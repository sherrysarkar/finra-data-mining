Plaintiff-appellant AccuSoft\n\nCorporation (“AccuSoft”) and Defendants-appellees James Palo,\n\nSimon Wieczner and Snowbound Software appeal from the district\n\ncourt's rulings on cross-petitions for civil contempt arising\n\nout     of   alleged   breaches    of        a    1996   settlement   agreement\n\nestablishing their respective rights in a piece of computer\n\nsoftware.      The district court, adopting the conclusions of a\n\nspecial      master,   agreed   with     AccuSoft        that   the   Defendants\n\nbreached the settlement agreement, awarding AccuSoft $149,000 in\n\nattorneys' fees, but no damages, while finding in Defendants'\n\nfavor with respect to $178,000 in unpaid royalties they claimed\n\nwere owed under the agreement.          For the reasons discussed below,\n\nwe affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                        I.\n\n             Plaintiff AccuSoft is a corporation engaged in the\n\nimage    processing     software   business.             Defendants    Palo   and\n\nWieczner are former associates of AccuSoft and the current\n\nowners of Snowbound Software (“Snowbound”), a corporation that\n\ncompetes with AccuSoft in the image processing software market.\n\nThe events relevant to this appeal began in 1992 when Palo, a\n\nsoftware designer and developer, was engaged by AccuSoft to\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fdevelop         a     library    or    toolkit      of     software    routines         for\n\nmanipulating computer images.                      Pursuant to a contract with\n\nAccuSoft,           Palo    agreed    to    provide      the    software    product     to\n\nAccuSoft, along with an exclusive right to distribute it for one\n\nyear, in return for a percentage of the sales revenue.                           AccuSoft\n\nand   Palo          subsequently      extended     this    agreement       and   made   it\n\nautomatically renewable for additional one-year periods.\n\n                The software developed by Palo was brought to market\n\nby AccuSoft in 1992 as the Image Format Library (“IFL”) and\n\nbecame AccuSoft's principal product.                           In 1993, Wieczner was\n\nhired by AccuSoft to direct the sales and marketing program for\n\nthe IFL.            AccuSoft's and Wieczner's efforts to market the IFL\n\nwere apparently successful; by 1995, the IFL had a significant\n\nshare      of       the    relevant    market      and    produced    gross      revenues\n\ntotaling $3.2 million.\n\n                Despite this success, AccuSoft's relationship with Palo\n\nand Wieczner began to deteriorate during 1995.                       By January 1996,\n\nboth Palo and Wieczner had terminated their association with\n\nAccuSoft.           Subsequently, Palo notified AccuSoft of his intent to\n\nend his licensing agreement with AccuSoft, effective January 31,\n\n1996.      On January 22, 1996, Palo registered a copyright for the\n\nIFL   in    his       name    with    the    United      States    Copyright      Office.\n\nShortly thereafter, Palo and Wieczner founded their own company,\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fSnowbound Software, and offered for sale a product called the\n\nRasterMaster Library which, they acknowledge, was essentially\n\nthe same as the version of IFL then being marketed by AccuSoft.\n\nIn February 1996, AccuSoft also registered a copyright for the\n\nIFL software.1\n\n            On March 5, 1996, AccuSoft filed a complaint in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\nagainst   Palo,   Wieczner   and   Snowbound   alleging,   inter   alia,\n\ncopyright infringement, breach of contract and misappropriation\n\nof proprietary information.        The same day, Palo also filed a\n\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Massachusetts against AccuSoft and Scott Warner, AccuSoft's\n\npresident and founder, asserting similar claims.            Each party\n\nsubsequently moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the\n\nother from using or selling the disputed software and from\n\nmaking public statements concerning their ownership of the IFL.\n\nThe two actions were consolidated before Judge Gorton on April\n\n24, 1996.\n\n\n\n\n    1     The fact that both parties were able to register\ncopyrights in the IFL software -- an element of the background\nwhich we draw from Judge Gorton's opinion -- strikes us as\nunusual and we find nothing in the record of the present case to\nexplain how this occurred. However, it does not appear to bear\ndirectly on the issues presented by these appeals.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           In a published ruling on the motions for injunctive\n\nrelief, AccuSoft Corp. v.    Palo, 923 F. Supp. 290 (D. Mass.\n\n1996), the district court concluded that Palo was likely to\n\nsucceed on his claim that he was the author of most or all of\n\nthe code contained in the IFL, and thus the rightful copyright\n\nowner.    However, Judge Gorton found that AccuSoft would likely\n\nsucceed in demonstrating that the agreement between AccuSoft and\n\nPalo transferred to AccuSoft an exclusive right to distribute\n\nproducts derived from the codes and that this right could be\n\nterminated only by mutual consent of the parties.       Based on\n\nthese findings, Judge Gorton issued a preliminary injunction\n\nwhich effectively prohibited either company from distributing\n\nits product and barred all parties from making public statements\n\nconcerning ownership of the software until the trial on the\n\nmerits.\n\n           It was in this context that the parties, on the eve of\n\ntrial, signed a confidential agreement settling the case.    The\n\nagreement was filed under seal and was approved and incorporated\n\ninto an order of the district court dated June 7, 1996.      The\n\nagreement sought to establish the respective rights of the\n\nparties in the IFL code, providing generally for a transfer of\n\nthose rights to Palo/Snowbound but allowing AccuSoft to continue\n\nto license the IFL through August 31, 1996 at specified royalty\n\n\n                               -5-\n\frates.     During this transitional period, it was AccuSoft's\n\nintent to finish developing and begin marketing a replacement\n\nproduct, dubbed “ImageGear,” which was not based on the IFL\n\ncode.      The   settlement     agreement       also    set    forth    detailed\n\nrequirements concerning the public statements that could be made\n\nby the parties with respect to ownership of the IFL, established\n\ncertain requirements for record-keeping, and allowed Palo access\n\nto AccuSoft's records for the purpose of conducting audits to\n\ndetermine whether appropriate royalty payments were being paid.\n\nPursuant   to    the   order,   the     court   retained      jurisdiction     to\n\nenforce the agreement's terms.\n\n           Less than two months later, on July 30, 1996, AccuSoft\n\nfiled a motion for contempt in the district court, alleging\n\nnumerous    violations     of   the     settlement       agreement's      public\n\ndisclosure and confidentiality provisions by Palo, Wieczner and\n\nSnowbound (referred to hereafter collectively as “Snowbound”).\n\nAs relief for Snowbound's alleged contempt, AccuSoft sought an\n\norder    directing     Snowbound   to    comply    with    the    agreement,    a\n\ndetermination     that   AccuSoft     was   excused     from     making   future\n\nroyalty payments under the agreement as a result of Snowbound's\n\nbreach,    and   an    unspecified      monetary       penalty.        Snowbound\n\nsubsequently filed a cross-motion for contempt, alleging non-\n\npayment of royalties due under the agreement, violations of the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fagreement's public disclosure provisions, and non-compliance\n\nwith the agreement's requirements regarding record-keeping and\n\nthe form of licenses that AccuSoft could issue.\n\n            By order of reference dated August 16, 1996, Judge\n\nGorton    referred      the    contempt   motions      and   “related     motions”\n\narising    out    of   the     same   dispute   to     special   master    Michael\n\nKeating.     Nearly two years of proceedings before the master\n\nensued,    during      which    the   master    held    evidentiary      hearings,\n\narranged for an outside audit of AccuSoft's books by Richard L.\n\nEisner & Co., LLP (“Eisner”)2 to determine AccuSoft's compliance\n\nwith royalty obligations, and responded to a steady stream of\n\ninterlocutory motions emanating from both parties.\n\n            The     master's      conclusions        concerning    the    matters\n\nreferred to him were subsequently set forth in a series of\n\nmemoranda.       The first such memorandum concerned the dispute over\n\nroyalties owed by AccuSoft to Snowbound for licensing of the\n\nIFL, referred to by the parties as the “audit phase” of the\n\ncase.    Based on testimony from the parties and from the master's\n\n\n\n    2     Prior to the master's involvement, Palo engaged Newburg\n& Company, LLP (“Newburg”) to conduct an audit pursuant to the\nsettlement agreement.     According to Snowbound, Newburg had\nsignificant difficulty obtaining the information it sought from\nAccuSoft, although a report summarizing Newburg's findings was\ncompleted and submitted to Snowbound in November, 1996.\nAccuSoft apparently disputed the conclusions of the Newburg\naudit.\n\n                                        -7-\n\findependent auditor, the master concluded that Accusoft had\n\nfailed in a number of instances to pay royalties owed under the\n\nagreement, by a total amount later determined to be $178,000,\n\nexclusive of interest.3         At the same time, the master concluded\n\nthat the terms of the settlement agreement precluded Snowbound\n\nfrom collecting other royalty sums it believed it was owed.\n\n           The remaining substantive allegations in the contempt\n\npetitions were disposed of in a second memorandum.                 Here, the\n\nmaster rejected all of Snowbound's allegations of contemptuous\n\nconduct by AccuSoft, generally finding that although AccuSoft\n\nhad at times engaged in “sharp practices” in an effort to\n\nmaximize   its    benefits      under    the   settlement    agreement,    its\n\nactions were not prohibited by the agreement with sufficient\n\nspecificity      to   support    a   finding    of   civil   contempt.      By\n\ncontrast, the master found that many public statements made by\n\nSnowbound in the period immediately following settlement were\n\nsufficiently     clear     violations     of   the   agreement's   terms    to\n\nconstitute    contempt.         Nonetheless,     the   master   declined    to\n\nprovide    the    relief    AccuSoft     requested,    finding:    (1)    that\n\nAccuSoft had adduced no grounds justifying rescission of the\n\nagreement or otherwise excusing AccuSoft from its obligation to\n\n\n\n     3    The master calculated the interest, as of May 31, 1998,\nto be approximately $40,000.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpay royalties after the date of Snowbound’s breaches of the\n\nagreement; and (2) that AccuSoft had not demonstrated that it\n\nsuffered monetary damages as a result of Snowbound's breaches.\n\n           Finally, the master issued several brief memoranda\n\nconcerning the allocation of the audit costs and attorneys' fees\n\nand related litigation costs.    All costs of the audit ($25,000)\n\nwere charged to AccuSoft, pursuant to the settlement agreement\n\nitself, which established a sliding scale for apportioning audit\n\ncosts based on the degree of underpayment identified.   However,\n\nAccuSoft was awarded in excess of $149,000 in attorneys' fees\n\n(plus an unspecified amount of interest) under a provision of\n\nthe agreement the master interpreted as allowing a party proving\n\nbreach to recover its fees for prosecuting a contempt motion,\n\neven if no substantive damages were recovered.\n\n           The master's final submission to the district court,\n\nwhich included all of the above memoranda, was made on October\n\n5, 1998.   On April 5, 1999, following a further round of motions\n\nby the parties challenging various of the conclusions contained\n\nin the master's consolidated report, Judge Gorton adopted the\n\nreport in full.   These appeals followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f            On    appeal,   the       parties    challenge      aspects   of    the\n\nmaster's conclusions4 with respect to each of the three classes\n\nof issues that the master addressed: royalties; contempt; and\n\nallocation       of   attorneys'      fees     and   costs.      AccuSoft      also\n\nchallenges an interlocutory ruling of the master limiting the\n\nscope of discovery during hearings on the contempt issue.                        In\n\nthe interest of consistency, we follow the master's categorical\n\ndivision of the issues, discussing the interlocutory ruling as\n\npart of our review of the master's disposition of the parties'\n\nsubstantive allegations of contempt.                      Within categories, we\n\norder the subjects with an eye toward clear exposition of the\n\nissues and logical development of our conclusions.\n\nA.          Royalties Owed to Snowbound\n\n            Both parties ask us to revisit the master's assessment\n\nof   the   royalties     owed    by    AccuSoft      to    Snowbound   under    the\n\nsettlement agreement.           Snowbound asserts two claims of error:\n\n(1) that the master misinterpreted relevant contract language in\n\ndeciding that AccuSoft was entitled to retain the entirety of\n\nlicensing fees it received after August 31, 1996, pursuant to\n\n\n      4   In the analysis that follows, we refer to the\nconclusions below as those of the master. Because the master's\nconclusions were adopted without exception by the district\ncourt, they are equivalent to rulings of the district court\nitself for purposes of our review. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)\n(“The findings of a master, to the extent a court adopts them,\nshall be considered as the findings of the court.”).\n\n                                        -10-\n\fpre-existing agreements with America OnLine (“AOL”) and Lexis-\n\nNexis; and (2) that the master improperly allowed AccuSoft to\n\npay royalties on only a portion of the income received from\n\nlicenses that included both the IFL and AccuSoft's replacement\n\nproduct, ImageGear.              AccuSoft, for its part, asks us to reverse\n\nthe    master's         decision    to    award    to    Snowbound    all     revenues\n\nreceived after August 31, 1996 pursuant to an agreement with\n\nLifeboat Japan, Inc. on the ground that this conclusion is\n\nunsupported by either the settlement agreement or applicable\n\nlaw.\n\n                 Our consideration of the foregoing matters is governed\n\nby    familiar      standards       of   review.        To   the   extent     that   the\n\nquestions presented turn on the language of the settlement\n\nagreement or other contracts, we have considerable freedom to\n\ndraw       our    own     conclusions,     guided       by   the   language    of    the\n\nagreement, the circumstances of its formation and its purposes\n\n--     “in       brief,     by   the     usual    considerations       of     contract\n\ninterpretation.”            AMF v. Jewett, 711 F.2d 1096, 1102 (1st Cir.\n\n1983) (as modified on denial of rehearing and rehearing en banc\n\nAug. 26, 1983);5 see also Langton v. Johnson, 928 F.2d 1206, 1220\n\n\n       5  To the extent that we rely on legal principles from a\nspecific jurisdiction in interpreting the settlement agreement,\nwe follow the parties in applying the law of Massachusetts. We\nnote that the applicability of Massachusetts law is not a given\nin this case, since the agreement includes no choice of law\n\n                                           -11-\n\f(1st Cir. 1991) (noting that interpretation of a settlement\n\nagreement between private parties “is akin to a contractual\n\ninterpretation, and is thus largely a conclusion of law”); cf.\n\nFashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (“Contract interpretation presents, in the first\n\ninstance,   a   question   of   law,   and   is   therefore   the   court's\n\nresponsibility.”).     However, we will not disturb the master's\n\nfactual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.                 Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 52(a).6     Included in the latter category are factual\n\nfindings concerning the intent of the parties where contract\n\nlanguage is ambiguous.          RCI Northeast Serv. Div. v.          Boston\n\nEdison Co., 822 F.2d 199, 202 (1st Cir. 1987) (district court's\n\nfindings concerning intent based on examination of dealings of\n\nparties were “sufficiently factbound to fit comfortably” within\n\nthe scope of Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)).\n\n\n\nprovision and, once incorporated as a court order in a federal\ncourt, is arguably subject to interpretation under federal law.\nHowever, given the parties' apparent consensus that the law of\nMassachusetts applies, we need not resolve that question here.\nSee, e.g., Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d 370,\n375 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that parties are bound by plausible\nchoices of law made in proceedings below).\n    6     Although the clearly erroneous standard would apply to\nfactual findings in any event, we note that Paragraph 15 of the\nsettlement agreement, which requires disputes over royalties to\nbe referred to a master for resolution, specifically states that\n“[t]he findings of facts [sic] of the Master shall be final\nunless clearly erroneous.”\n\n                                   -12-\n\f            1.       Income from AOL and Lexis-Nexis\n\n            In April 1994, AccuSoft entered into an agreement with\n\nAOL to license the IFL software for distribution as a component\n\nof AOL's software products.            This agreement was amended by the\n\nparties in July 1995.       The amendment provided that AOL's license\n\nwould   run   for    a   period   of    one    year   from   the   amendment's\n\neffective date (July 1, 1995), and, thereafter, would renew for\n\nadditional one-year periods automatically, at specified royalty\n\nrates, unless terminated by the parties.              AOL continued to make\n\npayments, and neither party moved to terminate the agreement,\n\nwith the result that the license continued in effect after\n\nAugust 31, 1996.         During the “audit phase” of this case, both\n\nSnowbound and AccuSoft asserted that the revenue stream issuing\n\nfrom this agreement after August 31, 1996, belonged to it under\n\nthe settlement agreement.\n\n            In February 1995, AccuSoft entered into a licensing\n\nagreement     with   Lexis-Nexis       which    permitted    Lexis-Nexis    to\n\n“distribute, lease and market” the IFL as a component of the\n\nprograms used to access Lexis-Nexis' services.                An addendum to\n\nthe agreement, signed the same day, specified that the agreement\n\nwould initially terminate in December 1995, but that Lexis-Nexis\n\ncould, at its option, extend the agreement for a second and then\n\na third year by paying stated amounts before the end of each\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fprior year.    It also provided that Lexis-Nexis could, by paying\n\nan additional amount before the end of the second year, convert\n\nthe license to a “perpetual, fully paid-up license” effective\n\nJanuary 1, 1998.         In January 1997, Lexis-Nexis paid AccuSoft\n\n$35,000, representing the $25,000 annual renewal for the 1997\n\ncalendar year and the $10,000 specified for converting the\n\nlicense to a perpetual license.              Both AccuSoft and Snowbound\n\nargued before the master that this income belonged to it under\n\nthe settlement agreement.\n\n            In his memorandum, the master ruled that AccuSoft was\n\nentitled to retain the entirety of both the AOL revenue stream\n\nand the Lexis-Nexis payments, because the settlement agreement\n\ndid not affect the continuation of licensing agreements already\n\nin effect on June 5, 1996 -- when the settlement agreement was\n\nsigned -- nor did it provide for royalties to be paid on such\n\nlicenses.     The master noted that nothing in the settlement\n\nagreement    expressly     addressed     the   continuation        of   existing\n\nlicenses.    He also found nothing in the agreement to implicitly\n\nrequire their termination or transfer to Snowbound.                     Although\n\nthe   settlement     agreement       clearly    did    transfer       AccuSoft's\n\ncopyright     in   the    IFL   to   Snowbound,       the    master     accepted\n\nAccuSoft's contention that a non-exclusive license issued by\n\nAccuSoft    before   the    settlement       agreement      was   signed   would\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fcontinue in effect under 17 U.S.C. § 204(e).7                 The master also\n\nagreed   with   AccuSoft           that   the    language   accomplishing    the\n\ntransfer of copyright did not transfer AccuSoft's collateral\n\ncontractual     rights        in    existing     IFL   licensing     agreements,\n\nincluding the right to receive payment under such agreements.\n\n          Turning        to        the    AOL    and   Lexis-Nexis    licensing\n\nagreements, the master found in each case that the agreements\n\nconstituted continuing licenses, rejecting Snowbound's argument\n\nthat the renewal of the licenses was tantamount to issuance of\n\na “new” license after August 31, 1996.                 The master interpreted\n\nthe AOL agreement to create, in effect, a perpetual license,\n\nconditioned only on payment, that would continue “unless and\n\nuntil an affirmative act is done by either AccuSoft or AOL which\n\nbreaks the continuity of the license.”                  Similarly, the Lexis-\n\nNexis agreement “continue[d] in effect from the date of the\n\nAddendum . . . without a new grant or extension of rights.”                   On\n\nthis basis, the master ruled that AccuSoft could retain any and\n\nall revenues resulting from annual renewals of the AOL agreement\n\n\n\n    7     This section provides, in pertinent part, that “a\nnonexclusive license, whether recorded or not, prevails over a\nconflicting transfer of copyright if the license is evidenced by\na written instrument signed by the owner of the rights licensed\n. . . and . . . the license was taken before execution of the\ntransfer.” 17 U.S.C. § 204(e). Nothing in Snowbound’s appeal\nsuggests that Snowbound disputes the applicability of this\nstatute or the import of its application.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fafter August 31, 1996, as well as the entirety of the January\n\n1997 payment from Lexis-Nexis.\n\n          On appeal, Snowbound's principal contention is that the\n\nmaster   improperly        interpreted     the     settlement    agreement.\n\nSnowbound admits that there is a “lack of pertinent language” in\n\nthe settlement agreement, but argues that “the entire tenor of\n\nthe Settlement Agreement is that after August 31, 1996, AccuSoft\n\nwas to have no further dealings of any kind with the IFL”\n\n(emphasis added).       Snowbound also notes that the settlement\n\nagreement provided for royalty payments to be made to Snowbound,\n\nand that AccuSoft had paid royalties to Palo on IFL sales even\n\nbefore   the    settlement    agreement     was    signed.      Given     this\n\n“historical     and   contractual    context,”      Snowbound   argues,     it\n\n“makes no sense . . . to infer that Palo intended AccuSoft to\n\nkeep the entirety of [the income from AOL and Lexis-Nexis].”\n\nTaking a different tack, Snowbound also argues that the AOL\n\nagreement, at least, is not properly viewed as a continuing\n\nlicense, because its terms allow AccuSoft to terminate upon 120\n\ndays notice for any reason.\n\n          We are not persuaded to adopt the interpretation of the\n\nsettlement     agreement    that   Snowbound      proposes.     As   we   have\n\npreviously stated, when sophisticated business entities enter\n\ninto a settlement agreement, they “rely upon and have a right to\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fexpect a fairly literal interpretation of the bargain that was\n\nstruck and approved by the court.”             Jewett, 711 F.2d at 1101.\n\nWe have also made clear that we do not consider it our place to\n\n“rewrite contracts freely entered into between sophisticated\n\nbusiness entities.”       Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus.,\n\nInc., 827 F.2d 850, 855 (1st Cir. 1987).           Here, it is undisputed\n\nthat   the     parties    are   business        entities   of     reasonable\n\nsophistication     who   drafted   a    settlement    agreement    with    the\n\nextensive participation of attorneys on both sides.               It is also\n\nundisputed that the settlement agreement does not, by its terms,\n\neither terminate pre-existing licenses issued by AccuSoft or\n\ntransfer collateral contractual benefits resulting from existing\n\nlicensing agreements to Snowbound.            Under such circumstances, we\n\nconsider it “far wiser for a court to honor the parties' words\n\nthan to imply other and further promises out of thin air.”                 Id.\n\n             We are particularly loath to do so given the conclusory\n\narguments advanced by Snowbound in favor of its interpretation.\n\nWe do not consider it obvious that the master's decision is\n\ncontrary to the “entire tenor” of the agreement, and Snowbound\n\nprovides     nothing   beyond   its    bare    assertion   to   convince   us\n\notherwise.      While Snowbound's contention that it “makes no\n\nsense” to infer that Palo/Snowbound intended that these revenues\n\nshould pass to AccuSoft royalty-free strikes us as plausible, it\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fis also irrelevant to our analysis.               Whether or not Snowbound\n\nanticipated this result (and we acknowledge the possibility that\n\nSnowbound      simply    did   not     consider    what    would     happen     to\n\ncontinuing agreements), it is not our role “to accomplish by\n\njudicial fiat what a party neglected to achieve contractually.”\n\nNorthern Heel Corp. v. Compo Indus., Inc., 851 F.2d 456, 466\n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (quoting RCI Northeast Serv. Div., 822 F.2d at\n\n204) (internal punctuation omitted).              Furthermore, we note the\n\nmaster's finding that Palo knew of at least the AOL licensing\n\nagreement during settlement negotiations, which Snowbound does\n\nnot dispute.     Under such circumstances, Snowbound took the risk\n\nthat its unspoken understanding was incorrect and thus was not\n\nentitled to rest on this unilateral belief that future rights\n\nassociated with the AOL agreement were comprehended in the\n\nlanguage of the settlement agreement.\n\n            Finally, we find no merit in Snowbound's argument that\n\nthe AOL license renewal constituted a “new” license simply\n\nbecause   it    was     subject   to    termination       at   either      party's\n\ndiscretion.     We do not agree that the fact that AccuSoft could\n\nhave terminated its agreement with AOL, but did not, amounts to\n\nthe same thing as the affirmative grant of a new license.                       As\n\npreviously     noted,    the   settlement     agreement        did   not   oblige\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fAccuSoft to terminate the license; AccuSoft therefore did not\n\nviolate the agreement by taking no action.\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the master's\n\ndecision with respect to the revenues received under the AOL and\n\nLexis-Nexis licensing agreements.\n\n         2.       Allocation of Split Licenses\n\n         In June and July 1996, AccuSoft entered into licensing\n\nagreements with Aimtech Corporation (“Aimtech”), NetObjects,\n\nInc.   (“NetObjects”),      and      Caere     Corporation    (“Caere”)\n\n(collectively “licensees”), granting the recipients the right to\n\ndistribute, as part of their software products, both the IFL and\n\nAccuSoft's    successor   product,       ImageGear.    Each   agreement\n\nincluded a provision allocating the licensing fee between the\n\ntwo products.    The provision stated that the portion of the fee\n\nassociated with the IFL license was based on specified estimates\n\n(these estimates apparently came from the customers) concerning\n\nthe number of copies of the IFL that would be sold.                 The\n\nremainder of the licensing fee was for an unlimited license to\n\nuse ImageGear.\n\n         At the hearing before the master, Snowbound argued\n\nthat, although the agreements recited this allocation of the\n\nlicensing fees between the two products, other language in the\n\nagreements suggested that the licensees were not obligated to\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\flimit their IFL sales to the levels on which the fee allocation\n\nwas based.8    The NetObjects agreement, for example, stated that\n\n“[t]his is a fully paid up license fee and no additional fees\n\nare due from Customer during the term of this Agreement,” and\n\nalso provided that “[t]he fees under this agreement are not\n\nreturnable.”     Snowbound    contended      that   this   language,   and\n\nsimilar language in the other agreements, suggested that the\n\nlicensees effectively obtained unlimited licenses to the IFL and\n\nwere not bound by the allocations.         Snowbound also asserted that\n\nit was not clear that the licensees had ever in fact switched to\n\nusing ImageGear.     On the basis of these arguments, Snowbound\n\nclaimed the entirety of the licensing fee from each agreement.\n\nAccuSoft, for its part, contended that the license allocations\n\nwere intended to be enforceable and presented testimony of its\n\nofficers   stating   that    they    believed   the   allocations      were\n\nenforceable when they signed the agreements.\n\n           In his memorandum, the master rejected Snowbound's\n\nposition with minimal analysis, stating, without elaboration,\n\nthat “in the absence of language in the Settlement Agreement\n\nthat addresses this issue . . . Palo has not established a right\n\n\n     8    Snowbound also argues that these licensing agreements\nviolated provisions of the settlement agreement prescribing the\nform of licenses AccuSoft could issue and therefore constituted\ncontempt of the court's order. We review this assertion in Part\nB.1.b, infra.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fto claim all of the income in these distribution licenses as\n\n[income     subject     to    the     settlement     agreement's     royalty\n\nprovisions].”         The    master   then   directed     AccuSoft    to   pay\n\nroyalties based on the portion of the license fees allocated to\n\nthe IFL in each agreement.            On appeal, Snowbound presses its\n\npoint that this conclusion is incorrect “because there was no\n\nevidence in the record that the licensees ever used any product\n\nother than the IFL, or ever restrained their use of the IFL to\n\nthe numbers stated in the nominal 'allocations.'”\n\n            Although the master's decision is short on detailed\n\nanalysis,    we   believe      that   his    conclusion    concerning      the\n\nroyalties owed by AccuSoft withstands Snowbound's challenges.\n\nIn so deciding, we need not, and do not, decide the questions of\n\ninterpretation pressed by Snowbound.               Even assuming     arguendo\n\nthat Snowbound is right that the allocations contained in the\n\nlicenses were not enforceable, we conclude that Snowbound would\n\nnot be entitled to additional royalties unless the licensees\n\nactually sold more products containing the IFL than were set\n\nforth in the allocations.             As Snowbound itself argues, the\n\nsettlement agreement included as Exhibit B a per-copy price list\n\nintended to govern AccuSoft's sales of the IFL through August\n\n31, 1996.    Our review of the three agreements indicates that the\n\nportion of the licensing fee allocated to the IFL in each\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fagreement accurately incorporates the applicable per-copy price.\n\nIf   that        allocation    were    honored,   we   find     nothing   in    the\n\nsettlement agreement to suggest that Snowbound is entitled to\n\nany more than the appropriate royalty on the allocation amount,\n\nwhich is precisely what the master ordered.9\n\n                 Snowbound points to no evidence in the record that\n\ndemonstrates that the allocations were not honored.                       In its\n\nbrief, Snowbound attempts to place the burden on AccuSoft on\n\nthis point, claiming that there is “no evidence in the record”\n\nthat the licensees kept to the allocation limits.                   However, it\n\nwas plainly Snowbound's burden to introduce evidence indicating\n\nthat       the    allocation    limits    were    exceeded.10      Absent      such\n\nevidence, the master was under no obligation to disregard the\n\nnumbers contained in the agreements in determining the amount of\n\nroyalties due Snowbound.              We therefore affirm.\n\n                 3.    Income from Lifeboat Japan\n\n\n       9  Although Snowbound makes much of the fact that one or\nmore of the licensees never switched to ImageGear, that fact, by\nitself, is irrelevant to whether Snowbound was appropriately\npaid for IFL sales.      Aimtech, NetObjects, and Caere were\nentitled to make whatever use they wished, including no use at\nall, of the ImageGear license they purchased simultaneously with\ntheir IFL license.\n       10 Indeed, from our review of the record, it appears that\nSnowbound requested, and was granted, the right to conduct\ndiscovery into the question of how the licensees viewed their\nobligations under the licensing agreements. We find no evidence\nthat Snowbound did so, nor any explanation for why it did not.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f            From   October   1995    until   at    least   February   1997,\n\nLifeboat Japan Inc. (“Lifeboat”) paid licensing fees to AccuSoft\n\nunder an agreement which permitted Lifeboat to sell copies of\n\nthe IFL in the Japanese market in return for a percentage of the\n\nincome on those sales.11          The agreement between AccuSoft and\n\nLifeboat, as initially executed by the parties, ran through July\n\n1996.    However, in April 1996, after AccuSoft and Snowbound had\n\nfiled suit against each other and shortly before Judge Gorton\n\nissued his injunction, AccuSoft extended the arrangement to July\n\n1997.     The   extension    of   the   Lifeboat    agreement   never   was\n\nrevealed to Snowbound during the settlement negotiations that\n\nfollowed.    Indeed, AccuSoft did not acknowledge until March 1997\n\nthat sales by Lifeboat continued past August 31, 1996, having\n\nearlier represented to the master's auditor that Lifeboat's\n\nsales terminated by the cutoff date.\n\n            The issue before us centers on the disposition of\n\nrevenues resulting from Lifeboat's sales of the IFL after August\n\n31, 1996.   In the proceedings below, AccuSoft argued that it was\n\n\n\n    11    AccuSoft appears to dispute, to some degree, the\ncharacterization of Lifeboat as a “reseller,” and points to\nstatements in the record to the effect that Lifeboat actually\nsold its own product incorporating the IFL. Nothing identified\nby AccuSoft is adequate to cause us to disturb the master’s\nfactual finding that Lifeboat is properly characterized as a\nreseller and we adopt that characterization in the analysis that\nfollows.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fentitled to the entirety of this income, advancing the same\n\nargument that it made, successfully, with respect to income\n\nresulting from the AOL and Lexis-Nexis licensing agreements\n\nafter the cutoff.       See supra.     In the case of Lifeboat, however,\n\nthe master reached a different result.                 The master found that\n\nAccuSoft's      conduct     surrounding       the    Lifeboat          extension   --\n\nprincipally,     AccuSoft's     failure       to    reveal    its      existence   to\n\nSnowbound -- violated an implied duty of good faith and fair\n\ndealing      imposed   on   AccuSoft    as    a     party    to   the     settlement\n\nagreement.12     In support of this conclusion the master noted that\n\nthe extension was executed “at a time when Palo was challenging\n\nAccuSoft's rights in court.”            In addition, the master pointed\n\nout   that    Lifeboat's     ability    as    a     reseller      to    continue   to\n\n\n\n      12  In the interest of completeness, we note that the\nmaster’s report appears to advance a second argument for\nallocating the Lifeboat revenues to Snowbound; an argument that\nSnowbound briefly references on appeal. The master begins from\nthe fact that, in his interpretation, the settlement agreement\ntransferred all of AccuSoft’s ownership interest in the IFL to\nSnowbound.   From that, the master reasons that AccuSoft’s\nactivities with respect to the IFL must be limited to those\nactions expressly “given back” under the settlement agreement.\nWe find little support for this argument in the settlement\nagreement.   Indeed, as discussed in Part II.B.2.c of this\nopinion, we believe that the settlement agreement did not\ntransfer “ownership” of the IFL to Snowbound. In addition, we\nfind it difficult to square this analysis with the master’s\nallocation of the AOL and Lexis-Nexis revenues to AccuSoft –\noutcomes that were plainly not provided for in the settlement\nagreement. For both reasons, we reject this as an alternative\nground supporting the master’s conclusion.\n\n                                       -24-\n\fdistribute      the   IFL    as    a   stand-alone       product      “absolutely\n\ncontradict[ed]”       the    “express      intention”     of    the    settlement\n\nagreement that “all distribution [of the IFL] by or through\n\nAccuSoft will cease on August 31, 1996.”                       Because of this\n\nviolation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, the master\n\nconcluded that AccuSoft should not be allowed to retain the\n\nLifeboat income, and determined that the entirety of the income\n\nresulting from sales after August 31, 1996, must be paid to\n\nPalo.\n\n              On appeal, AccuSoft argues that the master erroneously\n\nused    the    duty   of    good   faith    and   fair    dealing      to   create\n\nobligations that exist nowhere in the agreement between the\n\nparties.       While sympathetic to the master's frustration with\n\nAccuSoft's lack of candor, we must agree.                The implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing between parties to a contract\n\nprovides that “neither party shall do anything that will have\n\nthe effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other\n\nparty to receive the fruits of the contract.”                  Druker v. Roland\n\nWm. Jutras Assoc., 348 N.E.2d 763, 765 (Mass. 1976) (quoting\n\nUproar Co. v. Nat'l Broadcasting Co., 81 F.2d 373, 377 (1st Cir.\n\n1936)).    It is implicit in that definition, and made explicit in\n\nour precedent, that the prohibition contained in the covenant\n\napplies only to conduct during performance of the contract, not\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fto conduct occurring prior to the contract's existence, such as\n\nconduct affecting contract negotiations.        E.g., FDIC v. LeBlanc,\n\n85 F.3d 815, 822 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Restatement (Second)\n\nof the Law of Contracts § 205, cmt. c (noting that bad faith in\n\ncontract negotiations is not reached by the implied duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing, but instead by concepts such as fraud in\n\nthe inducement or absence of agreement).           Equally clear from\n\nthis   definition    is    that     the   requirement   of     good-faith\n\nperformance ultimately is circumscribed by the obligations --\n\nthe contractual “fruits” -- actually contained in the agreement.\n\nSee LeBlanc, 85 F.3d at 822 (holding that an obligation to\n\nnegotiate subsequent agreements in good faith would not be\n\nimputed under the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing\n\nwhere the original agreement included no such requirement).\n\n           The master's application of the duty of good faith and\n\nfair dealing cannot be squared with the above principles.               As\n\nAccuSoft   notes,   the   master's    opinion   acknowledges    that   the\n\nsettlement agreement simply does not address the continuation of\n\npre-existing agreements.          To the extent this is an accurate\n\ninterpretation of the contract, we do not see how good faith\n\nperformance could nonetheless require AccuSoft to surrender the\n\nincome on certain such agreements.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f              We   need     not,   however,    decide   this   question   of\n\ncontractual interpretation as the master's rationale fails on a\n\nnarrower ground.          It is undisputed that AccuSoft's extension of\n\nthe Lifeboat agreement occurred before the settlement agreement\n\nwas signed.        Therefore, neither execution of the extension nor\n\nAccuSoft's silence about it while negotiating the settlement\n\nagreement can form the basis for a violation of the duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.            No one has suggested that AccuSoft's\n\nmere continued silence after the settlement agreement was signed\n\nconstituted a violation of the duty.13           Since we find no evidence\n\nidentified in the record on which a violation of the covenant of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing could rest, the master's conclusion\n\ncannot be supported on the legal grounds offered.\n\n              In its motion papers, Snowbound proposes an alternative\n\nground for affirming the master's conclusion which we believe\n\nmerits    a    response.14         Snowbound   contends   that   AccuSoft's\n\n\n     13   We find nothing in the settlement agreement that would\nrequire AccuSoft to disclose the existence of the extension.\nFurthermore, we do not see how disclosure after the settlement\nagreement was signed could have in any way affected Snowbound's\nability to obtain the fruits of the agreement. The terms of the\nsettlement agreement, including its failure to adequately\naddress pre-existing agreements like Lifeboat's, were at that\npoint fixed.\n     14   Yet another contention, raised by Snowbound's counsel\nat oral argument, is that Snowbound might be entitled to\nroyalties on the Lifeboat agreement pursuant to a pre-existing\nroyalty agreement between the present parties.      Given that\n\n                                      -27-\n\fnondisclosure of the Lifeboat extension violated a warranty\n\nprovision of the Assignment of Copyright, which stated, in\n\npertinent part:\n\n           AccuSoft represents and warrants to the best\n           of its knowledge, that it has made no\n           transfer, assignment, or license (other than\n           non-exclusive licenses in the ordinary\n           course of business) with respect to the\n           Software or any part thereof . . . .\n\nIn   Snowbound's       view,   AccuSoft's     “premature   extension    of\n\nLifeboat's distributorship, made days before an anticipated\n\nruling from the court that could have terminated AccuSoft's\n\nright to sell the IFL for good,” cannot be considered to be a\n\nlicense entered into “in the ordinary course of business.”              As\n\na result, AccuSoft was in breach of the warranty from the moment\n\nit was signed.\n\n           Although Snowbound's argument is facially credible,\n\nSnowbound fails to identify record evidence adequate for us to\n\nfind that AccuSoft's extension of the Lifeboat agreement was not\n\nexecuted   in    the    “ordinary    course    of   business.”         The\n\ndetermination of what is or is not comprehended in the phrase\n\n“ordinary course of business” is necessarily fact-specific,\n\ninvolving consideration of all the circumstances of the conduct\n\n\n\nParagraph 18 of the settlement agreement specifically provides\nthat it will “supersede all prior agreements between the parties\nand each and every term thereof,” this argument is unavailing.\n\n                                    -28-\n\for   transaction       at   issue.    See    Demoulas   v.    Demoulas   Super\n\nMarkets, 677 N.E.2d 159, 202 (Mass. 1996) (concluding, in the\n\ncontext    of    a    contempt    action,    that   whether   a   transaction\n\noccurred in the ordinary course of business is a question of\n\nfact; the court looks to the prior course of dealings between\n\nthe parties involved and the circumstances of the transaction to\n\ndetermine whether the transaction was part of the defendant's\n\n“normal,        day-to-day       business    operations”).          In    this\n\ndetermination, the timing of the Lifeboat extension is relevant,\n\nsee id. (noting that the timing of a transaction is one of the\n\nfactors to be considered), but we do not believe that, standing\n\nalone, it is sufficient to convince us that AccuSoft violated\n\nthe commitment contained in its warranty.               Since Snowbound has\n\npointed to no other record evidence supporting its position, we\n\ncannot affirm the master's conclusion on this basis.\n\n           In light of the preceding, we hold that the master's\n\nallocation of the entirety of the Lifeboat revenues to Palo must\n\nbe vacated.          In so doing, however, we acknowledge that this\n\ndetermination does not fully resolve the rights of the parties\n\nin regard to this revenue.            Given the timing of the Lifeboat\n\nextension, it seems possible that AccuSoft would nonetheless owe\n\n\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fsome portion of these revenues to Snowbound as royalties.15        This\n\nissue was not briefed on appeal and we do not believe that the\n\nrecord provides an adequate basis for us to decide how the\n\nsettlement   agreement's   royalty   provisions   might   apply.     We\n\ntherefore remand to the district court for a determination of\n\nwhat, if any, royalties are due Palo on the Lifeboat revenues.\n\n\n\n\n     15   Indeed, it appears from the record that AccuSoft itself\ntook this position at one point in the proceedings before the\nmaster. The master rejected the argument at that point because\nhe   considered AccuSoft to have no rights in regard to the\nincome.\n\n                               -30-\n\fB.          Rulings on Allegations of Contempt\n\n            Both AccuSoft and Snowbound dispute aspects of the\n\nmaster's memorandum disposing of their allegations of contempt.\n\nIn assessing these claims of error, we employ the aforementioned\n\nstandards    of    review    with       respect   to   the    master's    factual\n\nfindings and his interpretation of the settlement agreement's\n\nterms.      With   respect    to    the    master's    ultimate    findings     on\n\ncontempt, however, we review only for abuse of discretion.\n\nE.g., Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 947 F.2d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).   In the context of contempt rulings, we have said, the\n\nabuse of discretion standard “will be administered flexibly,”\n\ndepending on the circumstances of the case.                     Id. at 16.      In\n\nparticular, “greater deference is owed to the trial court in\n\npublic law litigation than in purely private litigation.”                      Id.\n\nWe also have stated that, in recognition of the fact that the\n\ncontempt power is a “potent weapon,” our review will proceed\n\nmore searchingly when we confront a finding of contempt than\n\nwhen we consider a decision “exonerating a putative contemnor.”\n\nId.\n\n            Our    assessment      of    the    master's     deployment   of   the\n\ncontempt power also incorporates various prudential principles\n\nwe have adopted in recognition of the contempt power's “virility\n\nand damage potential.”          Id.       A complainant “must prove civil\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fcontempt by clear and convincing evidence.”                 Id.; accord Gemco\n\nLatinoAmerica, Inc. v. Seiko Time Corp., 61 F.3d 94, 98 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).      In addition, contempt may only be established if\n\nthe    order    allegedly     violated    is   “clear       and    unambiguous.”\n\nProject B.A.S.I.C., 947 F.2d at 16; see also id. at 17 (stating\n\nthat “the party enjoined must be able to ascertain from the four\n\ncorners    of   the   order   precisely      what    acts    are    forbidden”).\n\n“[C]ourts are to construe ambiguities and omissions in consent\n\ndecrees as redounding to the benefit of the person charged with\n\ncontempt.”      Gilday v. Dubois, 124 F.3d 277, 282 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(internal citations and punctuation omitted).\n\n            Finally, we bear in mind that, while good-faith efforts\n\nalone do not insulate a defendant in a contempt action, see Star\n\nFin. Servs. Inc. v. AASTAR Mortg. Corp., 89 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (“An act does not cease to be a violation of law and of a\n\ndecree merely because it may have been done innocently.”), our\n\nprecedent permits a finding of contempt to be averted where\n\ndiligent    efforts    result    in   substantial      compliance         with    the\n\nunderlying order.      Langton, 928 F.2d at 1220.            The determination\n\nof whether substantial compliance has been achieved will “depend\n\non the circumstances of each case, including the nature of the\n\ninterest at stake and the degree to which noncompliance affects\n\nthat   interest.”      Fortin    v.   Comm'r    of    Mass.       Dept.   of     Pub.\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fWelfare, 692 F.2d 790, 795 (1st Cir. 1982).   For this reason, a\n\ncourt may decline to find a party in contempt despite the\n\nfailure to achieve “letter perfect compliance” with the order at\n\nissue.   Langton, 928 F.2d at 1222.\n\n\n\n\n                              -33-\n\f            1.         Snowbound's Claims of Error\n\n            Having failed to convince the master to find AccuSoft\n\nin    contempt    of    any   aspect     of   the    settlement    agreement,16\n\nSnowbound, on appeal, reasserts its arguments for several such\n\nclaims.     With but one exception, we find no reason to disturb\n\nthe master's conclusions as adopted by the district court.\n\n            a.         Failure to Find that AccuSoft's Nonpayment of\n                       Royalties and Improper Accounting Practices\n                       Constituted Contempt\n\n            In the proceedings below, Snowbound sought to hold\n\nAccuSoft in contempt for its nonpayment of royalties due under\n\nthe   settlement       agreement   and    what      Snowbound    deemed   to    be\n\nfraudulent       accounting    practices      surrounding       AccuSoft's     IFL\n\nsales.     As previously indicated, the master found that AccuSoft\n\nhad, in several instances, failed to pay royalties owed under\n\nthe settlement agreement.17        The master also found that AccuSoft\n\nhad engaged in certain “sharp practices,” such as initiating\n\n\n\n      16  Here, and in the discussion that follows, we\noccasionally use the phrase “contempt of the settlement\nagreement.” This phrase is employed in the interest of brevity\nas shorthand for “contempt of the court order incorporating the\nsettlement agreement.”\n      17  The total amount of unpaid royalties (less the\nroyalties on improper “returns” discussed below) was later\ncalculated to be approximately $145,000.       Of this, almost\n$122,000 reflected the master's allocation of revenues from the\nLifeboat licensing agreement, an allocation which we have\nconcluded must be vacated.\n\n                                       -34-\n\fexchanges    of   the   IFL    for       AccuSoft's      replacement   product,\n\nImageGear, then seeking to claim a credit for such exchanges as\n\n“returns”    under   Paragraph       1    of     the   settlement   agreement.18\n\nFinally, the master found evidence that AccuSoft had been less\n\nthan forthcoming in responding to the audit that Snowbound had\n\ninitiated pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the settlement agreement.\n\n            Ultimately,       however,          the    master   concluded     that\n\nSnowbound had failed to produce “clear and convincing evidence”\n\nthat    AccuSoft’s   actions     constituted           contempt.    The     master\n\ngrounded his decision principally on language in paragraph 15 of\n\nthe settlement agreement, which states:\n\n            In the event that there is a dispute\n            concerning the amount of AccuSoft's Software\n            Gross Billings19 as provided for herein, the\n            Court shall appoint a Master pursuant to\n            Fed. R. Civ. P. 53. The findings of facts\n            [sic] of the Master shall be final unless\n            clearly erroneous.     The compensation for\n            said Master shall be split equally between\n            the parties.\n\nThe master interpreted this language to create an alternative\n\ndispute resolution process for addressing any “allegations of\n\n\n\n       18 AccuSoft deducted $135,023 in “returns” from the\nroyalty base under this provision, none of which the master\nfound to be properly deductible. The master ultimately found\nthat this resulted in AccuSoft failing to pay $33,481 in\nroyalties due under the agreement.\n       19 The term “Software Gross Billings” is used to identify\nthe revenue base on which royalty amounts are calculated.\n\n                                         -35-\n\fnon-payment or improper accounting” that might arise when the\n\nagreement was implemented.              Because the parties had provided\n\nthis   process,        the   master   reasoned,      nonpayment   or     improper\n\ncalculation       of   royalties      would    not   become   contempt    of   the\n\nsettlement agreement “until and unless either party disregarded\n\nthe Master's findings and order.”\n\n            The master acknowledged that certain conduct attributed\n\nto AccuSoft by Snowbound, including intentional falsification of\n\nrecords to conceal IFL sales, would independently violate the\n\nsettlement agreement and therefore provide a basis for contempt.\n\nHowever, he found that the evidence introduced by Snowbound with\n\nrespect to these activities, including evidence regarding the\n\nimproper “returns” of IFL and inconsistencies in the recording\n\nof certain sales, did not constitute the “clear and convincing\n\nevidence”    of    a    violation     of   a   specific   requirement     of   the\n\nsettlement agreement necessary to support a finding of contempt.\n\nThe master noted that his independent auditor did not find\n\nevidence that AccuSoft had engaged in “purposeful falsification”\n\nof the records.          Furthermore, the master found that, in many\n\ncases, the position AccuSoft took to justify its actions “was\n\nnot without support in the Settlement Agreement,” even if the\n\nmaster ultimately determined that AccuSoft’s approach to the\n\ncalculation of royalties was not correct.\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\f            On appeal, Snowbound argues that the master was wrong\n\nto   conclude     that   the    dispute   resolution         process     insulated\n\nAccuSoft from the contempt sanction unless AccuSoft failed to\n\npay royalties after the master had issued his ruling.                    Snowbound\n\ncontends    that     reading     the    settlement        agreement      this   way\n\neffectively       nullifies     the    payment    deadlines        contained     in\n\nParagraph 5 of the agreement, as AccuSoft could avoid payment\n\n“with impunity” until the master had finally determined the\n\nissue.     According to Snowbound's interpretation, the dispute\n\nresolution provision did not relieve AccuSoft of the obligation\n\nto   pay   royalties     on    the   deadlines    but     merely   provided,     in\n\nadvance, for the mechanism that would be used to determine\n\nwhether a breach of the agreement had occurred.\n\n            Snowbound's argument is not without some force and we\n\nconcede uncertainty as to whether the provision for resolution\n\nof disputes by a master should be read to foreclose all contempt\n\nactions    grounded      in   “non-payment    and       improper    accounting.”\n\nNonetheless, bearing in mind the cautionary principles guiding\n\nexercise     of    the    contempt      sanction        --   particularly       the\n\nrequirement       that   contempt      requires     the      violation     of   “an\n\nunambiguous consent decree that left no reasonable doubt as to\n\nwhat behavior was to be expected,”                Gilday, 124 F.3d at 282\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted) -- we are not prepared to say\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fthat the master's failure to find AccuSoft in contempt for these\n\nactions was an abuse of discretion.\n\n            Snowbound also presses again its claim that AccuSoft\n\nshould be found in contempt because it engaged in deliberate\n\nfalsifications     of   records     and   purposefully    frustrated\n\nSnowbound’s audit in order to avoid paying royalties owed under\n\nthe   settlement   agreement.      However,   Snowbound   adduces   no\n\nevidence that compels us to believe that the master's findings\n\nto the contrary on this point are clearly erroneous.          To the\n\ncontrary, the master's position is amply supported by record\n\nevidence.    We therefore affirm.\n\n            b.     Failure to Find that the AccuSoft's Allocated\n                   Licenses for IFL and ImageGear Constituted\n                   Contempt\n\n            We have previously discussed Snowbound's contention\n\nthat the master improperly calculated royalties due on certain\n\nlicensing agreements which purported to convey licenses to both\n\nthe IFL and AccuSoft's replacement product, ImageGear.              In\n\naddition, Snowbound has asserted that issuance of these licenses\n\nconstituted contempt of Paragraph 5 of the settlement agreement,\n\nwhich states:\n\n            All  distribution   licenses  will   be  at\n            standard published rates in effect prior to\n            May, 1996, a list of which is attached\n            hereto as Exhibit B. If AccuSoft wishes to\n            issue any distribution license on terms not\n            listed on Exhibit B, it will submit those\n\n                                  -38-\n\f               terms . . . to Palo for his written approval\n               . . . .\n\nIn the proceedings below, Snowbound argued that the allocated\n\nlicenses were effectively unlimited licenses because they did\n\nnot create an enforceable limitation on the number of copies of\n\nIFL that could be sold.            As such, they did not conform to the\n\nprice schedule contained in Exhibit B, which established fixed\n\nprices for stated numbers of copies.\n\n               Nothing in the master's memorandum on the contempt\n\nissues directly addresses Snowbound's arguments concerning the\n\nallocated licenses, although the master's determination that the\n\nallocations       were    a   valid   basis       for    calculating     royalties\n\narguably does so by implication.                 On appeal, Snowbound presses\n\nits    claim     that    “issuing     a     license      without   a    clear   and\n\nenforceable legal limitation on the licensee's use of the IFL–a\n\nlimitation       to   standard    amounts        for    standard   prices--was    a\n\nmaterial breach of the agreement” and thus grounds for finding\n\nAccuSoft in contempt.\n\n               Although the master’s failure to address this issue in\n\nstraightforward terms is unfortunate, we do not find that a\n\nremand on this issue is required.                The argument Snowbound makes\n\non    appeal    is    premised    solely    on    language    contained    in   the\n\nlicensing       agreements,      which,    it    claims,    conflicts    with   the\n\nrequirements imposed by the settlement agreement.                        Snowbound\n\n                                          -39-\n\fdoes not refer us to any factual information in the record\n\nbearing on this issue, and, indeed, we find no indication that\n\nany factual information was developed which might shed light on\n\nthis claim, even though Snowbound was given permission to do so.\n\nAs previously noted, the interpretation of settlement agreements\n\nand contracts, where no recourse to negotiating history or other\n\nextrinsic factors is required, is a question of law.              Langton,\n\n928 F.2d at 1220; Fashion House, 892 F.2d at 1083.\n\n            Having reviewed the relevant agreements, we conclude\n\nthat Snowbound has not demonstrated that AccuSoft committed a\n\nbreach of the settlement agreement for which it should be held\n\nin contempt.       First, and despite Snowbound's protestations, it\n\nis not self-evident that the settlement agreement requires that\n\nlicenses issued by AccuSoft contain a “clear and enforceable\n\nlimitation” on the number of copies that can be sold.             We agree\n\nthat the settlement agreement language, reasonably read, would\n\nprohibit issuance of a license that stated a per-copy price for\n\nthe   IFL   that    was   inconsistent      with   the   “published   rates”\n\ncontained in Exhibit B. 20          We would also accept, for present\n\npurposes,    that    a    license    that    unambiguously    conveyed    an\n\nunlimited license for a fixed price would not be “at” the\n\n\n      20  As noted in our previous discussion of the allocated\nlicenses, our review indicates that the per-copy prices recited\nin the three licenses are consistent those set out in Exhibit B.\n\n                                     -40-\n\fExhibit B rates.       It is by no means obvious, however, that a\n\nlicense that stated a proper per-copy price would violate the\n\nsettlement    agreement     simply     because    it   proved     to   be\n\nunenforceable in certain respects.         Nor do we consider it clear\n\nthat the licenses at issue actually permitted the licensees to\n\nsell more copies of the IFL than stated in the allocations.\n\nCertain language, such as that stating the licenses are “fully\n\npaid up,” arguably supports Snowbound’s proposed interpretation.\n\nAt the same time, we find arguable merit in AccuSoft’s response\n\nthat this language referred only to the ImageGear license.             As\n\npreviously    noted,    Snowbound    has   not   introduced     extrinsic\n\nevidence supporting its interpretation of the agreement.\n\n         Given the cautionary principles governing our use of\n\nthe contempt sanction, we consider the unresolved ambiguities in\n\nthe relevant agreements fatal to Snowbound's claim.             Although\n\nthe interpretations Snowbound advances are not illogical, they\n\nfall well short of constituting proof, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, that AccuSoft violated the settlement agreement by\n\nissuing the licenses in question.\n\n         c.       Failure to Find AccuSoft in Contempt Because it\n                  did Not Maintain Records of IFL Sales Using\n                  Sequential Serial Numbers\n\n         As a third ground for contempt, Snowbound alleges that\n\nAccuSoft failed to maintain its records of IFL sales as required\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\fby the last section of Paragraph 5 of the settlement agreement,\n\nwhich states:\n\n            Each AccuSoft sale or license pursuant to\n            this Paragraph will be identified by a\n            serial number, issued sequentially beginning\n            with the number 276745. AccuSoft will keep\n            a list of each sale by serial number, which\n            list will be made available to Palo's\n            independent accountant . . . .\n\nThis    argument     was    raised    below    by   Snowbound,       but,    like\n\nSnowbound's contention that the allocated licenses constituted\n\ncontempt,    was   not     directly   addressed     by   the   master   in    his\n\nmemorandum disposing of the contempt allegations.                    On appeal,\n\nSnowbound asks us to rectify the omission, pointing to language\n\nin one of the master's memoranda on audit costs which, it\n\nargues, constitutes a factual finding that no such records were\n\nkept.   Because it considers the settlement agreement unambiguous\n\nas to this requirement, Snowbound contends that this finding\n\nobligates us to conclude, as a matter of law, that AccuSoft was\n\nin contempt.\n\n            Given the heavy burden of proof our precedent places\n\non a party alleging contempt, we do not agree that the current\n\nrecord provides an adequate basis for resolving the issue in\n\nSnowbound's favor.          The language to which Snowbound refers,\n\nalthough it does state that AccuSoft “failed to maintain” the\n\nsequential    list    of    IFL   sales      required    by    the   settlement\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fagreement, appears in a discussion of the allocation of audit\n\ncosts, contained in a memorandum issued after the master had\n\nruled on the parties' contempt allegations.               It is not clear\n\nthat the master intended the statement to stand as a formal\n\nfinding of fact, and there is certainly no suggestion in the\n\nrecord that it was meant to carry the weight Snowbound would\n\nhave it bear.     Nor can we consider the matter free from dispute,\n\nas AccuSoft points to several exhibits appearing to show that\n\nsequential   serial    numbers,      meeting   the   requirements    of   the\n\nsettlement agreement, were used for at least some IFL sales.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the master's brief statement does not\n\nconstitute proof, by clear and convincing evidence, of contempt.\n\n          At the same time, however, we conclude that we cannot\n\nresolve this matter in AccuSoft's favor either.              The master's\n\nstatement at a minimum indicates that he harbored some doubt\n\nabout AccuSoft's compliance with this requirement.           On the basis\n\nof the current record, we cannot foreclose the possibility that\n\nthe master, once he squarely confronts the issue, might find\n\nthat AccuSoft's failure to comply fully constitutes contempt.\n\nWhile we see comparatively little chance that such contempt, if\n\nproven,   could   be   linked   to    any   significant    damages   --    or\n\nattorneys' fees, given our interpretation of the fee-shifting\n\n\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\fprovision    contained   in   the    agreement    --    we    leave    those\n\ndeterminations to the district court on remand.\n\n            d.    Failure to Find AccuSoft in Contempt on the\n                  Basis of Written and Oral Statements\n\n            Snowbound's final claim of error with respect to the\n\nmaster's contempt rulings is that the master improperly failed\n\nto find AccuSoft in contempt for various statements that it made\n\nto third parties both orally and in writing.           In the proceedings\n\nbelow, Snowbound argued that AccuSoft made numerous statements\n\nthat violated Paragraph 9 of the settlement agreement, which\n\nstates, in pertinent part, that:\n\n            AccuSoft   will  not   hereafter   represent\n            explicitly or in substance to anyone that\n            its forthcoming new image software toolkit .\n            . . ”ImageGear,” is based upon or derived\n            from the Image Format Library.”\n\nAs examples, Snowbound pointed to the fact that AccuSoft's\n\nadvertising materials referred to ImageGear as “Version 6.0\"\n\n(the most recent version of the IFL was 5.0) and as the “new\n\nversion of the AccuSoft Image Format Library.”                     Similarly,\n\nAccuSoft's web page claimed that ImageGear “takes [AccuSoft's]\n\nexisting Image Format Library product to a new level by adding\n\nnew   features,    functions,       flexibility    and       performance.”\n\nSnowbound    alleged   that   AccuSoft     salespeople       had    similarly\n\nexceeded the limits of Paragraph 9 by, for example, stating in\n\nwritten communications with customers that “we are no longer\n\n                                    -44-\n\fselling the Image Format Library version 5.0 . . . we are\n\nselling the 6.0 version called ImageGear.”\n\n            While the master agreed that the statements identified\n\nby Snowbound suggested a “relationship” between the IFL and\n\nImageGear, he interpreted Paragraph 9 to prohibit a narrower\n\nclass of statements: those that “convey the . . . suggestion\n\nthat ImageGear contains the same computer code as the IFL.”                The\n\nmaster found that the statements attributed to AccuSoft did not\n\ncontain that suggestion.       The master also considered affidavits\n\nfrom the counsel who negotiated the settlement agreement. These\n\naffidavits, he found, showed considerable difference of opinion\n\nas to what the parties intended Paragraph 9 to cover.               In view\n\nof both the narrow construction he applied to the language and\n\nthe ambiguity he detected in the parties' intent, he found that\n\ncontempt had not been proven.\n\n            Snowbound   also     asserted      that   AccuSoft    had     made\n\nstatements    concerning       its    (and    Snowbound's)      ability     to\n\ndistribute, maintain and support the Image Format Library that\n\nimpermissibly deviated from a “script” of approved statements\n\ncontained    in   Paragraph     13    of     the   settlement    agreement.\n\nSnowbound pointed to an e-mail from AccuSoft, issued days after\n\nthe settlement agreement was signed, stating that AccuSoft had\n\n“full rights to market, sell, distribute, maintain and support\n\n\n                                     -45-\n\fthe    Image   Format   Library.”           Snowbound     further     noted     that\n\nAccuSoft continued to refer to the IFL as the “AccuSoft Image\n\nFormat Library,” even after August 31, 1996, when its right to\n\ndistribute the software had terminated.                       Finally, Snowbound\n\nasserted that AccuSoft told certain customers who inquired about\n\nthe IFL after August 31, 1996 that “[n]o one has rights to\n\ndistribute the IFL,” that “[t]he Image Format Library is no\n\nlonger available from anywhere,” or even that “Snowbound does\n\nnot have the right to sell any licensing for the Image Format\n\nLibrary.”\n\n             Here, again, the master found that the statements\n\ncomplained of had not clearly been demonstrated to violate the\n\nrequirements of the settlement agreement.                 The master noted that\n\nParagraph 13, by its terms, only restricted the substance of\n\n“statements     by    either       party    to   the   public    concerning      the\n\nownership of the Software” (emphasis added).                    It therefore was\n\nnot    clear   that   Paragraph       13    covered     AccuSoft's     statements\n\nconcerning who could sell or distribute the IFL.                     Furthermore,\n\nthe master found some merit in AccuSoft's contention that the\n\nsettlement agreement, although it transferred the IFL software\n\nto Palo, did not clearly convey to Palo or Snowbound any rights\n\nto    the   product   named    the    Image      Format   Library.       As    such,\n\nAccuSoft's     statement      to    its    clients     that    the   Image    Format\n\n\n                                          -46-\n\fLibrary was “not available from anywhere” was in some sense true\n\n-- although less than forthcoming -- after August 31, 1996,\n\ngiven that the only product then available using the IFL code\n\nwas the one called RasterMaster.\n\n            The master apparently found AccuSoft's statement that\n\nit had “full rights” to the IFL to be the closest case, given\n\nhis conclusion that the settlement agreement actually placed\n\nsignificant        limits           on        AccuSoft's      ability      to         continue\n\ndistributing       the       IFL,    including         the    requirement        that       such\n\ndistribution cease entirely after August 31, 1996.                             Nonetheless,\n\nthe master found that, from a purchaser's perspective, AccuSoft\n\neffectively      had        the   “full        rights”   claimed    at     the    time       the\n\nstatement was made.               Moreover, he found that the statement was\n\nnot   “so   much       at    variance”          with    the    scripted    statement          --\n\nAccuSoft was permitted to say that “AccuSoft will continue to\n\ndistribute       the     AccuSoft             Image    Format    Library”        --    as     to\n\nconstitute contempt.\n\n            On     appeal,          Snowbound          argues    that      the        master's\n\nconclusions with respect to these alleged violations must be\n\nreversed because the master misinterpreted the requirements of\n\nthe   settlement            agreement          and     the    import      of     AccuSoft's\n\nstatements.        Although we acknowledge that the interpretations\n\nproposed    by    Snowbound,             at    least    in    certain    instances,          are\n\n\n                                                -47-\n\fplausible, we do not believe Snowbound has met the heavy burden\n\nof   demonstrating       that    the   master     abused     his    discretion     by\n\nconcluding otherwise.\n\n             With respect to the violations of Paragraph 9, we\n\nconcede that the use of “Version 6.0\" to describe ImageGear,\n\ntaken   in    isolation,      implies    a     relationship        between   it   and\n\nVersion 5.0 of the IFL that could include reliance on the same\n\nor similar underlying code.             However, other statements in the\n\nadvertisements and AccuSoft’s web page quite clearly undercut\n\nthat    suggestion.        For    example,      the   first   sentence       of   the\n\nadvertisement text states: “AccuSoft Corporation announces a\n\ntotally new product, ImageGear, the next generation in imaging\n\ntechnology” (emphasis added).             Similarly, the web site states:\n\n“It's not a new version of an old product . . . it's new from\n\nthe ground up, designed to the most current coding, quality and\n\nperformance standards” (emphasis added).                Given this, we see no\n\nreason to disturb the master's conclusion that these statements,\n\ntaken as a whole, did not improperly suggest that ImageGear was\n\n“based on or derived from” the code contained in the IFL.\n\n             The    written      communications       with    customers,      which\n\ninclude      no   such   clarifying     language,     present       a   perceptibly\n\ncloser case and, were we deciding this issue in the first\n\ninstance, we are not certain that our conclusion with respect to\n\n\n                                        -48-\n\fthese statements would be the same as the master’s.        However, we\n\ndo not find the master’s conclusions so clearly wrong as to\n\nrequire us to find an abuse of discretion.       The question of what\n\nAccuSoft’s statements implied, in the context in which they were\n\nmade, strikes us as one which the master was plainly in a\n\nsuperior position to answer.       So too, we note that the master’s\n\ninquiry into the negotiating history of the parties on the\n\nrelevant language of Paragraph 9 led him to believe that the\n\nquestion of what was prohibited was not entirely understood by\n\nthe parties.    Under the circumstances, we are not convinced that\n\nthe master’s conclusion constitutes reversible error.\n\n         We are similarly unpersuaded that reversal of the\n\nmaster’s conclusions regarding alleged violations of Paragraph\n\n13 is justified.    We agree with the master that the settlement\n\nagreement’s scripts, which, by their terms, extend only to\n\nstatements concerning the “ownership” of the software, are not\n\nunambiguously    applicable   to     the   statements   AccuSoft   made\n\nconcerning rights to market and distribute the software.            It\n\nalso seems to us to stretch the scripts too far to assume that\n\nthey would prohibit AccuSoft from making potentially accurate\n\nnegative statements concerning Snowbound's distribution of the\n\nIFL when such statements did not conflict with those that the\n\nsettlement agreement permitted.\n\n\n                                   -49-\n\f            Turning finally to AccuSoft's statement that it had\n\n“full rights to market, sell, distribute, maintain and support\n\nthe Image Format Library,” we again conclude that the master's\n\nconclusion should be affirmed, although, in this case, we rely\n\non a different ground than did the master.                 See Ross-Simons of\n\nWarwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 217 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (holding that the appellate court is “not bound by the\n\ntrial court's rationale, but may affirm [the trial court's]\n\njudgment    for    any    valid   reason       that   finds    support   in   the\n\nrecord”).       In our view, there is no doubt that AccuSoft's\n\nstatement ultimately implies a claim regarding “ownership” of\n\nthe IFL, and therefore is governed by Paragraph 13 of the\n\nsettlement agreement.          Equally clear, as the master found (and\n\nthe   scripts     and    the   settlement      agreement      confirm)   is   that\n\nAccuSoft had, and could properly claim, only more limited rights\n\nin the software.         The “full” rights to which AccuSoft sought to\n\nlay claim were transferred to Snowbound, and, in fact, Snowbound\n\nwas specifically allowed to claim such full rights in the code\n\nunderlying the IFL (and RasterMaster) by section b of Paragraph\n\n13 of the settlement agreement.               Given this, to the extent that\n\nthe   master's     opinion      rests    on    a   finding     that   AccuSoft's\n\nstatement did not conflict with the settlement agreement, we\n\nmust disagree.\n\n\n                                        -50-\n\f           At the same time, we think that this comparatively\n\nminor departure from the settlement agreement's requirements\n\ndoes not, by itself, require a finding of civil contempt.                As we\n\nhave noted, “letter perfect compliance” with a court's order is\n\nnot required -- only substantial compliance.               Langton, 928 F.2d\n\nat 1222.   While AccuSoft doubtless tried to portray its position\n\nfollowing execution of the settlement agreement in a favorable\n\nlight, most of its statements -- particularly those disseminated\n\nto the public generally -- were adequately qualified to avoid\n\nconflict with the settlement agreement's terms.                     We do not\n\nconsider this single improper statement, contained in an e-mail\n\nbetween AccuSoft and one of its resellers, so significant as to\n\nrequire    a   finding      that   AccuSoft   was    not    in     substantial\n\ncompliance     with   the    relevant   provisions    of     the   settlement\n\nagreement.     We therefore affirm the master's conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\f           2.          AccuSoft’s Claims of Error\n\n           In      the     proceedings        below,     the     master   found    in\n\nAccuSoft’s favor with respect to a number of its allegations of\n\ncontemptuous conduct by Snowbound.                   In particular, the master\n\nfound that several widely-disseminated statements by Snowbound\n\nviolated the requirements of Paragraph 13 of the settlement\n\nagreement.      These included statements issued almost immediately\n\nafter the litigation, asserting that Snowbound had “won” the\n\nlitigation      and      had   “accomplished         what   it    wanted”   in    the\n\nsettlement agreement.           Snowbound also was found to have violated\n\nthe settlement agreement by using the words “AccuSoft” and\n\n“Image    Format      Library”    in    its    advertisements,       by   revealing\n\nconfidential terms of the settlement agreement to clients, and\n\nby failing to delete references to “Accu” or “AccuSoft” in\n\nproducts   it     distributed         after   the    settlement     agreement     was\n\nsigned.\n\n           However, the master ultimately rejected the relief\n\nsought    by    AccuSoft       with    respect      to   these   breaches   of    the\n\nagreement.       The master declined AccuSoft’s request that it be\n\nexcused from performance of its obligations under the agreement\n\n(principally payment of royalties) from the date of Snowbound’s\n\nbreach.        The master also found that AccuSoft had failed to\n\nintroduce evidence linking the proven breaches of the agreement\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\fwith any damages it had suffered.          On appeal AccuSoft challenges\n\nthese conclusions, as well as rulings by the master limiting the\n\nscope of discovery with respect to damages.                  AccuSoft also\n\nargues that the master should have separately found Snowbound in\n\ncontempt for licensing the IFL under that name, as opposed to\n\nunder its own brand name, RasterMaster.\n\n            a.      Rejection   of  Request   for  Rescission            of\n                    Settlement Agreement/Relief from Judgment\n\n            In its initial motion for contempt, AccuSoft requested\n\nthat it:\n\n            be excused from making any and all further\n            payments to Defendants . . . as a result of\n            their wilful and deliberate breach of the\n            bargained for exchange of payments for\n            confidentiality and protection of AccuSoft’s\n            goodwill   embodied   in   the    Settlement\n            Agreement.\n\nIn an amended motion, submitted in September 1996, AccuSoft\n\nreframed this argument more broadly as a request for relief from\n\njudgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) and for rescission\n\nof   the   settlement   agreement    in    its   entirety.     Citing   our\n\ndecision in      United States v.     Baus, 834 F.2d 1114 (1st Cir.\n\n1981), AccuSoft argued that Snowbound’s contempt justified the\n\nmaster in “relieving AccuSoft of the terms of the Judgment and\n\nSettlement Agreement.”     AccuSoft's rescission request, fleshed\n\nout in a “post-trial” brief submitted at the close of the\n\nhearings before the master, sought an order that would “rescind\n\n                                    -53-\n\fthe Settlement Agreement and require the parties to return all\n\nconsideration received, thereby returning them to the status quo\n\nthat existed prior to the entry of the Settlement Agreement.”\n\nAs grounds for both forms of relief, AccuSoft argued that: (1)\n\nSnowbound had failed to honor “material and essential” terms of\n\nthe settlement agreement; (2) AccuSoft's actual damages were\n\n“difficult or impossible to determine”; and (3) there was “no\n\nmeeting of the minds and therefore no valid contract.”\n\n            In his memorandum, the master rejected AccuSoft's claim\n\nfor relief on two grounds.          First, noting AccuSoft's delay in\n\nasserting    its    rescission    claim    until   after   the   settlement\n\nagreement's August 31, 1996 cutoff had passed, the master found\n\nthat AccuSoft's conduct constituted an election to continue to\n\noperate under the contract, thus precluding rescission.            Canada-\n\nAtlantic & Plant S.S. Co., Ltd. v. Flanders, 165 F. 321, 323\n\n(1st Cir. 1908).      Furthermore, even if AccuSoft had not waived\n\nits right to such relief, the master found that Snowbound’s\n\nbreaches of the settlement agreement were not “sufficiently\n\nmaterial” to justify rescission of the contract or to excuse\n\nAccuSoft from its obligation to perform.             Although the master\n\nacknowledged       that   the    confidentiality     provisions    of   the\n\nsettlement agreement were “important” to the parties, the master\n\nheld that they did not constitute an “essential and inducing\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\ffeature of the contract.”              Lease-It, Inc. v. Mass. Port Auth.,\n\n600   N.E.2d     599,    602    (Mass.    App.    Ct.       1992)    (discussing     the\n\nstandard of materiality for excusing a non-breaching party from\n\nperformance).           To   the      contrary,       he    concluded,     “the     most\n\nimportant features of the Settlement Agreement were those which\n\npermitted the parties to continue in business by releasing their\n\nclaims to the other's software.”\n\n            On appeal, AccuSoft's principal claim of error concerns\n\nthe   master's     conclusion          that    Snowbound's          breaches   of    the\n\nsettlement agreement were not material.                      Accusoft contends that\n\nthe   master     failed      to    appreciate         that    the    confidentiality\n\nprovisions were essential to the agreement because, in the small\n\nmarket the parties were competing in, revelations concerning the\n\noutcome    of    the    litigation       could    severely       impair    AccuSoft's\n\nability to continue to do business and to transition its current\n\ncustomers to the ImageGear software.                   In fact, AccuSoft argued,\n\nthose provisions were the most important to AccuSoft because\n\nthey protected its goodwill.              Notably, and without explanation,\n\nAccuSoft does not address the master's alternative holding that\n\nAccuSoft    is    barred       from   relief     by    an    implicit     election    to\n\ncontinue under the contract.\n\n            As we proceed to the merits of AccuSoft's appeal on\n\nthis issue, we first address the fact that, on appeal, AccuSoft\n\n\n                                         -55-\n\fonce again appears to recast the nature of the relief it seeks.\n\nAccuSoft's most recent complaint, as well as its argument before\n\nthe master (and, subsequently, before Judge Gorton), asked for\n\ncomplete    rescission     of    the    settlement    agreement   and,    by\n\nimplication, complete relief from judgment pursuant to Rule\n\n60(b)(6).     In the briefs submitted to this court, however,\n\nAccuSoft reverts to the version of this count contained in the\n\ninitial complaint, asking simply to be excused from paying\n\nroyalties    from   the   date   that     Snowbound   first   breached   the\n\nagreement by announcing that it had “won” the litigation.21\n\nAccuSoft also fails to press any specific argument for relief\n\nbased on Rule 60(b)(6), although it could be concluded that\n\nAccuSoft's continuing references to our decision in Baus are\n\nintended to do so by implication.\n\n            The significance of this shift in tactics is unclear.\n\nArguably, although Snowbound has not so contended, AccuSoft's\n\nrequest on appeal for a more limited remedy is subject to\n\ndismissal because it was not properly raised in the forum below.\n\nHowever, Massachusetts caselaw is not entirely clear on whether\n\nthe line of precedent excusing a party from performance based on\n\nanother party's breach may be viewed as deriving from the same\n\n\n    21    Indeed, in its reply brief in this Court, AccuSoft\nstates baldly it is “not seeking to rescind the Settlement\nAgreement.”\n\n                                       -56-\n\fsource as the precedent regarding rescission.                       See Lease-It,\n\nInc.,    600    N.E.2d   at       601-02    (discussing    the    right    to    cease\n\nperformance while referencing authority concerning rescission).\n\nIf Massachusetts law would treat the difference as going to the\n\nextent, rather than the nature, of the relief, AccuSoft could be\n\nfound to have adequately preserved its position.                          Because it\n\ndoes not affect the result we reach, we accept arguendo that the\n\nrelief    requested      on        appeal    is   properly       before     us   and,\n\nfurthermore,      that   an       argument    under     Rule   60(b)(6)     is   also\n\nproperly preserved.\n\n               Turning to the substance of AccuSoft's appeal, we\n\naffirm the master's conclusion on the ground that AccuSoft, by\n\nelecting to continue accepting benefits under the agreement, has\n\nlost any right it may have had to be excused from performance as\n\na result of Snowbound's contempt.22               It is well established that\n\nconduct    indicating         a    willingness     to    continue    to     honor    a\n\ncontract, despite knowledge that the other party has failed to\n\nperform, “operates as a promise to perform in spite of that non-\n\n\n\n    22    In so holding, we specifically do not decide whether\nthe master was right to conclude that Snowbound's violations of\nthe settlement agreement were not “sufficiently material” to\njustify rescission or to excuse AccuSoft from its duty to\nperform.    Indeed, we find significant merit in AccuSoft's\ncontention that the confidentiality requirements and related\nprovisions related to publicity were critical components of the\nsettlement agreement from AccuSoft's perspective.\n\n                                           -57-\n\foccurrence.”   Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 246; see also\n\nFlanders, 165 F. at 321 (1st Cir. 1908) (holding that a breach\n\nby one party gives the other the right of election to continue\n\nunder the contract or to sue for rescission); accord Apex Pool\n\nEquip. Corp. v. Lee, 419 F.2d 556, 561 (2d Cir. 1969) (“[T]he\n\npower to terminate a continuing contract because of a particular\n\nbreach of that contract is a power of election.”).         Here,\n\nAccuSoft plainly knew of Snowbound's breaches of the agreement\n\nwithin a short time of when they occurred, and, indeed, soon\n\nfiled its first motion for contempt.   Yet AccuSoft continued to\n\naccept the benefits of the settlement agreement and to act as if\n\nit were still in effect.   It was not until several months later\n\n-- after August 31, 1996 -- that AccuSoft filed an amended\n\npleading that made clear it sought rescission of the entire\n\nagreement.     In the interim, AccuSoft availed itself of the\n\nability to license the IFL in return for royalty payments, as\n\nwell as the ability to sell ImageGear free from infringement\n\nclaims.   Indeed, by the time AccuSoft asserted its rescission\n\nclaim, it had obtained all the benefits from the settlement\n\nagreement that it could.   Under the circumstances, we agree with\n\nthe master that AccuSoft was not entitled to cancel -- largely\n\n\n\n\n                               -58-\n\fretroactively -- its obligation to pay royalties.23              We therefore\n\naffirm the master's conclusion.\n\n            b.     Conclusion that AccuSoft Failed to Introduce\n                   Adequate Evidence of Damages\n\n            In addition to rejecting AccuSoft's rescission claim,\n\nthe master rejected AccuSoft's contention that it was entitled\n\nto be compensated for Snowbound's contempt with money damages.\n\nThe master acknowledged that AccuSoft had introduced evidence\n\nshowing that many of its customers from 1995 did not continue as\n\ncustomers    in   1996   or   later,    and   that   many   of    those   same\n\ncustomers had become customers of Snowbound.                The master also\n\nconceded that Accusoft had not reached its projected levels of\n\ngrowth in 1996 and beyond.             However, the master found that\n\nAccuSoft had failed to introduce “any evidence that these events\n\noccurred because Snowbound breached the Settlement Agreement”\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            To the contrary, the master noted that the testimony\n\nsuggested a number of reasons, unrelated to the alleged breaches\n\n\n\n    23    We acknowledge that nothing in our limited precedent\nconcerning the circumstances under which relief from judgment\npursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) will be granted specifically\nincorporates a parallel principle that a party may “elect” to\naccept non-performance of a settlement agreement, nor do we\nintend to establish such a general principle here. However, we\ndo find that, on the facts presented here, AccuSoft has not\npresented any “reason justifying relief from the operation of\njudgment.”\n\n                                   -59-\n\fof the agreement, that could explain these occurrences.             It was\n\napparent that many of AccuSoft's customers knew of the legal\n\ndispute between AccuSoft and the founders of Snowbound, and that\n\nsome number also understood that the disputes concerned rights\n\nto the code contained in the IFL.         AccuSoft's operations were\n\nalso disrupted by the injunction entered by the court shortly\n\nbefore the infringement trial was to begin.            Finally, AccuSoft\n\nfaced, beginning in early 1996, a new and combative competitor\n\n(Snowbound), aggressively courting the same customers in a small\n\nniche market, and at a time when AccuSoft was having difficulty\n\ncompleting and marketing its own new product.\n\n          On    appeal,   AccuSoft    argues   first   that   the   master\n\napplied   the    “wrong    legal     standard”   in    determining     the\n\nsufficiency of AccuSoft's evidence of damages.             Specifically,\n\nAccuSoft contends that the master ignored precedent indicating\n\nthat damages can be recovered even where the amount of damages\n\nsuffered cannot be calculated with certainty.           See, e.g., Nat'l\n\nMerchandising Corp. v. Leyden, 348 N.E.2d 771, 774 (Mass. 1976)\n\n(noting, with respect to a claim for damages for interference\n\nwith contractual relations, that “an element of uncertainty in\n\nthe assessment of damages is not a bar to their recovery”).\n\nWhile the cases AccuSoft cites appear to be good law, AccuSoft's\n\nargument ultimately is irrelevant to the issue on appeal.            We do\n\n\n                                   -60-\n\fnot   read   the   master's   conclusion   to   be   that   AccuSoft\n\ninadequately identified the amount of damages, but rather that\n\nAccuSoft could not demonstrate that any damages suffered were\n\ncaused by breaches of the settlement agreement.       Such proof of\n\na causal nexus between Snowbound's breaches and the damages\n\nAccuSoft suffered is clearly required by Paragraph 16 of the\n\nsettlement agreement 24 as well as by settled precedent.         See\n\nBurke v. Guiney, 700 F.2d 767, 770 (1st Cir. 1983) (“In addition\n\nto presenting clear and convincing evidence that a court order\n\nhas been violated, a party seeking monetary damages in civil\n\ncontempt     . . . must show that he has suffered damage       as a\n\nresult of the violation”) (emphasis added); see also In re Kave,\n\n760 F.2d 343, 351 (1st Cir. 1985) (explaining that compensatory\n\ndamages for contempt are intended to “make whole the aggrieved\n\nparty for damages caused by the contemnor's conduct”) (emphasis\n\nadded); Town of Manchester v. Dept. of Envtl. Quality Eng'g, 409\n\nN.E.2d 176, 182 (Mass. 1980) (“Where a fine is imposed in a\n\ncivil contempt proceeding it must not exceed the actual loss to\n\nthe complainant caused by the contemnor's violation of the order\n\n. . . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n      24  The relevant portion of Paragraph 16 states that “[i]f\nany party should breach any term of this Agreement, the other\nparty will be entitled . . . to an award of its actual damages\nsustained by reason of such breach . . .” (emphasis added).\n\n                                -61-\n\f            In the alternative, AccuSoft argues that it did offer\n\nevidence demonstrating that it suffered damages as a result of\n\nSnowbound's violations of the settlement agreement.                  However,\n\nbased on the record evidence AccuSoft identifies in its motion\n\npapers, we are not persuaded to reverse the master's conclusion\n\nto the contrary.        As we have previously stated, in evaluating a\n\nchallenge to the award of damages, “we rely heavily on the\n\njudgment of the trial court, who has had the benefit of hearing\n\nall of the evidence.”         Clark v. Taylor, 710 F.2d 4, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1983).     The evidence AccuSoft points to, at best, demonstrates\n\nthat Snowbound made statements to current customers of AccuSoft,\n\nregarding the IFL, that violated the settlement agreement; that\n\nSnowbound was aware when doing so that such statements could\n\naffect AccuSoft's ability to sell the IFL to its customers; and\n\nthat     some   of    those   customers      later   became   customers    of\n\nSnowbound.        Nothing AccuSoft identifies in the record moves\n\nbeyond     mere      circumstantial    evidence      to   directly   connect\n\nSnowbound's actions with specific lost customers.                While such\n\ncircumstantial evidence of causation may, in certain instances,\n\nbe adequate, AccuSoft has given us no reason to believe that the\n\nmaster erred in concluding otherwise in this case.\n\n            As a final argument on this point, AccuSoft contends\n\nthat the master committed reversible error by limiting discovery\n\n\n                                      -62-\n\fwith respect to damages.           AccuSoft states that discovery was\n\nlimited to communications between Snowbound and former AccuSoft\n\ncustomers.       AccuSoft    was    not   allowed     to   investigate     what\n\nstatements were made to other Snowbound customers who may have\n\nconsidered   purchasing       AccuSoft's        product    but   were   unduly\n\ninfluenced by the improper communications.             AccuSoft also argues\n\nthat it should have been allowed to investigate Snowbound's\n\nfinancial condition.        With this information, AccuSoft contends,\n\nit could have developed the necessary evidence concerning its\n\ndamages.\n\n           The master, in his memorandum, noted that AccuSoft had\n\nfailed, on the basis of the discovery it was allowed, to produce\n\nany   evidence   that   would      lead   him    to   believe    that   further\n\ndiscovery was justified.        AccuSoft was not able to point to any\n\nof its own communications with customers suggesting that they\n\nhad information relevant to whether Snowbound's conduct caused\n\nAccuSoft's damages.     Nor had the limited discovery of customers\n\nwho had switched from AccuSoft to Snowbound suggested that such\n\ninformation would be revealed through additional discovery.                 The\n\nmaster acknowledged that, given the “substantial difficulties in\n\ngetting third-parties to permit themselves to become involved in\n\nthis kind of dispute,” it was not fair to “infer that such\n\ninformation would not be helpful to Accusoft.”                   On the other\n\n\n                                     -63-\n\fhand, he concluded that he could not simply “assume . . . that\n\nAccuSoft's loss of revenues or Snowbound's receipt of revenues\n\nare the result of the improper conduct by Snowbound” (emphasis\n\nin original).\n\n           Here     too,   precedent       suggests       a   highly   deferential\n\nstandard of review.           During the performance of his duties, a\n\nmaster is “functionally indistinguishable from . . . a trial\n\njudge.”    Jenkins v. Sterlacci, 849 F.2d 627, 634 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1988).    Trial judges “enjoy broad discretion in the handling of\n\ninterstitial       matters,      such   as       the   management      of   pretrial\n\ndiscovery.”     FDIC v. Ogden Corp., 202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    While such decisions are not immune from review, they\n\nwill   only   be    reversed       “upon     a    clear   showing      of   manifest\n\ninjustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was\n\nplainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the\n\naggrieved party.”          Id.     AccuSoft has identified no facts or\n\nprecedent that convince us that the master was “plainly wrong”\n\nin limiting discovery as he did.                 To the contrary, it appears to\n\nus that the master's decision to disallow further discovery was\n\nfirmly grounded in his factual findings, which AccuSoft does not\n\nmeaningfully dispute.            We therefore affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -64-\n\f              c.        Finding that Settlement Agreement Transferred\n                        “Ownership” of the IFL to Snowbound\n\n              In the proceedings below, AccuSoft alleged, and the\n\nmaster      found,     that   Snowbound   had    offered    to    sell    or    renew\n\nlicenses for the IFL and, in at least a few instances, actually\n\nsold   or    renewed     such    licenses.       AccuSoft    argued      that    this\n\nviolated         the   settlement      agreement    because,       although       the\n\nagreement         transferred     to   Palo     AccuSoft's       rights    in     the\n\nunderlying code, it did not transfer any rights in the product\n\nnamed the Image Format Library.               The master rejected AccuSoft's\n\ncontention, noting that, in his view, the settlement agreement\n\nshould      be     interpreted    as   transferring     “all      of     AccuSoft's\n\ninterest in the IFL” to Palo.             He also indicated that the lack\n\nof clarity in the settlement agreement concerning the interest\n\nthat was transferred to Palo precluded finding of contempt in\n\nany event.\n\n              On appeal, AccuSoft renews its argument that the master\n\nerroneously interpreted the agreement and that only ownership of\n\nthe underlying code was transferred to Snowbound.                         AccuSoft\n\nnotes that the language of the Assignment of Copyright, which\n\nstates that AccuSoft will transfer “all of its right, title, and\n\ninterest in and to all computer programs or other software that\n\nhave at any time to date been sold under the name 'AccuSoft\n\nImage Format Library,'” does not expressly transfer ownership of\n\n                                        -65-\n\fthe IFL name, or any IFL documentation, or customer contacts or\n\ngoodwill associated with the IFL.           AccuSoft also points out that\n\nthe settlement agreement strictly limits what Snowbound could\n\nsay concerning ownership of the IFL, and specifically prohibits\n\nSnowbound from “trading in any manner upon the goodwill attached\n\nto the name 'AccuSoft.'”          Finally, AccuSoft identifies record\n\nevidence suggesting that Palo and Wieczner were not particularly\n\nconcerned with gaining the ability to sell the IFL code qua IFL\n\n(rather     than    under   the   name   RasterMaster)       when   they   were\n\nnegotiating the settlement agreement.\n\n            As a matter of contractual interpretation, we find\n\nsignificant merit in AccuSoft's argument.              We do not read the\n\nagreement to unambiguously transfer to Palo ownership of the IFL\n\nproduct, as opposed to its underlying code.              Further, we find\n\nthat AccuSoft makes a compelling case that other provisions --\n\nsuch   as   those    concerning     publicity    and   the    protection     of\n\nAccuSoft's goodwill -- suggest that the parties did not intend\n\nthat Snowbound would license the IFL.            In this context we note\n\nthat the settlement agreement's express statement that Snowbound\n\ncould publicize its ability to “support” the IFL after August\n\n31, 1996, may also be read to imply that Snowbound could not\n\npublicize its ability to take other actions with respect to the\n\nIFL.   These provisions, taken together, lead us to believe that\n\n\n                                     -66-\n\fSnowbound was not authorized by the settlement agreement to sell\n\nthe product under the IFL name.\n\n            We    are   less    certain       that   AccuSoft    has     advanced\n\ncompelling       grounds   to   reverse      the   master's   conclusion       that\n\nSnowbound's actions did not constitute civil contempt.                     First,\n\nas   the   master's     opinion      makes    clear,   the    language    of    the\n\nsettlement agreement is not unambiguous on this issue.                   While we\n\nfeel that the better reading favors AccuSoft's position, we do\n\nnot believe that the interpretation argued by Snowbound and\n\nadopted by the master is entirely without foundation.                    The lack\n\nof a clear directive counsels against a finding of contempt.\n\nSee, e.g., Project B.A.S.I.C., 947 F.2d at 16.\n\n            In    addition,     we   have     some   doubt    whether,    from    a\n\nsubstantive point of view, anything turns on the prohibition\n\nAccuSoft would impose.           It seems evident that the settlement\n\nagreement would, at least after August 31, 1996, allow Snowbound\n\nto tell customers who inquired that it was supporting the IFL\n\nand also selling the RasterMaster product, which used the same\n\ncode as the IFL.        We note also that the master found -- and we\n\nhave affirmed -- that it was permissible to state, after August\n\n31, 1996, that no one was actually selling the IFL anymore.\n\nGiven Snowbound's evident ability to license the IFL code, to\n\nstate that such code was formerly contained in the IFL but now\n\n\n                                       -67-\n\fcontained in RasterMaster, and to indicate that the IFL qua IFL\n\nwas no longer available, Snowbound could only be found to have\n\nbreached the agreement to the extent that licensing the IFL\n\nwithout    such      explanation      improperly         traded   on    goodwill\n\nassociated with that name.           In this context, it is noteworthy\n\nthat the master already considered, and found contemptuous,\n\nSnowbound's     use     of     the   term    IFL    in    advertisements       and\n\nSnowbound's use of references to “AccuSoft”\n\nor “Accu” in products it sold, but found no damages associated\n\nwith these breaches.25\n\n           Although the above suggests to us that AccuSoft may\n\nhave difficulty proving contempt, or proving that any damages\n\nresulted from such contempt, we believe a remand is necessary to\n\ndetermine whether the factual record may support such a finding\n\nif the interpretation of the settlement agreement set out above\n\nis applied.     As but one reason for so doing, we note that it is\n\nnot at all clear, from the record evidence identified by the\n\nparties,   when Snowbound licensed the IFL.                   With the record\n\nbefore    us,   we    cannot    conclusively       resolve    this     issue   and\n\ntherefore leave it to the district court to determine.\n\n\n    25    We also consider it significant that the settlement\nagreement expressly did not seek to regulate the parties' oral\nstatements, further limiting the conduct surrounding the sales\nof IFL that could be considered grounds for a finding of\ncontempt.\n\n                                      -68-\n\fC.          Attorneys' Fees and Related Costs; Costs of Audit\n\n            Finally, the parties appeal aspects of the master's\n\nrulings with respect to costs of the master's audit and the\n\naward of attorneys' fees and related litigation costs.\n\n            1.       Costs of Audit\n\n            In its motion papers, AccuSoft argues that, if its\n\nappeals     concerning    the    royalties    owed     to   Snowbound    are\n\nsuccessful, the award of audit costs to Snowbound may need to be\n\nrevisited.       In charging the entirety of the audit to AccuSoft in\n\nhis decision below, the master relied on Paragraph 6 of the\n\nsettlement agreement which states, in relation to the audit,\n\nthat:\n\n            If the audit discloses that any amount due\n            was underreported or underpaid by more than\n            5%, AccuSoft will reimburse Palo for one-\n            half of the cost of the audit. If the audit\n            discloses   that   any    amount  due   was\n            underreported by more than 10%, AccuSoft\n            will reimburse Palo for the entire cost of\n            the audit.\n\nBecause we hold that the master's award of the Lifeboat revenues\n\nto Snowbound must be vacated -- an award which constituted the\n\nmajority of the amount unpaid by AccuSoft – this calculation may\n\nindeed change on remand.        We therefore direct the court below to\n\nreview    this    question   again    after   the    remanded   issues   are\n\nresolved.\n\n            2.       Attorneys' Fees and Related Costs\n\n                                     -69-\n\f         Paragraph 16 of the settlement agreement provides, in\n\nrelevant part, that:\n\n         If any party should breach any term of this\n         Agreement, the other party will be entitled\n         to move for contempt of the Order, to an\n         award of its actual damages sustained by\n         reason of such breach, and to recover its\n         reasonable   attorneys'   fees  and   costs\n         incurred in such proceedings . . . .\n\nIn his memorandum, the master concluded that the phrase “in such\n\nproceedings” must be read as limited to that process in which a\n\nparty “move[s] for contempt of the Order” to remedy the other\n\nparty's breach, and, therefore, that the provision only allowed\n\nfor recovery by a plaintiff in a contempt action.   He also found\n\nthat, by its terms, the provision required that a breach of the\n\nagreement be proved before fees could be awarded.    However, the\n\nmaster found nothing in the language to limit a party who\n\nalleged multiple counts of contempt to obtaining attorneys' fees\n\nassociated with its “successful” contempt claims.     Nor did he\n\nview the language as requiring the party to meet the definition\n\nof a “prevailing party” as it is used in statutory fee-shifting\n\nprovisions; a definition which typically requires that some\n\ndamages be proven.     Cf. PH Group, Ltd. v. Birch, 985 F.2d 649,\n\n652 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing to cases indicating that the award\n\nof zero or merely nominal damages may not convey prevailing-\n\nparty status).\n\n\n                               -70-\n\f            Based on this interpretation, the master found that\n\nAccuSoft was entitled to recover the reasonable fees it incurred\n\nin prosecuting its motion for contempt against Snowbound.                            In\n\ncalculating the fees, the master employed the lodestar time and\n\nrate analysis.          See Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. 104 Acres of\n\nLand, 32 F.3d 632, 634 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting our preference\n\nfor the lodestar time and rate method “if an alternative method\n\nis   not   expressly      dictated      by     applicable      law”).        Following\n\nseveral    rounds       of   submissions           from   AccuSoft,      the    master\n\ndetermined that $135,102 in attorneys' fees and $14,143 in\n\nrelated costs (travel costs, constable fees, etc.) were properly\n\nattributable to AccuSoft's prosecution of its contempt action\n\nand thus recoverable.           Because the master found that Snowbound\n\nhad not succeeded in proving that AccuSoft was in contempt of\n\nany aspect of the settlement agreement, Snowbound was awarded no\n\nfees.\n\n            On    appeal,       both    parties       challenge        the     master's\n\ninterpretation of the settlement agreement language.                           AccuSoft\n\nargues that it should be allowed to recover the entirety of its\n\nattorneys'       fees     and   costs,        including     those       expended     in\n\nsuccessfully      defending      itself        against     Snowbound's         contempt\n\nallegations.        Snowbound,         in    turn,    argues    that    AccuSoft     is\n\nentitled to recover none of its fees and costs, because, in\n\n\n                                            -71-\n\fdetermining the “reasonableness” of the fee award, the master\n\nshould have considered AccuSoft's failure to obtain any of the\n\nrelief it sought.           Snowbound also argues that, because the\n\nmaster     should    have    found     AccuSoft    to    have     breached    the\n\nagreement, Snowbound should have received an award of attorneys'\n\nfees.\n\n            We see no reason to disturb the master's conclusion\n\nthat, under the terms of the settlement agreement, a party may\n\nrecover fees for prosecuting a contempt action but may not\n\nrecover fees incurred in defending against a claim of contempt.\n\nThe     language     of    the   settlement      agreement       supports     this\n\ninterpretation       and    AccuSoft     has    provided    no    precedent     or\n\nextrinsic evidence that casts any doubt on its correctness.                     On\n\nthe other hand, we find merit in Snowbound's contention that the\n\nmaster should have given consideration to AccuSoft's success (or\n\nlack    thereof)     in    determining    the   amount     of    fees   it   could\n\nrecover.\n\n            In doing so we acknowledge that, when a contractual fee\n\nprovision is included by the parties, the question of what fees\n\nare owed “is ultimately one of contract interpretation,” and our\n\nprimary obligation is simply to honor the agreement struck by\n\nthe parties.        MIF Realty, L.P. v. Fineberg, 989 F. Supp. 400,\n\n402 (D. Mass. 1998); see also United States v. Western States\n\n\n                                       -72-\n\fMech. Contractors, Inc., 834 F.2d 1533, 1548 (10th Cir. 1987)\n\n(noting that “where contracting parties have agreed that a\n\nbreaching party will be liable for attorneys' fees, the purpose\n\nof the award [of such fees] is to give the parties the benefit\n\nof that bargain, and the court's responsibility is to enforce\n\nthat bargain”).       We are also aware of precedent suggesting that\n\nthe court's discretion in awarding fees is more limited where\n\nthe parties have specifically agreed that fees will be paid\n\nunder certain circumstances.             See Cable Marine v. M/V Trust, 632\n\nF.2d 1344, 1345 (5th Cir. 1980) (“Where attorney's fees are\n\nprovided by contract, a trial court does not possess the same\n\ndegree of equitable discretion to deny such fees as it has\n\napplying     a    statute      providing      for   a   discretionary     award.”);\n\nWestern States, 834 F.2d at 1548 (“Normally, where the court is\n\nmerely enforcing a contractual provision authorizing attorney's\n\nfees, the fees are routinely awarded . . . .”).\n\n             Nonetheless, we find nothing in precedent to suggest\n\nthat   the       master    could      properly      exclude       consideration    of\n\nAccuSoft's       overall       success   as    a    factor   in    determining    the\n\nappropriateness           of    its    fee     award.         To    the   contrary,\n\nMassachusetts law suggests that success is a factor that must be\n\nconsidered when fixing the fees to be awarded pursuant to a\n\ncontractual provision.            In First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Brink,\n\n\n                                         -73-\n\f361 N.E.2d 406, 410-11 (Mass. 1977), for example, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts specifically approved the trial\n\ncourt's application, in determining a fee award pursuant to a\n\ncontractual provision, of the factors set forth in Cummings v.\n\nNat'l Shawmut Bank, 188 N.E. 489, 492 (Mass. 1934).             These\n\nfactors include “the ability and reputation of the attorney, the\n\ndemand for his services by others, the amount and importance of\n\nthe matter involved, the time spent, the prices usually charged\n\nfor   similar   services   by    other   attorneys   in   the   same\n\nneighborhood, the amount of money or the value of the property\n\naffected by controversy, and the results secured.”        Cummings,\n\n188 N.E. at 492 (emphasis added).         Other opinions applying\n\nMassachusetts law appear to reach a similar result.       See, e.g.,\n\nNorthern Heel, 951 F.2d at 476-77 (discussing application of\n\nCummings factors in determining reasonableness of fees awarded\n\nunder contractual provision); MIF Realty, 989 F. Supp. at 402\n\n(same); Taupa Lithuanian Fed. Credit Union v. Bajercius, 1997\n\nMass. App. Div. 31, 32 (same).      Furthermore, even where courts\n\nhave adopted a comparatively narrow view of their discretion\n\nwhere contractual provisions are concerned, they have recognized\n\nthe ability to “adjust or even deny a contractual award of fees\n\nif such an award would be inequitable or unreasonable.”     Western\n\nStates, 834 F.2d at 1548.       This standard has been employed to\n\n\n                                 -74-\n\fdeny the award of fees pursuant to contract when the party has\n\nmet with scant success in its action.                 See Rent It Co. v. Aetna\n\nCas. & Sur. Co., 988 F.2d 88, 91 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that\n\nthe    lower    court    acted   within     its    discretion    in   denying   as\n\n“inequitable and unreasonable” any award of fees “[g]iven the\n\nmore    than    eight-to-one      ratio     of    damages   sought    to   damages\n\nrecovered”).\n\n               In light of this, we believe that the contractual\n\nprovision at issue here is appropriately interpreted to require\n\nconsideration of all relevant factors, including the results\n\nobtained by the parties, in determining the reasonableness of\n\nthe fees requested.             On remand, the district court, or the\n\nmaster, if the order of reference is renewed, should include\n\nthese considerations in determining whether the fee awards are\n\nappropriate in light of the reasoning set forth in this opinion\n\nand the proceedings on remand.              We realize that, as the master\n\nnoted     below,    it    may    not   be     possible      or   appropriate    to\n\ndistinguish the fees associated with successful and unsuccessful\n\nclaims.    We also do not mean to suggest that AccuSoft’s failure\n\nto obtain damages or other requested relief is necessarily fatal\n\nto its claim for attorneys' fees.                Ultimately, the determination\n\nof what fees are properly awarded under this standard lies\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the finder of fact.\n\n\n                                       -75-\n\f           As a final point, we note that AccuSoft has requested\n\nthat it be awarded its fees for these appeals pursuant to\n\nParagraph 16 of the settlement agreement.               Whether, or under\n\nwhat   circumstances,    fees    should     be   awarded      for   appellate\n\nadvocacy pursuant to a contractual agreement “is one largely of\n\njudicial   discretion,    since      the    provision    or    stipulations\n\ninvolved usually do not contain explicit reference to fees on\n\nappeal.”   Robert L. Rossi, Attorney's Fees 492 (1995).               Because\n\nthe question of attorneys' fees will be revisited on remand in\n\nany event, and should properly be evaluated in light of the\n\ndistrict court's final conclusions on remand regarding aspects\n\nof the substantive relief awarded the parties, we instruct\n\nAccuSoft   and   Snowbound      to   make   their   case      for   the   fees\n\nassociated with these appeals at that time.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -76-\n\f                                     IV.\n\n           Our conclusions may be summarized as follows.                 With\n\nrespect to the allocation of the Lifeboat revenues, the decision\n\nof the master is vacated and the matter is remanded for a\n\ndetermination of what royalties, if any, are owed to Snowbound\n\non this income.       In addition, the master's conclusion that\n\nSnowbound's sales of the IFL did not constitute contempt is\n\nvacated   and   the   matter       remanded      for    further   proceedings\n\nconsistent with Part II.B.2.c of this opinion.                On remand, we\n\nfurther direct that the district court address the issue of\n\nwhether   AccuSoft    may   have    been    in   contempt   for   failing   to\n\nmaintain sequential serial numbers of its IFL sales, an issue\n\nthat was not fully resolved below.            Finally, we direct that, on\n\nremand,   the   awards   of   audit    costs      and   attorneys'   fees   be\n\nreconsidered in view of the standards discussed in Part II.C of\n\nthis opinion and changes in the substantive relief obtained by\n\nthe parties on remand.         In all other respects, we affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n           It is so ordered.        No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -77-\n\f",

Plaintiff-appellant AccuSoft\n\nCorporation (“AccuSoft”) and Defendants-appellees James Palo,\n\nSimon Wieczner and Snowbound Software appeal from the district\n\ncourt's rulings on cross-petitions for civil contempt arising\n\nout     of   alleged   breaches    of        a    1996   settlement   agreement\n\nestablishing their respective rights in a piece of computer\n\nsoftware.      The district court, adopting the conclusions of a\n\nspecial      master,   agreed   with     AccuSoft        that   the   Defendants\n\nbreached the settlement agreement, awarding AccuSoft $149,000 in\n\nattorneys' fees, but no damages, while finding in Defendants'\n\nfavor with respect to $178,000 in unpaid royalties they claimed\n\nwere owed under the agreement.          For the reasons discussed below,\n\nwe affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                        I.\n\n             Plaintiff AccuSoft is a corporation engaged in the\n\nimage    processing     software   business.             Defendants    Palo   and\n\nWieczner are former associates of AccuSoft and the current\n\nowners of Snowbound Software (“Snowbound”), a corporation that\n\ncompetes with AccuSoft in the image processing software market.\n\nThe events relevant to this appeal began in 1992 when Palo, a\n\nsoftware designer and developer, was engaged by AccuSoft to\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fdevelop         a     library    or    toolkit      of     software    routines         for\n\nmanipulating computer images.                      Pursuant to a contract with\n\nAccuSoft,           Palo    agreed    to    provide      the    software    product     to\n\nAccuSoft, along with an exclusive right to distribute it for one\n\nyear, in return for a percentage of the sales revenue.                           AccuSoft\n\nand   Palo          subsequently      extended     this    agreement       and   made   it\n\nautomatically renewable for additional one-year periods.\n\n                The software developed by Palo was brought to market\n\nby AccuSoft in 1992 as the Image Format Library (“IFL”) and\n\nbecame AccuSoft's principal product.                           In 1993, Wieczner was\n\nhired by AccuSoft to direct the sales and marketing program for\n\nthe IFL.            AccuSoft's and Wieczner's efforts to market the IFL\n\nwere apparently successful; by 1995, the IFL had a significant\n\nshare      of       the    relevant    market      and    produced    gross      revenues\n\ntotaling $3.2 million.\n\n                Despite this success, AccuSoft's relationship with Palo\n\nand Wieczner began to deteriorate during 1995.                       By January 1996,\n\nboth Palo and Wieczner had terminated their association with\n\nAccuSoft.           Subsequently, Palo notified AccuSoft of his intent to\n\nend his licensing agreement with AccuSoft, effective January 31,\n\n1996.      On January 22, 1996, Palo registered a copyright for the\n\nIFL   in    his       name    with    the    United      States    Copyright      Office.\n\nShortly thereafter, Palo and Wieczner founded their own company,\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fSnowbound Software, and offered for sale a product called the\n\nRasterMaster Library which, they acknowledge, was essentially\n\nthe same as the version of IFL then being marketed by AccuSoft.\n\nIn February 1996, AccuSoft also registered a copyright for the\n\nIFL software.1\n\n            On March 5, 1996, AccuSoft filed a complaint in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\nagainst   Palo,   Wieczner   and   Snowbound   alleging,   inter   alia,\n\ncopyright infringement, breach of contract and misappropriation\n\nof proprietary information.        The same day, Palo also filed a\n\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Massachusetts against AccuSoft and Scott Warner, AccuSoft's\n\npresident and founder, asserting similar claims.            Each party\n\nsubsequently moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the\n\nother from using or selling the disputed software and from\n\nmaking public statements concerning their ownership of the IFL.\n\nThe two actions were consolidated before Judge Gorton on April\n\n24, 1996.\n\n\n\n\n    1     The fact that both parties were able to register\ncopyrights in the IFL software -- an element of the background\nwhich we draw from Judge Gorton's opinion -- strikes us as\nunusual and we find nothing in the record of the present case to\nexplain how this occurred. However, it does not appear to bear\ndirectly on the issues presented by these appeals.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           In a published ruling on the motions for injunctive\n\nrelief, AccuSoft Corp. v.    Palo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1946637\"><a href=\"/opinion/1946637/accusoft-corp-v-palo/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Mass.\n\n1996), the district court concluded that Palo was likely to\n\nsucceed on his claim that he was the author of most or all of\n\nthe code contained in the IFL, and thus the rightful copyright\n\nowner.    However, Judge Gorton found that AccuSoft would likely\n\nsucceed in demonstrating that the agreement between AccuSoft and\n\nPalo transferred to AccuSoft an exclusive right to distribute\n\nproducts derived from the codes and that this right could be\n\nterminated only by mutual consent of the parties.       Based on\n\nthese findings, Judge Gorton issued a preliminary injunction\n\nwhich effectively prohibited either company from distributing\n\nits product and barred all parties from making public statements\n\nconcerning ownership of the software until the trial on the\n\nmerits.\n\n           It was in this context that the parties, on the eve of\n\ntrial, signed a confidential agreement settling the case.    The\n\nagreement was filed under seal and was approved and incorporated\n\ninto an order of the district court dated June 7, 1996.      The\n\nagreement sought to establish the respective rights of the\n\nparties in the IFL code, providing generally for a transfer of\n\nthose rights to Palo/Snowbound but allowing AccuSoft to continue\n\nto license the IFL through August 31, 1996 at specified royalty\n\n\n                               -5-\n\frates.     During this transitional period, it was AccuSoft's\n\nintent to finish developing and begin marketing a replacement\n\nproduct, dubbed “ImageGear,” which was not based on the IFL\n\ncode.      The   settlement     agreement       also    set    forth    detailed\n\nrequirements concerning the public statements that could be made\n\nby the parties with respect to ownership of the IFL, established\n\ncertain requirements for record-keeping, and allowed Palo access\n\nto AccuSoft's records for the purpose of conducting audits to\n\ndetermine whether appropriate royalty payments were being paid.\n\nPursuant   to    the   order,   the     court   retained      jurisdiction     to\n\nenforce the agreement's terms.\n\n           Less than two months later, on July 30, 1996, AccuSoft\n\nfiled a motion for contempt in the district court, alleging\n\nnumerous    violations     of   the     settlement       agreement's      public\n\ndisclosure and confidentiality provisions by Palo, Wieczner and\n\nSnowbound (referred to hereafter collectively as “Snowbound”).\n\nAs relief for Snowbound's alleged contempt, AccuSoft sought an\n\norder    directing     Snowbound   to    comply    with    the    agreement,    a\n\ndetermination     that   AccuSoft     was   excused     from     making   future\n\nroyalty payments under the agreement as a result of Snowbound's\n\nbreach,    and   an    unspecified      monetary       penalty.        Snowbound\n\nsubsequently filed a cross-motion for contempt, alleging non-\n\npayment of royalties due under the agreement, violations of the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fagreement's public disclosure provisions, and non-compliance\n\nwith the agreement's requirements regarding record-keeping and\n\nthe form of licenses that AccuSoft could issue.\n\n            By order of reference dated August 16, 1996, Judge\n\nGorton    referred      the    contempt   motions      and   “related     motions”\n\narising    out    of   the     same   dispute   to     special   master    Michael\n\nKeating.     Nearly two years of proceedings before the master\n\nensued,    during      which    the   master    held    evidentiary      hearings,\n\narranged for an outside audit of AccuSoft's books by Richard L.\n\nEisner & Co., LLP (“Eisner”)2 to determine AccuSoft's compliance\n\nwith royalty obligations, and responded to a steady stream of\n\ninterlocutory motions emanating from both parties.\n\n            The     master's      conclusions        concerning    the    matters\n\nreferred to him were subsequently set forth in a series of\n\nmemoranda.       The first such memorandum concerned the dispute over\n\nroyalties owed by AccuSoft to Snowbound for licensing of the\n\nIFL, referred to by the parties as the “audit phase” of the\n\ncase.    Based on testimony from the parties and from the master's\n\n\n\n    2     Prior to the master's involvement, Palo engaged Newburg\n& Company, LLP (“Newburg”) to conduct an audit pursuant to the\nsettlement agreement.     According to Snowbound, Newburg had\nsignificant difficulty obtaining the information it sought from\nAccuSoft, although a report summarizing Newburg's findings was\ncompleted and submitted to Snowbound in November, 1996.\nAccuSoft apparently disputed the conclusions of the Newburg\naudit.\n\n                                        -7-\n\findependent auditor, the master concluded that Accusoft had\n\nfailed in a number of instances to pay royalties owed under the\n\nagreement, by a total amount later determined to be $178,000,\n\nexclusive of interest.3         At the same time, the master concluded\n\nthat the terms of the settlement agreement precluded Snowbound\n\nfrom collecting other royalty sums it believed it was owed.\n\n           The remaining substantive allegations in the contempt\n\npetitions were disposed of in a second memorandum.                 Here, the\n\nmaster rejected all of Snowbound's allegations of contemptuous\n\nconduct by AccuSoft, generally finding that although AccuSoft\n\nhad at times engaged in “sharp practices” in an effort to\n\nmaximize   its    benefits      under    the   settlement    agreement,    its\n\nactions were not prohibited by the agreement with sufficient\n\nspecificity      to   support    a   finding    of   civil   contempt.      By\n\ncontrast, the master found that many public statements made by\n\nSnowbound in the period immediately following settlement were\n\nsufficiently     clear     violations     of   the   agreement's   terms    to\n\nconstitute    contempt.         Nonetheless,     the   master   declined    to\n\nprovide    the    relief    AccuSoft     requested,    finding:    (1)    that\n\nAccuSoft had adduced no grounds justifying rescission of the\n\nagreement or otherwise excusing AccuSoft from its obligation to\n\n\n\n     3    The master calculated the interest, as of May 31, 1998,\nto be approximately $40,000.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpay royalties after the date of Snowbound’s breaches of the\n\nagreement; and (2) that AccuSoft had not demonstrated that it\n\nsuffered monetary damages as a result of Snowbound's breaches.\n\n           Finally, the master issued several brief memoranda\n\nconcerning the allocation of the audit costs and attorneys' fees\n\nand related litigation costs.    All costs of the audit ($25,000)\n\nwere charged to AccuSoft, pursuant to the settlement agreement\n\nitself, which established a sliding scale for apportioning audit\n\ncosts based on the degree of underpayment identified.   However,\n\nAccuSoft was awarded in excess of $149,000 in attorneys' fees\n\n(plus an unspecified amount of interest) under a provision of\n\nthe agreement the master interpreted as allowing a party proving\n\nbreach to recover its fees for prosecuting a contempt motion,\n\neven if no substantive damages were recovered.\n\n           The master's final submission to the district court,\n\nwhich included all of the above memoranda, was made on October\n\n5, 1998.   On April 5, 1999, following a further round of motions\n\nby the parties challenging various of the conclusions contained\n\nin the master's consolidated report, Judge Gorton adopted the\n\nreport in full.   These appeals followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f            On    appeal,   the       parties    challenge      aspects   of    the\n\nmaster's conclusions4 with respect to each of the three classes\n\nof issues that the master addressed: royalties; contempt; and\n\nallocation       of   attorneys'      fees     and   costs.      AccuSoft      also\n\nchallenges an interlocutory ruling of the master limiting the\n\nscope of discovery during hearings on the contempt issue.                        In\n\nthe interest of consistency, we follow the master's categorical\n\ndivision of the issues, discussing the interlocutory ruling as\n\npart of our review of the master's disposition of the parties'\n\nsubstantive allegations of contempt.                      Within categories, we\n\norder the subjects with an eye toward clear exposition of the\n\nissues and logical development of our conclusions.\n\nA.          Royalties Owed to Snowbound\n\n            Both parties ask us to revisit the master's assessment\n\nof   the   royalties     owed    by    AccuSoft      to    Snowbound   under    the\n\nsettlement agreement.           Snowbound asserts two claims of error:\n\n(1) that the master misinterpreted relevant contract language in\n\ndeciding that AccuSoft was entitled to retain the entirety of\n\nlicensing fees it received after August 31, 1996, pursuant to\n\n\n      4   In the analysis that follows, we refer to the\nconclusions below as those of the master. Because the master's\nconclusions were adopted without exception by the district\ncourt, they are equivalent to rulings of the district court\nitself for purposes of our review. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)\n(“The findings of a master, to the extent a court adopts them,\nshall be considered as the findings of the court.”).\n\n                                        -10-\n\fpre-existing agreements with America OnLine (“AOL”) and Lexis-\n\nNexis; and (2) that the master improperly allowed AccuSoft to\n\npay royalties on only a portion of the income received from\n\nlicenses that included both the IFL and AccuSoft's replacement\n\nproduct, ImageGear.              AccuSoft, for its part, asks us to reverse\n\nthe    master's         decision    to    award    to    Snowbound    all     revenues\n\nreceived after August 31, 1996 pursuant to an agreement with\n\nLifeboat Japan, Inc. on the ground that this conclusion is\n\nunsupported by either the settlement agreement or applicable\n\nlaw.\n\n                 Our consideration of the foregoing matters is governed\n\nby    familiar      standards       of   review.        To   the   extent     that   the\n\nquestions presented turn on the language of the settlement\n\nagreement or other contracts, we have considerable freedom to\n\ndraw       our    own     conclusions,     guided       by   the   language    of    the\n\nagreement, the circumstances of its formation and its purposes\n\n--     “in       brief,     by   the     usual    considerations       of     contract\n\ninterpretation.”            AMF v.

Income from AOL and Lexis-Nexis\n\n            In April 1994, AccuSoft entered into an agreement with\n\nAOL to license the IFL software for distribution as a component\n\nof AOL's software products.            This agreement was amended by the\n\nparties in July 1995.       The amendment provided that AOL's license\n\nwould   run   for    a   period   of    one    year   from   the   amendment's\n\neffective date (July 1, 1995), and, thereafter, would renew for\n\nadditional one-year periods automatically, at specified royalty\n\nrates, unless terminated by the parties.              AOL continued to make\n\npayments, and neither party moved to terminate the agreement,\n\nwith the result that the license continued in effect after\n\nAugust 31, 1996.         During the “audit phase” of this case, both\n\nSnowbound and AccuSoft asserted that the revenue stream issuing\n\nfrom this agreement after August 31, 1996, belonged to it under\n\nthe settlement agreement.\n\n            In February 1995, AccuSoft entered into a licensing\n\nagreement     with   Lexis-Nexis       which    permitted    Lexis-Nexis    to\n\n“distribute, lease and market” the IFL as a component of the\n\nprograms used to access Lexis-Nexis' services.                An addendum to\n\nthe agreement, signed the same day, specified that the agreement\n\nwould initially terminate in December 1995, but that Lexis-Nexis\n\ncould, at its option, extend the agreement for a second and then\n\na third year by paying stated amounts before the end of each\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fprior year.    It also provided that Lexis-Nexis could, by paying\n\nan additional amount before the end of the second year, convert\n\nthe license to a “perpetual, fully paid-up license” effective\n\nJanuary 1, 1998.         In January 1997, Lexis-Nexis paid AccuSoft\n\n$35,000, representing the $25,000 annual renewal for the 1997\n\ncalendar year and the $10,000 specified for converting the\n\nlicense to a perpetual license.              Both AccuSoft and Snowbound\n\nargued before the master that this income belonged to it under\n\nthe settlement agreement.\n\n            In his memorandum, the master ruled that AccuSoft was\n\nentitled to retain the entirety of both the AOL revenue stream\n\nand the Lexis-Nexis payments, because the settlement agreement\n\ndid not affect the continuation of licensing agreements already\n\nin effect on June 5, 1996 -- when the settlement agreement was\n\nsigned -- nor did it provide for royalties to be paid on such\n\nlicenses.     The master noted that nothing in the settlement\n\nagreement    expressly     addressed     the   continuation        of   existing\n\nlicenses.    He also found nothing in the agreement to implicitly\n\nrequire their termination or transfer to Snowbound.                     Although\n\nthe   settlement     agreement       clearly    did    transfer       AccuSoft's\n\ncopyright     in   the    IFL   to   Snowbound,       the    master     accepted\n\nAccuSoft's contention that a non-exclusive license issued by\n\nAccuSoft    before   the    settlement       agreement      was   signed   would\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fcontinue in effect under 17 U.S.C. § 204(e).7                 The master also\n\nagreed   with   AccuSoft           that   the    language   accomplishing    the\n\ntransfer of copyright did not transfer AccuSoft's collateral\n\ncontractual     rights        in    existing     IFL   licensing     agreements,\n\nincluding the right to receive payment under such agreements.\n\n          Turning        to        the    AOL    and   Lexis-Nexis    licensing\n\nagreements, the master found in each case that the agreements\n\nconstituted continuing licenses, rejecting Snowbound's argument\n\nthat the renewal of the licenses was tantamount to issuance of\n\na “new” license after August 31, 1996.                 The master interpreted\n\nthe AOL agreement to create, in effect, a perpetual license,\n\nconditioned only on payment, that would continue “unless and\n\nuntil an affirmative act is done by either AccuSoft or AOL which\n\nbreaks the continuity of the license.”                  Similarly, the Lexis-\n\nNexis agreement “continue[d] in effect from the date of the\n\nAddendum . . . without a new grant or extension of rights.”                   On\n\nthis basis, the master ruled that AccuSoft could retain any and\n\nall revenues resulting from annual renewals of the AOL agreement\n\n\n\n    7     This section provides, in pertinent part, that “a\nnonexclusive license, whether recorded or not, prevails over a\nconflicting transfer of copyright if the license is evidenced by\na written instrument signed by the owner of the rights licensed\n. . . and . . . the license was taken before execution of the\ntransfer.” 17 U.S.C. § 204(e). Nothing in Snowbound’s appeal\nsuggests that Snowbound disputes the applicability of this\nstatute or the import of its application.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fafter August 31, 1996, as well as the entirety of the January\n\n1997 payment from Lexis-Nexis.\n\n          On appeal, Snowbound's principal contention is that the\n\nmaster   improperly        interpreted     the     settlement    agreement.\n\nSnowbound admits that there is a “lack of pertinent language” in\n\nthe settlement agreement, but argues that “the entire tenor of\n\nthe Settlement Agreement is that after August 31, 1996, AccuSoft\n\nwas to have no further dealings of any kind with the IFL”\n\n(emphasis added).       Snowbound also notes that the settlement\n\nagreement provided for royalty payments to be made to Snowbound,\n\nand that AccuSoft had paid royalties to Palo on IFL sales even\n\nbefore   the    settlement    agreement     was    signed.      Given     this\n\n“historical     and   contractual    context,”      Snowbound   argues,     it\n\n“makes no sense . . . to infer that Palo intended AccuSoft to\n\nkeep the entirety of [the income from AOL and Lexis-Nexis].”\n\nTaking a different tack, Snowbound also argues that the AOL\n\nagreement, at least, is not properly viewed as a continuing\n\nlicense, because its terms allow AccuSoft to terminate upon 120\n\ndays notice for any reason.\n\n          We are not persuaded to adopt the interpretation of the\n\nsettlement     agreement    that   Snowbound      proposes.     As   we   have\n\npreviously stated, when sophisticated business entities enter\n\ninto a settlement agreement, they “rely upon and have a right to\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fexpect a fairly literal interpretation of the bargain that was\n\nstruck and approved by the court.”             Jewett, 711 F.2d at 1101.\n\nWe have also made clear that we do not consider it our place to\n\n“rewrite contracts freely entered into between sophisticated\n\nbusiness entities.”       Mathewson Corp. v.

It is also\n\nundisputed that the settlement agreement does not, by its terms,\n\neither terminate pre-existing licenses issued by AccuSoft or\n\ntransfer collateral contractual benefits resulting from existing\n\nlicensing agreements to Snowbound.            Under such circumstances, we\n\nconsider it “far wiser for a court to honor the parties' words\n\nthan to imply other and further promises out of thin air.”                 Id.\n\n             We are particularly loath to do so given the conclusory\n\narguments advanced by Snowbound in favor of its interpretation.\n\nWe do not consider it obvious that the master's decision is\n\ncontrary to the “entire tenor” of the agreement, and Snowbound\n\nprovides     nothing   beyond   its    bare    assertion   to   convince   us\n\notherwise.      While Snowbound's contention that it “makes no\n\nsense” to infer that Palo/Snowbound intended that these revenues\n\nshould pass to AccuSoft royalty-free strikes us as plausible, it\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fis also irrelevant to our analysis.

Furthermore, we note the\n\nmaster's finding that Palo knew of at least the AOL licensing\n\nagreement during settlement negotiations, which Snowbound does\n\nnot dispute.     Under such circumstances, Snowbound took the risk\n\nthat its unspoken understanding was incorrect and thus was not\n\nentitled to rest on this unilateral belief that future rights\n\nassociated with the AOL agreement were comprehended in the\n\nlanguage of the settlement agreement.\n\n            Finally, we find no merit in Snowbound's argument that\n\nthe AOL license renewal constituted a “new” license simply\n\nbecause   it    was     subject   to    termination       at   either      party's\n\ndiscretion.     We do not agree that the fact that AccuSoft could\n\nhave terminated its agreement with AOL, but did not, amounts to\n\nthe same thing as the affirmative grant of a new license.                       As\n\npreviously     noted,    the   settlement     agreement        did   not   oblige\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fAccuSoft to terminate the license; AccuSoft therefore did not\n\nviolate the agreement by taking no action.\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the master's\n\ndecision with respect to the revenues received under the AOL and\n\nLexis-Nexis licensing agreements.\n\n         2.       Allocation of Split Licenses\n\n         In June and July 1996, AccuSoft entered into licensing\n\nagreements with Aimtech Corporation (“Aimtech”), NetObjects,\n\nInc.   (“NetObjects”),      and      Caere     Corporation    (“Caere”)\n\n(collectively “licensees”), granting the recipients the right to\n\ndistribute, as part of their software products, both the IFL and\n\nAccuSoft's    successor   product,       ImageGear.    Each   agreement\n\nincluded a provision allocating the licensing fee between the\n\ntwo products.    The provision stated that the portion of the fee\n\nassociated with the IFL license was based on specified estimates\n\n(these estimates apparently came from the customers) concerning\n\nthe number of copies of the IFL that would be sold.                 The\n\nremainder of the licensing fee was for an unlimited license to\n\nuse ImageGear.\n\n         At the hearing before the master, Snowbound argued\n\nthat, although the agreements recited this allocation of the\n\nlicensing fees between the two products, other language in the\n\nagreements suggested that the licensees were not obligated to\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\flimit their IFL sales to the levels on which the fee allocation\n\nwas based.8    The NetObjects agreement, for example, stated that\n\n“[t]his is a fully paid up license fee and no additional fees\n\nare due from Customer during the term of this Agreement,” and\n\nalso provided that “[t]he fees under this agreement are not\n\nreturnable.”     Snowbound    contended      that   this   language,   and\n\nsimilar language in the other agreements, suggested that the\n\nlicensees effectively obtained unlimited licenses to the IFL and\n\nwere not bound by the allocations.         Snowbound also asserted that\n\nit was not clear that the licensees had ever in fact switched to\n\nusing ImageGear.     On the basis of these arguments, Snowbound\n\nclaimed the entirety of the licensing fee from each agreement.\n\nAccuSoft, for its part, contended that the license allocations\n\nwere intended to be enforceable and presented testimony of its\n\nofficers   stating   that    they    believed   the   allocations      were\n\nenforceable when they signed the agreements.\n\n           In his memorandum, the master rejected Snowbound's\n\nposition with minimal analysis, stating, without elaboration,\n\nthat “in the absence of language in the Settlement Agreement\n\nthat addresses this issue . . . Palo has not established a right\n\n\n     8    Snowbound also argues that these licensing agreements\nviolated provisions of the settlement agreement prescribing the\nform of licenses AccuSoft could issue and therefore constituted\ncontempt of the court's order. We review this assertion in Part\nB.1.b, infra.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fto claim all of the income in these distribution licenses as\n\n[income     subject     to    the     settlement     agreement's     royalty\n\nprovisions].”         The    master   then   directed     AccuSoft    to   pay\n\nroyalties based on the portion of the license fees allocated to\n\nthe IFL in each agreement.            On appeal, Snowbound presses its\n\npoint that this conclusion is incorrect “because there was no\n\nevidence in the record that the licensees ever used any product\n\nother than the IFL, or ever restrained their use of the IFL to\n\nthe numbers stated in the nominal 'allocations.'”\n\n            Although the master's decision is short on detailed\n\nanalysis,    we   believe      that   his    conclusion    concerning      the\n\nroyalties owed by AccuSoft withstands Snowbound's challenges.\n\nIn so deciding, we need not, and do not, decide the questions of\n\ninterpretation pressed by Snowbound.               Even assuming     arguendo\n\nthat Snowbound is right that the allocations contained in the\n\nlicenses were not enforceable, we conclude that Snowbound would\n\nnot be entitled to additional royalties unless the licensees\n\nactually sold more products containing the IFL than were set\n\nforth in the allocations.             As Snowbound itself argues, the\n\nsettlement agreement included as Exhibit B a per-copy price list\n\nintended to govern AccuSoft's sales of the IFL through August\n\n31, 1996.    Our review of the three agreements indicates that the\n\nportion of the licensing fee allocated to the IFL in each\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fagreement accurately incorporates the applicable per-copy price.\n\nIf   that        allocation    were    honored,   we   find     nothing   in    the\n\nsettlement agreement to suggest that Snowbound is entitled to\n\nany more than the appropriate royalty on the allocation amount,\n\nwhich is precisely what the master ordered.9\n\n                 Snowbound points to no evidence in the record that\n\ndemonstrates that the allocations were not honored.                       In its\n\nbrief, Snowbound attempts to place the burden on AccuSoft on\n\nthis point, claiming that there is “no evidence in the record”\n\nthat the licensees kept to the allocation limits.                   However, it\n\nwas plainly Snowbound's burden to introduce evidence indicating\n\nthat       the    allocation    limits    were    exceeded.10      Absent      such\n\nevidence, the master was under no obligation to disregard the\n\nnumbers contained in the agreements in determining the amount of\n\nroyalties due Snowbound.              We therefore affirm.\n\n                 3.    Income from Lifeboat Japan\n\n\n       9  Although Snowbound makes much of the fact that one or\nmore of the licensees never switched to ImageGear, that fact, by\nitself, is irrelevant to whether Snowbound was appropriately\npaid for IFL sales.      Aimtech, NetObjects, and Caere were\nentitled to make whatever use they wished, including no use at\nall, of the ImageGear license they purchased simultaneously with\ntheir IFL license.\n       10 Indeed, from our review of the record, it appears that\nSnowbound requested, and was granted, the right to conduct\ndiscovery into the question of how the licensees viewed their\nobligations under the licensing agreements. We find no evidence\nthat Snowbound did so, nor any explanation for why it did not.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f            From   October   1995    until   at    least   February   1997,\n\nLifeboat Japan Inc. (“Lifeboat”) paid licensing fees to AccuSoft\n\nunder an agreement which permitted Lifeboat to sell copies of\n\nthe IFL in the Japanese market in return for a percentage of the\n\nincome on those sales.11          The agreement between AccuSoft and\n\nLifeboat, as initially executed by the parties, ran through July\n\n1996.    However, in April 1996, after AccuSoft and Snowbound had\n\nfiled suit against each other and shortly before Judge Gorton\n\nissued his injunction, AccuSoft extended the arrangement to July\n\n1997.     The   extension    of   the   Lifeboat    agreement   never   was\n\nrevealed to Snowbound during the settlement negotiations that\n\nfollowed.    Indeed, AccuSoft did not acknowledge until March 1997\n\nthat sales by Lifeboat continued past August 31, 1996, having\n\nearlier represented to the master's auditor that Lifeboat's\n\nsales terminated by the cutoff date.\n\n            The issue before us centers on the disposition of\n\nrevenues resulting from Lifeboat's sales of the IFL after August\n\n31, 1996.   In the proceedings below, AccuSoft argued that it was\n\n\n\n    11    AccuSoft appears to dispute, to some degree, the\ncharacterization of Lifeboat as a “reseller,” and points to\nstatements in the record to the effect that Lifeboat actually\nsold its own product incorporating the IFL. Nothing identified\nby AccuSoft is adequate to cause us to disturb the master’s\nfactual finding that Lifeboat is properly characterized as a\nreseller and we adopt that characterization in the analysis that\nfollows.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fentitled to the entirety of this income, advancing the same\n\nargument that it made, successfully, with respect to income\n\nresulting from the AOL and Lexis-Nexis licensing agreements\n\nafter the cutoff.       See supra.     In the case of Lifeboat, however,\n\nthe master reached a different result.                 The master found that\n\nAccuSoft's      conduct     surrounding       the    Lifeboat          extension   --\n\nprincipally,     AccuSoft's     failure       to    reveal    its      existence   to\n\nSnowbound -- violated an implied duty of good faith and fair\n\ndealing      imposed   on   AccuSoft    as    a     party    to   the     settlement\n\nagreement.12     In support of this conclusion the master noted that\n\nthe extension was executed “at a time when Palo was challenging\n\nAccuSoft's rights in court.”            In addition, the master pointed\n\nout   that    Lifeboat's     ability    as    a     reseller      to    continue   to\n\n\n\n      12  In the interest of completeness, we note that the\nmaster’s report appears to advance a second argument for\nallocating the Lifeboat revenues to Snowbound; an argument that\nSnowbound briefly references on appeal. The master begins from\nthe fact that, in his interpretation, the settlement agreement\ntransferred all of AccuSoft’s ownership interest in the IFL to\nSnowbound.   From that, the master reasons that AccuSoft’s\nactivities with respect to the IFL must be limited to those\nactions expressly “given back” under the settlement agreement.\nWe find little support for this argument in the settlement\nagreement.   Indeed, as discussed in Part II.B.2.c of this\nopinion, we believe that the settlement agreement did not\ntransfer “ownership” of the IFL to Snowbound. In addition, we\nfind it difficult to square this analysis with the master’s\nallocation of the AOL and Lexis-Nexis revenues to AccuSoft –\noutcomes that were plainly not provided for in the settlement\nagreement. For both reasons, we reject this as an alternative\nground supporting the master’s conclusion.\n\n                                       -24-\n\fdistribute      the   IFL    as    a   stand-alone       product      “absolutely\n\ncontradict[ed]”       the    “express      intention”     of    the    settlement\n\nagreement that “all distribution [of the IFL] by or through\n\nAccuSoft will cease on August 31, 1996.”                       Because of this\n\nviolation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, the master\n\nconcluded that AccuSoft should not be allowed to retain the\n\nLifeboat income, and determined that the entirety of the income\n\nresulting from sales after August 31, 1996, must be paid to\n\nPalo.\n\n              On appeal, AccuSoft argues that the master erroneously\n\nused    the    duty   of    good   faith    and   fair    dealing      to   create\n\nobligations that exist nowhere in the agreement between the\n\nparties.       While sympathetic to the master's frustration with\n\nAccuSoft's lack of candor, we must agree.                The implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing between parties to a contract\n\nprovides that “neither party shall do anything that will have\n\nthe effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other\n\nparty to receive the fruits of the contract.”                  Druker v.

Equally clear from\n\nthis   definition    is    that     the   requirement   of     good-faith\n\nperformance ultimately is circumscribed by the obligations --\n\nthe contractual “fruits” -- actually contained in the agreement.\n\nSee LeBlanc, 85 F.3d at 822 (holding that an obligation to\n\nnegotiate subsequent agreements in good faith would not be\n\nimputed under the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing\n\nwhere the original agreement included no such requirement).\n\n           The master's application of the duty of good faith and\n\nfair dealing cannot be squared with the above principles.               As\n\nAccuSoft   notes,   the   master's    opinion   acknowledges    that   the\n\nsettlement agreement simply does not address the continuation of\n\npre-existing agreements.          To the extent this is an accurate\n\ninterpretation of the contract, we do not see how good faith\n\nperformance could nonetheless require AccuSoft to surrender the\n\nincome on certain such agreements.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f              We   need     not,   however,    decide   this   question   of\n\ncontractual interpretation as the master's rationale fails on a\n\nnarrower ground.          It is undisputed that AccuSoft's extension of\n\nthe Lifeboat agreement occurred before the settlement agreement\n\nwas signed.        Therefore, neither execution of the extension nor\n\nAccuSoft's silence about it while negotiating the settlement\n\nagreement can form the basis for a violation of the duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.            No one has suggested that AccuSoft's\n\nmere continued silence after the settlement agreement was signed\n\nconstituted a violation of the duty.13           Since we find no evidence\n\nidentified in the record on which a violation of the covenant of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing could rest, the master's conclusion\n\ncannot be supported on the legal grounds offered.\n\n              In its motion papers, Snowbound proposes an alternative\n\nground for affirming the master's conclusion which we believe\n\nmerits    a    response.14         Snowbound   contends   that   AccuSoft's\n\n\n     13   We find nothing in the settlement agreement that would\nrequire AccuSoft to disclose the existence of the extension.\nFurthermore, we do not see how disclosure after the settlement\nagreement was signed could have in any way affected Snowbound's\nability to obtain the fruits of the agreement. The terms of the\nsettlement agreement, including its failure to adequately\naddress pre-existing agreements like Lifeboat's, were at that\npoint fixed.\n     14   Yet another contention, raised by Snowbound's counsel\nat oral argument, is that Snowbound might be entitled to\nroyalties on the Lifeboat agreement pursuant to a pre-existing\nroyalty agreement between the present parties.      Given that\n\n                                      -27-\n\fnondisclosure of the Lifeboat extension violated a warranty\n\nprovision of the Assignment of Copyright, which stated, in\n\npertinent part:\n\n           AccuSoft represents and warrants to the best\n           of its knowledge, that it has made no\n           transfer, assignment, or license (other than\n           non-exclusive licenses in the ordinary\n           course of business) with respect to the\n           Software or any part thereof . . . .\n\nIn   Snowbound's       view,   AccuSoft's     “premature   extension    of\n\nLifeboat's distributorship, made days before an anticipated\n\nruling from the court that could have terminated AccuSoft's\n\nright to sell the IFL for good,” cannot be considered to be a\n\nlicense entered into “in the ordinary course of business.”              As\n\na result, AccuSoft was in breach of the warranty from the moment\n\nit was signed.\n\n           Although Snowbound's argument is facially credible,\n\nSnowbound fails to identify record evidence adequate for us to\n\nfind that AccuSoft's extension of the Lifeboat agreement was not\n\nexecuted   in    the    “ordinary    course    of   business.”         The\n\ndetermination of what is or is not comprehended in the phrase\n\n“ordinary course of business” is necessarily fact-specific,\n\ninvolving consideration of all the circumstances of the conduct\n\n\n\nParagraph 18 of the settlement agreement specifically provides\nthat it will “supersede all prior agreements between the parties\nand each and every term thereof,” this argument is unavailing.\n\n                                    -28-\n\for   transaction       at   issue.

In    this\n\ndetermination, the timing of the Lifeboat extension is relevant,\n\nsee id.

Since Snowbound has\n\npointed to no other record evidence supporting its position, we\n\ncannot affirm the master's conclusion on this basis.\n\n           In light of the preceding, we hold that the master's\n\nallocation of the entirety of the Lifeboat revenues to Palo must\n\nbe vacated.          In so doing, however, we acknowledge that this\n\ndetermination does not fully resolve the rights of the parties\n\nin regard to this revenue.

Snowbound's Claims of Error\n\n            Having failed to convince the master to find AccuSoft\n\nin    contempt    of    any   aspect     of   the    settlement    agreement,16\n\nSnowbound, on appeal, reasserts its arguments for several such\n\nclaims.     With but one exception, we find no reason to disturb\n\nthe master's conclusions as adopted by the district court.\n\n            a.         Failure to Find that AccuSoft's Nonpayment of\n                       Royalties and Improper Accounting Practices\n                       Constituted Contempt\n\n            In the proceedings below, Snowbound sought to hold\n\nAccuSoft in contempt for its nonpayment of royalties due under\n\nthe   settlement       agreement   and    what      Snowbound    deemed   to    be\n\nfraudulent       accounting    practices      surrounding       AccuSoft's     IFL\n\nsales.     As previously indicated, the master found that AccuSoft\n\nhad, in several instances, failed to pay royalties owed under\n\nthe settlement agreement.17        The master also found that AccuSoft\n\nhad engaged in certain “sharp practices,” such as initiating\n\n\n\n      16  Here, and in the discussion that follows, we\noccasionally use the phrase “contempt of the settlement\nagreement.” This phrase is employed in the interest of brevity\nas shorthand for “contempt of the court order incorporating the\nsettlement agreement.”\n      17  The total amount of unpaid royalties (less the\nroyalties on improper “returns” discussed below) was later\ncalculated to be approximately $145,000.       Of this, almost\n$122,000 reflected the master's allocation of revenues from the\nLifeboat licensing agreement, an allocation which we have\nconcluded must be vacated.\n\n                                       -34-\n\fexchanges    of   the   IFL    for       AccuSoft's      replacement   product,\n\nImageGear, then seeking to claim a credit for such exchanges as\n\n“returns”    under   Paragraph       1    of     the   settlement   agreement.18\n\nFinally, the master found evidence that AccuSoft had been less\n\nthan forthcoming in responding to the audit that Snowbound had\n\ninitiated pursuant to Paragraph 5 of the settlement agreement.\n\n            Ultimately,       however,          the    master   concluded     that\n\nSnowbound had failed to produce “clear and convincing evidence”\n\nthat    AccuSoft’s   actions     constituted           contempt.    The     master\n\ngrounded his decision principally on language in paragraph 15 of\n\nthe settlement agreement, which states:\n\n            In the event that there is a dispute\n            concerning the amount of AccuSoft's Software\n            Gross Billings19 as provided for herein, the\n            Court shall appoint a Master pursuant to\n            Fed. R. Civ. P. 53. The findings of facts\n            [sic] of the Master shall be final unless\n            clearly erroneous.     The compensation for\n            said Master shall be split equally between\n            the parties.\n\nThe master interpreted this language to create an alternative\n\ndispute resolution process for addressing any “allegations of\n\n\n\n       18 AccuSoft deducted $135,023 in “returns” from the\nroyalty base under this provision, none of which the master\nfound to be properly deductible. The master ultimately found\nthat this resulted in AccuSoft failing to pay $33,481 in\nroyalties due under the agreement.\n       19 The term “Software Gross Billings” is used to identify\nthe revenue base on which royalty amounts are calculated.\n\n                                         -35-\n\fnon-payment or improper accounting” that might arise when the\n\nagreement was implemented.              Because the parties had provided\n\nthis   process,        the   master   reasoned,      nonpayment   or     improper\n\ncalculation       of   royalties      would    not   become   contempt    of   the\n\nsettlement agreement “until and unless either party disregarded\n\nthe Master's findings and order.”\n\n            The master acknowledged that certain conduct attributed\n\nto AccuSoft by Snowbound, including intentional falsification of\n\nrecords to conceal IFL sales, would independently violate the\n\nsettlement agreement and therefore provide a basis for contempt.\n\nHowever, he found that the evidence introduced by Snowbound with\n\nrespect to these activities, including evidence regarding the\n\nimproper “returns” of IFL and inconsistencies in the recording\n\nof certain sales, did not constitute the “clear and convincing\n\nevidence”    of    a    violation     of   a   specific   requirement     of   the\n\nsettlement agreement necessary to support a finding of contempt.\n\nThe master noted that his independent auditor did not find\n\nevidence that AccuSoft had engaged in “purposeful falsification”\n\nof the records.          Furthermore, the master found that, in many\n\ncases, the position AccuSoft took to justify its actions “was\n\nnot without support in the Settlement Agreement,” even if the\n\nmaster ultimately determined that AccuSoft’s approach to the\n\ncalculation of royalties was not correct.\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\f            On appeal, Snowbound argues that the master was wrong\n\nto   conclude     that   the    dispute   resolution         process     insulated\n\nAccuSoft from the contempt sanction unless AccuSoft failed to\n\npay royalties after the master had issued his ruling.                    Snowbound\n\ncontends    that     reading     the    settlement        agreement      this   way\n\neffectively       nullifies     the    payment    deadlines        contained     in\n\nParagraph 5 of the agreement, as AccuSoft could avoid payment\n\n“with impunity” until the master had finally determined the\n\nissue.     According to Snowbound's interpretation, the dispute\n\nresolution provision did not relieve AccuSoft of the obligation\n\nto   pay   royalties     on    the   deadlines    but     merely   provided,     in\n\nadvance, for the mechanism that would be used to determine\n\nwhether a breach of the agreement had occurred.\n\n            Snowbound's argument is not without some force and we\n\nconcede uncertainty as to whether the provision for resolution\n\nof disputes by a master should be read to foreclose all contempt\n\nactions    grounded      in   “non-payment    and       improper    accounting.”\n\nNonetheless, bearing in mind the cautionary principles guiding\n\nexercise     of    the    contempt      sanction        --   particularly       the\n\nrequirement       that   contempt      requires     the      violation     of   “an\n\nunambiguous consent decree that left no reasonable doubt as to\n\nwhat behavior was to be expected,”                Gilday, 124 F.3d at 282\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted) -- we are not prepared to say\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fthat the master's failure to find AccuSoft in contempt for these\n\nactions was an abuse of discretion.\n\n            Snowbound also presses again its claim that AccuSoft\n\nshould be found in contempt because it engaged in deliberate\n\nfalsifications     of   records     and   purposefully    frustrated\n\nSnowbound’s audit in order to avoid paying royalties owed under\n\nthe   settlement   agreement.      However,   Snowbound   adduces   no\n\nevidence that compels us to believe that the master's findings\n\nto the contrary on this point are clearly erroneous.          To the\n\ncontrary, the master's position is amply supported by record\n\nevidence.    We therefore affirm.\n\n            b.     Failure to Find that the AccuSoft's Allocated\n                   Licenses for IFL and ImageGear Constituted\n                   Contempt\n\n            We have previously discussed Snowbound's contention\n\nthat the master improperly calculated royalties due on certain\n\nlicensing agreements which purported to convey licenses to both\n\nthe IFL and AccuSoft's replacement product, ImageGear.              In\n\naddition, Snowbound has asserted that issuance of these licenses\n\nconstituted contempt of Paragraph 5 of the settlement agreement,\n\nwhich states:\n\n            All  distribution   licenses  will   be  at\n            standard published rates in effect prior to\n            May, 1996, a list of which is attached\n            hereto as Exhibit B. If AccuSoft wishes to\n            issue any distribution license on terms not\n            listed on Exhibit B, it will submit those\n\n                                  -38-\n\f               terms . . . to Palo for his written approval\n               . . . .\n\nIn the proceedings below, Snowbound argued that the allocated\n\nlicenses were effectively unlimited licenses because they did\n\nnot create an enforceable limitation on the number of copies of\n\nIFL that could be sold.            As such, they did not conform to the\n\nprice schedule contained in Exhibit B, which established fixed\n\nprices for stated numbers of copies.\n\n               Nothing in the master's memorandum on the contempt\n\nissues directly addresses Snowbound's arguments concerning the\n\nallocated licenses, although the master's determination that the\n\nallocations       were    a   valid   basis       for    calculating     royalties\n\narguably does so by implication.                 On appeal, Snowbound presses\n\nits    claim     that    “issuing     a     license      without   a    clear   and\n\nenforceable legal limitation on the licensee's use of the IFL–a\n\nlimitation       to   standard    amounts        for    standard   prices--was    a\n\nmaterial breach of the agreement” and thus grounds for finding\n\nAccuSoft in contempt.\n\n               Although the master’s failure to address this issue in\n\nstraightforward terms is unfortunate, we do not find that a\n\nremand on this issue is required.                The argument Snowbound makes\n\non    appeal    is    premised    solely    on    language    contained    in   the\n\nlicensing       agreements,      which,    it    claims,    conflicts    with   the\n\nrequirements imposed by the settlement agreement.                        Snowbound\n\n                                          -39-\n\fdoes not refer us to any factual information in the record\n\nbearing on this issue, and, indeed, we find no indication that\n\nany factual information was developed which might shed light on\n\nthis claim, even though Snowbound was given permission to do so.\n\nAs previously noted, the interpretation of settlement agreements\n\nand contracts, where no recourse to negotiating history or other\n\nextrinsic factors is required, is a question of law.              Langton,\n\n928 F.2d at 1220; Fashion House, 892 F.2d at 1083.\n\n            Having reviewed the relevant agreements, we conclude\n\nthat Snowbound has not demonstrated that AccuSoft committed a\n\nbreach of the settlement agreement for which it should be held\n\nin contempt.       First, and despite Snowbound's protestations, it\n\nis not self-evident that the settlement agreement requires that\n\nlicenses issued by AccuSoft contain a “clear and enforceable\n\nlimitation” on the number of copies that can be sold.             We agree\n\nthat the settlement agreement language, reasonably read, would\n\nprohibit issuance of a license that stated a per-copy price for\n\nthe   IFL   that    was   inconsistent      with   the   “published   rates”\n\ncontained in Exhibit B. 20          We would also accept, for present\n\npurposes,    that    a    license    that    unambiguously    conveyed    an\n\nunlimited license for a fixed price would not be “at” the\n\n\n      20  As noted in our previous discussion of the allocated\nlicenses, our review indicates that the per-copy prices recited\nin the three licenses are consistent those set out in Exhibit B.\n\n                                     -40-\n\fExhibit B rates.       It is by no means obvious, however, that a\n\nlicense that stated a proper per-copy price would violate the\n\nsettlement    agreement     simply     because    it   proved     to   be\n\nunenforceable in certain respects.         Nor do we consider it clear\n\nthat the licenses at issue actually permitted the licensees to\n\nsell more copies of the IFL than stated in the allocations.\n\nCertain language, such as that stating the licenses are “fully\n\npaid up,” arguably supports Snowbound’s proposed interpretation.\n\nAt the same time, we find arguable merit in AccuSoft’s response\n\nthat this language referred only to the ImageGear license.             As\n\npreviously    noted,    Snowbound    has   not   introduced     extrinsic\n\nevidence supporting its interpretation of the agreement.\n\n         Given the cautionary principles governing our use of\n\nthe contempt sanction, we consider the unresolved ambiguities in\n\nthe relevant agreements fatal to Snowbound's claim.             Although\n\nthe interpretations Snowbound advances are not illogical, they\n\nfall well short of constituting proof, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, that AccuSoft violated the settlement agreement by\n\nissuing the licenses in question.\n\n         c.       Failure to Find AccuSoft in Contempt Because it\n                  did Not Maintain Records of IFL Sales Using\n                  Sequential Serial Numbers\n\n         As a third ground for contempt, Snowbound alleges that\n\nAccuSoft failed to maintain its records of IFL sales as required\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\fby the last section of Paragraph 5 of the settlement agreement,\n\nwhich states:\n\n            Each AccuSoft sale or license pursuant to\n            this Paragraph will be identified by a\n            serial number, issued sequentially beginning\n            with the number 276745. AccuSoft will keep\n            a list of each sale by serial number, which\n            list will be made available to Palo's\n            independent accountant . . . .\n\nThis    argument     was    raised    below    by   Snowbound,       but,    like\n\nSnowbound's contention that the allocated licenses constituted\n\ncontempt,    was   not     directly   addressed     by   the   master   in    his\n\nmemorandum disposing of the contempt allegations.                    On appeal,\n\nSnowbound asks us to rectify the omission, pointing to language\n\nin one of the master's memoranda on audit costs which, it\n\nargues, constitutes a factual finding that no such records were\n\nkept.   Because it considers the settlement agreement unambiguous\n\nas to this requirement, Snowbound contends that this finding\n\nobligates us to conclude, as a matter of law, that AccuSoft was\n\nin contempt.\n\n            Given the heavy burden of proof our precedent places\n\non a party alleging contempt, we do not agree that the current\n\nrecord provides an adequate basis for resolving the issue in\n\nSnowbound's favor.          The language to which Snowbound refers,\n\nalthough it does state that AccuSoft “failed to maintain” the\n\nsequential    list    of    IFL   sales      required    by    the   settlement\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fagreement, appears in a discussion of the allocation of audit\n\ncosts, contained in a memorandum issued after the master had\n\nruled on the parties' contempt allegations.               It is not clear\n\nthat the master intended the statement to stand as a formal\n\nfinding of fact, and there is certainly no suggestion in the\n\nrecord that it was meant to carry the weight Snowbound would\n\nhave it bear.     Nor can we consider the matter free from dispute,\n\nas AccuSoft points to several exhibits appearing to show that\n\nsequential   serial    numbers,      meeting   the   requirements    of   the\n\nsettlement agreement, were used for at least some IFL sales.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the master's brief statement does not\n\nconstitute proof, by clear and convincing evidence, of contempt.\n\n          At the same time, however, we conclude that we cannot\n\nresolve this matter in AccuSoft's favor either.              The master's\n\nstatement at a minimum indicates that he harbored some doubt\n\nabout AccuSoft's compliance with this requirement.           On the basis\n\nof the current record, we cannot foreclose the possibility that\n\nthe master, once he squarely confronts the issue, might find\n\nthat AccuSoft's failure to comply fully constitutes contempt.\n\nWhile we see comparatively little chance that such contempt, if\n\nproven,   could   be   linked   to    any   significant    damages   --    or\n\nattorneys' fees, given our interpretation of the fee-shifting\n\n\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\fprovision    contained   in   the    agreement    --    we    leave    those\n\ndeterminations to the district court on remand.\n\n            d.    Failure to Find AccuSoft in Contempt on the\n                  Basis of Written and Oral Statements\n\n            Snowbound's final claim of error with respect to the\n\nmaster's contempt rulings is that the master improperly failed\n\nto find AccuSoft in contempt for various statements that it made\n\nto third parties both orally and in writing.           In the proceedings\n\nbelow, Snowbound argued that AccuSoft made numerous statements\n\nthat violated Paragraph 9 of the settlement agreement, which\n\nstates, in pertinent part, that:\n\n            AccuSoft   will  not   hereafter   represent\n            explicitly or in substance to anyone that\n            its forthcoming new image software toolkit .\n            . . ”ImageGear,” is based upon or derived\n            from the Image Format Library.”\n\nAs examples, Snowbound pointed to the fact that AccuSoft's\n\nadvertising materials referred to ImageGear as “Version 6.0\"\n\n(the most recent version of the IFL was 5.0) and as the “new\n\nversion of the AccuSoft Image Format Library.”                     Similarly,\n\nAccuSoft's web page claimed that ImageGear “takes [AccuSoft's]\n\nexisting Image Format Library product to a new level by adding\n\nnew   features,    functions,       flexibility    and       performance.”\n\nSnowbound    alleged   that   AccuSoft     salespeople       had    similarly\n\nexceeded the limits of Paragraph 9 by, for example, stating in\n\nwritten communications with customers that “we are no longer\n\n                                    -44-\n\fselling the Image Format Library version 5.0 . . . we are\n\nselling the 6.0 version called ImageGear.”\n\n            While the master agreed that the statements identified\n\nby Snowbound suggested a “relationship” between the IFL and\n\nImageGear, he interpreted Paragraph 9 to prohibit a narrower\n\nclass of statements: those that “convey the . . . suggestion\n\nthat ImageGear contains the same computer code as the IFL.”                The\n\nmaster found that the statements attributed to AccuSoft did not\n\ncontain that suggestion.       The master also considered affidavits\n\nfrom the counsel who negotiated the settlement agreement. These\n\naffidavits, he found, showed considerable difference of opinion\n\nas to what the parties intended Paragraph 9 to cover.               In view\n\nof both the narrow construction he applied to the language and\n\nthe ambiguity he detected in the parties' intent, he found that\n\ncontempt had not been proven.\n\n            Snowbound   also     asserted      that   AccuSoft    had     made\n\nstatements    concerning       its    (and    Snowbound's)      ability     to\n\ndistribute, maintain and support the Image Format Library that\n\nimpermissibly deviated from a “script” of approved statements\n\ncontained    in   Paragraph     13    of     the   settlement    agreement.\n\nSnowbound pointed to an e-mail from AccuSoft, issued days after\n\nthe settlement agreement was signed, stating that AccuSoft had\n\n“full rights to market, sell, distribute, maintain and support\n\n\n                                     -45-\n\fthe    Image   Format   Library.”           Snowbound     further     noted     that\n\nAccuSoft continued to refer to the IFL as the “AccuSoft Image\n\nFormat Library,” even after August 31, 1996, when its right to\n\ndistribute the software had terminated.                       Finally, Snowbound\n\nasserted that AccuSoft told certain customers who inquired about\n\nthe IFL after August 31, 1996 that “[n]o one has rights to\n\ndistribute the IFL,” that “[t]he Image Format Library is no\n\nlonger available from anywhere,” or even that “Snowbound does\n\nnot have the right to sell any licensing for the Image Format\n\nLibrary.”\n\n             Here, again, the master found that the statements\n\ncomplained of had not clearly been demonstrated to violate the\n\nrequirements of the settlement agreement.                 The master noted that\n\nParagraph 13, by its terms, only restricted the substance of\n\n“statements     by    either       party    to   the   public    concerning      the\n\nownership of the Software” (emphasis added).                    It therefore was\n\nnot    clear   that   Paragraph       13    covered     AccuSoft's     statements\n\nconcerning who could sell or distribute the IFL.                     Furthermore,\n\nthe master found some merit in AccuSoft's contention that the\n\nsettlement agreement, although it transferred the IFL software\n\nto Palo, did not clearly convey to Palo or Snowbound any rights\n\nto    the   product   named    the    Image      Format   Library.       As    such,\n\nAccuSoft's     statement      to    its    clients     that    the   Image    Format\n\n\n                                          -46-\n\fLibrary was “not available from anywhere” was in some sense true\n\n-- although less than forthcoming -- after August 31, 1996,\n\ngiven that the only product then available using the IFL code\n\nwas the one called RasterMaster.\n\n            The master apparently found AccuSoft's statement that\n\nit had “full rights” to the IFL to be the closest case, given\n\nhis conclusion that the settlement agreement actually placed\n\nsignificant        limits           on        AccuSoft's      ability      to         continue\n\ndistributing       the       IFL,    including         the    requirement        that       such\n\ndistribution cease entirely after August 31, 1996.                             Nonetheless,\n\nthe master found that, from a purchaser's perspective, AccuSoft\n\neffectively      had        the   “full        rights”   claimed    at     the    time       the\n\nstatement was made.               Moreover, he found that the statement was\n\nnot   “so   much       at    variance”          with    the    scripted    statement          --\n\nAccuSoft was permitted to say that “AccuSoft will continue to\n\ndistribute       the     AccuSoft             Image    Format    Library”        --    as     to\n\nconstitute contempt.\n\n            On     appeal,          Snowbound          argues    that      the        master's\n\nconclusions with respect to these alleged violations must be\n\nreversed because the master misinterpreted the requirements of\n\nthe   settlement            agreement          and     the    import      of     AccuSoft's\n\nstatements.        Although we acknowledge that the interpretations\n\nproposed    by    Snowbound,             at    least    in    certain    instances,          are\n\n\n                                                -47-\n\fplausible, we do not believe Snowbound has met the heavy burden\n\nof   demonstrating       that    the   master     abused     his    discretion     by\n\nconcluding otherwise.\n\n             With respect to the violations of Paragraph 9, we\n\nconcede that the use of “Version 6.0\" to describe ImageGear,\n\ntaken   in    isolation,      implies    a     relationship        between   it   and\n\nVersion 5.0 of the IFL that could include reliance on the same\n\nor similar underlying code.             However, other statements in the\n\nadvertisements and AccuSoft’s web page quite clearly undercut\n\nthat    suggestion.        For    example,      the   first   sentence       of   the\n\nadvertisement text states: “AccuSoft Corporation announces a\n\ntotally new product, ImageGear, the next generation in imaging\n\ntechnology” (emphasis added).             Similarly, the web site states:\n\n“It's not a new version of an old product . . . it's new from\n\nthe ground up, designed to the most current coding, quality and\n\nperformance standards” (emphasis added).                Given this, we see no\n\nreason to disturb the master's conclusion that these statements,\n\ntaken as a whole, did not improperly suggest that ImageGear was\n\n“based on or derived from” the code contained in the IFL.\n\n             The    written      communications       with    customers,      which\n\ninclude      no   such   clarifying     language,     present       a   perceptibly\n\ncloser case and, were we deciding this issue in the first\n\ninstance, we are not certain that our conclusion with respect to\n\n\n                                        -48-\n\fthese statements would be the same as the master’s.        However, we\n\ndo not find the master’s conclusions so clearly wrong as to\n\nrequire us to find an abuse of discretion.       The question of what\n\nAccuSoft’s statements implied, in the context in which they were\n\nmade, strikes us as one which the master was plainly in a\n\nsuperior position to answer.       So too, we note that the master’s\n\ninquiry into the negotiating history of the parties on the\n\nrelevant language of Paragraph 9 led him to believe that the\n\nquestion of what was prohibited was not entirely understood by\n\nthe parties.    Under the circumstances, we are not convinced that\n\nthe master’s conclusion constitutes reversible error.\n\n         We are similarly unpersuaded that reversal of the\n\nmaster’s conclusions regarding alleged violations of Paragraph\n\n13 is justified.    We agree with the master that the settlement\n\nagreement’s scripts, which, by their terms, extend only to\n\nstatements concerning the “ownership” of the software, are not\n\nunambiguously    applicable   to     the   statements   AccuSoft   made\n\nconcerning rights to market and distribute the software.            It\n\nalso seems to us to stretch the scripts too far to assume that\n\nthey would prohibit AccuSoft from making potentially accurate\n\nnegative statements concerning Snowbound's distribution of the\n\nIFL when such statements did not conflict with those that the\n\nsettlement agreement permitted.\n\n\n                                   -49-\n\f            Turning finally to AccuSoft's statement that it had\n\n“full rights to market, sell, distribute, maintain and support\n\nthe Image Format Library,” we again conclude that the master's\n\nconclusion should be affirmed, although, in this case, we rely\n\non a different ground than did the master.

Baccarat, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198975\"><a href=\"/opinion/198975/ross-simons-v-baccarat-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10-11 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (holding that the appellate court is “not bound by the\n\ntrial court's rationale, but may affirm [the trial court's]\n\njudgment    for    any    valid   reason       that   finds    support   in   the\n\nrecord”).       In our view, there is no doubt that AccuSoft's\n\nstatement ultimately implies a claim regarding “ownership” of\n\nthe IFL, and therefore is governed by Paragraph 13 of the\n\nsettlement agreement.          Equally clear, as the master found (and\n\nthe   scripts     and    the   settlement      agreement      confirm)   is   that\n\nAccuSoft had, and could properly claim, only more limited rights\n\nin the software.         The “full” rights to which AccuSoft sought to\n\nlay claim were transferred to Snowbound, and, in fact, Snowbound\n\nwas specifically allowed to claim such full rights in the code\n\nunderlying the IFL (and RasterMaster) by section b of Paragraph\n\n13 of the settlement agreement.               Given this, to the extent that\n\nthe   master's     opinion      rests    on    a   finding     that   AccuSoft's\n\nstatement did not conflict with the settlement agreement, we\n\nmust disagree.\n\n\n                                        -50-\n\f           At the same time, we think that this comparatively\n\nminor departure from the settlement agreement's requirements\n\ndoes not, by itself, require a finding of civil contempt.

While AccuSoft doubtless tried to portray its position\n\nfollowing execution of the settlement agreement in a favorable\n\nlight, most of its statements -- particularly those disseminated\n\nto the public generally -- were adequately qualified to avoid\n\nconflict with the settlement agreement's terms.                     We do not\n\nconsider this single improper statement, contained in an e-mail\n\nbetween AccuSoft and one of its resellers, so significant as to\n\nrequire    a   finding      that   AccuSoft   was    not    in     substantial\n\ncompliance     with   the    relevant   provisions    of     the   settlement\n\nagreement.     We therefore affirm the master's conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\f           2.          AccuSoft’s Claims of Error\n\n           In      the     proceedings        below,     the     master   found    in\n\nAccuSoft’s favor with respect to a number of its allegations of\n\ncontemptuous conduct by Snowbound.                   In particular, the master\n\nfound that several widely-disseminated statements by Snowbound\n\nviolated the requirements of Paragraph 13 of the settlement\n\nagreement.      These included statements issued almost immediately\n\nafter the litigation, asserting that Snowbound had “won” the\n\nlitigation      and      had   “accomplished         what   it    wanted”   in    the\n\nsettlement agreement.           Snowbound also was found to have violated\n\nthe settlement agreement by using the words “AccuSoft” and\n\n“Image    Format      Library”    in    its    advertisements,       by   revealing\n\nconfidential terms of the settlement agreement to clients, and\n\nby failing to delete references to “Accu” or “AccuSoft” in\n\nproducts   it     distributed         after   the    settlement     agreement     was\n\nsigned.\n\n           However, the master ultimately rejected the relief\n\nsought    by    AccuSoft       with    respect      to   these   breaches   of    the\n\nagreement.       The master declined AccuSoft’s request that it be\n\nexcused from performance of its obligations under the agreement\n\n(principally payment of royalties) from the date of Snowbound’s\n\nbreach.        The master also found that AccuSoft had failed to\n\nintroduce evidence linking the proven breaches of the agreement\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\fwith any damages it had suffered.          On appeal AccuSoft challenges\n\nthese conclusions, as well as rulings by the master limiting the\n\nscope of discovery with respect to damages.                  AccuSoft also\n\nargues that the master should have separately found Snowbound in\n\ncontempt for licensing the IFL under that name, as opposed to\n\nunder its own brand name, RasterMaster.\n\n            a.      Rejection   of  Request   for  Rescission            of\n                    Settlement Agreement/Relief from Judgment\n\n            In its initial motion for contempt, AccuSoft requested\n\nthat it:\n\n            be excused from making any and all further\n            payments to Defendants . . . as a result of\n            their wilful and deliberate breach of the\n            bargained for exchange of payments for\n            confidentiality and protection of AccuSoft’s\n            goodwill   embodied   in   the    Settlement\n            Agreement.\n\nIn an amended motion, submitted in September 1996, AccuSoft\n\nreframed this argument more broadly as a request for relief from\n\njudgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) and for rescission\n\nof   the   settlement   agreement    in    its   entirety.     Citing   our\n\ndecision in      United States v.

First, noting AccuSoft's delay in\n\nasserting    its    rescission    claim    until   after   the   settlement\n\nagreement's August 31, 1996 cutoff had passed, the master found\n\nthat AccuSoft's conduct constituted an election to continue to\n\noperate under the contract, thus precluding rescission.

Furthermore, even if AccuSoft had not waived\n\nits right to such relief, the master found that Snowbound’s\n\nbreaches of the settlement agreement were not “sufficiently\n\nmaterial” to justify rescission of the contract or to excuse\n\nAccuSoft from its obligation to perform.             Although the master\n\nacknowledged       that   the    confidentiality     provisions    of   the\n\nsettlement agreement were “important” to the parties, the master\n\nheld that they did not constitute an “essential and inducing\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\ffeature of the contract.”              Lease-It, Inc. v.

To   the      contrary,       he    concluded,     “the     most\n\nimportant features of the Settlement Agreement were those which\n\npermitted the parties to continue in business by releasing their\n\nclaims to the other's software.”\n\n            On appeal, AccuSoft's principal claim of error concerns\n\nthe   master's     conclusion          that    Snowbound's          breaches   of    the\n\nsettlement agreement were not material.                      Accusoft contends that\n\nthe   master     failed      to    appreciate         that    the    confidentiality\n\nprovisions were essential to the agreement because, in the small\n\nmarket the parties were competing in, revelations concerning the\n\noutcome    of    the    litigation       could    severely       impair    AccuSoft's\n\nability to continue to do business and to transition its current\n\ncustomers to the ImageGear software.                   In fact, AccuSoft argued,\n\nthose provisions were the most important to AccuSoft because\n\nthey protected its goodwill.              Notably, and without explanation,\n\nAccuSoft does not address the master's alternative holding that\n\nAccuSoft    is    barred       from   relief     by    an    implicit     election    to\n\ncontinue under the contract.\n\n            As we proceed to the merits of AccuSoft's appeal on\n\nthis issue, we first address the fact that, on appeal, AccuSoft\n\n\n                                         -55-\n\fonce again appears to recast the nature of the relief it seeks.\n\nAccuSoft's most recent complaint, as well as its argument before\n\nthe master (and, subsequently, before Judge Gorton), asked for\n\ncomplete    rescission     of    the    settlement    agreement   and,    by\n\nimplication, complete relief from judgment pursuant to Rule\n\n60(b)(6).     In the briefs submitted to this court, however,\n\nAccuSoft reverts to the version of this count contained in the\n\ninitial complaint, asking simply to be excused from paying\n\nroyalties    from   the   date   that     Snowbound   first   breached   the\n\nagreement by announcing that it had “won” the litigation.21\n\nAccuSoft also fails to press any specific argument for relief\n\nbased on Rule 60(b)(6), although it could be concluded that\n\nAccuSoft's continuing references to our decision in Baus are\n\nintended to do so by implication.\n\n            The significance of this shift in tactics is unclear.\n\nArguably, although Snowbound has not so contended, AccuSoft's\n\nrequest on appeal for a more limited remedy is subject to\n\ndismissal because it was not properly raised in the forum below.\n\nHowever, Massachusetts caselaw is not entirely clear on whether\n\nthe line of precedent excusing a party from performance based on\n\nanother party's breach may be viewed as deriving from the same\n\n\n    21    Indeed, in its reply brief in this Court, AccuSoft\nstates baldly it is “not seeking to rescind the Settlement\nAgreement.”\n\n                                       -56-\n\fsource as the precedent regarding rescission.

Because it\n\ndoes not affect the result we reach, we accept arguendo that the\n\nrelief    requested      on        appeal    is   properly       before     us   and,\n\nfurthermore,      that   an       argument    under     Rule   60(b)(6)     is   also\n\nproperly preserved.\n\n               Turning to the substance of AccuSoft's appeal, we\n\naffirm the master's conclusion on the ground that AccuSoft, by\n\nelecting to continue accepting benefits under the agreement, has\n\nlost any right it may have had to be excused from performance as\n\na result of Snowbound's contempt.22               It is well established that\n\nconduct    indicating         a    willingness     to    continue    to     honor    a\n\ncontract, despite knowledge that the other party has failed to\n\nperform, “operates as a promise to perform in spite of that non-\n\n\n\n    22    In so holding, we specifically do not decide whether\nthe master was right to conclude that Snowbound's violations of\nthe settlement agreement were not “sufficiently material” to\njustify rescission or to excuse AccuSoft from its duty to\nperform.    Indeed, we find significant merit in AccuSoft's\ncontention that the confidentiality requirements and related\nprovisions related to publicity were critical components of the\nsettlement agreement from AccuSoft's perspective.\n\n                                           -57-\n\foccurrence.”   Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 246; see also\n\nFlanders, 165 F. at 321 (1st Cir. 1908) (holding that a breach\n\nby one party gives the other the right of election to continue\n\nunder the contract or to sue for rescission); accord Apex Pool\n\nEquip.

Yet AccuSoft continued to\n\naccept the benefits of the settlement agreement and to act as if\n\nit were still in effect.   It was not until several months later\n\n-- after August 31, 1996 -- that AccuSoft filed an amended\n\npleading that made clear it sought rescission of the entire\n\nagreement.     In the interim, AccuSoft availed itself of the\n\nability to license the IFL in return for royalty payments, as\n\nwell as the ability to sell ImageGear free from infringement\n\nclaims.   Indeed, by the time AccuSoft asserted its rescission\n\nclaim, it had obtained all the benefits from the settlement\n\nagreement that it could.   Under the circumstances, we agree with\n\nthe master that AccuSoft was not entitled to cancel -- largely\n\n\n\n\n                               -58-\n\fretroactively -- its obligation to pay royalties.23              We therefore\n\naffirm the master's conclusion.\n\n            b.     Conclusion that AccuSoft Failed to Introduce\n                   Adequate Evidence of Damages\n\n            In addition to rejecting AccuSoft's rescission claim,\n\nthe master rejected AccuSoft's contention that it was entitled\n\nto be compensated for Snowbound's contempt with money damages.\n\nThe master acknowledged that AccuSoft had introduced evidence\n\nshowing that many of its customers from 1995 did not continue as\n\ncustomers    in   1996   or   later,    and   that   many   of    those   same\n\ncustomers had become customers of Snowbound.                The master also\n\nconceded that Accusoft had not reached its projected levels of\n\ngrowth in 1996 and beyond.             However, the master found that\n\nAccuSoft had failed to introduce “any evidence that these events\n\noccurred because Snowbound breached the Settlement Agreement”\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            To the contrary, the master noted that the testimony\n\nsuggested a number of reasons, unrelated to the alleged breaches\n\n\n\n    23    We acknowledge that nothing in our limited precedent\nconcerning the circumstances under which relief from judgment\npursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) will be granted specifically\nincorporates a parallel principle that a party may “elect” to\naccept non-performance of a settlement agreement, nor do we\nintend to establish such a general principle here. However, we\ndo find that, on the facts presented here, AccuSoft has not\npresented any “reason justifying relief from the operation of\njudgment.”\n\n                                   -59-\n\fof the agreement, that could explain these occurrences.             It was\n\napparent that many of AccuSoft's customers knew of the legal\n\ndispute between AccuSoft and the founders of Snowbound, and that\n\nsome number also understood that the disputes concerned rights\n\nto the code contained in the IFL.         AccuSoft's operations were\n\nalso disrupted by the injunction entered by the court shortly\n\nbefore the infringement trial was to begin.            Finally, AccuSoft\n\nfaced, beginning in early 1996, a new and combative competitor\n\n(Snowbound), aggressively courting the same customers in a small\n\nniche market, and at a time when AccuSoft was having difficulty\n\ncompleting and marketing its own new product.\n\n          On    appeal,   AccuSoft    argues   first   that   the   master\n\napplied   the    “wrong    legal     standard”   in    determining     the\n\nsufficiency of AccuSoft's evidence of damages.             Specifically,\n\nAccuSoft contends that the master ignored precedent indicating\n\nthat damages can be recovered even where the amount of damages\n\nsuffered cannot be calculated with certainty.           See, e.g., Nat'l\n\nMerchandising Corp. v.

We do\n\n\n                                   -60-\n\fnot   read   the   master's   conclusion   to   be   that   AccuSoft\n\ninadequately identified the amount of damages, but rather that\n\nAccuSoft could not demonstrate that any damages suffered were\n\ncaused by breaches of the settlement agreement.       Such proof of\n\na causal nexus between Snowbound's breaches and the damages\n\nAccuSoft suffered is clearly required by Paragraph 16 of the\n\nsettlement agreement 24 as well as by settled precedent.

However,\n\nbased on the record evidence AccuSoft identifies in its motion\n\npapers, we are not persuaded to reverse the master's conclusion\n\nto the contrary.        As we have previously stated, in evaluating a\n\nchallenge to the award of damages, “we rely heavily on the\n\njudgment of the trial court, who has had the benefit of hearing\n\nall of the evidence.”         Clark v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420691\"><a href=\"/opinion/420691/sidney-a-clark-v-donald-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1983).     The evidence AccuSoft points to, at best, demonstrates\n\nthat Snowbound made statements to current customers of AccuSoft,\n\nregarding the IFL, that violated the settlement agreement; that\n\nSnowbound was aware when doing so that such statements could\n\naffect AccuSoft's ability to sell the IFL to its customers; and\n\nthat     some   of    those   customers      later   became   customers    of\n\nSnowbound.        Nothing AccuSoft identifies in the record moves\n\nbeyond     mere      circumstantial    evidence      to   directly   connect\n\nSnowbound's actions with specific lost customers.                While such\n\ncircumstantial evidence of causation may, in certain instances,\n\nbe adequate, AccuSoft has given us no reason to believe that the\n\nmaster erred in concluding otherwise in this case.\n\n            As a final argument on this point, AccuSoft contends\n\nthat the master committed reversible error by limiting discovery\n\n\n                                      -62-\n\fwith respect to damages.           AccuSoft states that discovery was\n\nlimited to communications between Snowbound and former AccuSoft\n\ncustomers.       AccuSoft    was    not   allowed     to   investigate     what\n\nstatements were made to other Snowbound customers who may have\n\nconsidered   purchasing       AccuSoft's        product    but   were   unduly\n\ninfluenced by the improper communications.             AccuSoft also argues\n\nthat it should have been allowed to investigate Snowbound's\n\nfinancial condition.        With this information, AccuSoft contends,\n\nit could have developed the necessary evidence concerning its\n\ndamages.\n\n           The master, in his memorandum, noted that AccuSoft had\n\nfailed, on the basis of the discovery it was allowed, to produce\n\nany   evidence   that   would      lead   him    to   believe    that   further\n\ndiscovery was justified.        AccuSoft was not able to point to any\n\nof its own communications with customers suggesting that they\n\nhad information relevant to whether Snowbound's conduct caused\n\nAccuSoft's damages.     Nor had the limited discovery of customers\n\nwho had switched from AccuSoft to Snowbound suggested that such\n\ninformation would be revealed through additional discovery.                 The\n\nmaster acknowledged that, given the “substantial difficulties in\n\ngetting third-parties to permit themselves to become involved in\n\nthis kind of dispute,” it was not fair to “infer that such\n\ninformation would not be helpful to Accusoft.”                   On the other\n\n\n                                     -63-\n\fhand, he concluded that he could not simply “assume . . . that\n\nAccuSoft's loss of revenues or Snowbound's receipt of revenues\n\nare the result of the improper conduct by Snowbound” (emphasis\n\nin original).\n\n           Here     too,   precedent       suggests       a   highly   deferential\n\nstandard of review.           During the performance of his duties, a\n\nmaster is “functionally indistinguishable from . . . a trial\n\njudge.”    Jenkins v.

While such decisions are not immune from review, they\n\nwill   only   be    reversed       “upon     a    clear   showing      of   manifest\n\ninjustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was\n\nplainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the\n\naggrieved party.”          Id.     AccuSoft has identified no facts or\n\nprecedent that convince us that the master was “plainly wrong”\n\nin limiting discovery as he did.                 To the contrary, it appears to\n\nus that the master's decision to disallow further discovery was\n\nfirmly grounded in his factual findings, which AccuSoft does not\n\nmeaningfully dispute.            We therefore affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -64-\n\f              c.        Finding that Settlement Agreement Transferred\n                        “Ownership” of the IFL to Snowbound\n\n              In the proceedings below, AccuSoft alleged, and the\n\nmaster      found,     that   Snowbound   had    offered    to    sell    or    renew\n\nlicenses for the IFL and, in at least a few instances, actually\n\nsold   or    renewed     such    licenses.       AccuSoft    argued      that    this\n\nviolated         the   settlement      agreement    because,       although       the\n\nagreement         transferred     to   Palo     AccuSoft's       rights    in     the\n\nunderlying code, it did not transfer any rights in the product\n\nnamed the Image Format Library.               The master rejected AccuSoft's\n\ncontention, noting that, in his view, the settlement agreement\n\nshould      be     interpreted    as   transferring     “all      of     AccuSoft's\n\ninterest in the IFL” to Palo.             He also indicated that the lack\n\nof clarity in the settlement agreement concerning the interest\n\nthat was transferred to Palo precluded finding of contempt in\n\nany event.\n\n              On appeal, AccuSoft renews its argument that the master\n\nerroneously interpreted the agreement and that only ownership of\n\nthe underlying code was transferred to Snowbound.                         AccuSoft\n\nnotes that the language of the Assignment of Copyright, which\n\nstates that AccuSoft will transfer “all of its right, title, and\n\ninterest in and to all computer programs or other software that\n\nhave at any time to date been sold under the name 'AccuSoft\n\nImage Format Library,'” does not expressly transfer ownership of\n\n                                        -65-\n\fthe IFL name, or any IFL documentation, or customer contacts or\n\ngoodwill associated with the IFL.           AccuSoft also points out that\n\nthe settlement agreement strictly limits what Snowbound could\n\nsay concerning ownership of the IFL, and specifically prohibits\n\nSnowbound from “trading in any manner upon the goodwill attached\n\nto the name 'AccuSoft.'”          Finally, AccuSoft identifies record\n\nevidence suggesting that Palo and Wieczner were not particularly\n\nconcerned with gaining the ability to sell the IFL code qua IFL\n\n(rather     than    under   the   name   RasterMaster)       when   they   were\n\nnegotiating the settlement agreement.\n\n            As a matter of contractual interpretation, we find\n\nsignificant merit in AccuSoft's argument.              We do not read the\n\nagreement to unambiguously transfer to Palo ownership of the IFL\n\nproduct, as opposed to its underlying code.              Further, we find\n\nthat AccuSoft makes a compelling case that other provisions --\n\nsuch   as   those    concerning     publicity    and   the    protection     of\n\nAccuSoft's goodwill -- suggest that the parties did not intend\n\nthat Snowbound would license the IFL.            In this context we note\n\nthat the settlement agreement's express statement that Snowbound\n\ncould publicize its ability to “support” the IFL after August\n\n31, 1996, may also be read to imply that Snowbound could not\n\npublicize its ability to take other actions with respect to the\n\nIFL.   These provisions, taken together, lead us to believe that\n\n\n                                     -66-\n\fSnowbound was not authorized by the settlement agreement to sell\n\nthe product under the IFL name.\n\n            We    are   less    certain       that   AccuSoft    has     advanced\n\ncompelling       grounds   to   reverse      the   master's   conclusion       that\n\nSnowbound's actions did not constitute civil contempt.                     First,\n\nas   the   master's     opinion      makes    clear,   the    language    of    the\n\nsettlement agreement is not unambiguous on this issue.                   While we\n\nfeel that the better reading favors AccuSoft's position, we do\n\nnot believe that the interpretation argued by Snowbound and\n\nadopted by the master is entirely without foundation.                    The lack\n\nof a clear directive counsels against a finding of contempt.\n\nSee, e.g., Project B.A.S.I.C., 947 F.2d at 16.\n\n            In    addition,     we   have     some   doubt    whether,    from    a\n\nsubstantive point of view, anything turns on the prohibition\n\nAccuSoft would impose.           It seems evident that the settlement\n\nagreement would, at least after August 31, 1996, allow Snowbound\n\nto tell customers who inquired that it was supporting the IFL\n\nand also selling the RasterMaster product, which used the same\n\ncode as the IFL.        We note also that the master found -- and we\n\nhave affirmed -- that it was permissible to state, after August\n\n31, 1996, that no one was actually selling the IFL anymore.\n\nGiven Snowbound's evident ability to license the IFL code, to\n\nstate that such code was formerly contained in the IFL but now\n\n\n                                       -67-\n\fcontained in RasterMaster, and to indicate that the IFL qua IFL\n\nwas no longer available, Snowbound could only be found to have\n\nbreached the agreement to the extent that licensing the IFL\n\nwithout    such      explanation      improperly         traded   on    goodwill\n\nassociated with that name.           In this context, it is noteworthy\n\nthat the master already considered, and found contemptuous,\n\nSnowbound's     use     of     the   term    IFL    in    advertisements       and\n\nSnowbound's use of references to “AccuSoft”\n\nor “Accu” in products it sold, but found no damages associated\n\nwith these breaches.25\n\n           Although the above suggests to us that AccuSoft may\n\nhave difficulty proving contempt, or proving that any damages\n\nresulted from such contempt, we believe a remand is necessary to\n\ndetermine whether the factual record may support such a finding\n\nif the interpretation of the settlement agreement set out above\n\nis applied.     As but one reason for so doing, we note that it is\n\nnot at all clear, from the record evidence identified by the\n\nparties,   when Snowbound licensed the IFL.                   With the record\n\nbefore    us,   we    cannot    conclusively       resolve    this     issue   and\n\ntherefore leave it to the district court to determine.\n\n\n    25    We also consider it significant that the settlement\nagreement expressly did not seek to regulate the parties' oral\nstatements, further limiting the conduct surrounding the sales\nof IFL that could be considered grounds for a finding of\ncontempt.\n\n                                      -68-\n\fC.          Attorneys' Fees and Related Costs; Costs of Audit\n\n            Finally, the parties appeal aspects of the master's\n\nrulings with respect to costs of the master's audit and the\n\naward of attorneys' fees and related litigation costs.\n\n            1.       Costs of Audit\n\n            In its motion papers, AccuSoft argues that, if its\n\nappeals     concerning    the    royalties    owed     to   Snowbound    are\n\nsuccessful, the award of audit costs to Snowbound may need to be\n\nrevisited.       In charging the entirety of the audit to AccuSoft in\n\nhis decision below, the master relied on Paragraph 6 of the\n\nsettlement agreement which states, in relation to the audit,\n\nthat:\n\n            If the audit discloses that any amount due\n            was underreported or underpaid by more than\n            5%, AccuSoft will reimburse Palo for one-\n            half of the cost of the audit. If the audit\n            discloses   that   any    amount  due   was\n            underreported by more than 10%, AccuSoft\n            will reimburse Palo for the entire cost of\n            the audit.\n\nBecause we hold that the master's award of the Lifeboat revenues\n\nto Snowbound must be vacated -- an award which constituted the\n\nmajority of the amount unpaid by AccuSoft – this calculation may\n\nindeed change on remand.        We therefore direct the court below to\n\nreview    this    question   again    after   the    remanded   issues   are\n\nresolved.\n\n            2.       Attorneys' Fees and Related Costs\n\n                                     -69-\n\f         Paragraph 16 of the settlement agreement provides, in\n\nrelevant part, that:\n\n         If any party should breach any term of this\n         Agreement, the other party will be entitled\n         to move for contempt of the Order, to an\n         award of its actual damages sustained by\n         reason of such breach, and to recover its\n         reasonable   attorneys'   fees  and   costs\n         incurred in such proceedings . . . .\n\nIn his memorandum, the master concluded that the phrase “in such\n\nproceedings” must be read as limited to that process in which a\n\nparty “move[s] for contempt of the Order” to remedy the other\n\nparty's breach, and, therefore, that the provision only allowed\n\nfor recovery by a plaintiff in a contempt action.   He also found\n\nthat, by its terms, the provision required that a breach of the\n\nagreement be proved before fees could be awarded.    However, the\n\nmaster found nothing in the language to limit a party who\n\nalleged multiple counts of contempt to obtaining attorneys' fees\n\nassociated with its “successful” contempt claims.     Nor did he\n\nview the language as requiring the party to meet the definition\n\nof a “prevailing party” as it is used in statutory fee-shifting\n\nprovisions; a definition which typically requires that some\n\ndamages be proven.

See Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. 104 Acres of\n\nLand, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676487\"><a href=\"/opinion/676487/tennessee-gas-pipeline-company-v-104-acres-of-land-more-or-less-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 634 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting our preference\n\nfor the lodestar time and rate method “if an alternative method\n\nis   not   expressly      dictated      by     applicable      law”).        Following\n\nseveral    rounds       of   submissions           from   AccuSoft,      the    master\n\ndetermined that $135,102 in attorneys' fees and $14,143 in\n\nrelated costs (travel costs, constable fees, etc.) were properly\n\nattributable to AccuSoft's prosecution of its contempt action\n\nand thus recoverable.           Because the master found that Snowbound\n\nhad not succeeded in proving that AccuSoft was in contempt of\n\nany aspect of the settlement agreement, Snowbound was awarded no\n\nfees.\n\n            On    appeal,       both    parties       challenge        the     master's\n\ninterpretation of the settlement agreement language.                           AccuSoft\n\nargues that it should be allowed to recover the entirety of its\n\nattorneys'       fees     and   costs,        including     those       expended     in\n\nsuccessfully      defending      itself        against     Snowbound's         contempt\n\nallegations.        Snowbound,         in    turn,    argues    that    AccuSoft     is\n\nentitled to recover none of its fees and costs, because, in\n\n\n                                            -71-\n\fdetermining the “reasonableness” of the fee award, the master\n\nshould have considered AccuSoft's failure to obtain any of the\n\nrelief it sought.           Snowbound also argues that, because the\n\nmaster     should    have    found     AccuSoft    to    have     breached    the\n\nagreement, Snowbound should have received an award of attorneys'\n\nfees.\n\n            We see no reason to disturb the master's conclusion\n\nthat, under the terms of the settlement agreement, a party may\n\nrecover fees for prosecuting a contempt action but may not\n\nrecover fees incurred in defending against a claim of contempt.\n\nThe     language     of    the   settlement      agreement       supports     this\n\ninterpretation       and    AccuSoft     has    provided    no    precedent     or\n\nextrinsic evidence that casts any doubt on its correctness.                     On\n\nthe other hand, we find merit in Snowbound's contention that the\n\nmaster should have given consideration to AccuSoft's success (or\n\nlack    thereof)     in    determining    the   amount     of    fees   it   could\n\nrecover.\n\n            In doing so we acknowledge that, when a contractual fee\n\nprovision is included by the parties, the question of what fees\n\nare owed “is ultimately one of contract interpretation,” and our\n\nprimary obligation is simply to honor the agreement struck by\n\nthe parties.

We are also aware of precedent suggesting that\n\nthe court's discretion in awarding fees is more limited where\n\nthe parties have specifically agreed that fees will be paid\n\nunder certain circumstances.

To    the   contrary,\n\nMassachusetts law suggests that success is a factor that must be\n\nconsidered when fixing the fees to be awarded pursuant to a\n\ncontractual provision.            In First Nat'l Bank of Boston v.

These\n\nfactors include “the ability and reputation of the attorney, the\n\ndemand for his services by others, the amount and importance of\n\nthe matter involved, the time spent, the prices usually charged\n\nfor   similar   services   by    other   attorneys   in   the   same\n\nneighborhood, the amount of money or the value of the property\n\naffected by controversy, and the results secured.”        Cummings,\n\n188 N.E. at 492 (emphasis added).         Other opinions applying\n\nMassachusetts law appear to reach a similar result.       See, e.g.,\n\nNorthern Heel, 951 F.2d at 476-77 (discussing application of\n\nCummings factors in determining reasonableness of fees awarded\n\nunder contractual provision); MIF Realty, 989 F.

Furthermore, even where courts\n\nhave adopted a comparatively narrow view of their discretion\n\nwhere contractual provisions are concerned, they have recognized\n\nthe ability to “adjust or even deny a contractual award of fees\n\nif such an award would be inequitable or unreasonable.”     Western\n\nStates, 834 F.2d at 1548.       This standard has been employed to\n\n\n                                 -74-\n\fdeny the award of fees pursuant to contract when the party has\n\nmet with scant success in its action.                 See Rent It Co. v. Aetna\n\nCas. & Sur. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601916\"><a href=\"/opinion/601916/united-states-of-america-ex-rel-rent-it-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that\n\nthe    lower    court    acted   within     its    discretion    in   denying   as\n\n“inequitable and unreasonable” any award of fees “[g]iven the\n\nmore    than    eight-to-one      ratio     of    damages   sought    to   damages\n\nrecovered”).\n\n               In light of this, we believe that the contractual\n\nprovision at issue here is appropriately interpreted to require\n\nconsideration of all relevant factors, including the results\n\nobtained by the parties, in determining the reasonableness of\n\nthe fees requested.             On remand, the district court, or the\n\nmaster, if the order of reference is renewed, should include\n\nthese considerations in determining whether the fee awards are\n\nappropriate in light of the reasoning set forth in this opinion\n\nand the proceedings on remand.              We realize that, as the master\n\nnoted     below,    it    may    not   be     possible      or   appropriate    to\n\ndistinguish the fees associated with successful and unsuccessful\n\nclaims.    We also do not mean to suggest that AccuSoft’s failure\n\nto obtain damages or other requested relief is necessarily fatal\n\nto its claim for attorneys' fees.                Ultimately, the determination\n\nof what fees are properly awarded under this standard lies\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the finder of fact.\n\n\n                                       -75-\n\f           As a final point, we note that AccuSoft has requested\n\nthat it be awarded its fees for these appeals pursuant to\n\nParagraph 16 of the settlement agreement.               Whether, or under\n\nwhat   circumstances,    fees    should     be   awarded      for   appellate\n\nadvocacy pursuant to a contractual agreement “is one largely of\n\njudicial   discretion,    since      the    provision    or    stipulations\n\ninvolved usually do not contain explicit reference to fees on\n\nappeal.”   Robert L. Rossi, Attorney's Fees 492 (1995).               Because\n\nthe question of attorneys' fees will be revisited on remand in\n\nany event, and should properly be evaluated in light of the\n\ndistrict court's final conclusions on remand regarding aspects\n\nof the substantive relief awarded the parties, we instruct\n\nAccuSoft   and   Snowbound      to   make   their   case      for   the   fees\n\nassociated with these appeals at that time.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -76-\n\f                                     IV.\n\n           Our conclusions may be summarized as follows.                 With\n\nrespect to the allocation of the Lifeboat revenues, the decision\n\nof the master is vacated and the matter is remanded for a\n\ndetermination of what royalties, if any, are owed to Snowbound\n\non this income.       In addition, the master's conclusion that\n\nSnowbound's sales of the IFL did not constitute contempt is\n\nvacated   and   the   matter       remanded      for    further   proceedings\n\nconsistent with Part II.B.2.c of this opinion.                On remand, we\n\nfurther direct that the district court address the issue of\n\nwhether   AccuSoft    may   have    been    in   contempt   for   failing   to\n\nmaintain sequential serial numbers of its IFL sales, an issue\n\nthat was not fully resolved below.            Finally, we direct that, on\n\nremand,   the   awards   of   audit    costs      and   attorneys'   fees   be\n\nreconsidered in view of the standards discussed in Part II.C of\n\nthis opinion and changes in the substantive relief obtained by\n\nthe parties on remand.         In all other respects, we affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n           It is so ordered.        No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -77-\n\f</pre>",
