Shortly after Christina Weston-\n\nSmith returned from her maternity leave in 1998 to her job as\n\nDirector   of    Peri-Operative   Services      at    Cooley      Dickinson\n\nHospital, she was laid off.       Based on comments she overheard,\n\nthe timing of her dismissal, a comparison of her credentials\n\nwith those of her replacement, and both a hearsay statement\n\n(that her supervisor said to her replacement that Weston-Smith's\n\nleave caused her to lose her job) and her supervisor's silence\n\nin the face of Weston-Smith's accusations, she believed that she\n\nwas terminated because of her maternity leave.             She brought suit\n\nunder Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (1994), and the anti-\n\nretaliation provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 2615 (1994).\n\n           The Hospital denied any discrimination or retaliation.\n\nIt   explained   that   Weston-Smith    was   laid   off    as   part   of   a\n\nhospital-wide reorganization of management, and that there were\n\nlegitimate reasons another employee had been retained instead of\n\nWeston-Smith in the new position.         It argued that neither the\n\nalleged statement nor the silence was admissible, because both\n\nwere hearsay.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f              On the Hospital's motion for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court agreed that all reasonable inferences from the\n\nevidence supported the Hospital’s position, and entered judgment\n\nfor   the    Hospital.           Specifically,      the    court    ruled   that   the\n\nstatement      was    inadmissible         double    hearsay,      Weston-Smith     v.\n\nCooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., 153 F. Supp. 2d 62, 69 (D. Mass.\n\n2001); that it was doubtful the silence was admissible and that\n\nit    certainly          did     not     amount     to     direct     evidence      of\n\ndiscrimination, id. at 69-70; and further that Weston-Smith had\n\nfailed to meet her burden to show the Hospital’s explanation was\n\npretextual,          id.    at    73.     We     affirm;   our     analysis   of   the\n\nquestions      presented         on   appeal     largely   mirrors    that    of   the\n\ndistrict court’s well-reasoned opinion.\n\n                                            I.\n\n              We take the facts and reasonable inferences in the\n\nlight most favorable to Weston-Smith's position.                       Zapata-Matos\n\nv. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir. 2002).                         We\n\nsketch      only   the     basic      facts;   details     may   be   found   in   the\n\ndistrict court opinion.                 We give a fuller description only of\n\nthe portions of the facts needed for our decision.\n\n              Cooley Dickinson Hospital hired Christina Weston-Smith\n\nin April 1996 as its Director of Peri-Operative Services; in\n\nthat position, she managed the treatment of patients before and\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fafter   surgery,      as    well    as   the   administration         of   surgical\n\nservices    themselves.            She   reported      to    Donna    Bowles,   the\n\nHospital's Vice President of Nursing.                 Weston-Smith did well at\n\nher job and received good, sometimes excellent, performance\n\nevaluations.    In April 1998, Weston-Smith took maternity leave,\n\nscheduled to last until August; she returned to her position\n\npart time in May.            She testified at deposition that while\n\nworking part time, she overheard two doctors complaining about\n\nher inaccessibility during her maternity leave.\n\n            In August, after the formal end of Weston-Smith's\n\nmaternity leave, Craig Melin, the Hospital's President and CEO,\n\nmet with her.    Melin informed Weston-Smith that the Hospital was\n\neliminating     her        position      as    part     of     a     hospital-wide\n\nreorganization.        A new position, Surgical Program Director,\n\nwould perform many of the same tasks as well some additional\n\nones, and would report directly to him rather than to Bowles.\n\nWeston-Smith also testified that she was told not to apply for\n\nthe new position.      After terminating Weston-Smith, Melin offered\n\nthe new position to Cathryn Neumann, formerly the Hospital's\n\nClinical Coordinator and Weston-Smith's subordinate.                       Neumann\n\naccepted.\n\n            Weston-Smith came to suspect, based on the conversation\n\nthat she had overheard between the doctors and on the timing of\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fher layoff, that Melin's decision was motivated at least in part\n\nby her absence during her maternity leave.             According to her\n\ndeposition testimony, Neumann told her that Bowles had said that\n\nWeston-Smith's maternity leave had indeed played a part in the\n\nlayoff decision.      Some time later, Bowles invited Weston-Smith\n\nto lunch.     Regarding that lunch, Weston-Smith testified at\n\ndeposition:\n\n            Donna [Bowles] invited me out to lunch at the\n            Northampton Brewery and I asked her at that time,\n            during that luncheon which she invited me to, because\n            I had a lot of questions, what was going on, why was\n            I laid off. I asked her about the conversation she\n            had with Cathy Neumann, about the fact that Cathy had\n            told me that the reason I was laid off, I mean that,\n            you know, she had a conversation with Donna about the\n            conversation that Donna and Cathy had had and that\n            Cathy had related that information to me and I asked\n            her about why Donna had said that about the fact that\n            I had been laid off because of my maternity leave and\n            when I asked her that question, when I asked Donna\n            that question at that luncheon, she clearly looked\n            extremely uncomfortable and didn't answer.     She sat\n            there and turned color, you know, turned bright red\n            and didn't answer the question, you know, he she [sic]\n            evaded the issue, tried to talk about something\n            different.    I tried to bring her back to that\n            question, I wanted to have the answer, but she clearly\n            -- her body language told me that she was well aware\n            of what I was talking about, but she did not answer\n            the question in words.\n\nBowles denied at deposition that she ever said anything to\n\nNeumann   regarding    the   reasons    Weston-Smith    was   laid   off.\n\nNeumann also denied that Bowles ever said anything of this kind,\n\nor that Neumann ever had a conversation on this topic with\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fWeston-Smith.         Weston-Smith's own testimony is therefore the\n\nprimary evidence that she claims entitles her to a jury trial,\n\nalthough she also makes other arguments that we address in the\n\ncourse of this opinion.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment.    Zapata-Matos, 277 F.3d at 42.\n\n            Some years ago the Supreme Court set up two different\n\nmodels    for    analysis     of    employment   discrimination       cases,\n\ndepending on whether an employee presented direct evidence1 of\n\ndiscrimination or relied solely on circumstantial evidence.              See\n\nPrice    Waterhouse     v.   Hopkins,   490   U.S.   228,   270-78    (1989)\n\n(O'Connor,      J.,   concurring)    (describing     the   direct   evidence\n\nmodel); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05\n\n(1973) (describing the circumstantial evidence model).               Like the\n\nparties, we apply the distinction drawn by these cases.2              As the\n\n\n\n     1    For a description of the differing requirements adopted\nby the circuits for the application of Price Waterhouse, see\nFernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc., 199 F.3d 572, 582 (1st\nCir. 1999). For present purposes, we will simply refer to such\ncases as those involving \"direct evidence.\"\n     2     Weston-Smith has alleged claims under both Title VII\nand the anti-retaliation provisions of the Family and Medical\nLeave Act. The parties have treated the standards under the two\nActs as the same. So do we. To be clear, however, our discussion\nof the 1991 amendments to Title VII in the text applies specifically to\nthat statute and not to the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fSupreme Court has recently reemphasized, however, the McDonnell\n\nDouglas framework is a \"flexible evidentiary standard\" whose\n\nrequirements \"vary depending on the context\"; it is a method for\n\nproving cases rather than the definition of a cause of action.\n\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., No. 00-1853, 2002 WL 261807, at *4\n\n(U.S. Feb. 26, 2002) (holding that a Title VII plaintiff need\n\nnot plead the elements of a McDonnell Douglas prima facie case\n\nto survive a motion to dismiss).\n\nA.    Direct Evidence\n\n              It is generally to an employee's benefit to show direct\n\nevidence      of     discrimination       rather   than    relying    on        the\n\ninferential        model   set   forth    in   McDonnell   Douglas.        If    an\n\nemployee makes a sufficiently strong showing of discrimination\n\nusing direct evidence, but the employer responds with a showing\n\nof legitimate reasons for the actions it took, then the court\n\nmay    view    the    employer     as    having    mixed   motives    --    some\n\nlegitimate, some not.            Under the 1991 Act amending Title VII,\n\nthe employer may then assert an affirmative defense, bearing the\n\nburdens of production and persuasion, that it \"would have taken\n\nthe same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating\n\nfactor.\"      Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, § 107,\n\n105 Stat. 1071, 1075-76 (1991), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n5(g)(2)(B).         On such a showing in a mixed-motive case, the\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\femployer may then avoid liability for monetary damages and\n\nreinstatement.     But so long as the employee has shown that the\n\nimpermissible factor was a motive, even if not the determinative\n\nmotive, the employer will still be subject to declaratory and\n\nlimited injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees.               Id.\n\nAlthough the 1991 Act is silent on exactly what showing is\n\nneeded to trigger a mixed-motive case, and so might be read to\n\nleave open the possibility of a mixed-motive analysis following\n\na sufficiently strong circumstantial showing of discrimination,\n\nmany courts require an employee to produce direct evidence that\n\nestablishes discrimination was a motive before employing such an\n\nanalysis.    See generally Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc.,\n\n199 F.3d 572, 580 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing Price Waterhouse, 490\n\nU.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., concurring)).\n\n            Employees benefit from presenting such direct evidence\n\nfor a number of reasons.          First, the sheer strength of the\n\nevidence may carry the day.       Second, it increases the chance of\n\nsome form of relief, including attorneys' fees.              Third, it\n\nimposes     on   the   employer   the    burdens   of   production   and\n\npersuasion,3 unlike the McDonnell Douglas model, which merely\n\n\n    3     This shift occurs, of course, only if the employee has\npersuaded the fact finder that an impermissible motive has\nplayed a part, and the employer is seeking to limit the relief\nby showing it also acted from permissible motives that would\nhave led to the same action anyway.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fshifts   to    the    employer       the    burden      of    producing       admissible\n\nevidence to support a non-discriminatory reason for its actions.\n\nSmith v. F.W. Morse & Co., 76 F.3d 413, 421 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nFourth, it is more difficult, although not impossible, for the\n\nemployer to get summary judgment in light of the strength of\n\ndirect   evidence        and       the     potential         shifting     of    burdens.\n\nDominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 429 (1st\n\nCir.   2000);    cf.     Swierkiewicz,           2002   WL    261807,     at   *3   (\"[A]\n\nplaintiff      [who]     is       able     to     produce     direct      evidence     of\n\ndiscrimination       .   .    .    may     prevail      without     proving     all    the\n\nelements of a [McDonnell Douglas] prima facie case.\").                                 To\n\nobtain   these       benefits,       the        employee     must   \"offer      stronger\n\nevidence . . . than that needed to establish a prima facie case\n\nunder\"   McDonnell       Douglas.           I     B.   Lindemann     &   P.    Grossman,\n\nEmployment Discrimination Law 43 (3d ed. 1996).\n\n              Much has been written about what is direct evidence.\n\nSee    id. at 40 nn.150, 151 (collecting cases).                         It is easy to\n\nsay that there is direct evidence when a decisionmaker says, for\n\nexample, \"I fired you because you became pregnant and took\n\nmaternity leave.\" But that rarely happens in this world, where\n\nmost employers are well aware of the legal consequences of\n\ndiscrimination.           And      so    employees         offer    other      types   of\n\nstatements as \"direct\" evidence.                  See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S.\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fat 272 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (treating as direct evidence\n\na statement by the relevant decisionmaker that the plaintiff's\n\n\"'professional' problems would be solved if she would 'walk more\n\nfemininely, talk more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair\n\nstyled, and wear jewelry'\").\n\n         This circuit has made clear that inherently ambiguous\n\nstatements do not qualify as direct evidence.   In Fernandes, we\n\nheld that the statement \"I don't need minorities and I don't\n\nneed residents on this job\" was ambiguous because in context it\n\nmight have reflected \"a benign response to a specific inquiry\n\nreflecting [the speaker's] . . . perception that he no longer\n\nhad to make special efforts to comply with EEO requirements.\"\n\n199 F.3d at 583.4   And in Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine, Inc.,\n\n155 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 1998), we held a store manager's statement\n\nthat the plaintiff in that case had \"a perfect case of age\n\ndiscrimination\" did not suffice as direct evidence because there\n\n\n\n    4     We have further explained this requirement in\nsubsequent cases. See Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp., 214\nF.3d 57, 61 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Comments which, fairly read,\ndemonstrate that a decisionmaker made, or intended to make,\nemployment decisions based on forbidden criteria constitute\ndirect evidence of discrimination. The mere fact that a fertile\nmind can conjure up some innocent explanation for such a comment\ndoes not undermine its standing as direct evidence.\" (citation\nomitted)).    We also note that the statement in Fernandes,\nalthough not direct evidence, when combined with the other\nevidence in that case enabled the plaintiffs to reach a jury\nunder McDonnell Douglas. 199 F.3d at 588-89.\n\n                               -10-\n\fwas insufficient evidence linking the manager to the actual\n\ndecisionmaking process for the statement to be admissible.                         Id.\n\nat 13-14.\n\n              Weston-Smith offered as direct evidence at summary\n\njudgment her testimony about both Neumann's statement regarding\n\nNeumann's conversation with Bowles and Bowles's silence at the\n\nlunch with Weston-Smith.            The district court concluded that\n\nWeston-Smith's        testimony    about    Neumann's          supposed     statement\n\nabout   what     Bowles      purportedly    said     is    double      hearsay     and\n\ninadmissible.         Weston-Smith, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 69.                    Weston-\n\nSmith   does    not    challenge    that     conclusion         on    appeal.      The\n\nappellate issue instead concerns Bowles's silence in the face of\n\nWeston-Smith's accusation that Bowles had made the statement to\n\nNeumann.        The    district     court     held        it    was    of    doubtful\n\nadmissibility and so ambiguous that it could not be considered\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination or retaliation.                      Id. at 69-70.\n\nThe   court    did    not,    however,   fully     resolve       the    question    of\n\nadmissibility.        Id.\n\n              This    ruling    presents      a    several-part evidentiary\n\nquestion.      Weston-Smith argues that the underlying statement --\n\nthat Bowles was laid off because of her maternity leave -- is an\n\nadmission, that Bowles is for this purpose an agent of the\n\nHospital, and that Bowles's failure to respond to Weston-Smith\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fwhen       accused   of   making    the    statement   constitutes    Bowles's\n\nadoption of that admission -- on behalf of the Hospital -- by\n\nsilence.      Weston-Smith could not get the statement into evidence\n\notherwise because Bowles and Neumann deny the encounter.                    Her\n\nargument presents two questions: whether the statement itself\n\nmet the criteria for the admission of a party-opponent, and if\n\nso whether Bowles by her silence adopted that admission at the\n\nlunch with Weston-Smith.5\n\n              We     start   with    the    general    requirements   for   an\n\nadmission.         For the statement of an employee to be the admission\n\nof a corporate or institutional employer, it must fit within\n\nsubsection (C) or (D) of Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2),\n\nwhich reads:\n\n              Admission by party-opponent. The statement is offered\n              against a party and is (A) the party's own statement,\n              in either an individual or a representative capacity\n              or (B) a statement of which the party has manifested\n              an adoption or belief in its truth, or (C) a statement\n              by a person authorized by the party to make a\n              statement concerning the subject, or (D) a statement\n\n\n       5  Weston-Smith's testimony is almost entirely consistent\nthat Bowles said nothing in response to Weston-Smith's\nquestions.   She did once, when questioned by counsel for the\nHospital, affirm that Bowles had \"said she was sorry.\"      That\naffirmation conflicts with her repeated statements, both earlier\nand later, that Bowles's response was \"[n]ot in words\" or was in\n\"body language\"; that Bowles \"change[d] the subject,\" and\n\"didn't answer.\" Even applying the lenient standards of summary\njudgment, the only reasonable reading of Weston-Smith's\ntestimony as a whole is that Bowles remained silent, and we\nassess the case on that basis.\n\n                                          -12-\n\f          by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter\n          within the scope of the agency or employment, made\n          during the existence of the relationship, or (E) a\n          statement by a coconspirator of a party during the\n          course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.       The\n          contents of the statement shall be considered but are\n          not alone sufficient to establish the declarant's\n          authority under subdivision (C), the agency or\n          employment relationship and scope thereof under\n          subdivision (D), or the existence of the conspiracy\n          and the participation therein of the declarant and the\n          party against whom the statement is offered under\n          subdivision (E).\n\nThe   statement   of   an   individual    defendant   may    be   a   direct\n\nadmission under subsection (A).          Bowles is not a defendant; the\n\nHospital is.      In order for the statement to be an admission,\n\ntherefore, Weston-Smith must show through evidence other than\n\nthe statement itself either that Bowles was authorized by the\n\nHospital to make the statement or that Bowles was the Hospital's\n\nagent and the statement concerned a matter within the scope of\n\nher employment, made while she was employed.                As we discuss\n\nbelow, she must also show that Bowles adopted the statement\n\nthrough her silence in the face of Weston-Smith's accusation.\n\n          It is undisputed that the relevant decisionmaker in\n\nthis case was Melin, the Hospital's President.                It is also\n\nundisputed that Bowles had held the position of Vice President\n\nfor Patient Care Services, that her position was eliminated, and\n\nthat she became one of the five Program Directors, the Program\n\nDirector of Medical Services.      Moreover, there was evidence that\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fBowles was not at all involved in the decision to lay Weston-\n\nSmith off: the testimony was that Melin, without discussing the\n\nfate   of   specific     individuals,      told     his   management     team,\n\nincluding Bowles, about the new overall structure he had in\n\nmind; that Melin told her his reasons for putting Neumann into\n\nthe new position; and that Bowles thus learned that Weston-\n\nSmith's position would be eliminated.             Nevertheless, Bowles was\n\nWeston-Smith's direct supervisor, and we do not think it is\n\nclear that a statement regarding the reasons for Weston-Smith's\n\ntermination    would   necessarily    be    outside       the   scope   of   her\n\nemployment.    Even assuming that the matter was within the scope\n\nof Bowles's employment, however, the district court's other\n\nreasons for holding Bowles's silence not to amount to direct\n\nevidence are solid.\n\n            The district court wrote that it was doubtful that\n\nBowles's silence could constitute an adoptive admission, and\n\nthat   if   admissible   it   did   not    amount    to    direct   evidence.\n\nWeston-Smith, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 69-70.              Weston-Smith's theory\n\nis that Bowles, by failing to deny the statement that she had\n\ntold Neumann that Weston-Smith had been laid off because of her\n\nmaternity leave, adopted that statement.                    See generally 2\n\nMcCormick on Evidence § 262 (J. Strong et al. eds., 5th ed.\n\n1999) (discussing the doctrine of admission by silence).                     The\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\ftrial judge plays a screening role in ruling whether a party\n\n(or, as here, its agent) has adopted an admission by silence.\n\nIn Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28 (1st Cir. 1998), we\n\nheld that \"[i]n all [such] cases, the burden is on the proponent\n\nto convince the judge that in the circumstances of the case a\n\nfailure    to    respond    is   so   unnatural   that   it   supports     the\n\ninference that the party acquiesced in the statement.\"                  Id. at\n\n35 (quoting Ricciardi v. Children's Hosp. Med. Ctr., 811 F.2d\n\n18, 24 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting J. Weinstein & M. Berger,\n\nWeinstein's      Evidence    §   801(d)(2)(B)[01],       at   801-202    n.15\n\n(1985))).       In making the evaluation, the trial judge considers\n\nthe nature of the statement, the identity of the person offering\n\nthe testimony, the identity of the maker of the statement, the\n\ncontext, and whether the circumstances as a whole show that the\n\nlack of a denial is so unnatural as to support an inference that\n\nthe undenied statement was true.\n\n            These circumstances do not meet that standard.              It was\n\na social occasion: Bowles had invited Weston-Smith to lunch.\n\nWeston-Smith testified that during that lunch, she told Bowles\n\nthat Neumann had said that Bowles had made the statement to\n\nNeumann.    The district court correctly concluded that in context\n\nthere might have been a great many reasons why Bowles was silent\n\non the point and changed the subject, and those other reasons\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fmade it far from unnatural for Bowles to handle the matter as\n\nshe did.        Weston-Smith, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 69.             We add another:\n\nBowles could not know what Neumann had or had not said to\n\nWeston-Smith.6              See     5    Weinstein's         Federal       Evidence\n\n§ 801.31[3][d], at 801-58 (J. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2001) (\"[A]\n\ncourt may find, after evaluating the type of statement and who\n\nmade it, that the party could not have been expected to deny it\n\nbecause the party lacked the information necessary to assess its\n\ntruthfulness.\")          The silence was not an adoptive admission.\n\n                Finally, even if the district court, exercising its\n\ndiscretion, might have concluded that the evidence just barely\n\nmet   the   criteria      for     admissibility,      the    court   was   plainly\n\ncorrect     to    hold    that    this   was    not   direct    evidence.       Its\n\nprobative value is not sufficiently strong.                     The reasons why\n\nBowles did not respond with a vigorous denial were ambiguous at\n\nbest,     and    Bowles   was     neither   involved    in     the   decision   nor\n\nnecessarily aware of the reasons Weston-Smith lost her job.\n\nFrom this conclusion it follows that Weston-Smith must present\n\n\n\n      6   Further, there is no reason to think that Bowles would\nknow, even as to her own purported statement, whether the\nstatement was true as to the reasons for the layoff. Rather,\nassuming that she made some statement regarding those reasons,\nshe might have been engaging in speculation about a matter of\nwhich she had no personal knowledge.       This is particularly\nplausible because, even on Weston-Smith's version of events,\nBowles was speaking to Neumann, not to Weston-Smith.\n\n                                         -16-\n\fher    case   within    the   burden-shifting      framework    of   McDonnell\n\nDouglas.\n\nB.     McDonnell Douglas\n\n              The district court found that Weston-Smith's evidence\n\ndid not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n\nthe Hospital's articulated legitimate reason for the layoff was\n\na pretext.      Weston-Smith, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 71.           The Hospital's\n\nstated    reasons      justify   both    Melin's   decision     to   eliminate\n\nWeston-Smith's original position and his preference for Neumann\n\nover     Weston-Smith     for    the    new    Surgical   Program    Director\n\nposition.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f1.   The Hospital's reasons\n\n            Melin testified as follows.               He was responsible both\n\nfor creating the new management structure resulting from the\n\nneed to cut staff and for picking the new Surgical Program\n\nDirector.    The Hospital lacked the funds to maintain both a new\n\nSurgical    Program    Director       and    the      Peri-Operative   Services\n\nDirector,    the   position     Weston-Smith           held.     Weston-Smith's\n\nmaternity leave had, he said, nothing to do with the elimination\n\nof her position.       The restructuring affected about 20 jobs,\n\nalthough this number includes some employees who were rehired in\n\nnew positions, as Neumann was.               Employees other than Weston-\n\nSmith were laid off, including at least one higher in the\n\norganization    than    she,    and   other      management     positions     were\n\neliminated.\n\n            After the reorganization, Neumann as the new Surgical\n\nProgram     Director     assumed       all       of     Weston-Smith's      prior\n\nresponsibilities, plus additional ones.                  Melin had considered\n\nboth Weston-Smith and Neumann for the new job, which was in many\n\nways similar to Weston-Smith's old job.                    He picked Neumann\n\nbecause she, in his view, fit better into the upgraded job, now\n\na part of senior management.                Melin thought the difference\n\nbetween the old job and the new one was that the old was a\n\n\"management    role\";     the     new,       a   \"senior       management,\"    or\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f\"leadership,\" role requiring \"leadership and support from the\n\nrest of the organization and a vision for a bigger picture.\"                   He\n\nhad two primary reasons for selecting Neumann.                 First, he had\n\nobserved Neumann's leadership skills when she served as chair of\n\nthe Hospital's successful, recent capital campaign.                During that\n\nprocess -- which involved asking employees to contribute to the\n\nHospital's fundraising for a new building even as it laid other\n\nemployees     off   --   Melin   had   seen    Neumann     build   loyalty    and\n\nmorale, and win employee support.              Second, he had faced Neumann\n\nat the bargaining table.           She had been chair of the nurses'\n\ncollective bargaining unit for a number of years; Melin had seen\n\nthat she was skilled with budgets and that she could lead.                    She\n\nwon his respect.\n\n2.   Weston-Smith's response\n\n             Weston-Smith    argues     that    a   jury   could   find   these\n\nreasons to be pretext on several grounds.                  The elimination of\n\nthe position to save money, she says, was pretextual because the\n\nnew job was really her old one without significant changes.\n\nMoreover, the total number of positions in her department stayed\n\nthe same, and the salary of her former job was increased when it\n\nbecame the Surgical Director's job.                 This argument takes too\n\nmyopic   a   view;   overall,     several      management     positions      were\n\neliminated, so that the reorganization did save the Hospital\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fmoney.      That the reorganized jobs encompassed functions of\n\nformer jobs is unsurprising.           Functions rarely go away; but how\n\nfunctions are handled does change, and changes can lead to\n\ngreater efficiency.\n\n              Weston-Smith is correct that an employer may not try\n\nto shield a discriminatory or retaliatory termination by hiding\n\nit in a layoff.        Smith v. F.W. Morse & Co., 76 F.3d 413, 422\n\n(1st   Cir.    1996)   (\"Whether      or   not    trimming            the   fat     from     a\n\ncompany's     organizational     chart       is   a   prudent           practice       in    a\n\nparticular business environment, the employer's decision to\n\neliminate      specific    positions       must       not        be     tainted        by    a\n\ndiscriminatory      animus.\").         But    there         is    little,         if    any,\n\nadmissible      evidence    suggesting       that     the        decision      to      merge\n\nWeston-Smith's      job    function    into       a   higher          level   job      in    a\n\nstreamlined organization was motivated by either retaliation or\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n              Weston-Smith's attack on the reasons given for the\n\nchoice of Neumann over Weston-Smith herself as pretextual is\n\nsimilarly flawed.         Weston-Smith says that Melin's generalized\n\nsubjective      assessments    about       \"leadership\"               and   \"vision\"        to\n\nsupport the creation of a new job and the choice of Neumann are\n\ninsufficient.      Subjective judgment may mask an improper motive,\n\nas Weston-Smith suggests.        Melin's explanation, however, is not\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fsheer subjectivity.   Melin had observed Neumann over a period of\n\nyears as she successfully performed demanding tasks.        These\n\ntasks -- heading the capital campaign and the nurses' bargaining\n\nunit -- demonstrated Neumann's skills.     Absent further evidence\n\nof discrimination or retaliation, which Weston-Smith has not\n\nproduced, there is no reasonable inference of pretext.\n\n         Melin's statement that he wanted Neumann on his senior\n\nmanagement team must be pretext, Weston-Smith argues, because\n\nWeston-Smith was terminated and discouraged from even applying\n\nfor the new position before Neumann was ever told of or accepted\n\nthe new position.     No reasonable inference of pretext can be\n\ndrawn from this.   Although it was not certain that Neumann would\n\naccept, it is improbable that she would decline a position with\n\nhigher pay on the senior management team, working directly under\n\nMelin, whom she knew.   Moreover, the Hospital might easily have\n\nwished to avoid the awkward situation of informing Neumann, then\n\nWeston-Smith's subordinate, of the decision to lay Weston-Smith\n\noff before Weston-Smith herself found out.\n\n         Weston-Smith also relies on her relative qualifications\n\nfor the new job compared with Neumann's.    She stresses Neumann's\n\ntestimony that she had no management experience and did not have\n\na masters degree, while Weston-Smith had both.    This argument is\n\nnothing more than second-guessing Melin's decision about whose\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fskill set would be more valuable.              That Melin might have decided\n\nin Weston-Smith's favor based on her own skills would not permit\n\na   jury   to    infer   that     his    choice    of   Neumann      was   either\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation.              Moreover, Weston-Smith places\n\ntoo much emphasis on whether a job was termed \"management\" and\n\non credentials.      Melin could reasonably look behind labels and\n\ndegrees,   and    rely   on     his   own   experience       with   Neumann    and\n\nobservation of her leadership skills, regardless of whether she\n\nhad played a union or a management role at the time.                          That\n\napproach does not render his decision so unlikely as to permit,\n\nfrom that and little more, a jury inference of improper motive.\n\n           Beyond her attacks on the Hospital's proffered reason,\n\nWeston-Smith      presents    a   few    more     pieces     of   circumstantial\n\nevidence of discrimination or retaliation on the Hospital's\n\npart.   These consist of her own testimony that she overheard two\n\ndoctors    complaining    about       her   absence     on    maternity    leave;\n\nNeumann's additional testimony that there had been complaints\n\nabout Weston-Smith's \"[l]ack of accessibility\" (although not\n\nthat these complaints were related to the maternity leave); and\n\nBowles's silence, if admissible, in the face of Weston-Smith's\n\naccusatory question.      As to the testimony of complaints, nothing\n\nlinks those complaints to the decision process; nor do they\n\nappear sufficiently pervasive to justify a finder of fact in\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\finferring such a link.   As to the silence, we have already given\n\nthe reasons that, if admissible, it has little probative value.\n\n         We conclude that Weston-Smith has produced insufficient\n\nevidence to take her case to a jury within the McDonnell Douglas\n\nframework.    Although her prima facie case is undisputed, the\n\nHospital's proffered reasons for her termination are plausible\n\nand coherent, and neither her criticisms of those reasons nor\n\nher independent circumstantial evidence of an improper motive,\n\nwhether taken apart or together, are sufficient to require      a\n\njury trial.    See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277\n\nF.3d 40, 47 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[A] slight suggestion of pretext,\n\nabsent other evidence from which discrimination can be inferred,\n\n[does not] meet[] plaintiff's ultimate burden.\").\n\n                               III.\n\n         For the reasons given, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.

She reported to Donna Bowles, the Hospital's Vice President of Nursing. Weston-Smith did well at her job and received good, sometimes excellent, performance evaluations. In April 1998, Weston-Smith took maternity leave, scheduled to last until August; she returned to her position part time in May. She testified at deposition that while working part time, she overheard two doctors complaining about her inaccessibility during her maternity leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August, after the formal end of Weston-Smith's maternity leave, Craig Melin, the Hospital's President and CEO, met with her. Melin informed Weston-Smith that the Hospital was eliminating her position as part of a hospital-wide reorganization. A new position, Surgical Program Director, would perform many of the same tasks as well some additional ones, and would report directly to him rather than to Bowles. Weston-Smith also testified that she was told not to apply for the new position. After terminating Weston-Smith, Melin offered the new position to Cathryn Neumann, formerly the Hospital's Clinical Coordinator and Weston-Smith's subordinate. Neumann accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith came to suspect, based on the conversation that she had overheard between the doctors and on the timing of her layoff, that Melin's decision was motivated at least in part by her absence during her maternity leave. According to her deposition testimony, Neumann told her that Bowles had said that Weston-Smith's maternity leave had indeed played a part in the layoff decision. Some time later, Bowles invited Weston-Smith to lunch. Regarding that lunch, Weston-Smith testified at deposition:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donna [Bowles] invited me out to lunch at the Northampton Brewery and I asked her at that time, during that luncheon which she invited me to, because I had a lot of questions, what was going on, why was I laid off. I asked her about the conversation she had with Cathy Neumann, about the fact that Cathy had told me that the reason I was laid off, I mean that, you know, she had a conversation with Donna about the conversation that Donna and Cathy had had and that Cathy had related that information to me and I asked her about why Donna had said that about the fact that I had been laid off because of my maternity leave and when I asked her that question, when I asked Donna that question at that luncheon, she clearly looked extremely uncomfortable and didn't answer. She sat there and turned color, you know, turned bright red and didn't answer the question, you know, he she [sic] evaded the issue, tried to talk about something different. I tried to bring her back to that question, I wanted to have the answer, but she clearly &#8212; her body language told me that she was well aware of what I was talking about, but she did not answer the question in words.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowles denied at deposition that she ever said anything to Neumann regarding the reasons Weston-Smith was laid off. Neumann also denied that Bowles ever said anything of this kind, or that Neumann ever had a conversation on this topic with Weston-Smith. Weston-Smith's own testimony is therefore the primary evidence that she claims entitles her to a jury trial, although she also makes other arguments that we address in the course of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment. <i>Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some years ago the Supreme Court set up two different models for analysis of employment discrimination cases, depending on whether an employee presented direct evidence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> of discrimination or relied solely on circumstantial evidence. <i>See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</i> 490 U.S. 228, 270-78, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (describing the direct evidence model); <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (describing the circumstantial evidence model). Like the parties, we apply the distinction drawn by these cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As the Supreme Court has recently reemphasized, however, the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework is a \"flexible evidentiary standard\" whose requirements \"vary depending on the context\"; it is a method for proving cases rather than the definition of a cause of action. <i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,</i> 534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 997, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (holding that a Title VII plaintiff need not plead the elements of a <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> prima facie case to survive a motion to dismiss).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Direct Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is generally to an employee's benefit to show direct evidence of discrimination rather than relying on the inferential model set forth in <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i> If an employee makes a sufficiently strong showing of discrimination using direct evidence, but the employer responds with a showing of legitimate reasons for the actions it took, then the court may view the employer as having mixed motives &#8212; some legitimate, some not. Under the 1991 Act amending Title VII, the employer may then assert an affirmative defense, bearing the burdens of production and persuasion, that it \"would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor.\" Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, &#167; 107, 105 Stat. 1071, 1075-76 (1991), <i>codified at</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). On such a showing in a mixed-motive case, the employer may then avoid liability for monetary damages and reinstatement. But so long as the employee has shown that the impermissible factor was a motive, even if not the determinative motive, the employer will still be subject to declaratory and limited injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees. <i>Id.</i> Although the 1991 Act is silent on exactly what showing is needed to trigger a mixed-motive case, and so might be read to leave open the possibility of a mixed-motive analysis following a sufficiently strong circumstantial showing of discrimination, many courts require an employee to produce direct evidence that establishes discrimination was a motive before employing such an analysis. <i>See generally Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc.,</i> 199 F.3d 572, 580 (1st Cir.1999) (citing <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> 490 U.S. at 277, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (O'Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employees benefit from presenting such direct evidence for a number of reasons. First, the sheer strength of the evidence may carry the day. Second, it increases the chance of some form of relief including attorneys' fees. Third, it imposes on the employer the burdens of production and persuasion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> unlike the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> model, which merely shifts to the employer the burden of producing admissible evidence to support a non-discriminatory reason for its actions. <i>Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co.,</i> 76 F.3d 413, 421 (1st Cir.1996). Fourth, it is more difficult, although not impossible, for the employer to get summary judgment in light of the strength of direct evidence and the potential shifting of burdens. <i>Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc.,</i> 202 F.3d 424, 429 (1st Cir.2000); <i>cf. Swierkiewicz,</i> 534 U.S. 506, at ___, 122 S.Ct. 992, 996, 152 L.Ed.2d 1, at ___ (\"[A] plaintiff [who] is able to produce direct evidence of discrimination... may prevail without proving all the elements of a [<i>McDonnell Douglas</i>] prima facie case.\"). To obtain these benefits, the employee must \"offer stronger evidence ... than that needed to establish a prima facie case under\" <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i> I B. Lindemann &amp; P.

It is easy to say that there is direct evidence when a decisionmaker says, for example, \"I fired you because you became pregnant and took maternity leave.\" But that rarely happens in this world, where most employers are well aware of the legal consequences of discrimination. And so employees offer other types of statements as \"direct\" evidence. <i>See Price Waterhouse,</i> 490 U.S. at 272, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (treating as direct evidence a statement by the relevant decisionmaker that the plaintiff's \"`professional' problems would be solved if she would `walk more femininely, talk more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has made clear that inherently ambiguous statements do not qualify as direct evidence. In <i>Fernandes,</i> we held that the statement \"I don't need minorities and I don't need residents on this job\" was ambiguous because in context it might have reflected \"a benign response to a specific inquiry reflecting [the speaker's]... perception that he no longer had to make special efforts to comply with EEO requirements.\" 199 F.3d at 583.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> And in <i>Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine, Inc.,</i> 155 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.1998), we held a store manager's statement that the plaintiff in that case had \"a perfect case of age discrimination\" did not suffice as direct evidence because there was insufficient evidence linking the manager to the actual decisionmaking process for the statement to be admissible. <i>Id.</i> at 13-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith offered as direct evidence at summary judgment her testimony about both Neumann's statement regarding Neumann's conversation with Bowles and Bowles's silence at the lunch with Weston-Smith. The district court concluded that Weston-Smith's testimony about Neumann's supposed statement about what Bowles purportedly said is double hearsay and inadmissible. <i>Weston-Smith,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 69. Weston-Smith does not challenge that conclusion on appeal. The appellate issue instead concerns Bowles's silence in the face of Weston-Smith's accusation that Bowles had made the statement to Neumann. The district court held it was of doubtful admissibility and so ambiguous that it could not be considered direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation. <i>Id.</i> at 69-70. The court did not, however, fully resolve the question of admissibility. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ruling presents a several-part evidentiary question. Weston-Smith argues that the underlying statement &#8212; that Bowles was laid off because of her maternity leave &#8212; is an admission, that Bowles is for this purpose an agent of the Hospital, and that Bowles's failure to respond to Weston-Smith when accused of making the statement constitutes Bowles's adoption of that admission &#8212; on behalf of the Hospital &#8212; by silence. Weston-Smith could not get the statement into evidence otherwise because Bowles and Neumann deny the encounter. Her argument presents two questions: whether the statement itself met the criteria for the admission of a party-opponent, and if so whether Bowles by her silence adopted that admission at the lunch with Weston-Smith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the general requirements for an admission. For the statement of an employee to be the admission of a corporate or institutional employer, it must fit within subsection (C) or (D) of Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2), which reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admission by party-opponent. The statement is offered against a party and is (A) the party's own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity or (B) a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth, or (C) a statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject, or (D) a statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship, or (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The contents of the statement shall be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant's authority under subdivision (C), the agency or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision (D), or the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered under subdivision (E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement of an individual defendant may be a direct admission under subsection (A). Bowles is not a defendant; the Hospital is. In order for the statement to be an admission, therefore, Weston-Smith must show through evidence other than the statement itself either that Bowles was authorized by the Hospital to make the statement or that Bowles was the Hospital's agent and the statement concerned a matter within the scope of her employment, made while she was employed. As we discuss below, she must also show that Bowles adopted the statement through her silence in the face of Weston-Smith's accusation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that the relevant decisionmaker in this case was Melin, the Hospital's President. It is also undisputed that Bowles had held the position of Vice President for Patient Care Services, that her position was eliminated, and that she became one of the five Program Directors, the Program Director of Medical Services. Moreover, there was evidence that Bowles was not at all involved in the decision to lay Weston-Smith off: the testimony was that Melin, without discussing the fate of specific individuals, told his management team, including Bowles, about the new overall structure he had in mind; that Melin told her his reasons for putting Neumann into the new position; and that Bowles thus learned that Weston-Smith's position would be eliminated. Nevertheless, Bowles was Weston-Smith's direct supervisor, and we do not think it is clear that a statement regarding the reasons for Weston-Smith's termination would necessarily be outside the scope of her employment. Even assuming that the matter was within the scope of Bowles's employment, however, the district court's other reasons for holding Bowles's silence not to amount to direct evidence are solid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court wrote that it was doubtful that Bowles's silence could constitute an adoptive admission, and that if admissible it did not amount to direct evidence. <i>Weston-Smith,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 69-70. Weston-Smith's theory is that Bowles, by failing to deny the statement that she had told Neumann that Weston-Smith had been laid off because of her maternity leave, adopted that statement. <i>See generally</i> 2 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> &#167; 262 (J. Strong et al. eds., 5th ed.1999) (discussing the doctrine of admission by silence). The trial judge plays a screening role in ruling whether a party (or, as here, its agent) has adopted an admission by silence. In <i>Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario,</i> 134 F.3d 28 (1st Cir.1998), we held that \"[i]n all [such] cases, the burden is on the proponent to convince the judge that in the circumstances of the case a failure to respond is so unnatural that it supports the inference that the party acquiesced in the statement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 35 (quoting <i>Ricciardi v. Children's Hosp. Med. Ctr.,</i> 811 F.2d 18, 24 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <i>Weinstein's Evidence</i> &#167; 801(d)(2)(B)[01], at 801-202 n.15 (1985))). In making the evaluation, the trial judge considers the nature of the statement, the identity of the person offering the testimony, the identity of the maker of the statement, the context, and whether the circumstances as a whole show that the lack of a denial is so unnatural as to support an inference that the undenied statement was true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These circumstances do not meet that standard. It was a social occasion: Bowles had invited Weston-Smith to lunch. Weston-Smith testified that during that lunch, she told Bowles that Neumann had said that Bowles had made the statement to Neumann. The district court correctly concluded that in context there might have been a great many reasons why Bowles was silent on the point and changed the subject, and those other reasons made it far from unnatural for Bowles to handle the matter as she did. <i>Weston-Smith,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 69. We add another: Bowles could not know what Neumann had or had not said to Weston-Smith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See</i> 5 <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence</i> &#167; 801.31[3][d], at 801-58 (J. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2001) (\"[A] court may find, after evaluating the type of statement and who made it, that the party could not have been expected to deny it because the party lacked the information necessary to assess its truthfulness.\") The silence was not an adoptive admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if the district court, exercising its discretion, might have concluded that the evidence just barely met the criteria for admissibility, the court was plainly correct to hold that this was not direct evidence. Its probative value is not sufficiently strong. The reasons why Bowles did not respond with a vigorous denial were ambiguous at best, and Bowles was neither involved in the decision nor necessarily aware of the reasons Weston-Smith lost her job. From this conclusion it follows that Weston-Smith must present her case within the burden-shifting framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>McDonnell Douglas</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Weston-Smith's evidence did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Hospital's articulated legitimate reason for the layoff was a pretext. <i>Weston-Smith,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 71. The Hospital's stated reasons justify both Melin's decision to eliminate Weston-Smith's original position and his preference for Neumann over Weston-Smith for the new Surgical Program Director position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Hospital's reasons</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Melin testified as follows. He was responsible both for creating the new management structure resulting from the need to cut staff and for picking the new Surgical Program Director. The Hospital lacked the funds to maintain both a new Surgical Program Director and the Peri-Operative Services Director, the position Weston-Smith held. Weston-Smith's maternity leave had, he said, nothing to do with the elimination of her position. The restructuring affected about 20 jobs, although this number includes some employees who were rehired in new positions, as Neumann was. Employees other than Weston-Smith were laid off, including at least one higher in the organization than she, and other management positions were eliminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the reorganization, Neumann as the new Surgical Program Director assumed all of Weston-Smith's prior responsibilities, plus additional ones. Melin had considered both Weston-Smith and Neumann for the new job, which was in many ways similar to Weston-Smith's old job. He picked Neumann because she, in his view, fit better into the upgraded job, now a part of senior management. Melin thought the difference between the old job and the new one was that the old was a \"management role\"; the new, a \"senior management,\" or \"leadership,\" role requiring \"leadership and support from the rest of the organization and a vision for a bigger picture.\" He had two primary reasons for selecting Neumann. First, he had observed Neumann's leadership skills when she served as chair of the Hospital's successful, recent capital campaign. During that process &#8212; which involved asking employees to contribute to the Hospital's fundraising for a new building even as it laid other employees off &#8212; Melin had seen Neumann build loyalty and morale, and win employee support. Second, he had faced Neumann at the bargaining table. She had been chair of the nurses' collective bargaining unit for a number of years; Melin had seen that she was skilled with budgets and that she could lead. She won his respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Weston-Smith's response</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith argues that a jury could find these reasons to be pretext on several grounds. The elimination of the position to save money, she says, was pretextual because the new job was really her old one without significant changes. Moreover, the total number of positions in her department stayed the same, and the salary of her former job was increased when it became the Surgical Director's job. This argument takes too myopic a view; overall, several management positions were eliminated, so that the reorganization did save the Hospital money. That the reorganized jobs encompassed functions of former jobs is unsurprising. Functions rarely go away; but how functions are handled does change, and changes can lead to greater efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith is correct that an employer may not try to shield a discriminatory or retaliatory termination by hiding it in a layoff. <i>Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co.,</i> 76 F.3d 413, 422 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Whether or not trimming the fat from a company's organizational chart is a prudent practice in a particular business environment, the employer's decision to eliminate specific positions must not be tainted by a discriminatory animus.\"). But there is little, if any, admissible evidence suggesting that the decision to merge Weston-Smith's job function into a higher level job in a streamlined organization was motivated by either retaliation or discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith's attack on the reasons given for the choice of Neumann over Weston-Smith herself as pretextual is similarly flawed. Weston-Smith says that Melin's generalized subjective assessments about \"leadership\" and \"vision\" to support the creation of a new job and the choice of Neumann are insufficient. Subjective judgment may mask an improper motive, as Weston-Smith suggests. Melin's explanation, however, is not sheer subjectivity. Melin had observed Neumann over a period of years as she successfully performed demanding tasks. These tasks &#8212; heading the capital campaign and the nurses' bargaining unit &#8212; demonstrated Neumann's skills. Absent further evidence of discrimination or retaliation, which Weston-Smith has not produced, there is no reasonable inference of pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Melin's statement that he wanted Neumann on his senior management team must be pretext, Weston-Smith argues, because Weston-Smith was terminated and discouraged from even applying for the new position before Neumann was ever told of or accepted the new position. No reasonable inference of pretext can be drawn from this. Although it was not certain that Neumann would accept, it is improbable that she would decline a position with higher pay on the senior management team, working directly under Melin, whom she knew. Moreover, the Hospital might easily have wished to avoid the awkward situation of informing Neumann, then Weston-Smith's subordinate, of the decision to lay Weston-Smith off before Weston-Smith herself found out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith also relies on her relative qualifications for the new job compared with Neumann's. She stresses Neumann's testimony that she had no management experience and did not have a masters degree, while Weston-Smith had both. This argument is nothing more than second-guessing Melin's decision about whose skill set would be more valuable. That Melin might have decided in Weston-Smith's favor based on her own skills would not permit a jury to infer that his choice of Neumann was either discrimination or retaliation. Moreover, Weston-Smith places too much emphasis on whether a job was termed \"management\" and on credentials. Melin could reasonably look behind labels and degrees, and rely on his own experience with Neumann and observation of her leadership skills, regardless of whether she had played a union or a management role at the time. That approach does not render his decision so unlikely as to permit, from that and little more, a jury inference of improper motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond her attacks on the Hospital's proffered reason, Weston-Smith presents a few more pieces of circumstantial evidence of discrimination or retaliation on the Hospital's part. These consist of her own testimony that she overheard two doctors complaining about her absence on maternity leave; Neumann's additional testimony that there had been complaints about Weston-Smith's \"[l]ack of accessibility\" (although not that these complaints were related to the maternity leave); and Bowles's silence, if admissible, in the face of Weston-Smith's accusatory question. As to the testimony of complaints, nothing links those complaints to the decision process; nor do they appear sufficiently pervasive to justify a finder of fact in inferring such a link. As to the silence, we have already given the reasons that, if admissible, it has little probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Weston-Smith has produced insufficient evidence to take her case to a jury within the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework. Although her prima facie case is undisputed, the Hospital's proffered reasons for her termination are plausible and coherent, and neither her criticisms of those reasons nor her independent circumstantial evidence of an improper motive, whether taken apart or together, are sufficient to require a jury trial. <i>See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> 277 F.3d 40, 47 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[A] slight suggestion of pretext, absent other evidence from which discrimination can be inferred, [does not] meet[] plaintiff's ultimate burden.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons given, we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court.

She reported to Donna Bowles, the Hospital's Vice President of Nursing. Weston-Smith did well at her job and received good, sometimes excellent, performance evaluations. In April 1998, Weston-Smith took maternity leave, scheduled to last until August; she returned to her position part time in May. She testified at deposition that while working part time, she overheard two doctors complaining about her inaccessibility during her maternity leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August, after the formal end of Weston-Smith's maternity leave, Craig Melin, the Hospital's President and CEO, met with her. Melin informed Weston-Smith that the Hospital was eliminating her position as part of a hospital-wide reorganization. A new position, Surgical Program Director, would perform many of the same tasks as well some additional ones, and would report directly to him rather than to Bowles. Weston-Smith also testified that she was told not to apply for the new position. After terminating Weston-Smith, Melin offered the new position to Cathryn Neumann, formerly the Hospital's Clinical Coordinator and Weston-Smith's subordinate. Neumann accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith came to suspect, based on the conversation that she had overheard between the doctors and on the timing of her layoff, that Melin's decision was motivated at least in part by her absence during her maternity leave. According to her deposition testimony, Neumann told her that Bowles had said that Weston-Smith's maternity leave had indeed played a part in the layoff decision. Some time later, Bowles invited Weston-Smith to lunch. Regarding that lunch, Weston-Smith testified at deposition:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donna [Bowles] invited me out to lunch at the Northampton Brewery and I asked her at that time, during that luncheon which she invited me to, because I had a lot of questions, what was going on, why was I laid off. I asked her about the conversation she had with Cathy Neumann, about the fact that Cathy had told me that the reason I was laid off, I mean that, you know, she had a conversation with Donna about the conversation that Donna and Cathy had had and that Cathy had related that information to me and I asked her about why Donna had said that about the fact that I had been laid off because of my maternity leave and when I asked her that question, when I asked Donna that question at that luncheon, she clearly looked extremely uncomfortable and didn't answer. She sat there and turned color, you know, turned bright red and didn't answer the question, you know, he she [sic] evaded the issue, tried to talk about something different. I tried to bring her back to that question, I wanted to have the answer, but she clearly &#8212; her body language told me that she was well aware of what I was talking about, but she did not answer the question in words.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowles denied at deposition that she ever said anything to Neumann regarding the reasons Weston-Smith was laid off. Neumann also denied that Bowles ever said anything of this kind, or that Neumann ever had a conversation on this topic with Weston-Smith. Weston-Smith's own testimony is therefore the primary evidence that she claims entitles her to a jury trial, although she also makes other arguments that we address in the course of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment. <i>Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some years ago the Supreme Court set up two different models for analysis of employment discrimination cases, depending on whether an employee presented direct evidence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> of discrimination or relied solely on circumstantial evidence. <i>See Price Waterhouse v.

Under the 1991 Act amending Title VII, the employer may then assert an affirmative defense, bearing the burdens of production and persuasion, that it \"would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor.\" Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, &#167; 107, 105 Stat. 1071, 1075-76 (1991), <i>codified at</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). On such a showing in a mixed-motive case, the employer may then avoid liability for monetary damages and reinstatement. But so long as the employee has shown that the impermissible factor was a motive, even if not the determinative motive, the employer will still be subject to declaratory and limited injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees. <i>Id.</i> Although the 1991 Act is silent on exactly what showing is needed to trigger a mixed-motive case, and so might be read to leave open the possibility of a mixed-motive analysis following a sufficiently strong circumstantial showing of discrimination, many courts require an employee to produce direct evidence that establishes discrimination was a motive before employing such an analysis. <i>See generally Fernandes v.

Third, it imposes on the employer the burdens of production and persuasion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> unlike the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> model, which merely shifts to the employer the burden of producing admissible evidence to support a non-discriminatory reason for its actions. <i>Smith v.

The district court concluded that Weston-Smith's testimony about Neumann's supposed statement about what Bowles purportedly said is double hearsay and inadmissible. <i>Weston-Smith,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 69. Weston-Smith does not challenge that conclusion on appeal. The appellate issue instead concerns Bowles's silence in the face of Weston-Smith's accusation that Bowles had made the statement to Neumann. The district court held it was of doubtful admissibility and so ambiguous that it could not be considered direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation. <i>Id.</i> at 69-70.

Weston-Smith argues that the underlying statement &#8212; that Bowles was laid off because of her maternity leave &#8212; is an admission, that Bowles is for this purpose an agent of the Hospital, and that Bowles's failure to respond to Weston-Smith when accused of making the statement constitutes Bowles's adoption of that admission &#8212; on behalf of the Hospital &#8212; by silence. Weston-Smith could not get the statement into evidence otherwise because Bowles and Neumann deny the encounter. Her argument presents two questions: whether the statement itself met the criteria for the admission of a party-opponent, and if so whether Bowles by her silence adopted that admission at the lunch with Weston-Smith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the general requirements for an admission. For the statement of an employee to be the admission of a corporate or institutional employer, it must fit within subsection (C) or (D) of Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2), which reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admission by party-opponent. The statement is offered against a party and is (A) the party's own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity or (B) a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth, or (C) a statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject, or (D) a statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship, or (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The contents of the statement shall be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant's authority under subdivision (C), the agency or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision (D), or the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered under subdivision (E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement of an individual defendant may be a direct admission under subsection (A). Bowles is not a defendant; the Hospital is. In order for the statement to be an admission, therefore, Weston-Smith must show through evidence other than the statement itself either that Bowles was authorized by the Hospital to make the statement or that Bowles was the Hospital's agent and the statement concerned a matter within the scope of her employment, made while she was employed. As we discuss below, she must also show that Bowles adopted the statement through her silence in the face of Weston-Smith's accusation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that the relevant decisionmaker in this case was Melin, the Hospital's President. It is also undisputed that Bowles had held the position of Vice President for Patient Care Services, that her position was eliminated, and that she became one of the five Program Directors, the Program Director of Medical Services. Moreover, there was evidence that Bowles was not at all involved in the decision to lay Weston-Smith off: the testimony was that Melin, without discussing the fate of specific individuals, told his management team, including Bowles, about the new overall structure he had in mind; that Melin told her his reasons for putting Neumann into the new position; and that Bowles thus learned that Weston-Smith's position would be eliminated. Nevertheless, Bowles was Weston-Smith's direct supervisor, and we do not think it is clear that a statement regarding the reasons for Weston-Smith's termination would necessarily be outside the scope of her employment. Even assuming that the matter was within the scope of Bowles's employment, however, the district court's other reasons for holding Bowles's silence not to amount to direct evidence are solid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court wrote that it was doubtful that Bowles's silence could constitute an adoptive admission, and that if admissible it did not amount to direct evidence. <i>Weston-Smith,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 69-70. Weston-Smith's theory is that Bowles, by failing to deny the statement that she had told Neumann that Weston-Smith had been laid off because of her maternity leave, adopted that statement. <i>See generally</i> 2 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> &#167; 262 (J. Strong et al. eds., 5th ed.1999) (discussing the doctrine of admission by silence). The trial judge plays a screening role in ruling whether a party (or, as here, its agent) has adopted an admission by silence. In <i>Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750689\"><a href=\"/opinion/750689/waldo-g-vazquez-v-carlos-lopez-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998), we held that \"[i]n all [such] cases, the burden is on the proponent to convince the judge that in the circumstances of the case a failure to respond is so unnatural that it supports the inference that the party acquiesced in the statement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 35 (quoting <i>Ricciardi v. Children's Hosp. Med. Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482846\"><a href=\"/opinion/482846/peter-j-ricciardi-v-the-childrens-hospital-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <i>Weinstein's Evidence</i> &#167; 801(d)(2)(B)[01], at 801-202 n.15 (1985))). In making the evaluation, the trial judge considers the nature of the statement, the identity of the person offering the testimony, the identity of the maker of the statement, the context, and whether the circumstances as a whole show that the lack of a denial is so unnatural as to support an inference that the undenied statement was true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These circumstances do not meet that standard. It was a social occasion: Bowles had invited Weston-Smith to lunch. Weston-Smith testified that during that lunch, she told Bowles that Neumann had said that Bowles had made the statement to Neumann. The district court correctly concluded that in context there might have been a great many reasons why Bowles was silent on the point and changed the subject, and those other reasons made it far from unnatural for Bowles to handle the matter as she did. <i>Weston-Smith,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 69. We add another: Bowles could not know what Neumann had or had not said to Weston-Smith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See</i> 5 <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence</i> &#167; 801.31[3][d], at 801-58 (J. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2001) (\"[A] court may find, after evaluating the type of statement and who made it, that the party could not have been expected to deny it because the party lacked the information necessary to assess its truthfulness.\") The silence was not an adoptive admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if the district court, exercising its discretion, might have concluded that the evidence just barely met the criteria for admissibility, the court was plainly correct to hold that this was not direct evidence. Its probative value is not sufficiently strong. The reasons why Bowles did not respond with a vigorous denial were ambiguous at best, and Bowles was neither involved in the decision nor necessarily aware of the reasons Weston-Smith lost her job. From this conclusion it follows that Weston-Smith must present her case within the burden-shifting framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>McDonnell Douglas</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Weston-Smith's evidence did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Hospital's articulated legitimate reason for the layoff was a pretext. <i>Weston-Smith,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 71. The Hospital's stated reasons justify both Melin's decision to eliminate Weston-Smith's original position and his preference for Neumann over Weston-Smith for the new Surgical Program Director position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Hospital's reasons</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Melin testified as follows. He was responsible both for creating the new management structure resulting from the need to cut staff and for picking the new Surgical Program Director. The Hospital lacked the funds to maintain both a new Surgical Program Director and the Peri-Operative Services Director, the position Weston-Smith held. Weston-Smith's maternity leave had, he said, nothing to do with the elimination of her position. The restructuring affected about 20 jobs, although this number includes some employees who were rehired in new positions, as Neumann was. Employees other than Weston-Smith were laid off, including at least one higher in the organization than she, and other management positions were eliminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the reorganization, Neumann as the new Surgical Program Director assumed all of Weston-Smith's prior responsibilities, plus additional ones. Melin had considered both Weston-Smith and Neumann for the new job, which was in many ways similar to Weston-Smith's old job. He picked Neumann because she, in his view, fit better into the upgraded job, now a part of senior management. Melin thought the difference between the old job and the new one was that the old was a \"management role\"; the new, a \"senior management,\" or \"leadership,\" role requiring \"leadership and support from the rest of the organization and a vision for a bigger picture.\" He had two primary reasons for selecting Neumann. First, he had observed Neumann's leadership skills when she served as chair of the Hospital's successful, recent capital campaign. During that process &#8212; which involved asking employees to contribute to the Hospital's fundraising for a new building even as it laid other employees off &#8212; Melin had seen Neumann build loyalty and morale, and win employee support. Second, he had faced Neumann at the bargaining table. She had been chair of the nurses' collective bargaining unit for a number of years; Melin had seen that she was skilled with budgets and that she could lead. She won his respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Weston-Smith's response</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith argues that a jury could find these reasons to be pretext on several grounds. The elimination of the position to save money, she says, was pretextual because the new job was really her old one without significant changes. Moreover, the total number of positions in her department stayed the same, and the salary of her former job was increased when it became the Surgical Director's job. This argument takes too myopic a view; overall, several management positions were eliminated, so that the reorganization did save the Hospital money. That the reorganized jobs encompassed functions of former jobs is unsurprising. Functions rarely go away; but how functions are handled does change, and changes can lead to greater efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith is correct that an employer may not try to shield a discriminatory or retaliatory termination by hiding it in a layoff. <i>Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196571\"><a href=\"/opinion/196571/smith-v-fw-morse-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 422 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Whether or not trimming the fat from a company's organizational chart is a prudent practice in a particular business environment, the employer's decision to eliminate specific positions must not be tainted by a discriminatory animus.\"). But there is little, if any, admissible evidence suggesting that the decision to merge Weston-Smith's job function into a higher level job in a streamlined organization was motivated by either retaliation or discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith's attack on the reasons given for the choice of Neumann over Weston-Smith herself as pretextual is similarly flawed. Weston-Smith says that Melin's generalized subjective assessments about \"leadership\" and \"vision\" to support the creation of a new job and the choice of Neumann are insufficient. Subjective judgment may mask an improper motive, as Weston-Smith suggests. Melin's explanation, however, is not sheer subjectivity. Melin had observed Neumann over a period of years as she successfully performed demanding tasks. These tasks &#8212; heading the capital campaign and the nurses' bargaining unit &#8212; demonstrated Neumann's skills. Absent further evidence of discrimination or retaliation, which Weston-Smith has not produced, there is no reasonable inference of pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Melin's statement that he wanted Neumann on his senior management team must be pretext, Weston-Smith argues, because Weston-Smith was terminated and discouraged from even applying for the new position before Neumann was ever told of or accepted the new position. No reasonable inference of pretext can be drawn from this. Although it was not certain that Neumann would accept, it is improbable that she would decline a position with higher pay on the senior management team, working directly under Melin, whom she knew. Moreover, the Hospital might easily have wished to avoid the awkward situation of informing Neumann, then Weston-Smith's subordinate, of the decision to lay Weston-Smith off before Weston-Smith herself found out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weston-Smith also relies on her relative qualifications for the new job compared with Neumann's. She stresses Neumann's testimony that she had no management experience and did not have a masters degree, while Weston-Smith had both. This argument is nothing more than second-guessing Melin's decision about whose skill set would be more valuable. That Melin might have decided in Weston-Smith's favor based on her own skills would not permit a jury to infer that his choice of Neumann was either discrimination or retaliation. Moreover, Weston-Smith places too much emphasis on whether a job was termed \"management\" and on credentials. Melin could reasonably look behind labels and degrees, and rely on his own experience with Neumann and observation of her leadership skills, regardless of whether she had played a union or a management role at the time. That approach does not render his decision so unlikely as to permit, from that and little more, a jury inference of improper motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond her attacks on the Hospital's proffered reason, Weston-Smith presents a few more pieces of circumstantial evidence of discrimination or retaliation on the Hospital's part. These consist of her own testimony that she overheard two doctors complaining about her absence on maternity leave; Neumann's additional testimony that there had been complaints about Weston-Smith's \"[l]ack of accessibility\" (although not that these complaints were related to the maternity leave); and Bowles's silence, if admissible, in the face of Weston-Smith's accusatory question. As to the testimony of complaints, nothing links those complaints to the decision process; nor do they appear sufficiently pervasive to justify a finder of fact in inferring such a link. As to the silence, we have already given the reasons that, if admissible, it has little probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Weston-Smith has produced insufficient evidence to take her case to a jury within the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework. Although her prima facie case is undisputed, the Hospital's proffered reasons for her termination are plausible and coherent, and neither her criticisms of those reasons nor her independent circumstantial evidence of an improper motive, whether taken apart or together, are sufficient to require a jury trial. <i>See Zapata-Matos v.

This is particularly plausible because, even on Weston-Smith's version of events, Bowles was speaking to Neumann, not to Weston-Smith</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
