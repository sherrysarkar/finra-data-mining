Fairbrothers, Regional Attorney, with\r\nwhom Darren F. Corrente, Regional Attorney, was on brief for\r\nappellants Rhode Island Laborers' District Council, Local Union\r\n808, et al.\r\n   Miriam Weizenbaum with whom Amato A. DeLuca and DeLuca &amp;\r\nWeizenbaum, Ltd. were on consolidated brief for appellants David E.\r\nPerry, et al.\r\n   Thomas A. Palombo, Special Assistant Attorney General, State\r\nof Rhode Island, Department of Attorney General, and Harris K.\r\nWeiner, Deputy Executive Counsel to the Governor, on consolidated\r\nbrief for appellees State of Rhode Island, Governor Lincoln C.\r\nAlmond, General Treasurer Nancy J. Mayer, Attorney General\r\nJeffrey B. Pine, Director of Administration Robert L. Carl, Jr.,\r\nand Supreme Court Administrator Robert C. Harrall. \r\n\nMay 27, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  In 1976, Rhode Island adopted a\r\nstatute, entitled Court Clerks' Incentive Pay, providing salary\r\nbonuses for state court clerks who obtained certain degrees.  1976\r\nR.I. Pub.  Laws ch. 205,  1, codified as amended at R.I. Gen. Laws\r\n8-4.1-1 to 8-4.1-5 (1997).  A 10 percent salary increase was\r\nprovided for a court clerk who obtained an Associate's Degree in\r\nfields relating to law enforcement or administration of justice; a\r\nBachelor's Degree in such a field or any field suitable for\r\nadmission to an accredited law school was worth a 16 percent\r\nincrease.\r\nAfter almost 20 years, Rhode Island in 1994 amended the\r\nstatute to replace percentage bonuses with flat rate amounts: \r\nclerks receiving the 10 percent increase would instead receive\r\n$2,000 yearly, and clerks receiving the 16 percent increase would\r\nreceive $3,200.  1994 R.I. Pub. Laws, ch. 125,  1, codified atR.I. Gen. Laws  8-4.1-3 (1997).  Clerks hired after July 5, 1994,\r\nreceived no incentive pay.  Id., codified at R.I. Gen. Laws   8-\r\n4.1-1.  The amendment provided that it would not take effect as to\r\nclerks already receiving incentive pay until the expiry of\r\ncollective bargaining agreements then in force.  Id.  2, codified\r\nat R.I. Gen. Laws  8-4.1-7.\r\nThe amendment effectively reduced the salaries of the\r\nclerks, in some cases by over $7,000 per year.  A group of clerks\r\nsued Rhode Island and its officials in the district court, claiming\r\nthat the amendment was unconstitutional.  A similar claim was made\r\nby the Rhode Island Laborers' District Council, Local Union 808\r\n(\"the union\") which represented a number but not all of the court\r\nclerks.  The union's complaint also charged that the amendment\r\nabrogated its collective bargaining agreement with Rhode Island.\r\nThe cases were consolidated before the district court,\r\nwhich heard cross-motions for summary judgment on an agreed\r\nstatement of facts.  On July 24, 1997, the district court granted\r\njudgment in favor of the state, rejecting the constitutional\r\nattacks on the amendment.  The district court explicitly declined\r\nto address a claim advanced by the union based on state collective-\r\nbargaining law because it had not been briefed or argued by the\r\nunion.\r\nThe clerks and the union now appeal, and we affirm,\r\nprimarily on the basis of the district court's decision.  No\r\ndetailed discussion of principles is needed because the pertinent\r\nlaw relating to the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I,  10, the\r\nmain pivot of the appellants' argument in this court, has been set\r\nforth in Parker v. Wakelin, 123 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1997), cert.\r\ndenied, 66 U.S.L.W. 3717 (U.S. May 5, 1998) (No. 97-1181), and\r\nMcGrath v. Rhode Island Retirement Board, 88 F.3d 12 (1st Cir.\r\n1996). \r\nAs Parker and McGrath explain, the first requisite for a\r\nContracts Clause argument is showing the existence of a contract\r\ngoverning the subject in dispute.  Although federal rather than\r\nstate standards govern this issue, General Motors Corp v. Romein,\r\n503 U.S. 181, 187 (1992), there is nothing recherch about the\r\ncriteria.  They may include not only the words used but also\r\napparent purpose, context, and any pertinent evidence of actual\r\nintent, including legislative history.  No single form of wording\r\nis essential in order to find a contractual relationship.  Cf.Parker, 123 F.3d at 9.  Further, \"a statute is itself treated as a\r\ncontract when the language and circumstances evince a legislative\r\nintent to create private rights . . . .\"  United States Trust Co.v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 17 n.14 (1977).   \r\nYet, while contracts between private parties are\r\nsometimes inferred rather easily, see McGrath, 88 F.3d at 19, the\r\nSupreme Court has for obvious reasons been more demanding where\r\nlegislative acts are claimed to create contracts binding future\r\nlegislatures.  Thus, the Supreme Court has said that such a\r\nsurrender of legislative authority must be expressed \"in terms too\r\nplain to be mistaken.\"  United States v. Winstar Corp., 116 S. Ct.\r\n2432, 2455 (1996) (quoting Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 66 U.S.\r\n(1 Black) 436, 446 (1861)).  This court has followed that precept. \r\nParker, 123 F.3d at 5.\r\nWhat has been called the \"unmistakability doctrine,\"\r\nMcGrath, 88 F.3d at 19, easily disposes of this case.  Ordinarily,\r\npay schedules for state employees can be altered at will by the\r\nlegislature.  The 1976 statute enacting incentive pay for court\r\nclerks does not say in terms that it is creating contractual rights\r\nor otherwise explicitly promise that incentive pay will never be\r\nreduced or eliminated for clerks who obtained the degrees rewarded\r\nby the statute.  Nor has any legislative history been unearthed by\r\nthe parties expressing the legislature's intention that incentive\r\npay be permanent and never subject to revision.\r\nThe only scrap of evidence identified by the clerks is\r\nthe original statute's language \"offering financial compensation\r\nfor clerks . . . for furthering their education.\"  R.I. Gen. Laws\r\n8-4.1-1 (emphasis added).  \"Offer\" is a term often used in\r\ncontract formation, but it is also a word of general usage and does\r\nnot alone convey an \"unmistakable\" intent to create a binding\r\ncontract.  It could be easily argued that the term \"compensation\"\r\nconnotes \"salary\"--normally subject to legislative adjustment--\r\nespecially because the increase was not limited to the period\r\nneeded to recoup out-of-pocket costs of education.  \r\nOf course, a clerk with a specialized degree may be worth\r\nmore to the state, justifying payment of the educational bonus\r\nafter out-of-pocket expenses have been recovered.  But this view\r\nmakes the incentive pay look more like ordinary compensation\r\nreflecting the employee's skill level, grade or seniority.  True,\r\nthere is seemingly an element of reimbursement as well--and\r\narguably some unfairness to any clerk who has not recovered his or\r\nher costs.  But the commitment was not unmistakably contractual,\r\nand that is the end of the matter under existing law.\r\n   In the district court, the union also sought declaratory\r\nrelief based upon its collective bargaining agreement with the\r\nstate.  The collective bargaining agreement at issue included some\r\naspects of the statutory incentive pay plan (as well as other bonus\r\nprovisions not contained in the statute); to that extent, the\r\nincentive pay of those clerks who were union members was\r\nindependently protected by the collective bargaining agreement.\r\n   As already noted, the 1994 amendment at issue,\r\neffectively reducing incentive pay for current clerks, stated that\r\nit would not take effect as to clerks covered by labor contracts\r\nuntil their collective bargaining agreement expired.  Thus the\r\nstatute was crafted to accommodate the agreement and not to\r\nconflict with it.  The collective bargaining agreement contained an\r\nexpiration date of June 30, 1995, provided that one party gave\r\nnotice of intent to terminate.  The union does not dispute that the\r\nstate gave timely notice.\r\n   However, there are a few references in the union's brief \r\nin this Court that could be read to suggest that the collective\r\nbargaining agreement was somehow extended because assertedly one of\r\nthe negotiating lawyers wrote a letter on July 12, 1995,\r\nrepresenting that the state would maintain \"the status quo during\r\nnegotiations.\"  Alternatively, the union may be suggesting that\r\nRhode Island's collective bargaining statute required the state to\r\ncontinue to respect the terms of the expired agreement until an\r\nimpasse was declared or a new agreement negotiated.  These\r\nsuggestions may or may not be the same arguments that the district\r\ncourt declined to address for failure to brief them.\r\n   In all events, it is patent that the union's main brief\r\nin this court does not seriously develop and support these further\r\narguments.  Any claims that the collective bargaining agreement was\r\nextended beyond its expiration date require independent structure\r\nand support.  The union's main brief contains nothing beyond terse\r\nreferences and hints.  Under well-settled precedent, these further\r\nclaims are waived, and we decline to address them on the merits. \r\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r\n494 U.S. 1082 (1990). \r\n   Affirmed.\n",
