Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n     [Hon. Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Fabio A.

Claimant Luis A. Lopez appeals from the\n\njudgment of the district court which upheld the decision of\n\nthe Commissioner of Social Security that claimant was not\n\nentitled to disability benefits.       After carefully reviewing\n\nthe record and the briefs, we affirm the district court's\n\njudgment for essentially the reasons stated in the Opinion\n\nand   Order   of   the   magistrate   judge.   We   add   only   the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n          First, the administrative law judge (ALJ) was not\n\nrequired to have consulted the Dictionary of Occupational\n\nTitles (D.O.T.) to ascertain the demands of claimant's past\n\nwork as a programmer-analyst at the Puerto Rico Electric\n\nPower Authority.         As we have stated, an ALJ usually \"is\n\nentitled to rely upon claimant's own description of the\n\nduties involved in [his] former job.\" Santiago v. Secretary\n\nof Health and Human Services, 944 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(per curiam).      Only when the ALJ is \"alerted by the record\n\nto the presence of an issue\" must the ALJ further develop\n\nthe record.        Id. (emphasis omitted).     However, claimant\n\npoints to nothing here which should have alerted the ALJ to\n\nthe need to consult outside sources such as the D.O.T.\n\n          In this regard, we note that the portions of the\n\nrecord to which claimant refers in support of the assertion\n\nthat he supervised others at the Power Authority do not show\n\fthat such a duty, in fact, was a part of his prior job.\n\nFurther, and assuming that         some contact with others was\n\nrequired, claimant completely fails to identify anything in\n\nthe record which even remotely suggests that such contact\n\noccurred frequently.       In this context, it is significant\n\nthat claimant nowhere stated that frequent contact with\n\nothers was a reason he could not perform his prior job as a\n\nprogrammer-analyst.       We think it fair to assume that if\n\nfrequent contact was, in fact, required and if claimant\n\ncould   not   tolerate    such    contact,     claimant    would   have\n\nmentioned it somewhere.         The ALJ's conclusion that claimant\n\ncould   perform   his    past   work     therefore   is   supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f",
