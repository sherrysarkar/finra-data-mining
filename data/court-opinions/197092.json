ST\r\n\nis a railroad operator located in Springfield, Massachusetts,\r\n\nand a carrier for  purposes of the RLA.  BLE  and UTU are two\r\n\nof  several  trade  unions  who  have  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreements with ST.  The  individual plaintiffs in this  case\r\n\nbelong to BLE.      The RLA authorizes carriers and unions to\r\n\nestablish union shops.  A union shop in the railroad industry\r\n\nsimply means that in order to remain employed with a railroad\r\n\ncompany, employees  must belong to  one of the  national, RLA\r\n\nrecognized  railroad   unions.     See  45  U.S.C.       152,\r                                                  \r\n\nEleventh(a)  and (c).1    ST and  the  unions with  which  it\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  45 U.S.C.    152 has  been drafted  in subsections  First\r\nthrough Eleventh.  Section 152, Eleventh contains subsections\r\na through d.  We note the unusual numbering scheme to explain\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nmaintains collective bargaining agreements have established a\r\n\nunion shop.  \r\n\n          Employment in the railroad industry revolves around\r\n\ncrafts or classes of work, each of which is represented  by a\r\n\ndifferent  union.    Train   service  and  engineer   service\r\n\nconstitute  two   such  crafts.     The   former  encompasses\r\n\nconductors, brakemen,  trainmen and  yardmen, and  the latter\r\n\nincludes primarily locomotive engineers.   UTU represents the\r\n\ntrain service  craft and BLE represents  the engineer service\r\n\ncraft.      \r\n\n          By  practice,  junior  engineers  advance  from the\r\n\nranks of the train service employees.  Over the course of any\r\n\ngiven  year,  however,  the   amount  of  engineer  work  may\r\n\nfluctuate.   During periods of reduced  engineer work, junior\r\n\nengineers may have to return temporarily to train  service in\r\n\norder to remain employed.2  Junior engineers, therefore, have\r\n\nan  economic  interest  in  maintaining  their  train service\r\n\nseniority.  \r\n\n          Prior  to  1995, the  UTU-ST  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement  allowed non-UTU  member engineers  to continue  to\r\n\naccrue  train  service  seniority.   In  1995,  however,  UTU\r\n\nnegotiated a  provision known  as Article 21,  which requires\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nour citation.  \r\n\n2.  In its reply brief, BLE appears to hint that the  ebb and\r\nflow  of train service employees to and from engineer service\r\noccurs with less regularity today than in prior eras.   \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nthat employees moving from  train service to engineer service\r\n\npay dues to UTU in  order to maintain and continue  to accrue\r\n\ntheir train service seniority.   When BLE objected to Article\r\n\n21,  ST offered  it a similar  provision which  BLE rejected,\r\n\napparently  believing  it  to  be  of  little  value  to  its\r\n\nmembership.  \r\n\n          BLE then challenged  Article 21 on RLA grounds.  It\r\n\nsought preliminary injunctive relief which the district court\r\n\ndenied.   Subsequently, on cross motions,  the district court\r\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of UTU and ST.  This appeal\r\n\nfollowed. \r\n\n                      Standard of Review\r                                  Standard of Review\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review  the award  of summary judgment  de novo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nOrtiz-Pinero v.

First,\r\n\nBLE contends, Article 21 violates the prohibition of mandated\r\n\ndual unionism  under 45 U.S.C.    152, Eleventh(c).   Second,\r\n\nBLE   urges,  Article   21   impermissibly  interferes   with\r\n\nemployees' rights to organize and choose their own collective\r\n\nbargaining representative  under 45 U.S.C.     152, Third and\r\n\nFourth.   Finally,  BLE asserts,  the RLA,  45 U.S.C.    156,\r\n\nrequired  UTU  and ST  to provide  BLE, an  interested party,\r\n\nnotice of  their contract negotiations and  an opportunity to\r\n\nparticipate in  them.   We conclude  that the  district court\r\n\nably analyzed each of BLE's arguments and properly found them\r\n\nlacking in substance.  We affirm.\r\n\n          A.  45 U.S.C.   152, Eleventh(c)\r                                                      \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          According to  BLE, Article 21 violates  45 U.S.C.  \r\n\n152,  Eleventh(c), part of  the union shop  provisions of the\r\n\nRLA.  Analysis of BLE's argument requires a brief detour into\r\n\nthe background  of the  union shop provisions  generally, and\r\n\nhow   152, Eleventh(c) fits into the union shop scheme.  \r\n\n          Under 45  U.S.C.    152, Eleventh(a),  carriers and\r\n\nunions may  establish union shops.   Section 152, Eleventh(a)\r\n\nspecifically  provides  that carriers  and  unions  may \"make\r\n\nagreements, requiring as a condition of continued employment,\r\n\nthat  . . . all  employees shall become  members of the labor\r\n\norganization  representing their  craft or  class.\"   Read in\r\n\nisolation, the  plain language of this  provision would allow\r\n\ncarriers and unions to require employees to belong not to the\r\n\nunion  of their  choice, but  to the  union certified  as the\r\n\nrepresentative of their craft or class.\r\n\n          Organized labor petitioned  Congress for the  union\r\n\nshop  option  in  order  to eradicate  the  problem  of \"free\r\n\nriders,\"  railroad employees who do not pay dues to any union\r\n\nbut  receive whatever benefits collective bargaining confers.\r\n\nSee generally Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Rychlik, 352 U.S. 480,\r                                                          \r\n\n489-94  (1957).   In  acceding to  labor's request,  however,\r\n\nCongress recognized that the intercraft mobility not uncommon\r\n\nin the railroad  industry could pose a  problem for employees\r\n\nin  a  union shop.   Under     152, Eleventh(a),  an employee\r\n\nshuttling  between train  service and engineer  service could\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\neither  be forced to change unions  or to belong and pay dues\r\n\nto  two unions until reaching a level of seniority sufficient\r\n\nto  stabilize him  as  an engineer.    As the  Supreme  Court\r\n\npointed out,  \"[t]he former alternative would,  of course, be\r\n\nexpensive and sometimes impossible, while the latter would be\r\n\ncomplicated and  might mean the  loss of seniority  and union\r\n\nbenefits.\"  Id. at 490.       Congress  attempted  to  tailor\r                           \r\n\nunion shops to accommodate intercraft mobility through   152,\r\n\nEleventh(c).  That subsection provides, \"[t]he requirement of\r\n\nmembership in a labor organization in [a union shop] shall be\r\n\nsatisfied  . .  .  if said  employee  shall hold  or  acquire\r\n\nmembership in any one of the labor organizations, national in\r\n\nscope, organized in accordance with this chapter.\"  45 U.S.C.\r\n\n  152, Eleventh(c).   On its face,   152  Eleventh(c) appears\r\n\nto contradict   152, Eleventh(a) by allowing any  employee in\r\n\nany  union  shop  to belong  to  any  of  the RLA  recognized\r\n\nrailroad unions. \r\n\n          The  purpose   of     152,   Eleventh(c),  however,\r\n\nsignificantly circumscribes its language.   See Rychlik,  352\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S.  at 488, 492; see  also Landers v.  Nat'l R.R. Passenger\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp.,  814  F.2d  41,  44-45 (1st  Cir.  1987)  (recognizing\r                 \r\n\nlimited applicability of   152, Eleventh(c)), aff'd, 485 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n652 (1988).

Section 152,\r                                        \r\n\nEleventh(c) does  not exist  to benefit unions  by permitting\r\n\nthem to recruit  members from the ranks  of other established\r\n\nunions, or to provide railroad employees with a general right\r\n\nto  join   unions  other   than  the   designated  bargaining\r\n\nrepresentative  of their  craft,  except to  meet the  narrow\r\n\nproblem of intercraft mobility in a union shop.

BLE\r\n\nessentially attacks  Article 21 from two angles.   First, BLE\r\n\ncontends, Article 21 constitutes  either a   152, Eleventh(a)\r\n\nunion  shop agreement that violates    152, Eleventh(c) or an\r\n\namendment to  the existing  ST-UTU agreement that  violates  \r\n\n152, Eleventh(c).  Second, BLE argues, Article  21 will upset\r\n\n\"the cost  sharing scheme which was continued and fostered by\r\n\nthe 1951 union shop amendments.\"  We disagree.  \r\n\n          On its  face, Article  21 can neither  constitute a\r\n\nunion shop agreement by  itself, nor an amendment to  the ST-\r\n\nUTU  agreement that  violates  Eleventh(c).

Failure  to pay,  however, would  not\r\n\naffect accrued seniority.  In examining whether the provision\r\n\nconstituted  a  union  shop  agreement,  the Seventh  Circuit\r\n\nrelied in part on the fact that it did not require payment of\r\n\ndues to  UTU in order  to retain accrued  seniority, implying\r\n\nthat  such   a  provision  might  constitute   a  union  shop\r\n\nprovision.

Id.  \r                           \r\n\n          In our view,  the extra step Article  21 takes with\r\n\nrespect to  accrued seniority does not  create any conditions\r\n\non employment  different from the  provision in Dempsey.   As\r                                                                   \r\n\nindicated,  nothing  on  the  face  of  Article  21  requires\r\n\nemployees  to  belong to  UTU  in order  to  remain employed.\r\n\nDespite  the fact  that Article  21 takes  the extra  step of\r\n\nconditioning  seniority retention  and  accrual on  continued\r\n\ndues payment, an engineer who chooses  BLE over UTU satisfies\r\n\neither of the UTU-ST  or BLE-ST union shop requirements.   To\r\n\nthe extent, therefore, that  Dempsey implies that a provision\r                                                \r\n\nsuch as Article 21 might constitute a union shop agreement or\r\n\namendment, we respectfully disagree.   \r\n\n          BLE, however, asserts that engineers who choose BLE\r\n\nover UTU run the  risk of unemployment when shuttled  back to\r\n\ntrain  service,  since  they   will  have  no  train  service\r\n\nseniority.   According to BLE, this  effectively forces those\r\n\nengineers at the  lower end  of the  engineer seniority  list\r\n\neither to belong to UTU and BLE, or to UTU instead of BLE, as\r\n\na  condition of continued employment at ST.  BLE asserts that\r\n\n  152, Eleventh(c) allows a railroad employee in a union shop\r\n\nto  change  membership to  any  other  RLA recognized  union,\r\n\n\"without  putting   himself  out  of   compliance  with   the\r\n\nmembership requirement  of a  valid union shop  agreement and\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nthereby  cause a  loss of  seniority and  employment rights.\"\r\n\nBLE's argument  requires  us to  determine  whether      152,\r\n\nEleventh(c), in protecting  against compulsory dual unionism,\r\n\nelevates  seniority  into   a  statutorily  protected   right\r\n\nemployees may take with them as they move from craft to craft\r\n\nand union to union.      \r\n\n          By  its own  language,  the  RLA governs  relations\r\n\nbetween   carriers,   unions  and   employees,  and      152,\r\n\nEleventh(c)  dictates  the  limits  of  what carriers  and/or\r\n\nunions can demand of employees in a union shop.  Within those\r\n\nparameters,  which include  a prohibition on  compulsory dual\r\n\nunionism, the RLA makes no  mention of seniority, and notably\r\n\nfails to designate seniority as a protected employment right.\r\n\n          In the absence  of a  legislative pronouncement  to\r\n\nthe contrary, union contracts  typically define the scope and\r\n\nsignificance of seniority rights.

The  NRAB exists  to\r\n\nsettle   disputes   arising   under   collective   bargaining\r\n\nagreements.  See  Rychlik, 352 U.S. at  487.  As the  Seventh\r                                     \r\n\nCircuit  pointed  out,  this requirement  limits  union  shop\r\n\nparticipation  to  those  unions  which share  the  costs  of\r\n\nadministering  the NRAB,  and which  \"join together  in other\r\n\nrespects  in  the  negotiating  and  policing  of  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreements  under the  dispute  mechanisms of  the\r\n\nRLA.\"   Dempsey, 16 F.3d at  840.

In  post-certification disputes, therefore,\r\n\nwe  must  limit  our  intervention  to  cases  in  which  the\r\n\naggrieved union has no other remedy \"to enforce the statutory\r\n\ncommands which Congress had written into the [RLA].\"  Id.  \r                                                                     \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          We  have  concluded that  intervention  in  a post-\r\n\ncertification  dispute under     152,  Third and  Fourth will\r\n\noccur in extremely limited  circumstances.

We need not recite all\r\n\nof them here.

Wightman, 915 F. Supp. at 507.  While BLE's facts\r                                \r\n\nevince competitive jockeying between it and UTU, they notably\r\n\nfail to  demonstrate anti-BLE animus or  a fundamental attack\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\non the bargaining process by ST.5   Accordingly, the District\r\n\nCourt   correctly  declined  to   intervene  in   this  post-\r\n\ncertification matter.\r\n\n          BLE also contends that  Article 21 violates    152,\r\n\nThird and Fourth as a matter  of law.6  BLE offers  precedent\r\n\nunder  the National  Labor Relations  Act (\"NLRA\"),  which it\r\n\nseeks to apply  analogically to this railroad dispute.  While\r\n\nthe NLRA may provide analogies that bear on interpretation of\r\n\nthe RLA,  the Supreme  Court has  emphasized  that \"the  NLRA\r\n\n'cannot be imported wholesale into the railway labor arena.'\"\r\n\nTWA,  489  U.S.  at  439 (quoting  Trainmen  v.

We especially hesitate\r                    \r\n\nto  employ   NLRA  precedent  in  light  of   the  clear  and\r\n\nunequivocal  RLA  precedent  from  the  Supreme  Court,  this\r\n\ncircuit  and  others,  which  underscores the  limited  post-\r\n\ncertification  application of    152,  Third and Fourth.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nTWA, 489 U.S. at  441 (limiting application of     152, Third\r               \r\n\nand  Fourth   to  pre-certification  contexts);   Nat'l  R.R.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  To  be  sure, it  does not  appear  that ST  was entirely\r\ncandid with BLE  regarding its negotiations with UTU  and the\r\nsubstance of the  ST-UTU agreement.   The RLA, however,  does\r\nnot  compel ST to inform BLE of the substance of negotiations\r\nwith a third union, and we do not identify anti-BLE animus in\r\nST's actions.  \r\n\n6.  BLE essentially  argues that  by making it  so attractive\r\nfor  engineers  to join  UTU, Article  21  has the  effect of\r\nimpermissibly interfering  with their  free choice  of union,\r\nand  coercing them to join UTU, in violation of    152, Third\r\nand Fourth.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nPassenger, 915 F.2d at 51 (same); see also Kansas City S., 26\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 795; Dempsey, 16 F.3d at 841.  Finally,   BLE  argues\r                                \r\n\nsomewhat opaquely that a wage deduction provision only passes\r\n\nRLA muster if  it comprises  part of a  union shop  agreement\r\n\nunder   152, Eleventh.  At the outset we note that Article 21\r\n\nby itself  does  not  refer  to wage  deductions,  much  less\r\n\nmandate  them.    Assuming  such  a  wage  deduction  exists,\r\n\nhowever,  we disagree  with BLE's  interpretation of     152,\r\n\nFourth and Eleventh(b).  \r\n\n          As indicated,   152, Fourth provides that  carriers\r\n\nmay  not  deduct union  dues  or  fees  from employee  wages.\r\n\nSection 152, Eleventh(b), however, provides that carriers and\r\n\nlabor  organizations may  make agreements  providing for  the\r\n\ndeduction  of  \"any  periodic   dues,  initiation  fees,  and\r\n\nassessments\" from employee wages as long as the  employee has\r\n\ngiven  the  carrier written  permission.   45  U.S.C.    152,\r\n\nEleventh(b).   Section 152,  Eleventh(b), unlike Eleventh(c),\r\n\ndoes  not limit  its applicability  to Eleventh(a),  or union\r\n\nshop agreement situations.   See Kansas City S., 26  F.3d. at\r                                                           \r\n\n794.  Read  together,    152, Fourth and  Eleventh(b) provide\r\n\nthat carriers may not  unilaterally deduct dues from employee\r\n\nwages,  but may  do  so upon  the  agreement of  all  parties\r\n\ninvolved.  See id.  Thus, even in the absence of a union shop\r                              \r\n\nagreement,  employees  and  carriers  may  agree  to  a  dues\r\n\ndeduction schedule under   152, Eleventh(b).  \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          C.  45 U.S.C.   156, Bargainable Interest\r                                                               \r\n\n          BLE contends  that the District Court  erred in not\r\n\nsetting Article 21 aside on the  basis that UTU and ST failed\r\n\nto  notify  BLE of  their  negotiations, and  afford  BLE the\r\n\nopportunity to participate in them.  \r\n\n          The    RLA    mandates    that   \"[c]arriers    and\r\n\nrepresentatives of  the employees shall give  at least thirty\r\n\ndays'  written notice  of  an intended  change in  agreements\r\n\naffecting  rates of  pay,  rules, or  working conditions\"  to\r\n\ninterested  parties.  45 U.S.C.   156.  BLE identifies itself\r\n\nas an interested  party, and contends that ST or  UTU owed it\r\n\nnotice.   BLE also  contends that  it has  joint jurisdiction\r\n\nover collective bargaining between ST and UTU, at least  with\r\n\nrespect to  train service seniority,  by dint of  the routine\r\n\nshuttling of employees between the train service and engineer\r\n\nservice crafts.   According  to BLE, that  joint jurisdiction\r\n\nshouldhavegivenitanopportunitytoparticipateinthenegotiations.\r\n\n          The  Eighth Circuit  recently faced  BLE's argument\r\n\nand  concluded  that  neither the  carrier  nor  UTU had  any\r\n\nstatutory  obligation  to  provide  BLE with  notice  or  the\r\n\nopportunity to participate in negotiations, a conclusion with\r\n\nwhich we substantially agree.  See Kansas City S., 26 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n792.  45 U.S.C.    156 exists to prevent either a  carrier or\r\n\nunion from  unilaterally changing the terms  of the operative\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.

Section\r                                         \r\n\n156, therefore,  furthers the overall  purpose of the  RLA to\r\n\npermit   employees   to    choose   their   own    bargaining\r\n\nrepresentative  freely, and  to ensure  a procedure  for \"the\r\n\ncommencement  of conferences  between representatives  of the\r\n\ntwo  parties  if changes  are to  be  made in  the contract.\"\r\n\nMcMullans, 229 F.2d  at 56.   Section 156  does not exist  to\r                     \r\n\nopen collective bargaining negotiations between a carrier and\r\n\na union to any other union claiming an interest.  \r\n\n          BLE relies  chiefly on two cases,  neither of which\r\n\ncompel the conclusion  BLE seeks.

The court\r\n\ndetermined that in the  absence of a certified representative\r\n\nfor  the  new  class,  any  union  that  could  fairly  claim\r\n\nrepresentation  over  the   apprentices  could   legitimately\r\n\nbargain  with the carrier  about the terms  and conditions of\r\n\nthe apprentices'  employment.

By demonstrating  a fair\r                                              \r\n\nclaim  of  representation, therefore,  a union  established a\r\n\nright to notice and the  opportunity to participate under the\r\n\nRLA.

This  case,  by contrast,  involves collective\r                     \r\n\nbargaining between a represented class of employees and their\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ncarrier.  BLE  does not  assert any  claim of  representation\r\n\nover UTU members, nor could it.  Train service employees have\r\n\nalready  certified UTU  as  their bargaining  representative.\r\n\nNational Mediation Board,  therefore, does not  support BLE's\r                                    \r\n\nasserted interest in the  negotiations that produced  Article\r\n\n21.\r\n\n          BLE  also  relies on  Illinois  Cent.

The  dispute in  Illinois  Central involved  a\r                                                             \r\n\ntripartite  agreement  between  the  carrier,  BLE  and   UTU\r\n\ngoverning the  list of  train service employees  eligible for\r\n\nengineer work.  UTU  filed suit when BLE sought  to negotiate\r\n\nrevisions to  the rules governing the  list without providing\r\n\nUTU notice  and an  opportunity to  participate.   The court,\r\n\nnoting the tripartite agreement,  determined that UTU and BLE\r\n\nshared  joint  negotiating  interests  over  the   list,  and\r\n\ntherefore,  that BLE  could  not unilaterally  negotiate rule\r\n\nrevisions with the carrier.  Id. at 141.\r                                            \r\n\n          Obviously  no formal tripartite agreement exists in\r\n\nthis  case.   BLE, however,  points  to language  in Illinois\r                                                                         \r\n\nCentral  indicating  that even  in  the  absence of  such  an\r                   \r\n\nagreement, the  ebb and  flow  of employees  between the  two\r\n\ncrafts would give the firemen an \"important economic stake in\r\n\nthe  rules regulating  the  extra list\"  which in  turn would\r\n\nestablish a bargainable interest  in UTU over rules governing\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nthe list.  Id. at 141-42.   BLE argues that the same ebb  and\r                          \r\n\nflow  vests it with a bargainable interest in the negotiation\r\n\nof train service seniority.  \r\n\n          We disagree with  BLE's interpretation of  Illinois\r                                                                         \r\n\nCentral.   First, that case revolved around a list outside of\r                   \r\n\neither UTU's  or BLE's collective bargaining  agreements with\r\n\nthe  carrier.  The rules  governing the extra list, moreover,\r\n\nplaced direct  conditions on  a fireman's employment  -- they\r\n\ndictated which of the  firemen could also engage in  engineer\r\n\nwork.   BLE's assumption of  sole negotiating  responsibility\r\n\nover rules governing the  list placed BLE in the  position of\r\n\nrepresenting firemen  even though  the firemen had  certified\r\n\nUTU as their collective bargaining agent.  \r\n\n          In this  case, by  contrast, UTU  does not  seek to\r\n\nunilaterally govern  the ebb and  flow itself.   UTU, through\r\n\nArticle  21,  has simply  negotiated  with  ST the  mechanism\r\n\nthrough which  train service employees  accrue seniority,  as\r\n\npart of  negotiations over  a  general collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement.   BLE and UTU have no tripartite agreement, nor is\r\n\nUTU  attempting  to unilaterally  negotiate  a  set of  rules\r\n\ngoverning movement between the two crafts.  \r\n\n          As the Eighth Circuit concluded, \r\n\n          \"[t]he  distinctive division  of railroad\r\n          employees  under the  RLA into  crafts or\r\n          classes,  and  the  regular  movement  of\r\n          employees  among  the   crafts  that   is\r\n          characteristic of  the industry, portends\r\n          overlapping 'interests'  among bargaining\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          units  in the  composition of  the crafts\r\n          and in their labor agreements.  That sort\r\n          of  interest,  however,  does not  confer\r\n          upon all  unions the right to  notice and\r\n          participation in the arbitrations  of all\r\n          other unions.\"\r\n\nKansas City S., 26 F.3d at  791-92.  We conclude that the RLA\r                          \r\n\ndoes not provide BLE  with a bargainable interest  in Article\r\n\n21 such that ST and UTU owed BLE notice and an opportunity to\r\n\nparticipate in the negotiations.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed\r                              \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n",

ST\r\n\nis a railroad operator located in Springfield, Massachusetts,\r\n\nand a carrier for  purposes of the RLA.  BLE  and UTU are two\r\n\nof  several  trade  unions  who  have  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreements with ST.  The  individual plaintiffs in this  case\r\n\nbelong to BLE.      The RLA authorizes carriers and unions to\r\n\nestablish union shops.  A union shop in the railroad industry\r\n\nsimply means that in order to remain employed with a railroad\r\n\ncompany, employees  must belong to  one of the  national, RLA\r\n\nrecognized  railroad   unions.     See  45  U.S.C.       152,\r                                                  \r\n\nEleventh(a)  and (c).1    ST and  the  unions with  which  it\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  45 U.S.C.    152 has  been drafted  in subsections  First\r\nthrough Eleventh.  Section 152, Eleventh contains subsections\r\na through d.  We note the unusual numbering scheme to explain\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nmaintains collective bargaining agreements have established a\r\n\nunion shop.  \r\n\n          Employment in the railroad industry revolves around\r\n\ncrafts or classes of work, each of which is represented  by a\r\n\ndifferent  union.    Train   service  and  engineer   service\r\n\nconstitute  two   such  crafts.     The   former  encompasses\r\n\nconductors, brakemen,  trainmen and  yardmen, and  the latter\r\n\nincludes primarily locomotive engineers.   UTU represents the\r\n\ntrain service  craft and BLE represents  the engineer service\r\n\ncraft.      \r\n\n          By  practice,  junior  engineers  advance  from the\r\n\nranks of the train service employees.  Over the course of any\r\n\ngiven  year,  however,  the   amount  of  engineer  work  may\r\n\nfluctuate.   During periods of reduced  engineer work, junior\r\n\nengineers may have to return temporarily to train  service in\r\n\norder to remain employed.2  Junior engineers, therefore, have\r\n\nan  economic  interest  in  maintaining  their  train service\r\n\nseniority.  \r\n\n          Prior  to  1995, the  UTU-ST  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement  allowed non-UTU  member engineers  to continue  to\r\n\naccrue  train  service  seniority.   In  1995,  however,  UTU\r\n\nnegotiated a  provision known  as Article 21,  which requires\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nour citation.  \r\n\n2.  In its reply brief, BLE appears to hint that the  ebb and\r\nflow  of train service employees to and from engineer service\r\noccurs with less regularity today than in prior eras.   \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nthat employees moving from  train service to engineer service\r\n\npay dues to UTU in  order to maintain and continue  to accrue\r\n\ntheir train service seniority.   When BLE objected to Article\r\n\n21,  ST offered  it a similar  provision which  BLE rejected,\r\n\napparently  believing  it  to  be  of  little  value  to  its\r\n\nmembership.  \r\n\n          BLE then challenged  Article 21 on RLA grounds.  It\r\n\nsought preliminary injunctive relief which the district court\r\n\ndenied.   Subsequently, on cross motions,  the district court\r\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of UTU and ST.

First,\r\n\nBLE contends, Article 21 violates the prohibition of mandated\r\n\ndual unionism  under 45 U.S.C.    152, Eleventh(c).   Second,\r\n\nBLE   urges,  Article   21   impermissibly  interferes   with\r\n\nemployees' rights to organize and choose their own collective\r\n\nbargaining representative  under 45 U.S.C.     152, Third and\r\n\nFourth.   Finally,  BLE asserts,  the RLA,  45 U.S.C.    156,\r\n\nrequired  UTU  and ST  to provide  BLE, an  interested party,\r\n\nnotice of  their contract negotiations and  an opportunity to\r\n\nparticipate in  them.   We conclude  that the  district court\r\n\nably analyzed each of BLE's arguments and properly found them\r\n\nlacking in substance.  We affirm.\r\n\n          A.  45 U.S.C.   152, Eleventh(c)\r                                                      \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          According to  BLE, Article 21 violates  45 U.S.C.  \r\n\n152,  Eleventh(c), part of  the union shop  provisions of the\r\n\nRLA.  Analysis of BLE's argument requires a brief detour into\r\n\nthe background  of the  union shop provisions  generally, and\r\n\nhow   152, Eleventh(c) fits into the union shop scheme.  \r\n\n          Under 45  U.S.C.    152, Eleventh(a),  carriers and\r\n\nunions may  establish union shops.   Section 152, Eleventh(a)\r\n\nspecifically  provides  that carriers  and  unions  may \"make\r\n\nagreements, requiring as a condition of continued employment,\r\n\nthat  . . . all  employees shall become  members of the labor\r\n\norganization  representing their  craft or  class.\"   Read in\r\n\nisolation, the  plain language of this  provision would allow\r\n\ncarriers and unions to require employees to belong not to the\r\n\nunion  of their  choice, but  to the  union certified  as the\r\n\nrepresentative of their craft or class.\r\n\n          Organized labor petitioned  Congress for the  union\r\n\nshop  option  in  order  to eradicate  the  problem  of \"free\r\n\nriders,\"  railroad employees who do not pay dues to any union\r\n\nbut  receive whatever benefits collective bargaining confers.\r\n\nSee generally Pennsylvania R.R.

In  acceding to  labor's request,  however,\r\n\nCongress recognized that the intercraft mobility not uncommon\r\n\nin the railroad  industry could pose a  problem for employees\r\n\nin  a  union shop.   Under     152, Eleventh(a),  an employee\r\n\nshuttling  between train  service and engineer  service could\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\neither  be forced to change unions  or to belong and pay dues\r\n\nto  two unions until reaching a level of seniority sufficient\r\n\nto  stabilize him  as  an engineer.    As the  Supreme  Court\r\n\npointed out,  \"[t]he former alternative would,  of course, be\r\n\nexpensive and sometimes impossible, while the latter would be\r\n\ncomplicated and  might mean the  loss of seniority  and union\r\n\nbenefits.\"  Id. at 490.       Congress  attempted  to  tailor\r                           \r\n\nunion shops to accommodate intercraft mobility through   152,\r\n\nEleventh(c).  That subsection provides, \"[t]he requirement of\r\n\nmembership in a labor organization in [a union shop] shall be\r\n\nsatisfied  . .  .  if said  employee  shall hold  or  acquire\r\n\nmembership in any one of the labor organizations, national in\r\n\nscope, organized in accordance with this chapter.\"  45 U.S.C.\r\n\n  152, Eleventh(c).   On its face,   152  Eleventh(c) appears\r\n\nto contradict   152, Eleventh(a) by allowing any  employee in\r\n\nany  union  shop  to belong  to  any  of  the RLA  recognized\r\n\nrailroad unions. \r\n\n          The  purpose   of     152,   Eleventh(c),  however,\r\n\nsignificantly circumscribes its language.

BLE\r\n\nessentially attacks  Article 21 from two angles.   First, BLE\r\n\ncontends, Article 21 constitutes  either a   152, Eleventh(a)\r\n\nunion  shop agreement that violates    152, Eleventh(c) or an\r\n\namendment to  the existing  ST-UTU agreement that  violates  \r\n\n152, Eleventh(c).

Failure  to pay,  however, would  not\r\n\naffect accrued seniority.  In examining whether the provision\r\n\nconstituted  a  union  shop  agreement,  the Seventh  Circuit\r\n\nrelied in part on the fact that it did not require payment of\r\n\ndues to  UTU in order  to retain accrued  seniority, implying\r\n\nthat  such   a  provision  might  constitute   a  union  shop\r\n\nprovision.

Id.  \r                           \r\n\n          In our view,  the extra step Article  21 takes with\r\n\nrespect to  accrued seniority does not  create any conditions\r\n\non employment  different from the  provision in Dempsey.   As\r                                                                   \r\n\nindicated,  nothing  on  the  face  of  Article  21  requires\r\n\nemployees  to  belong to  UTU  in order  to  remain employed.\r\n\nDespite  the fact  that Article  21 takes  the extra  step of\r\n\nconditioning  seniority retention  and  accrual on  continued\r\n\ndues payment, an engineer who chooses  BLE over UTU satisfies\r\n\neither of the UTU-ST  or BLE-ST union shop requirements.   To\r\n\nthe extent, therefore, that  Dempsey implies that a provision\r                                                \r\n\nsuch as Article 21 might constitute a union shop agreement or\r\n\namendment, we respectfully disagree.   \r\n\n          BLE, however, asserts that engineers who choose BLE\r\n\nover UTU run the  risk of unemployment when shuttled  back to\r\n\ntrain  service,  since  they   will  have  no  train  service\r\n\nseniority.   According to BLE, this  effectively forces those\r\n\nengineers at the  lower end  of the  engineer seniority  list\r\n\neither to belong to UTU and BLE, or to UTU instead of BLE, as\r\n\na  condition of continued employment at ST.  BLE asserts that\r\n\n  152, Eleventh(c) allows a railroad employee in a union shop\r\n\nto  change  membership to  any  other  RLA recognized  union,\r\n\n\"without  putting   himself  out  of   compliance  with   the\r\n\nmembership requirement  of a  valid union shop  agreement and\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nthereby  cause a  loss of  seniority and  employment rights.\"\r\n\nBLE's argument  requires  us to  determine  whether      152,\r\n\nEleventh(c), in protecting  against compulsory dual unionism,\r\n\nelevates  seniority  into   a  statutorily  protected   right\r\n\nemployees may take with them as they move from craft to craft\r\n\nand union to union.      \r\n\n          By  its own  language,  the  RLA governs  relations\r\n\nbetween   carriers,   unions  and   employees,  and      152,\r\n\nEleventh(c)  dictates  the  limits  of  what carriers  and/or\r\n\nunions can demand of employees in a union shop.  Within those\r\n\nparameters,  which include  a prohibition on  compulsory dual\r\n\nunionism, the RLA makes no  mention of seniority, and notably\r\n\nfails to designate seniority as a protected employment right.\r\n\n          In the absence  of a  legislative pronouncement  to\r\n\nthe contrary, union contracts  typically define the scope and\r\n\nsignificance of seniority rights.

The  NRAB exists  to\r\n\nsettle   disputes   arising   under   collective   bargaining\r\n\nagreements.  See  Rychlik, 352 U.S. at  487.  As the  Seventh\r                                     \r\n\nCircuit  pointed  out,  this requirement  limits  union  shop\r\n\nparticipation  to  those  unions  which share  the  costs  of\r\n\nadministering  the NRAB,  and which  \"join together  in other\r\n\nrespects  in  the  negotiating  and  policing  of  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreements  under the  dispute  mechanisms of  the\r\n\nRLA.\"   Dempsey, 16 F.3d at  840.  BLE appears  to argue that\r                           \r\n\nArticle 21  has the effect of depriving it of dues that would\r\n\noffset its obligations to NRAB.  See id.

Stated more broadly, the  RLA does\r\n\nnot protect any one union from competition  with another over\r\n\nmembership and dues.  \r\n\n          B.  45 U.S.C.    152, Third and Fourth\r                                                            \r\n\n          Section  152,  Third,   entitled  \"Designation   of\r\n\nrepresentatives,\" provides  that neither unions  nor carriers\r\n\n\"shall in any  way interfere with,  influence, or coerce  the\r\n\nother  in  its  choice  of representatives.\"    Section  152,\r\n\nFourth,   dealing  with   organization  and   the  collective\r\n\nbargaining  process, grants  employees the right  to organize\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nand bargain collectively through representatives of their own\r\n\nchoosing,  and  provides that  no  carrier  may influence  or\r\n\ncoerce   employees   regarding    their   choice   of   labor\r\n\norganization,  nor   deduct  dues  or  other   fees  of  such\r\n\norganizations from employee wages.

We especially hesitate\r                    \r\n\nto  employ   NLRA  precedent  in  light  of   the  clear  and\r\n\nunequivocal  RLA  precedent  from  the  Supreme  Court,  this\r\n\ncircuit  and  others,  which  underscores the  limited  post-\r\n\ncertification  application of    152,  Third and Fourth.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nTWA, 489 U.S. at  441 (limiting application of     152, Third\r               \r\n\nand  Fourth   to  pre-certification  contexts);   Nat'l  R.R.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  To  be  sure, it  does not  appear  that ST  was entirely\r\ncandid with BLE  regarding its negotiations with UTU  and the\r\nsubstance of the  ST-UTU agreement.   The RLA, however,  does\r\nnot  compel ST to inform BLE of the substance of negotiations\r\nwith a third union, and we do not identify anti-BLE animus in\r\nST's actions.  \r\n\n6.  BLE essentially  argues that  by making it  so attractive\r\nfor  engineers  to join  UTU, Article  21  has the  effect of\r\nimpermissibly interfering  with their  free choice  of union,\r\nand  coercing them to join UTU, in violation of    152, Third\r\nand Fourth.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nPassenger, 915 F.2d at 51 (same); see also Kansas City S., 26\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 795; Dempsey, 16 F.3d at 841.  Finally,   BLE  argues\r                                \r\n\nsomewhat opaquely that a wage deduction provision only passes\r\n\nRLA muster if  it comprises  part of a  union shop  agreement\r\n\nunder   152, Eleventh.  At the outset we note that Article 21\r\n\nby itself  does  not  refer  to wage  deductions,  much  less\r\n\nmandate  them.    Assuming  such  a  wage  deduction  exists,\r\n\nhowever,  we disagree  with BLE's  interpretation of     152,\r\n\nFourth and Eleventh(b).  \r\n\n          As indicated,   152, Fourth provides that  carriers\r\n\nmay  not  deduct union  dues  or  fees  from employee  wages.\r\n\nSection 152, Eleventh(b), however, provides that carriers and\r\n\nlabor  organizations may  make agreements  providing for  the\r\n\ndeduction  of  \"any  periodic   dues,  initiation  fees,  and\r\n\nassessments\" from employee wages as long as the  employee has\r\n\ngiven  the  carrier written  permission.   45  U.S.C.    152,\r\n\nEleventh(b).   Section 152,  Eleventh(b), unlike Eleventh(c),\r\n\ndoes  not limit  its applicability  to Eleventh(a),  or union\r\n\nshop agreement situations.   See Kansas City S., 26  F.3d. at\r                                                           \r\n\n794.  Read  together,    152, Fourth and  Eleventh(b) provide\r\n\nthat carriers may not  unilaterally deduct dues from employee\r\n\nwages,  but may  do  so upon  the  agreement of  all  parties\r\n\ninvolved.  See id.  Thus, even in the absence of a union shop\r                              \r\n\nagreement,  employees  and  carriers  may  agree  to  a  dues\r\n\ndeduction schedule under   152, Eleventh(b).  \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>\r\r\n\n          <span class=\"reporter\">Cow.</span>  <span class=\"page\">45</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> U.S.C.   156, Bargainable Interest\r                                                               \r\n\n          BLE contends  that the District Court  erred in not\r\n\nsetting Article 21 aside on the  basis that UTU and ST failed\r\n\nto  notify  BLE of  their  negotiations, and  afford  BLE the\r\n\nopportunity to participate in them.  \r\n\n          The    RLA    mandates    that   \"[c]arriers    and\r\n\nrepresentatives of  the employees shall give  at least thirty\r\n\ndays'  written notice  of  an intended  change in  agreements\r\n\naffecting  rates of  pay,  rules, or  working conditions\"  to\r\n\ninterested  parties.  45 U.S.C.   156.  BLE identifies itself\r\n\nas an interested  party, and contends that ST or  UTU owed it\r\n\nnotice.   BLE also  contends that  it has  joint jurisdiction\r\n\nover collective bargaining between ST and UTU, at least  with\r\n\nrespect to  train service seniority,  by dint of  the routine\r\n\nshuttling of employees between the train service and engineer\r\n\nservice crafts.

Co.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nBrotherhood  of Locomotive  Eng'rs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"296898\"><a href=\"/opinion/296898/illinois-central-railroad-company-a-corporation-and-united-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  138, (7th\r                                              \r\n\nCir.  1971).   The  dispute in  Illinois  Central involved  a\r                                                             \r\n\ntripartite  agreement  between  the  carrier,  BLE  and   UTU\r\n\ngoverning the  list of  train service employees  eligible for\r\n\nengineer work.  UTU  filed suit when BLE sought  to negotiate\r\n\nrevisions to  the rules governing the  list without providing\r\n\nUTU notice  and an  opportunity to  participate.   The court,\r\n\nnoting the tripartite agreement,  determined that UTU and BLE\r\n\nshared  joint  negotiating  interests  over  the   list,  and\r\n\ntherefore,  that BLE  could  not unilaterally  negotiate rule\r\n\nrevisions with the carrier.  Id. at 141.\r                                            \r\n\n          Obviously  no formal tripartite agreement exists in\r\n\nthis  case.   BLE, however,  points  to language  in Illinois\r                                                                         \r\n\nCentral  indicating  that even  in  the  absence of  such  an\r                   \r\n\nagreement, the  ebb and  flow  of employees  between the  two\r\n\ncrafts would give the firemen an \"important economic stake in\r\n\nthe  rules regulating  the  extra list\"  which in  turn would\r\n\nestablish a bargainable interest  in UTU over rules governing\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nthe list.  Id. at 141-42.   BLE argues that the same ebb  and\r                          \r\n\nflow  vests it with a bargainable interest in the negotiation\r\n\nof train service seniority.  \r\n\n          We disagree with  BLE's interpretation of  Illinois\r                                                                         \r\n\nCentral.   First, that case revolved around a list outside of\r                   \r\n\neither UTU's  or BLE's collective bargaining  agreements with\r\n\nthe  carrier.  The rules  governing the extra list, moreover,\r\n\nplaced direct  conditions on  a fireman's employment  -- they\r\n\ndictated which of the  firemen could also engage in  engineer\r\n\nwork.   BLE's assumption of  sole negotiating  responsibility\r\n\nover rules governing the  list placed BLE in the  position of\r\n\nrepresenting firemen  even though  the firemen had  certified\r\n\nUTU as their collective bargaining agent.  \r\n\n          In this  case, by  contrast, UTU  does not  seek to\r\n\nunilaterally govern  the ebb and  flow itself.   UTU, through\r\n\nArticle  21,  has simply  negotiated  with  ST the  mechanism\r\n\nthrough which  train service employees  accrue seniority,  as\r\n\npart of  negotiations over  a  general collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement.   BLE and UTU have no tripartite agreement, nor is\r\n\nUTU  attempting  to unilaterally  negotiate  a  set of  rules\r\n\ngoverning movement between the two crafts.  \r\n\n          As the Eighth Circuit concluded, \r\n\n          \"[t]he  distinctive division  of railroad\r\n          employees  under the  RLA into  crafts or\r\n          classes,  and  the  regular  movement  of\r\n          employees  among  the   crafts  that   is\r\n          characteristic of  the industry, portends\r\n          overlapping 'interests'  among bargaining\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          units  in the  composition of  the crafts\r\n          and in their labor agreements.  That sort\r\n          of  interest,  however,  does not  confer\r\n          upon all  unions the right to  notice and\r\n          participation in the arbitrations  of all\r\n          other unions.\"\r\n\nKansas City S., 26 F.3d at  791-92.  We conclude that the RLA\r                          \r\n\ndoes not provide BLE  with a bargainable interest  in Article\r\n\n21 such that ST and UTU owed BLE notice and an opportunity to\r\n\nparticipate in the negotiations.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed\r                              \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n</pre>",
