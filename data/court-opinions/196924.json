See\r                                                                           \r\n\nIn re Two Appeals Arising Out  of the San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel\r                                                                           \r\n\nFire Litig.,  994 F.2d 956 (1st  Cir. 1993).  Finding,  as we do,\r                     \r\n\nthat  the  district  court's   determinations  comport  with  the\r\n\nparameters  that we set in  Two Appeals and  fall squarely within\r                                                 \r\n\nthe realm of judicial discretion, we affirm.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We sketch  the background of  these appeals,  cognizant\r\n\nthat  readers who hunger for more detail  can find it in a myriad\r\n\nof reported cases, including our earlier opinion.  See, e.g., id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 959-60.\r\n\n          The  sprawling litigation  that  burst  forth from  the\r\n\nsmoldering  embers  of  the  charred hotel  encompassed  wrongful\r\n\ndeath, personal injury, property damage, and other claims brought\r\n\nby more  than 2,000 plaintiffs against more  than 200 defendants.\r\n\nIn  an  effort  to tame  this  behemoth  and  to orchestrate  the\r\n\nproceedings,  the district  court  devised  an  innovative  case-\r\n\nmanagement  system.    The  system included  the  appointment  of\r\n\nliaison  counsels (to  facilitate interactions  both between  the\r\n\ncourt and the legion  of lawyers linked to the litigation as well\r\n\nas  among  the  lawyers themselves);  the  formation  of a  Joint\r\n\nDiscovery Committee (\"JDC\") to coordinate  discovery initiatives;\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nand  the creation  of a  Joint Document  Depository (\"JDD\")  as a\r\n\nresting  place for  all pleadings,  discovery materials,  and the\r\n\nlike.  See  id. at 959.  To pay  for this case-management system,\r                         \r\n\nthe trial judge imposed mandatory assessments on all litigants.\r\n\n          The  appellants  (whom  we  shall  call  \"the  pre-fire\r\n\ninsurers\")  comprise thirteen insurance companies that had issued\r\n\nliability policies to firms which eventually became defendants in\r\n\nthe underlying  litigation.1   The quondam insureds  settled with\r\n\nvarious  claimants  and  then  sued  the  pre-fire  insurers  for\r\n\nindemnification,   notwithstanding  that  all  the  policies  had\r\n\nexpired  prior  to the  conflagration.   Not  to be  outdone, the\r\n\noriginal  plaintiffs  joined  the  pre-fire  insurers  as  direct\r\n\ndefendants.  Though they had been brought late into the fray, the\r\n\ndistrict court levied an assessment against each pre-fire insurer\r\n\nfor a standard \"defendant's share\" (which, over time, amounted to\r\n\nroughly $41,500).   Like all such  assessments, these funds  were\r\n\nslated  for use  in defraying  the  expenses associated  with the\r\n\ncase-management scheme.\r\n\n          Fairly early  in the game, the  pre-fire insurers moved\r\n\nfor summary judgment on all claims against them.  After a lengthy\r\n\ninterval, the  district court  granted their motions  but ordered\r\n\nsua sponte that  they bear their own  costs.  The court  afforded\r                    \r\n\nthe pre-fire insurers no  opportunity to be heard.   Moreover, it\r\n\ndid not specifically mention the cost-sharing assessments.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Nineteen  pre-fire  insurers  were  sued.    Only  fourteen\r\nappealed.  One of  them, Puerto Rico American Insurance  Co., has\r\nsince capitulated.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          The pre-fire insurers appealed the denial of costs.  In\r\n\ndeciding  those appeals, we ruled, inter alia, that a trial court\r                                                       \r\n\nhas the power to reallocate monetary assessments imposed  as part\r\n\nof  a case-management  system.   See  id.  at 965.    Because the\r                                                   \r\n\ndistrict court did not  give the pre-fire insurers a  fair chance\r\n\nto seek reallocation  of those  costs, we remanded  so that  they\r\n\nmight   ask  the   district  court   to  determine   whether  the\r\n\ncircumstances  warranted  some  redistribution  of   the  payment\r\n\nburden.  See id. at 969.  The pre-fire insurers made the request,\r                          \r\n\nbut, in the end, it went  unrequited.  See In re San Juan  Dupont\r                                                                           \r\n\nPlaza  Hotel Fire Litig., MDL-721, Order No. 581 (D.P.R. Aug. 17,\r                                  \r\n\n1995).\r\n\n          On appeal,  the  pre-fire  insurers  contend  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court ignored the guideposts  we erected in Two  Appeals\r                                                                           \r\n\nfor  evaluating case-management  cost-reallocation claims.   They\r\n\nalso contend that the  lower court failed to recognize  that they\r\n\nhad  established a prima  facie case for  reallocation.  Finally,\r\n\nthey  complain that  they did  not receive  any benefit  from the\r\n\ncase-management system, and that, therefore, the court improperly\r\n\nrefused to relieve them from the standardized assessments.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2In a reply brief, certain of the pre-fire insurers complain\r\nthat they have not  been given access to the  depository accounts\r\nto determine  how funds were  spent, or how  much, if  any, money\r\nremains on  hand.   They develop no  legal argument  out of  this\r\ncomplaint, and it is beyond peradventure that we will not address\r\nan  issue when the party raising it  fails to treat it seriously.\r\nSee, e.g.,  United States v. Zannino,  895 F.2d 1, 17  (1st Cir.)\r                                              \r\n(describing the  \"settled appellate rule that  issues adverted to\r\nin  a  perfunctory  manner,   unaccompanied  by  some  effort  at\r\ndeveloped argumentation,  are deemed waived\"),  cert. denied, 494\r                                                                      \r\nU.S. 1082 (1990).\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\r          II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Because  the   district  court   has  spelled   out  an\r\n\nacceptable basis for its cost-sharing orders and for  its refusal\r\n\nto  grant a  special dispensation  to the  pre-fire  insurers, we\r\n\naffirm principally on the strength of its rescript, adding only a\r\n\nfew amplificative comments.\r\n\n          First:     The   pre-fire  insurers   have  incorrectly\r                    First:\r                         \r\n\nidentified the  legal standard applicable to  appellate review of\r\n\nOrder  No. 581.  They  insist that plenary  review is appropriate\r\n\nhere  because  the  trial  judge ignored  and/or  mishandled  the\r\n\ngeneral  guides for evaluating  cost-reallocation claims  that we\r\n\nlimned in Two Appeals, thereby committing an error of law.   This\r                               \r\n\nargument elevates form over substance.\r\n\n          In Two Appeals we delineated several factors that might\r                                  \r\n\nbe  considered in  mulling  whether  to reallocate  court-ordered\r\n\ncase-management expenses.  See  994 F.2d at 966-68.   Although we\r                                        \r\n\nhoped  that these suggestions would provide \"a modicum of general\r\n\nguidance  to the  district courts,\" id.  at 967, we  made it very\r                                                 \r\n\nclear that the trier's judgment is inevitably a critical  element\r\n\nin determining which factors have relevance in a particular case,\r\n\nwhat other factors may  be pertinent, and what weights  to assign\r\n\nto various factors.  In that connection we wrote:\r\n\n          By definition,  cost-sharing orders originate\r\n          with the district court as a component of the\r\n          court's case-management function.   Given the\r\n          district  judge's  intimate knowledge  of the\r\n          circumstances  under  which the  imposts were\r\n          conceived,  his  familiarity with  the nature\r\n          and  purposes of  the assessments,  his front\r\n          row seat throughout  the litigation, and  his\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          matchless ability to measure the benefits and\r\n          burdens  of cost-sharing  to  the parties  in\r\n          light  of  the   litigation's  progress   and\r\n          stakes,  we are  convinced that  the district\r\n          judge has the coign of vantage best suited to\r\n          determining, in the first  instance, whether,\r\n          and  if so,  how,  the  initial  cost-sharing\r\n          orders should be modified.\r\n\nId. at 968.\r             \r\n\n          This  issue  is  fact-sensitive,  and  even  a  cursory\r\n\nreading of the record reveals that the district court stayed well\r\n\nwithin the broad contours  of the inquiry that we  had suggested.\r\n\nStripped  of rhetorical  flourishes, the pre-fire  insurers' real\r\n\ncomplaint  is  not  that  the judge  misunderstood  the  relevant\r\n\nfactors but that he weighed them haphazardly.  Emblematic of this\r\n\nfocus  is the  undeniable fact  that,  at bottom,  the appellants\r\n\nchallenge  the  court's factbound  conclusion  that  the pre-fire\r\n\ninsurers actually benefitted from  the elaborate network of case-\r\n\nmanagement devices (like  the JDD) that their  payments helped to\r\n\nsubsidize.     So  viewed,  these  appeals  raise  fact-sensitive\r\n\ndisputes that invite discretionary  judgments.  In  circumstances\r\n\nwhere,  as here,  a  matter is  committed  to the  trial  judge's\r\n\nequitable discretion, see  id. at  965, deference is  due.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g.,  Koon v. United States,  64 U.S.L.W. 4512,  4517 (U.S. June\r                                      \r\n\n13, 1996).\r\n\n          That ends the standard-of-review contretemps.  Here, as\r\n\nin Koon, the  pre-fire insurers merely  seek to recharacterize  a\r                 \r\n\nfactbound dispute  on \"a higher  level of  generality.\"  Id.   An\r                                                                      \r\n\nappellate court therefore ought  to limit its review to  a search\r\n\nfor abuse  of the  trial court's discretion.   See id.;  see also\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nTexaco P.R., Inc. v. Department of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867,\r                                                             \r\n\n875  (1st Cir.  1995)  (reviewing a  trial  court's choice  among\r\n\nequitable  remedies for  abuse of  discretion because  \"the trial\r\n\njudge,  `who has had first-hand exposure to the litigants and the\r\n\nevidence, is  in  a considerably  better  position to  bring  the\r\n\nscales  into  balance  than  an  appellate  tribunal'\")  (quoting\r\n\nRosario-Torres v.

And  the  pre-fire  insurers'  attempt  to\r\n\ntransform  what  are  essentially  factual  findings  into  legal\r\n\nconclusions by the alchemy of words is insufficient to alter this\r\n\nstandard  of review.

We  did not  use the  phrase \"prima  facie case\"  as a\r\n\ntalisman  indicating  that the  pre-fire  insurers  had proved  a\r\n\npoint, but, rather, as  a means of describing the  arguments that\r                                                                      \r\n\nthey had tendered in support of reallocation.  Id. at  968.  This\r                                                            \r\n\nusage  was  intended merely  to  demonstrate  that  a remand  was\r\n\nadvisable because,  on the  exiguous record  then before  us, the\r\n\npre-fire insurers had  offered enough of  an argument to  warrant\r\n\nthe district court's  consideration of  their claim.   We had  at\r\n\nhand neither a  precise knowledge of the facts  nor a valid means\r\n\nof testing the integrity of the pre-fire insurers' asseverations.\r\n\nThus, we  could say no more than that \"it appears from the record\r                                                                           \r\n\nbefore us that appellants have a colorable basis for arguing that\r                                                          \r\n\nthey  derived  minimal  benefits  from  the  assessments.\"    Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(emphasis supplied).  And,  in words that should have  erased any\r\n\ndoubt, we added:\r\n\n          Nonetheless,    this    hypothesis    remains\r                                                                 \r\n          unproven.  There may  be more here than meets\r                            \r\n          the  eye; for one thing, the appellate record\r\n          does not speak in any detail to the equities.\r\n          .  . .  [T]here are  pregnant questions to be\r\n          mulled on  remand    questions  on which  the\r\n          trial   judge's   viewpoint   is   especially\r\n          important.  We  conclude, therefore, that the\r\n          case must  be returned to the  district court\r\n          for further proceedings before  Judge Acosta.\r\n          We intimate no opinion as  to the appropriate\r                                                                 \r\n          outcome of these proceedings.\r                                                \r\n\nId. at 968-69 (emphasis supplied).  Judge Acosta,  therefore, had\r             \r\n\nauthority  to   exercise  discretion  in  both   marshalling  and\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nbalancing the relevant factors.   He was not compelled  to attach\r\n\nany special significance to  the largely theoretical \"prima facie\r\n\ncase\" language  that the pre-fire  insurers pluck out  of context\r\n\nfrom our earlier opinion.\r\n\n          Third:  The district  court's finding that the pre-fire\r                    Third:\r                         \r\n\ninsurers  did in  fact  receive a  significant  benefit from  the\r\n\nexistence of the case-management  system withstands review  under\r\n\nan abuse-of-discretion  test.  The pre-fire  insurers assert that\r\n\nthey received no  benefit from the devices  because (1) discovery\r\n\nalready had been completed at the time they were brought into the\r\n\ncase, (2)  they were  perfectly capable  of doing  for themselves\r\n\nwhat the JDD accomplished for them,  and (3) they did not need to\r\n\nrely  on the  material in  the JDD  since they  sought  (and were\r\n\ngranted) summary judgment as a matter of law on the claims lodged\r\n\nagainst them.3  We  agree with the district court,  see Order No.\r                                                                 \r\n\n581,  supra,  at 9,  that these  assertions  stem from  an overly\r                     \r\n\nsimplistic view of the pre-fire insurers' situation.\r\n\n          For one thing, Judge Acosta specifically found that the\r\n\ntiming of discovery did not warrant a reduction of charges to the\r\n\npre-fire insurers.  See id.  at 10.  We think that  this finding,\r                                     \r\n\nthough perhaps  not inevitable, is  supportable.   The fact  that\r\n\ndiscovery had been  concluded was  a two-edged sword.   While  it\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  pre-fire insurers  concentrate their  fire on  the JDD\r\nbecause, in their view, nothing else  mattered.  This is a myopic\r\noutlook.  The case-management  system functioned as an integrated\r\nwhole.     The  JDC  played  a  pivotal  role  in  producing  the\r\ninformation  stored in the JDD, and the liaison consuls saved all\r\nparties time and money at every stage of the farflung litigation.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nmeant  that the pre-fire insurers did not  have to use the JDD to\r\n\nkeep track of  ongoing discovery,  it also meant  that they  \"had\r\n\navailable to them in a single location all  pleadings, discovery,\r\n\nservice   lists,  pretrial  documents,   records  of   all  court\r\n\nproceedings,  trial  transcripts,  evidence  utilized  at trials,\r\n\nmemoranda,  as well  as docket  reference[s] as  to all  that had\r\n\ntranspired up to that time.\"  Id. at 8.\r                                           \r\n\n          For another thing, it is of no moment that the pre-fire\r\n\ninsurers  might have  preferred  to  go  it  alone.    The  case-\r\n\nmanagement  system  that  the  district  court  so  painstakingly\r\n\ndevised  could  not  have operated  on  a  voluntary  basis.   It\r\n\ndepended  on the court's authority  to order all  parties both to\r\n\nparticipate and to share  the associated costs.  Since  the court\r\n\nacted  within   the  scope  of  its   case-management  powers  in\r\n\nestablishing the overall paradigm,  see Two Appeals, 994 F.2d  at\r                                                             \r\n\n965; In  re Recticel Foam  Corp., 859  F.2d 1000, 1004  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1988),  we  give short  shrift to  the  notion that  the pre-fire\r\n\ninsurers would have  been better off conducting  their defense in\r\n\nmore traditional surroundings.\r\n\n          Finally,  the district  court found specially  that the\r\n\nmaterials  in the JDD were of significant benefit to the pre-fire\r\n\ninsurers.  See  Order No. 581,  supra, at 8-9.   This finding  is\r                                               \r\n\nalso  supportable.  After  all, the allegations  against the pre-\r\n\nfire insurers  developed during, and  arose from the  results of,\r\n\nthe  discovery process.   Thus, materials  in the  JDD had  to be\r\n\nsearched,  and some were directly relevant to the claims asserted\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nand/or to the pre-fire insurers' defenses.  As the district court\r\n\nput  it, \"upon being served with [a]  copy of the claims asserted\r\n\nagainst them   two or three years after the initial complaint [in\r\n\nthe  underlying  litigation]  had  been  filed     [the  pre-fire\r\n\ninsurers] could, through the availability of a well-organized and\r\n\nefficient Joint Document Depository,  ascertain the status of the\r\n\nproceedings   and  have   readily  available   all  documentation\r\n\npertinent to their case.\"  Id. at 9.\r                                        \r\n\n          The proof of  the pudding is in  the pre-fire insurers'\r\n\nadmission that their confidence knew certain limits.  Faced  with\r\n\nupward of $200,000,000 in claims, the pre-fire insurers undertook\r\n\nfull-scale  trial preparations  notwithstanding  the pendency  of\r\n\ntheir dispositive motions.  The preparations envisioned reopening\r\n\ndiscovery, and as  a necessary  prelude (under the  terms of  the\r\n\napplicable  pretrial  orders)  entailed  heavy use  of  the  JDD,\r\n\nresulting,  for  example,  in   making  copies  of  over  275,000\r\n\ndocuments and  ordering  in excess  of  110 computer  disks  that\r\n\ncontained stored information.  In  light of these statistics, the\r\n\n\"no benefit\" claim rings hollow. \r\n\n          The  pre-fire insurers attempt to downplay the district\r\n\ncourt's finding and the  statistics that support it on  the basis\r\n\nthat they eventually  succeeded in obtaining judgment as a matter\r\n\nof law.   In  their view, this  outcome signifies  that they  had\r\n\nlittle need  to rely on  the JDD.   In an allied  vein, they note\r\n\nthat they did not refer to any documents contained in  the JDD in\r\n\ntheir summary judgment motions.  We believe that these rejoinders\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nmiss the point.  Although the pre-fire insurers ultimately proved\r\n\nthemselves able to defeat the claims without relying on discovery\r\n\nmaterials, simple prudence required them carefully to check those\r\n\nmaterials  (if  for no  other reason  than  to guard  against the\r\n\npossible denial  of their Rule 56  motions), and it was  to their\r\n\nadvantage  that  the  materials were  pre-assembled,  catalogued,\r\n\ncross-indexed, and readily  accessible.  In  a similar vein,  the\r\n\ncompilation  of  those  materials  necessarily  assisted  in  the\r\n\nprocessing of their motions.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  as the district court explained, previous\r\n\nlitigation  of  other  issues  earlier in  the  trial  (including\r\n\nextensive discovery) had framed  the issues, thereby enabling the\r\n\ncourt to resolve  the claims against  the pre-fire insurers  with\r\n\nrelative ease.   The pre-fire  insurers (who have  the burden  to\r\n\nprove  they are  entitled  to reallocation)  offer no  convincing\r\n\nanswer  to  this  observation  in their  appellate  briefs,  but,\r\n\nrather,  ask  us to  accept on  faith  their assumption  that the\r\n\ndistrict court did not  rely on its knowledge of  the litigation,\r\n\ngleaned in large part through the case-management system, to rule\r\n\nin their favor.   We are  unwilling to buy so  large a pig  in so\r\n\nrecondite a poke.\r\n\n               Fourth:  The pre-fire insurers refuse to recognize\r                         Fourth:\r                               \r\n\nthe extent to  which the  size and complexity  of the  underlying\r\n\nlitigation  affected  the  district  court's  evaluation  of  the\r\n\nrelative benefits  and  burdens imposed  by  the  case-management\r\n\nsystem.   In our judgment,  it is this  blind spot that  explains\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\ntheir  contention that  the district  court failed  adequately to\r\n\ncompare  relative  costs  and  benefits  between  and  among  the\r\n\nparties.\r\n\n          To be sure, we stated in Two Appeals that the principle\r                                                        \r\n\nwhich  \"dominates the  constellation  of factors  bearing on  the\r\n\ndecision to  reallocate\" is that a district court should consider\r\n\nreallocating   case-management  assessments   if  and   when  \"it\r\n\ndetermines that  a party  or group of  parties has  significantly\r\n\nfailed to derive the expected benefits from burdens imposed under\r\n\ncost-sharing  orders entered  earlier in  the litigation,  or has\r\n\nderived  those  benefits to  a  significantly  greater or  lesser\r\n\nextent than other similarly situated parties.\"  Two  Appeals, 994\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  966.   But  at the  same time  we  emphasized that  \"the\r\n\nrelative weight  and impact of relevant  considerations will vary\r\n\nfrom  situation  to  situation.\"    Id.  at  967.    Even  though\r                                                 \r\n\ncomparative  benefits   are  always  a  salient   aspect  of  the\r\n\nreallocation  calculus, see id. at 966, district courts cannot be\r                                         \r\n\nexpected  to measure benefits and burdens with the precision of a\r\n\nmicrometer in an antiseptic laboratory setting.\r\n\n          This  vastly complicated case (or, more accurately put,\r\n\ncompendium of cases)   which involves upwards of 2,000 plaintiffs\r\n\nwhose claims have  run the gamut  of imaginable and  unimaginable\r\n\ntheories of  liability    illustrates  the  need for  a  flexible\r\n\nstandard.  In such circumstances, it is simply not practicable to\r\n\ncontrive a clean matrix of benefits and burdens.  The best that a\r\n\ntrial court can do is to determine, as a matter of rough remedial\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\njustice, whether  significant disparities in the  distribution of\r\n\nbenefits and  burdens demand  readjustment of a  generic formula.\r\n\nSee id. at 966.  This is precisely the approach that the district\r                 \r\n\ncourt took on remand.\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no  further.4  Based on its  experience with\r\n\nthis  convoluted case,  its  familiarity with  the evidence,  its\r\n\nknowledge  of  the issues,  and  its  awareness  of the  parties'\r\n\nstrategies,  the  trial court  is in  the  best position  to make\r\n\ndelicate case-management judgments, including judgments about the\r\n\nreallocation of expenses previously assessed.\r\n\n          Here,  the trial  court  determined that  each pre-fire\r\n\ninsurer should bear a full \"defendant's share\" of case-management\r\n\nexpenses.  Because the district court's refusal to reallocate the\r\n\nexpense shares does not constitute a serious lapse in judgment of\r\n\nthe kind that  must occur before we will reverse  under an abuse-\r\n\nof-discretion standard, see Texaco P.R., 60 F.3d at 875; Anderson\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Cryovac, Inc.,  862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir.  1988), we are not\r                          \r\n\nat  liberty to  second-guess  it.   Though we,  if  writing on  a\r\n\npristine  page,   might  have   balanced  some  of   the  factors\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The  pre-fire   insurers  harp   on  what  they   term  the\r\n\"frivolousness\" of the  claims against them.   While the strength\r\nor  weakness  of  the claims  is  one of  many  factors  that may\r\ninfluence  the outcome  of  a  quest  for reallocation,  see  Two\r                                                                           \r\nAppeals,  994 F.2d  at  967,  that  factor  does  not  carry  the\r                 \r\ndecretory significance  that the pre-fire insurers  attach to it.\r\nReallocating cost-sharing  assessments is a matter  of equity; it\r\nis  not a  substitute for, and  should not  be confused  with, an\r\naward of  sanctions for  filing groundless claims  under Fed.  R.\r\nCiv. P. 11.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ndifferently  or taken a divergent  view of the  importance of the\r\n\nsystemic  benefits received  by  the pre-fire  insurers, we  made\r\n\nclear in Two Appeals that the call is not ours to make.\r                              \r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n",

Today, we review the district court's actions following the remand that we ordered in an earlier opinion.  See In re Two Appeals Arising Out of the San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 994 F.2d 956 (1st Cir.1993).  Finding, as we do, that the district court's determinations comport with the parameters that we set in Two Appeals and fall squarely within the realm of judicial discretion, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the background of these appeals, cognizant that readers who hunger for more detail can find it in a myriad of reported cases, including our earlier opinion.  See, e.g., id. at 959-60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sprawling litigation that burst forth from the smoldering embers of the charred hotel encompassed wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, and other claims brought by more than 2,000 plaintiffs against more than 200 defendants.  In an effort to tame this behemoth and to orchestrate the proceedings, the district court devised an innovative case-management system.  The system included the appointment of liaison counsels (to facilitate interactions both between the court and the legion of lawyers linked to the litigation as well as among the lawyers themselves);  the formation of a Joint Discovery Committee (\"JDC\") to coordinate discovery initiatives;  and the creation of a Joint Document Depository (\"JDD\") as a resting place for all pleadings, discovery materials, and the like.  See id. at 959.   To pay for this case-management system, the trial judge imposed mandatory assessments on all litigants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants (whom we shall call \"the pre-fire insurers\") comprise thirteen insurance companies that had issued liability policies to firms which eventually became defendants in the underlying litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The quondam insureds settled with various claimants and then sued the pre-fire insurers for indemnification, notwithstanding that all the policies had expired prior to the conflagration.  Not to be outdone, the original plaintiffs joined the pre-fire insurers as direct defendants.  Though they had been brought late into the fray, the district court levied an assessment against each pre-fire insurer for a standard \"defendant's share\" (which, over time, amounted to roughly $41,500).

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court has spelled out an acceptable basis for its cost-sharing orders and for its refusal to grant a special dispensation to the pre-fire insurers, we affirm principally on the strength of its rescript, adding only a few amplificative comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  The pre-fire insurers have incorrectly identified the legal standard applicable to appellate review of Order No. 581.  They insist that plenary review is appropriate here because the trial judge ignored and/or mishandled the general guides for evaluating cost-reallocation claims that we limned in Two Appeals, thereby committing an error of law.  This argument elevates form over substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Two Appeals we delineated several factors that might be considered in mulling whether to reallocate court-ordered case-management expenses.  See 994 F.2d at 966-68.   Although we hoped that these suggestions would provide \"a modicum of general guidance to the district courts,\" id. at 967, we made it very clear that the trier's judgment is inevitably a critical element in determining which factors have relevance in a particular case, what other factors may be pertinent, and what weights to assign to various factors.  In that connection we wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>By definition, cost-sharing orders originate with the district court as a component of the court's case-management function.  Given the district judge's intimate knowledge of the circumstances under which the imposts were conceived, his familiarity with the nature and purposes of the assessments, his front row seat throughout the litigation, and his matchless ability to measure the benefits and burdens of cost-sharing to the parties in light of the litigation's progress and stakes, we are convinced that the district judge has the coign of vantage best suited to determining, in the first instance, whether, and if so, how, the initial cost-sharing orders should be modified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 968.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue is fact-sensitive, and even a cursory reading of the record reveals that the district court stayed well within the broad contours of the inquiry that we had suggested.  Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, the pre-fire insurers' real complaint is not that the judge misunderstood the relevant factors but that he weighed them haphazardly.  Emblematic of this focus is the undeniable fact that, at bottom, the appellants challenge the court's factbound conclusion that the pre-fire insurers actually benefitted from the elaborate network of case-management devices (like the JDD) that their payments helped to subsidize.  So viewed, these appeals raise fact-sensitive disputes that invite discretionary judgments.  In circumstances where, as here, a matter is committed to the trial judge's equitable discretion, see id. at 965, deference is due.  See, e.g., Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, ----, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the standard-of-review contretemps.  Here, as in Koon, the pre-fire insurers merely seek to recharacterize a factbound dispute on \"a higher level of generality.\"  Id. An appellate court therefore ought to limit its review to a search for abuse of the trial court's discretion.  See id.;   see also Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Department of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 875 (1st Cir.1995) (reviewing a trial court's choice among equitable remedies for abuse of discretion because \"the trial judge, 'who has had first-hand exposure to the litigants and the evidence, is in a considerably better position to bring the scales into balance than an appellate tribunal' \") (quoting Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc)).  And the pre-fire insurers' attempt to transform what are essentially factual findings into legal conclusions by the alchemy of words is insufficient to alter this standard of review.  Since appellate courts \"will not permit parties to profit by dressing factual disputes in 'legal' costumery,\" Reliance Steel Prods., Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 577 (1st Cir.1989), abuse of discretion remains the appropriate benchmark against which the district court's ruling must be measured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  The pre-fire insurers misconstrue our comment that they had previously established \"at least a prima facie case for some reallocation of the assessments.\"  Two Appeals, 994 F.2d at 968.   They interpret this language as signifying that on remand the appellees had a burden to proffer evidence sufficient to rebut this prima facie case, and that the district court should have responded in terms both to the prima facie case and to the lack of any formal rebuttal.  This self-serving reading of Two Appeals injects more into the quoted comment than the context will bear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Two Appeals, we remanded the question of reallocation because the district court had not given the pre-fire insurers the opportunity to argue their position.  See id. at 969.   We did not use the phrase \"prima facie case\" as a talisman indicating that the pre-fire insurers had proved a point, but, rather, as a means of describing the arguments that they had tendered in support of reallocation.  Id. at 968.   This usage was intended merely to demonstrate that a remand was advisable because, on the exiguous record then before us, the pre-fire insurers had offered enough of an argument to warrant the district court's consideration of their claim.  We had at hand neither a precise knowledge of the facts nor a valid means of testing the integrity of the pre-fire insurers' asseverations.  Thus, we could say no more than that \"it appears from the record before us that appellants have a colorable basis for arguing that they derived minimal benefits from the assessments.\"  Id. (emphasis supplied).  And, in words that should have erased any doubt, we added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Nonetheless, this hypothesis remains unproven.   There may be more here than meets the eye;  for one thing, the appellate record does not speak in any detail to the equities....  [T]here are pregnant questions to be mulled on remand--questions on which the trial judge's viewpoint is especially important.  We conclude, therefore, that the case must be returned to the district court for further proceedings before Judge Acosta.  We intimate no opinion as to the appropriate outcome of these proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 968-69 (emphasis supplied).  Judge Acosta, therefore, had authority to exercise discretion in both marshalling and balancing the relevant factors.  He was not compelled to attach any special significance to the largely theoretical \"prima facie case\" language that the pre-fire insurers pluck out of context from our earlier opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  The district court's finding that the pre-fire insurers did in fact receive a significant benefit from the existence of the case-management system withstands review under an abuse-of-discretion test.  The pre-fire insurers assert that they received no benefit from the devices because (1) discovery already had been completed at the time they were brought into the case, (2) they were perfectly capable of doing for themselves what the JDD accomplished for them, and (3) they did not need to rely on the material in the JDD since they sought (and were granted) summary judgment as a matter of law on the claims lodged against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We agree with the district court, see Order No. 581, supra, at 9, that these assertions stem from an overly simplistic view of the pre-fire insurers' situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, Judge Acosta specifically found that the timing of discovery did not warrant a reduction of charges to the pre-fire insurers.  See id. at 10.   We think that this finding, though perhaps not inevitable, is supportable.  The fact that discovery had been concluded was a two-edged sword.  While it meant that the pre-fire insurers did not have to use the JDD to keep track of ongoing discovery, it also meant that they \"had available to them in a single location all pleadings, discovery, service lists, pretrial documents, records of all court proceedings, trial transcripts, evidence utilized at trials, memoranda, as well as docket reference[s] as to all that had transpired up to that time.\"  Id. at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, it is of no moment that the pre-fire insurers might have preferred to go it alone.  The case-management system that the district court so painstakingly devised could not have operated on a voluntary basis.  It depended on the court's authority to order all parties both to participate and to share the associated costs.  Since the court acted within the scope of its case-management powers in establishing the overall paradigm, see Two Appeals, 994 F.2d at 965;  In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1004 (1st Cir.1988), we give short shrift to the notion that the pre-fire insurers would have been better off conducting their defense in more traditional surroundings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court found specially that the materials in the JDD were of significant benefit to the pre-fire insurers.  See Order No. 581, supra, at 8-9.  This finding is also supportable.  After all, the allegations against the pre-fire insurers developed during, and arose from the results of, the discovery process.  Thus, materials in the JDD had to be searched, and some were directly relevant to the claims asserted and/or to the pre-fire insurers' defenses.  As the district court put it, \"upon being served with [a] copy of the claims asserted against them--two or three years after the initial complaint [in the underlying litigation] had been filed--[the pre-fire insurers] could, through the availability of a well-organized and efficient Joint Document Depository, ascertain the status of the proceedings and have readily available all documentation pertinent to their case.\"  Id. at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof of the pudding is in the pre-fire insurers' admission that their confidence knew certain limits.  Faced with upward of $200,000,000 in claims, the pre-fire insurers undertook full-scale trial preparations notwithstanding the pendency of their dispositive motions.  The preparations envisioned reopening discovery, and as a necessary prelude (under the terms of the applicable pretrial orders) entailed heavy use of the JDD, resulting, for example, in making copies of over 275,000 documents and ordering in excess of 110 computer disks that contained stored information.  In light of these statistics, the \"no benefit\" claim rings hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-fire insurers attempt to downplay the district court's finding and the statistics that support it on the basis that they eventually succeeded in obtaining judgment as a matter of law.  In their view, this outcome signifies that they had little need to rely on the JDD. In an allied vein, they note that they did not refer to any documents contained in the JDD in their summary judgment motions.  We believe that these rejoinders miss the point.  Although the pre-fire insurers ultimately proved themselves able to defeat the claims without relying on discovery materials, simple prudence required them carefully to check those materials (if for no other reason than to guard against the possible denial of their Rule 56 motions), and it was to their advantage that the materials were pre-assembled, catalogued, cross-indexed, and readily accessible.  In a similar vein, the compilation of those materials necessarily assisted in the processing of their motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, as the district court explained, previous litigation of other issues earlier in the trial (including extensive discovery) had framed the issues, thereby enabling the court to resolve the claims against the pre-fire insurers with relative ease.  The pre-fire insurers (who have the burden to prove they are entitled to reallocation) offer no convincing answer to this observation in their appellate briefs, but, rather, ask us to accept on faith their assumption that the district court did not rely on its knowledge of the litigation, gleaned in large part through the case-management system, to rule in their favor.  We are unwilling to buy so large a pig in so recondite a poke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  The pre-fire insurers refuse to recognize the extent to which the size and complexity of the underlying litigation affected the district court's evaluation of the relative benefits and burdens imposed by the case-management system.  In our judgment, it is this blind spot that explains their contention that the district court failed adequately to compare relative costs and benefits between and among the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we stated in Two Appeals that the principle which \"dominates the constellation of factors bearing on the decision to reallocate\" is that a district court should consider reallocating case-management assessments if and when \"it determines that a party or group of parties has significantly failed to derive the expected benefits from burdens imposed under cost-sharing orders entered earlier in the litigation, or has derived those benefits to a significantly greater or lesser extent than other similarly situated parties.\"  Two Appeals, 994 F.2d at 966.   But at the same time we emphasized that \"the relative weight and impact of relevant considerations will vary from situation to situation.\"  Id. at 967.   Even though comparative benefits are always a salient aspect of the reallocation calculus, see id. at 966, district courts cannot be expected to measure benefits and burdens with the precision of a micrometer in an antiseptic laboratory setting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This vastly complicated case (or, more accurately put, compendium of cases)--which involves upwards of 2,000 plaintiffs whose claims have run the gamut of imaginable and unimaginable theories of liability--illustrates the need for a flexible standard.  In such circumstances, it is simply not practicable to contrive a clean matrix of benefits and burdens.  The best that a trial court can do is to determine, as a matter of rough remedial justice, whether significant disparities in the distribution of benefits and burdens demand readjustment of a generic formula.  See id. at 966.   This is precisely the approach that the district court took on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Based on its experience with this convoluted case, its familiarity with the evidence, its knowledge of the issues, and its awareness of the parties' strategies, the trial court is in the best position to make delicate case-management judgments, including judgments about the reallocation of expenses previously assessed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the trial court determined that each pre-fire insurer should bear a full \"defendant's share\" of case-management expenses.  Because the district court's refusal to reallocate the expense shares does not constitute a serious lapse in judgment of the kind that must occur before we will reverse under an abuse-of-discretion standard, see Texaco P.R., 60 F.3d at 875;  Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir.1988), we are not at liberty to second-guess it.  Though we, if writing on a pristine page, might have balanced some of the factors differently or taken a divergent view of the importance of the systemic benefits received by the pre-fire insurers, we made clear in Two Appeals that the call is not ours to make.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nineteen pre-fire insurers were sued.

They develop no legal argument out of this complaint, and it is beyond peradventure that we will not address an issue when the party raising it fails to treat it seriously.  See, e.g., United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (describing the \"settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The pre-fire insurers concentrate their fire on the JDD because, in their view, nothing else mattered.  This is a myopic outlook.  The case-management system functioned as an integrated whole.  The JDC played a pivotal role in producing the information stored in the JDD, and the liaison consuls saved all parties time and money at every stage of the farflung litigation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The pre-fire insurers harp on what they term the \"frivolousness\" of the claims against them.  While the strength or weakness of the claims is one of many factors that may influence the outcome of a quest for reallocation, see Two Appeals, 994 F.2d at 967, that factor does not carry the decretory significance that the pre-fire insurers attach to it.  Reallocating cost-sharing assessments is a matter of equity;  it is not a substitute for, and should not be confused with, an award of sanctions for filing groundless claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the background of these appeals, cognizant that readers who hunger for more detail can find it in a myriad of reported cases, including our earlier opinion.  See, e.g., id. at 959-60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sprawling litigation that burst forth from the smoldering embers of the charred hotel encompassed wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, and other claims brought by more than 2,000 plaintiffs against more than 200 defendants.  In an effort to tame this behemoth and to orchestrate the proceedings, the district court devised an innovative case-management system.  The system included the appointment of liaison counsels (to facilitate interactions both between the court and the legion of lawyers linked to the litigation as well as among the lawyers themselves);  the formation of a Joint Discovery Committee (\"JDC\") to coordinate discovery initiatives;  and the creation of a Joint Document Depository (\"JDD\") as a resting place for all pleadings, discovery materials, and the like.  See id. at 959.   To pay for this case-management system, the trial judge imposed mandatory assessments on all litigants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants (whom we shall call \"the pre-fire insurers\") comprise thirteen insurance companies that had issued liability policies to firms which eventually became defendants in the underlying litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The quondam insureds settled with various claimants and then sued the pre-fire insurers for indemnification, notwithstanding that all the policies had expired prior to the conflagration.  Not to be outdone, the original plaintiffs joined the pre-fire insurers as direct defendants.  Though they had been brought late into the fray, the district court levied an assessment against each pre-fire insurer for a standard \"defendant's share\" (which, over time, amounted to roughly $41,500).  Like all such assessments, these funds were slated for use in defraying the expenses associated with the case-management scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fairly early in the game, the pre-fire insurers moved for summary judgment on all claims against them.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court has spelled out an acceptable basis for its cost-sharing orders and for its refusal to grant a special dispensation to the pre-fire insurers, we affirm principally on the strength of its rescript, adding only a few amplificative comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  The pre-fire insurers have incorrectly identified the legal standard applicable to appellate review of Order No. 581.  They insist that plenary review is appropriate here because the trial judge ignored and/or mishandled the general guides for evaluating cost-reallocation claims that we limned in Two Appeals, thereby committing an error of law.  This argument elevates form over substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Two Appeals we delineated several factors that might be considered in mulling whether to reallocate court-ordered case-management expenses.  See 994 F.2d at 966-68.   Although we hoped that these suggestions would provide \"a modicum of general guidance to the district courts,\" id. at 967, we made it very clear that the trier's judgment is inevitably a critical element in determining which factors have relevance in a particular case, what other factors may be pertinent, and what weights to assign to various factors.  In that connection we wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>By definition, cost-sharing orders originate with the district court as a component of the court's case-management function.  Given the district judge's intimate knowledge of the circumstances under which the imposts were conceived, his familiarity with the nature and purposes of the assessments, his front row seat throughout the litigation, and his matchless ability to measure the benefits and burdens of cost-sharing to the parties in light of the litigation's progress and stakes, we are convinced that the district judge has the coign of vantage best suited to determining, in the first instance, whether, and if so, how, the initial cost-sharing orders should be modified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 968.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue is fact-sensitive, and even a cursory reading of the record reveals that the district court stayed well within the broad contours of the inquiry that we had suggested.  Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, the pre-fire insurers' real complaint is not that the judge misunderstood the relevant factors but that he weighed them haphazardly.  Emblematic of this focus is the undeniable fact that, at bottom, the appellants challenge the court's factbound conclusion that the pre-fire insurers actually benefitted from the elaborate network of case-management devices (like the JDD) that their payments helped to subsidize.  So viewed, these appeals raise fact-sensitive disputes that invite discretionary judgments.  In circumstances where, as here, a matter is committed to the trial judge's equitable discretion, see id. at 965, deference is due.  See, e.g., Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2035</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span> (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the standard-of-review contretemps.  Here, as in Koon, the pre-fire insurers merely seek to recharacterize a factbound dispute on \"a higher level of generality.\"  Id. An appellate court therefore ought to limit its review to a search for abuse of the trial court's discretion.  See id.;   see also Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Department of Consumer Affairs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196188\"><a href=\"/opinion/196188/texaco-pr-inc-v-daco/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 875 (1st Cir.1995) (reviewing a trial court's choice among equitable remedies for abuse of discretion because \"the trial judge, 'who has had first-hand exposure to the litigants and the evidence, is in a considerably better position to bring the scales into balance than an appellate tribunal' \") (quoting Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532023\"><a href=\"/opinion/532023/miguel-a-rosario-torres-v-rafael-hernandez-colon-etc-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc)).  And the pre-fire insurers' attempt to transform what are essentially factual findings into legal conclusions by the alchemy of words is insufficient to alter this standard of review.  Since appellate courts \"will not permit parties to profit by dressing factual disputes in 'legal' costumery,\" Reliance Steel Prods., Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526735\"><a href=\"/opinion/526735/reliance-steel-products-company-v-national-fire-insurance-company-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 577 (1st Cir.1989), abuse of discretion remains the appropriate benchmark against which the district court's ruling must be measured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  The pre-fire insurers misconstrue our comment that they had previously established \"at least a prima facie case for some reallocation of the assessments.\"  Two Appeals, 994 F.2d at 968.   They interpret this language as signifying that on remand the appellees had a burden to proffer evidence sufficient to rebut this prima facie case, and that the district court should have responded in terms both to the prima facie case and to the lack of any formal rebuttal.  This self-serving reading of Two Appeals injects more into the quoted comment than the context will bear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Two Appeals, we remanded the question of reallocation because the district court had not given the pre-fire insurers the opportunity to argue their position.  See id. at 969.   We did not use the phrase \"prima facie case\" as a talisman indicating that the pre-fire insurers had proved a point, but, rather, as a means of describing the arguments that they had tendered in support of reallocation.  Id. at 968.   This usage was intended merely to demonstrate that a remand was advisable because, on the exiguous record then before us, the pre-fire insurers had offered enough of an argument to warrant the district court's consideration of their claim.  We had at hand neither a precise knowledge of the facts nor a valid means of testing the integrity of the pre-fire insurers' asseverations.  Thus, we could say no more than that \"it appears from the record before us that appellants have a colorable basis for arguing that they derived minimal benefits from the assessments.\"  Id. (emphasis supplied).  And, in words that should have erased any doubt, we added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Nonetheless, this hypothesis remains unproven.   There may be more here than meets the eye;  for one thing, the appellate record does not speak in any detail to the equities....  [T]here are pregnant questions to be mulled on remand--questions on which the trial judge's viewpoint is especially important.  We conclude, therefore, that the case must be returned to the district court for further proceedings before Judge Acosta.  We intimate no opinion as to the appropriate outcome of these proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 968-69 (emphasis supplied).  Judge Acosta, therefore, had authority to exercise discretion in both marshalling and balancing the relevant factors.  He was not compelled to attach any special significance to the largely theoretical \"prima facie case\" language that the pre-fire insurers pluck out of context from our earlier opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  The district court's finding that the pre-fire insurers did in fact receive a significant benefit from the existence of the case-management system withstands review under an abuse-of-discretion test.  The pre-fire insurers assert that they received no benefit from the devices because (1) discovery already had been completed at the time they were brought into the case, (2) they were perfectly capable of doing for themselves what the JDD accomplished for them, and (3) they did not need to rely on the material in the JDD since they sought (and were granted) summary judgment as a matter of law on the claims lodged against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We agree with the district court, see Order No. 581, supra, at 9, that these assertions stem from an overly simplistic view of the pre-fire insurers' situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, Judge Acosta specifically found that the timing of discovery did not warrant a reduction of charges to the pre-fire insurers.  See id. at 10.   We think that this finding, though perhaps not inevitable, is supportable.  The fact that discovery had been concluded was a two-edged sword.  While it meant that the pre-fire insurers did not have to use the JDD to keep track of ongoing discovery, it also meant that they \"had available to them in a single location all pleadings, discovery, service lists, pretrial documents, records of all court proceedings, trial transcripts, evidence utilized at trials, memoranda, as well as docket reference[s] as to all that had transpired up to that time.\"  Id. at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, it is of no moment that the pre-fire insurers might have preferred to go it alone.  The case-management system that the district court so painstakingly devised could not have operated on a voluntary basis.  It depended on the court's authority to order all parties both to participate and to share the associated costs.  Since the court acted within the scope of its case-management powers in establishing the overall paradigm, see Two Appeals, 994 F.2d at 965;  In re Recticel Foam Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513181\"><a href=\"/opinion/513181/in-re-recticel-foam-corporation-in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1004 (1st Cir.1988), we give short shrift to the notion that the pre-fire insurers would have been better off conducting their defense in more traditional surroundings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court found specially that the materials in the JDD were of significant benefit to the pre-fire insurers.  See Order No. 581, supra, at 8-9.  This finding is also supportable.  After all, the allegations against the pre-fire insurers developed during, and arose from the results of, the discovery process.  Thus, materials in the JDD had to be searched, and some were directly relevant to the claims asserted and/or to the pre-fire insurers' defenses.  As the district court put it, \"upon being served with [a] copy of the claims asserted against them--two or three years after the initial complaint [in the underlying litigation] had been filed--[the pre-fire insurers] could, through the availability of a well-organized and efficient Joint Document Depository, ascertain the status of the proceedings and have readily available all documentation pertinent to their case.\"  Id. at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof of the pudding is in the pre-fire insurers' admission that their confidence knew certain limits.  Faced with upward of $200,000,000 in claims, the pre-fire insurers undertook full-scale trial preparations notwithstanding the pendency of their dispositive motions.  The preparations envisioned reopening discovery, and as a necessary prelude (under the terms of the applicable pretrial orders) entailed heavy use of the JDD, resulting, for example, in making copies of over 275,000 documents and ordering in excess of 110 computer disks that contained stored information.  In light of these statistics, the \"no benefit\" claim rings hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-fire insurers attempt to downplay the district court's finding and the statistics that support it on the basis that they eventually succeeded in obtaining judgment as a matter of law.  In their view, this outcome signifies that they had little need to rely on the JDD. In an allied vein, they note that they did not refer to any documents contained in the JDD in their summary judgment motions.  We believe that these rejoinders miss the point.  Although the pre-fire insurers ultimately proved themselves able to defeat the claims without relying on discovery materials, simple prudence required them carefully to check those materials (if for no other reason than to guard against the possible denial of their Rule 56 motions), and it was to their advantage that the materials were pre-assembled, catalogued, cross-indexed, and readily accessible.  In a similar vein, the compilation of those materials necessarily assisted in the processing of their motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, as the district court explained, previous litigation of other issues earlier in the trial (including extensive discovery) had framed the issues, thereby enabling the court to resolve the claims against the pre-fire insurers with relative ease.  The pre-fire insurers (who have the burden to prove they are entitled to reallocation) offer no convincing answer to this observation in their appellate briefs, but, rather, ask us to accept on faith their assumption that the district court did not rely on its knowledge of the litigation, gleaned in large part through the case-management system, to rule in their favor.  We are unwilling to buy so large a pig in so recondite a poke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  The pre-fire insurers refuse to recognize the extent to which the size and complexity of the underlying litigation affected the district court's evaluation of the relative benefits and burdens imposed by the case-management system.  In our judgment, it is this blind spot that explains their contention that the district court failed adequately to compare relative costs and benefits between and among the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we stated in Two Appeals that the principle which \"dominates the constellation of factors bearing on the decision to reallocate\" is that a district court should consider reallocating case-management assessments if and when \"it determines that a party or group of parties has significantly failed to derive the expected benefits from burdens imposed under cost-sharing orders entered earlier in the litigation, or has derived those benefits to a significantly greater or lesser extent than other similarly situated parties.\"  Two Appeals, 994 F.2d at 966.   But at the same time we emphasized that \"the relative weight and impact of relevant considerations will vary from situation to situation.\"  Id. at 967.   Even though comparative benefits are always a salient aspect of the reallocation calculus, see id. at 966, district courts cannot be expected to measure benefits and burdens with the precision of a micrometer in an antiseptic laboratory setting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This vastly complicated case (or, more accurately put, compendium of cases)--which involves upwards of 2,000 plaintiffs whose claims have run the gamut of imaginable and unimaginable theories of liability--illustrates the need for a flexible standard.  In such circumstances, it is simply not practicable to contrive a clean matrix of benefits and burdens.  The best that a trial court can do is to determine, as a matter of rough remedial justice, whether significant disparities in the distribution of benefits and burdens demand readjustment of a generic formula.  See id. at 966.   This is precisely the approach that the district court took on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Based on its experience with this convoluted case, its familiarity with the evidence, its knowledge of the issues, and its awareness of the parties' strategies, the trial court is in the best position to make delicate case-management judgments, including judgments about the reallocation of expenses previously assessed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the trial court determined that each pre-fire insurer should bear a full \"defendant's share\" of case-management expenses.  Because the district court's refusal to reallocate the expense shares does not constitute a serious lapse in judgment of the kind that must occur before we will reverse under an abuse-of-discretion standard, see Texaco P.R., 60 F.3d at 875;  Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515444\"><a href=\"/opinion/515444/anne-anderson-v-cryovac-inc-anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 923 (1st Cir.1988), we are not at liberty to second-guess it.  Though we, if writing on a pristine page, might have balanced some of the factors differently or taken a divergent view of the importance of the systemic benefits received by the pre-fire insurers, we made clear in Two Appeals that the call is not ours to make.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nineteen pre-fire insurers were sued.

They develop no legal argument out of this complaint, and it is beyond peradventure that we will not address an issue when the party raising it fails to treat it seriously.  See, e.g., United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.)

This is a myopic outlook.  The case-management system functioned as an integrated whole.

While the strength or weakness of the claims is one of many factors that may influence the outcome of a quest for reallocation, see Two Appeals, 994 F.2d at 967, that factor does not carry the decretory significance that the pre-fire insurers attach to it.  Reallocating cost-sharing assessments is a matter of equity;  it is not a substitute for, and should not be confused with, an award of sanctions for filing groundless claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
