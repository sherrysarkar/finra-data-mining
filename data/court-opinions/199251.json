Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n        [Hon. David L. Martin, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     John Shewchun on brief pro se.\n     Sheldon Whitehouse, Attorney General, and Neil F.X. Kelly,\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                       January 24, 2001\n\f            Per       Curiam.         The       district        court    held     that\n\nplaintiff's        claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 were barred by\n\nthe forum State's statute of limitations.                       Plaintiff repeats\n\nhere some of the arguments which he presented below and adds\n\nothers.     The added arguments were waived by the failure to\n\nurge them below and there is no plain error.\n\n            Reviewing the preserved issues de novo in light of\n\nthe briefs and the record on appeal, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that the suit was filed almost eight years\n\ntoo late.    Specifically, plaintiff has not substantiated his\n\nclaim     that    a     lawsuit       which      he   commenced         during     the\n\nlimitations period had remained pending for any significant\n\nportion    of     the    intervening        years.         He    also     offers    no\n\nconvincing argument for use of the equitable exception to\n\nthe     limitations        period       for      \"continuing            violations.\"\n\nConstrued in light of what he pleaded and could prove, the\n\ncomplaint        alleged       several      communications          of      mistaken\n\ninformation       emanating       from      a   single     wrongful        act   (the\n\nalleged     entry       into    the    state      court     records        of    wrong\n\ninformation about the terms of the plaintiff's probationary\n\nsentence in breach of a plea agreement).                    No systemic policy\n\nnor practice was alleged.              The pendent claim, too, properly\n\nwas dismissed.\n\f         We need not reach the ineffective assistance claim\n\nsince there is no right to counsel in a civil case.    The\n\nalleged impropriety by plaintiff's private counsel did not\n\naffect the result in this case.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                           -3-\n\f",
