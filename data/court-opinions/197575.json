Appellant Omil  Arroyo  was convicted  on\r                            \r\n\ncharges of possession with intent to deliver 50 grams or more\r\n\nof cocaine base and 500 grams or more of powdered cocaine, 21\r\n\nU.S.C.   841(a)(1),   and sentenced to 151  months in prison,\r\n\nthe  low  end  of  the  range  determined  by the  Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines.   He  challenges both  the jury  verdict  and his\r\n\nsentence,  beginning with a claim that there was insufficient\r\n\nevidence to support the conviction.    \r\n\n     In reviewing a  verdict for evidentiary sufficiency,  we\r\n\nresolve  all legitimate evidentiary conflicts in favor of the\r\n\nverdict.  See United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1495 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1997).  Arroyo's main insufficient-evidence argument is\r\n\nthat  there  was no  proof  that  he exercised  dominion  and\r\n\ncontrol over the  drugs in question.  However,  the drugs and\r\n\nrelated paraphernalia were found  in Arroyo's apartment, some\r\n\nin plain view.\r\n\n     Although Arroyo and a defense witness testified that two\r\n\nfriends also lived in his apartment, the jury was entitled to\r\n\ndisbelieve this testimony  in light of Arroyo's  inability to\r\n\nidentify where these  friends worked or where  they had lived\r\n\nbefore  moving in  with him.   The government's  evidence was\r\n\nclearly \"sufficient  to warrant a  jury to conclude  that the\r\n\ndefendant  is  guilty  beyond a  reasonable  doubt.\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

This Court has already  rejected\r\n\nan  equal protection challenge  to the differential.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Here, Arroyo simply  recasts\r                  \r\n\nthe attack as a claim  that the differential should have been\r\n\ntreated as a ground for a downward departure.\r\n\n     But  a  refusal  to depart  downward  is  not reviewable\r\n\nunless  it  rests on  a  mistake  of  law, United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGrandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560 (1st Cir. 1996), and Arroyo has\r                       \r\n\nnot  pointed to  any  misapprehension  of  authority  by  the\r\n\nsentencing judge.   Further,  even if  the refusal  to depart\r\n\nwere reviewable, the use of  a 100-to-1 ratio is part of  the\r\n\nguideline--not itself  an unusual  circumstance or  condition\r\n\nthat  might take the  case outside the  \"heartland of typical\r\n\ncases\" envisioned  by the Sentencing Guidelines.  See Koon v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited States, 116 S. Ct. 2035, 2044 (1996).  \r                         \r\n\n     Finally,  Arroyo argues that the district court erred in\r\n\nruling  that  he was  not  eligible  for the  \"safety  valve\"\r\n\nreduction provided by  U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(b)(4).   The district\r\n\ncourt  concluded that Arroyo had not satisfied the conditions\r\n\nof  this provision because he had  not truthfully provided to\r\n\nthe government all  of the information  he had pertaining  to\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nthe offenses.   U.S.S.G.   5C1.2(5).  Arroyo  asserts that he\r\n\nis innocent and thus had no information to provide.  \r\n\n     Arroyo had the  burden of convincing the  district court\r\n\nthat he qualified for the safety valve reduction.  See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Montanez, 82 F.3d  520, 523  (1st Cir. 1996).   We\r                               \r\n\nreview   only  for   clear   error   the   district   court's\r\n\ndetermination   that  Arroyo  was  guilty  and  so  did  have\r\n\ninformation  to  provide.    See United  States  v.  Miranda-\r                                                                         \r\n\nSantiago, 96 F.3d  517, 527 (1st  Cir. 1996).  Since  we have\r                    \r\n\nalready  held that the  evidence was sufficient  to establish\r\n\nguilt  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  obviously  the district\r\n\ncourt's determination--based on a less demanding standard and\r\n\na reversal of the burden of proof--cannot be clear error.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n",
