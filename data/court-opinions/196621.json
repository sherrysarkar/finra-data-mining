Petitioner Dennis Martin  is a native\r                                \r\n\nand citizen of Jamaica who legally entered this country as an\r\n\nimmigrant in June 1988.  He  was convicted in April 1992 in a\r\n\nMassachusetts  Superior Court  of possession of  cocaine with\r\n\nintent to distribute.  The INS  then issued an Order to  Show\r\n\nCause in July 1992  based on his conviction of  an aggravated\r\n\nfelony.\r\n\n          An  immigration  judge  (IJ)  held   a  deportation\r\n\nhearing in  April 1994 at which petitioner was represented by\r\n\nan  attorney.     Deportability  was   conceded  and  Jamaica\r\n\ndesignated as the country  for deportation purposes.  Counsel\r\n\nthen  asked for a continuance of 15 months so that petitioner\r\n\ncould accumulate the seven  years required for an application\r\n\nfor  discretionary   relief  under     212(c),   8  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1182(c).1   Petitioner  would  reach the  seven-year mark  in\r                    1\r\n\nJune 1995.\r\n\n          Although acknowledging the presence of  hardship --\r\n\npetitioner has a stammer  which he alleges cannot be  treated\r\n\nin  Jamaica and his mother who lives  here is blind -- the IJ\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Section 212(c) provides in relevant part:\r               1\r\n\n            Aliens lawfully  admitted for permanent\r\n          resident [sic]  who temporarily proceeded\r\n          abroad voluntarily and not under an order\r\n          of deportation, and who are  returning to\r\n          a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven\r\n          consecutive years, may be admitted in the\r\n          discretion of the Attorney General. . . .\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndetermined that there  was no cause  to grant a  continuance.\r\n\nThe  Board of Immigration  Appeals (BIA)  summarily dismissed\r\n\nthe  appeal when  counsel failed  to file  a brief,  and this\r\n\npetition for review ensued.\r\n\n          Petitioner contends that the IJ should have granted\r\n\na  continuance  so  that  he  could  apply  for  a     212(c)\r\n\ndiscretionary waiver.     An  IJ  may grant  a  motion for  a\r\n\ncontinuance \"for good  cause shown.\"   8 C.F.R.    3.29.   We\r\n\nreview the denial of  such a motion for abuse  of discretion.\r\n\nSee  Baires v.  INS, 856  F.2d 89,  91 (9th  Cir. 1988).   In\r                               \r\n\nsupport of  his position  on review, petitioner  first argues\r\n\nthat  as a  statute of  repose and  forgiveness,    212(c) is\r\n\nliberally construed  in favor of aliens.   He then analogizes\r\n\nhis situation to a case  in which the BIA held that  a motion\r\n\nto  reopen  should be  granted where  an  alien has  filed an\r\n\napplication for adjustment of status contemporaneously with a\r\n\nvisa  petition.  See  Matter of Garcia,  16 I. &amp;  N. Dec. 653\r                                                  \r\n\n(BIA 1978).\r\n\n          In Garcia, an IJ had ordered  the deportation of an\r                               \r\n\nalien  as an overstay.   The alien  then moved  to reopen the\r\n\nproceedings  so that  he  could apply  for  an adjustment  of\r\n\nstatus pursuant to    245, 8 U.S.C.   1255.   Ordinarily, the\r\n\nINS required a prima  facie showing that, in addition  to the\r\n\nfiling of an application for an adjustment, (1) the alien was\r\n\neligible  to receive an immigrant  visa and was admissible to\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthe U.S. for permanent  residence, and (2) an  immigrant visa\r\n\nwas  immediately  available to  him or  her  at the  time the\r                                       \r\n\napplication  was  filed.    In  the  case  of  an  adjustment\r\n\napplication  simultaneously filed  with a visa  petition, the\r\n\nINS  would   deny  the  application  because   the  visa,  by\r\n\ndefinition, would not be immediately available.\r\n\n     However, an  amendment to the INA  changed the provision\r\n\nfor  dating the adjustment application.  As a result, the INS\r\n\namended   the   regulations   specifically  to   permit   the\r\n\nsimultaneous  filing  of  an  application  for  adjustment of\r\n\nstatus  and a visa petition.   In Garcia,  the BIA recognized\r                                                    \r\n\nthat  to continue  the  practice  of  requiring  immediately-\r\n\navailable  visas would  nullify the  new simultaneous  filing\r\n\nprovision.   To give proper  effect to this  provision, then,\r\n\nthe BIA  decided that  it would generally  reopen deportation\r\n\nproceedings unless  (1)  ineligibility was  apparent  on  the\r\n\nrecord, or (2) the adjustment application would  be denied on\r\n\nstatutory grounds or as a matter of discretion, even were the\r\n\nvisa  petition  approved.     In  this  way,  the  adjustment\r\n\napplication would be retained until the INS ruled on the visa\r\n\npetition.\r\n\n          We find  Garcia inapposite.  First,  to be entitled\r                                     \r\n\nto reopening, the  alien's visa petition must  be prima facie\r\n\napprovable.   Petitioner's  attempt to  make this  showing in\r\n\nregard to  his  application  for a     212(c)  waiver  fails.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nAccording to him, the IJ opined  that the hardship petitioner\r\n\nalleged would have  been the basis for a  \"successful\" waiver\r\n\napplication.  However, the record does not reveal that the IJ\r\n\nmade such a statement.  Rather, she stated that a continuance\r\n\nof  15  months to  enable petitioner  to  apply for    212(c)\r\n\nrelief was  not a good  reason to grant  petitioner's motion,\r\n\n\"understanding  that there are --  [that] this may  be a case\r\n\nwhere there are -- where  there is hardship.   Unfortunately,\r\n\nthe [petitioner]  has been convicted of  an aggravated felony\r\n\nas he has admitted in his pleadings.\"  At most,  then, the IJ\r\n\nviewed  the case as possibly involving hardship.  Even if she\r                                        \r\n\ndefinitely had  determined the presence of hardship, however,\r\n\nshe still  would need to balance the  humane factors favoring\r\n\nrelief against the adverse factors favoring deportation.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMatter of Marin,  16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581  (BIA 1978); Gouveia v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nINS, 980 F.2d 814, 816 (1st Cir. 1992).\r               \r\n\n          Second,  as the  IJ pointed  out, petitioner  is an\r\n\naggravated felon.   Indeed,  the last  sentence  of    212(c)\r\n\nprovides that an  aggravated felon  who has  served at  least\r\n\nfive years in prison is ineligible to apply for discretionary\r\n\nrelief.   Unlike the amendment to   245, then, the changes to\r\n\n   212(c)   in  regard   to  aggravated  felons   indicate  a\r\n\nrestrictive  approach.   Further,  even  where,  as here,  an\r\n\naggravated felon is entitled to make a    212(c) application,\r\n\n\"it  is  incumbent upon  [such]  a  petitioner  not  only  to\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ndemonstrate that favorable  factors preponderate but also  to\r\n\npresent  'unusual or outstanding  equities' as a prerequisite\r\n\nfor a waiver of excludability.\"  Gouveia, 980 F.2d at 816.\r                                                    \r\n\n          Without  deciding  whether such  equities  exist in\r\n\nthis  case, we cannot say  that the denial  of a continuance,\r\n\nbased in part on petitioner's status as an  aggravated felon,\r\n\nwas in  derogation of the intent  of   212(c).   Here, the IJ\r\n\nrefused a request to continue the proceedings for over a year\r\n\nso that  Martin could  file an application  for discretionary\r\n\nrelief.   Given the length of time involved and the intent of\r\n\nCongress to deport  aggravated felons with  relative dispatch\r\n\nand to  deny them,  in some circumstances,  opportunities for\r\n\nrelief from  deportation, we  conclude  that the  IJ did  not\r\n\nabuse her discretion in denying the motion for a continuance.\r\n\n          The  petition for  review  is summarily  dismissed.\r\n\nSee  Local Rule  27.1.

He was convicted in April 1992 in a Massachusetts Superior Court of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.   The INS then issued an Order to Show Cause in July 1992 based on his conviction of an aggravated felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An immigration judge (IJ) held a deportation hearing in April 1994 at which petitioner was represented by an attorney.   Deportability was conceded and Jamaica designated as the country for deportation purposes.   Counsel then asked for a continuance of 15 months so that petitioner could accumulate the seven years required for an application for discretionary relief under &#167; 212(c), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Petitioner would reach the seven-year mark in June 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although acknowledging the presence of hardship--petitioner has a stammer which he alleges cannot be treated in Jamaica and his mother who lives here is blind--the IJ determined that there was no cause to grant a continuance.   The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily dismissed the appeal when counsel failed to file a brief, and this petition for review ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner contends that the IJ should have granted a continuance so that he could apply for a &#167; 212(c) discretionary waiver.   An IJ may grant a motion for a continuance \"for good cause shown.\"  8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.29.  We review the denial of such a motion for abuse of discretion.  See Baires v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511042\"><a href=\"/opinion/511042/mario-antonio-portillo-baires-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 91 (9th Cir.1988).   In support of his position on review, petitioner first argues that as a statute of repose and forgiveness, &#167; 212(c) is liberally construed in favor of aliens.   He then analogizes his situation to a case in which the BIA held that a motion to reopen should be granted where an alien has filed an application for adjustment of status contemporaneously with a visa petition.  See Matter of Garcia, 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 653 (BIA 1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Garcia, an IJ had ordered the deportation of an alien as an overstay.   The alien then moved to reopen the proceedings so that he could apply for an adjustment of status pursuant to &#167; 245, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255.   Ordinarily, the INS required a prima facie showing that, in addition to the filing of an application for an adjustment, (1) the alien was eligible to receive an immigrant visa and was admissible to the U.S. for permanent residence, and (2) an immigrant visa was immediately available to him or her at the time the application was filed.   In the case of an adjustment application simultaneously filed with a visa petition, the INS would deny the application because the visa, by definition, would not be immediately available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, an amendment to the INA changed the provision for dating the adjustment application.   As a result, the INS amended the regulations specifically to permit the simultaneous filing of an application for adjustment of status and a visa petition.   In Garcia, the BIA recognized that to continue the practice of requiring immediately-available visas would nullify the new simultaneous filing provision.   To give proper effect to this provision, then, the BIA decided that it would generally reopen deportation proceedings unless (1) ineligibility was apparent on the record, or (2) the adjustment application would be denied on statutory grounds or as a matter of discretion, even were the visa petition approved.   In this way, the adjustment application would be retained until the INS ruled on the visa petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Garcia inapposite.   First, to be entitled to reopening, the alien's visa petition must be prima facie approvable.   Petitioner's attempt to make this showing in regard to his application for a &#167; 212(c) waiver fails.   According to him, the IJ opined that the hardship petitioner alleged would have been the basis for a \"successful\" waiver application.   However, the record does not reveal that the IJ made such a statement.   Rather, she stated that a continuance of 15 months to enable petitioner to apply for &#167; 212(c) relief was not a good reason to grant petitioner's motion, \"understanding that there are--[that] this may be a case where there are--where there is hardship.   Unfortunately, the [petitioner] has been convicted of an aggravated felony as he has admitted in his pleadings.\"   At most, then, the IJ viewed the case as possibly involving hardship.   Even if she definitely had determined the presence of hardship, however, she still would need to balance the humane factors favoring relief against the adverse factors favoring deportation.  See Matter of Marin, 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581 (BIA 1978);  Gouveia v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596105\"><a href=\"/opinion/596105/jose-gouveia-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span>, 816 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as the IJ pointed out, petitioner is an aggravated felon.   Indeed, the last sentence of &#167; 212(c) provides that an aggravated felon who has served at least five years in prison is ineligible to apply for discretionary relief.   Unlike the amendment to &#167; 245, then, the changes to &#167; 212(c) in regard to aggravated felons indicate a restrictive approach.   Further, even where, as here, an aggravated felon is entitled to make a &#167; 212(c) application, \"it is incumbent upon [such] a petitioner not only to demonstrate that favorable factors preponderate but also to present 'unusual or outstanding equities' as a prerequisite for a waiver of excludability.\"  Gouveia, 980 F.2d at 816.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without deciding whether such equities exist in this case, we cannot say that the denial of a continuance, based in part on petitioner's status as an aggravated felon, was in derogation of the intent of &#167; 212(c).   Here, the IJ refused a request to continue the proceedings for over a year so that Martin could file an application for discretionary relief.   Given the length of time involved and the intent of Congress to deport aggravated felons with relative dispatch and to deny them, in some circumstances, opportunities for relief from deportation, we conclude that the IJ did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for a continuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is summarily dismissed.   See Local Rule 27.1.   The motion for a stay is denied as moot.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 212(c) provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent resident [sic] who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The INS's denial of petitioner's motion for a stay may be challenged in a habeas corpus proceeding.
