Shortly thereafter, in Stella v.

The  interlocutory\r\n\nappeal in  this case requires us to  reexamine Stella in light of\r                                                               \r\n\nBehrens v. Pelletier, 116 S. Ct. 834, 838-41 (1996).  We conclude\r                              \r\n\nthat our holding in Stella remains fully intact.\r                                    \r\n\n          Before discussing  the issue of  appealability vel non,\r                                                                          \r\n\nwe  first set the stage.  In  1984, Miguel D az Mart nez (Officer\r\n\nD az) became  a  member of  the Puerto  Rico Police  Force.1   He\r\n\ninspired approximately eighteen  disciplinary complaints, many of\r\n\nwhich involved the profligate brandishing or  use of his official\r\n\nfirearm without adequate cause.  The pi ce de r sistance occurred\r                                                                  \r\n\non August  17, 1989,  when, after  assaulting and  threatening to\r\n\nkill his wife, Officer D az captured a police station at gunpoint\r\n\nand held several  fellow officers hostage.   As a result  of this\r\n\nincident,  he  was cashiered  and  involuntarily  committed to  a\r\n\nmental institution for three weeks.\r\n\n          Little daunted, Officer D az pressed  an administrative\r\n\nappeal.   Despite his  earlier escapades, he  eventually regained\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Although  Officer D az  is  a defendant  in the  underlying\r\nsuit, he is not a party to the appeal.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nhis position  on the  force.  At  the time  of his  reinstatement\r\n\n(March 25, 1993), and throughout  the period material hereto, the\r\n\nappellant, Tom s V zquez Rivera (V zquez), served as an assistant\r\n\nsuperintendent of  the  police  force and  the  director  of  its\r\n\n\"Auxiliary  Superintendency  for  Inspections   and  Disciplinary\r\n\nAffairs\"  (having assumed  that post  in August  1990).   In this\r\n\ncapacity, V zquez  was responsible,  inter alia, for  maintaining\r                                                         \r\n\nadministrative complaint records, identifying recidivist officers\r\n\n(those  who  repeatedly  violated  disciplinary  standards),  and\r\n\nensuring that \"problem\" officers  received special training.  The\r\n\nplaintiffs allege that, when Officer D az rejoined the force, the\r\n\npersonnel  director  ordered   an  investigation  preliminary  to\r\n\nauthorizing  him  to  carry  a  firearm,  and  that  one  of  the\r\n\nappellant's  subordinates  gave  D az  a clean  bill  of  health,\r\n\ninforming  the assigned  investigator  that D az's  file did  not\r\n\ncontain any mention of  past complaints or any other  indicium of\r\n\nhis disquieting  history.   They  also  allege that  V zquez,  in\r\n\nderogation of  his assigned  duties, did not  maintain up-to-date\r\n\nfiles, and, consequently, neither identified D az as a recidivist\r\n\nofficer  nor recommended that he undergo remedial training.  As a\r\n\nresult,  Officer  D az  returned  to duty  without  enduring  any\r\n\nprobationary  period,  without receiving  any  remedial training,\r\n\nand,  after a  delay to  permit the  completion of  the personnel\r\n\ndirector's investigation, without having any  restrictions on his\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nright to carry a firearm.2\r\n\n          On his  second day  of armed  duty, September  8, 1993,\r\n\nOfficer D az was stationed at the Barbosa Public Housing Project,\r\n\na  location which  the police  regarded as  a  high-tension area.\r\n\nThat afternoon, while on guard duty, he  accosted the plaintiffs'\r\n\ndecedent, Jos  Manuel Rosario D az (Jos ), a 19-year-old resident\r\n\nof  the  project,  and  ordered him  to  retrieve  identification\r\n\ndocuments  from his  apartment.   When Jos   did not  comply with\r\n\nsufficient  alacrity, Officer  D az shouted  obscenities at  him.\r\n\nJos 's  sister,  Mar a   Rosario  D az   (Mar a),  attempted   to\r\n\nintervene.    A scuffle  ensued.   Officer  D az drew  his police\r\n\nrevolver, fired a bullet  at Mar a (wounding her), and  then shot\r\n\nand killed Jos .\r\n\n          In due  season, Mar a and other  family members brought\r\n\nsuit  under 42 U.S.C.    1983 (1994).   They alleged that Officer\r\n\nD az and several supervisory police officials, including V zquez,\r\n\nhad violated  Mar a's and Jos 's constitutional  rights.  V zquez\r\n\nmoved  for summary  judgment,  raising, inter  alia, a  qualified\r                                                             \r\n\nimmunity defense.  The district court denied his motion.  V zquez\r\n\nnow prosecutes this interlocutory appeal.\r\n\n          Section  1983 provides  for a  private right  of action\r\n\nagainst  public officials who, under  color of state law, deprive\r\n\nindividuals of rights declared by the Constitution or laws of the\r\n\nUnited States.  Nonetheless,  a public official accused of  civil\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2For  purposes of  his  summary  judgment motion,  described\r\ninfra,  V zquez  did  not   contest  these  allegations,  and  we\r               \r\ntherefore must accept them as true.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nrights  violations  is shielded  from  claims  for damages  under\r\n\nsection  1983 as long as his conduct  did not violate rights that\r\n\nwere  \"clearly  established\"  under  the  Constitution  or  under\r\n\nfederal  law.   See Harlow  v. Fitzgerald,  457 U.S.  800, 818-19\r                                                   \r\n\n(1982); Buenrostro v. Collazo,  973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st  Cir. 1992).\r                                       \r\n\nFor purposes of this  defense, a right is clearly  established if\r\n\nthe  \"contours  of  the right  [are]  sufficiently  clear that  a\r\n\nreasonable  official  would  understand  that what  he  is  doing\r\n\nviolates that right.\"   Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.  635, 640\r                                                       \r\n\n(1987).\r\n\n          Interlocutory  orders (such as  orders denying pretrial\r\n\nmotions to  dismiss or for  summary judgment) ordinarily  are not\r\n\nappealable  as of  right at the  time they  are entered.   See 28\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.    1291 (1994).  But where, as here, a defendant seeks the\r\n\nshelter of qualified immunity  by means of a pretrial  motion and\r\n\nthe nisi prius  court denies  the requested  relief, a  different\r\n\nresult sometimes  obtains.   If  the  pretrial rejection  of  the\r\n\nqualified immunity  defense is  based on  a purely  legal ground,\r\n\nsuch  as a finding that  the conduct described  by the plaintiff,\r\n\nassuming it occurred,  transgressed a clearly  established right,\r\n\nthen  the  denial  may  be challenged  through  an  interlocutory\r\n\nappeal.  See  Johnson, 115  S. Ct.  at 2155-56.   Conversely,  \"a\r                               \r\n\ndefendant, entitled  to invoke a qualified-immunity  defense, may\r\n\nnot appeal a district  court's summary judgment order insofar  as\r\n\nthat order determines  whether or  not the  pretrial record  sets\r\n\nforth a `genuine'  issue of fact for  trial.\"  Id. at  2159.  The\r                                                            \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ndividing line that separates an immediately appealable order from\r\n\na  nonappealable  one in  these purlieus  is  not always  easy to\r\n\nvisualize.  In Stella, we attempted to illuminate it:\r                               \r\n\n          Thus, on  the  one hand,  a district  court's\r\n          pretrial rejection of  a proffered  qualified\r\n          immunity    defense    remains    immediately\r\n          appealable  as  a  collateral  order  to  the\r\n          extent that  it turns on a pure issue of law,\r\n          notwithstanding  the  absence   of  a   final\r\n          judgment.    On  the other  hand,  a district\r\n          court's  pretrial  rejection  of a  qualified\r\n          immunity    defense   is    not   immediately\r\n          appealable  to the  extent  that it  turns on\r\n          either an issue of fact or an issue perceived\r\n          by  the trial court  to be an  issue of fact.\r\n          In such a  situation, the  movant must  await\r\n          the entry of  final judgment before appealing\r\n          the adverse ruling.\r\n\nStella, 63 F.3d  at 74  (citations omitted).   Under Johnson  and\r                                                                      \r\n\nStella, then,  a defendant who, like  V zquez, has unsuccessfully\r                \r\n\nsought summary judgment based  on qualified immunity is permitted\r\n\nto  appeal the resultant denial on an interlocutory basis only to\r\n\nthe  extent  that the  qualified  immunity defense  turns  upon a\r\n\n\"purely legal\" question.\r\n\n          Behrens marks the Supreme Court's latest effort to shed\r                           \r\n\nlight  upon the timing of qualified immunity appeals.  There, the\r\n\nCourt noted that  \"[d]enial of summary judgment  often includes a\r\n\ndetermination  that  there  are controverted  issues  of material\r\n\nfact\"  and admonished that Johnson \"does not mean that every such\r                                            \r\n\ndenial  of summary judgment  is nonappealable.\"   Behrens, 116 S.\r                                                                   \r\n\nCt.  at 842.   Rather,  when  a court,  in denying  a motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment premised on qualified immunity,  determines that\r\n\ncertain  conduct  attributed  to  a defendant,  if  proven,  will\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nsuffice  to  show a  violation  of clearly  established  law, the\r\n\ndefendant may  assert on  interlocutory appeal  \"that all  of the\r\n\nconduct which the  District Court  deemed sufficiently  supported\r\n\nfor  purposes  of summary  judgment  met the  Harlow  standard of\r                                                              \r\n\n`objective  legal reasonableness.'\"   Id.  (quoting Harlow).   To\r                                                                    \r\n\nthis extent, Behrens  places a  gloss on Johnson  and reopens  an\r                                                          \r\n\nappellate  avenue  that  some  had  thought  Johnson  foreclosed.\r                                                              \r\n\nStill,  this court anticipated the Behrens gloss in Stella, where\r                                                                    \r\n\nwe wrote that  a summary judgment \"order  that determines whether\r\n\ncertain given facts demonstrate, under clearly established law, a\r\n\nviolation of some  federally protected right\" may  be reviewed on\r\n\nan intermediate appeal, Johnson notwithstanding, without awaiting\r                                         \r\n\nthe  post-trial entry of final judgment.

Thus, Stella survives the emergence of Behrens fully intact\r                                                              \r\n\nand remains the law of this circuit.\r\n\n          The  appeal at hand withers  in the hot  glare of these\r\n\nprecedents.

Jones, 515 U.S. 304, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 2156-59, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995), the Supreme Court discussed the circumstances in which a district court's denial of a public official's attempt to dispose of a claim for money damages by means of a pretrial motion asserting qualified immunity might be immediately appealable.  Shortly thereafter, in Stella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 73-77 (1st Cir.1995), we applied Johnson and elaborated upon our understanding of it.  The interlocutory appeal in this case requires us to reexamine Stella in light of Behrens v. Pelletier, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 834, 838-41, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996).  We conclude that our holding in Stella remains fully intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before discussing the issue of appealability vel non, we first set the stage.  In 1984, Miguel Daz Martnez (Officer Daz) became a member of the Puerto Rico Police Force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He inspired approximately eighteen disciplinary complaints, many of which involved the profligate brandishing or use of his official firearm without adequate cause.  The piece de resistance occurred on August 17, 1989, when, after assaulting and threatening to kill his wife, Officer Daz captured a police station at gunpoint and held several fellow officers hostage.  As a result of this incident, he was cashiered and involuntarily committed to a mental institution for three weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little daunted, Officer Daz pressed an administrative appeal.  Despite his earlier escapades, he eventually regained his position on the force.  At the time of his reinstatement (March 25, 1993), and throughout the period material hereto, the appellant, Tomas Vazquez Rivera (Vazquez), served as an assistant superintendent of the police force and the director of its \"Auxiliary Superintendency for Inspections and Disciplinary Affairs\" (having assumed that post in August 1990).  In this capacity, Vazquez was responsible, inter alia, for maintaining administrative complaint records, identifying recidivist officers (those who repeatedly violated disciplinary standards), and ensuring that \"problem\" officers received special training.  The plaintiffs allege that, when Officer Daz rejoined the force, the personnel director ordered an investigation preliminary to authorizing him to carry a firearm, and that one of the appellant's subordinates gave Daz a clean bill of health, informing the assigned investigator that Daz's file did not contain any mention of past complaints or any other indicium of his disquieting history.  They also allege that Vazquez, in derogation of his assigned duties, did not maintain up-to-date files, and, consequently, neither identified Daz as a recidivist officer nor recommended that he undergo remedial training.  As a result, Officer Daz returned to duty without enduring any probationary period, without receiving any remedial training, and, after a delay to permit the completion of the personnel director's investigation, without having any restrictions on his right to carry a firearm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On his second day of armed duty, September 8, 1993, Officer Daz was stationed at the Barbosa Public Housing Project, a location which the police regarded as a high-tension area.  That afternoon, while on guard duty, he accosted the plaintiffs' decedent, Jose Manuel Rosario Daz (Jose), a 19-year-old resident of the project, and ordered him to retrieve identification documents from his apartment.  When Jose did not comply with sufficient alacrity, Officer Daz shouted obscenities at him.  Jose's sister, Mara Rosario Daz (Mara), attempted to intervene.  A scuffle ensued.  Officer Daz drew his police revolver, fired a bullet at Mara (wounding her), and then shot and killed Jose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, Mara and other family members brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994).  They alleged that Officer Daz and several supervisory police officials, including Vazquez, had violated Mara's and Jose's constitutional rights.  Vazquez moved for summary judgment, raising, inter alia, a qualified immunity defense.  The district court denied his motion.  Vazquez now prosecutes this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1983 provides for a private right of action against public officials who, under color of state law, deprive individuals of rights declared by the Constitution or laws of the United States.  Nonetheless, a public official accused of civil rights violations is shielded from claims for damages under section 1983 as long as his conduct did not violate rights that were \"clearly established\" under the Constitution or under federal law.  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738-39, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982);  Buenrostro v. Collazo, 973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir.1992).  For purposes of this defense, a right is clearly established if the \"contours of the right [are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\"  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interlocutory orders (such as orders denying pretrial motions to dismiss or for summary judgment) ordinarily are not appealable as of right at the time they are entered.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (1994).  But where, as here, a defendant seeks the shelter of qualified immunity by means of a pretrial motion and the nisi prius court denies the requested relief, a different result sometimes obtains.  If the pretrial rejection of the qualified immunity defense is based on a purely legal ground, such as a finding that the conduct described by the plaintiff, assuming it occurred, transgressed a clearly established right, then the denial may be challenged through an interlocutory appeal.  See Johnson, 515 U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2155-56.   Conversely, \"a defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified-immunity defense, may not appeal a district court's summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a 'genuine' issue of fact for trial.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2159.   The dividing line that separates an immediately appealable order from a nonappealable one in these purlieus is not always easy to visualize.  In Stella, we attempted to illuminate it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Thus, on the one hand, a district court's pretrial rejection of a proffered qualified immunity defense remains immediately appealable as a collateral order to the extent that it turns on a pure issue of law, notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.  On the other hand, a district court's pretrial rejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately appealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact or an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact.  In such a situation, the movant must await the entry of final judgment before appealing the adverse ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stella, 63 F.3d at 74 (citations omitted).  Under Johnson and Stella, then, a defendant who, like Vazquez, has unsuccessfully sought summary judgment based on qualified immunity is permitted to appeal the resultant denial on an interlocutory basis only to the extent that the qualified immunity defense turns upon a \"purely legal\" question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Behrens marks the Supreme Court's latest effort to shed light upon the timing of qualified immunity appeals.  There, the Court noted that \"[d]enial of summary judgment often includes a determination that there are controverted issues of material fact\" and admonished that Johnson \"does not mean that every such denial of summary judgment is nonappealable.\"  Behrens, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 842.   Rather, when a court, in denying a motion for summary judgment premised on qualified immunity, determines that certain conduct attributed to a defendant, if proven, will suffice to show a violation of clearly established law, the defendant may assert on interlocutory appeal \"that all of the conduct which the District Court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment met the Harlow standard of 'objective legal reasonableness.' \"  Id. (quoting Harlow ).   To this extent, Behrens places a gloss on Johnson and reopens an appellate avenue that some had thought Johnson foreclosed.  Still, this court anticipated the Behrens gloss in Stella, where we wrote that a summary judgment \"order that determines whether certain given facts demonstrate, under clearly established law, a violation of some federally protected right\" may be reviewed on an intermediate appeal, Johnson notwithstanding, without awaiting the post-trial entry of final judgment.  Stella, 63 F.3d at 74-75.   Thus, Stella survives the emergence of Behrens fully intact and remains the law of this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal at hand withers in the hot glare of these precedents.  Under section 1983, a supervisor may be found liable on the basis of his own acts or omissions.  See Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581-82 (1st Cir.1994).  Such liability can arise out of participation in a custom that leads to a violation of constitutional rights, see, e.g., id. at 582 (citing other cases), or by acting with deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of others, see, e.g., Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir.1989) (citing other cases).  The plaintiffs' case against Vazquez hinges on his alleged deliberate indifference;  they claim, in essence, that if he had minded the store, the shootings would not have transpired because Officer Daz, given his horrendous record, would not have been rearmed (or, at least, would not have been rearmed without first having been retrained and rehabilitated), and therefore, that the tragic events of September 8 would not have occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez's motion for brevis disposition challenged this theory, legally and factually.  In adjudicating it, the district court made a binary determination.  First, the court ruled that a reasonable official in Vazquez's position would have known that the \"failure to take ... remedial actions concerning [a rogue officer] could create supervisory liability.\"   This is a pure conclusion of law as to which, in the qualified immunity context, an immediate appeal lies.  See Behrens, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 839;  Stella, 63 F.3d at 77;  see also Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 528 n. 9, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2816 n. 9, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (acknowledging that the question of whether the conduct attributed by a plaintiff to a particular defendant violates a clearly established right is a \"purely legal\" question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we agree with the lower court that the applicable law was clearly established;  it is beyond serious question that, at the times relevant hereto, a reasonable police supervisor, charged with the duties that Vazquez bore, would have understood that he could be held constitutionally liable for failing to identify and take remedial action concerning an officer with demonstrably dangerous predilections and a checkered history of grave disciplinary problems.  See Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562-64;  see generally Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 582 (explaining that a showing of gross negligence on a supervisory official's part \"can signify deliberate indifference and serve as a basis for supervisory liability if it is causally connected to the actions that work the direct constitutional injury\").  To the extent that Vazquez's appeal seeks to contest this verity, it is baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of the purely legal question, we are left with Vazquez's asseveration that the district court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment because, regardless of legal theory, the evidence was insufficient to establish deliberate indifference on his part, and, thus, he was entitled (at the least) to qualified immunity.  But Judge Laffitte rejected this argument on the basis that the record contained controverted facts and that, if a factfinder were to resolve those disputes favorably to the plaintiffs, he could then find that Vazquez's supervision of the disciplinary affairs bureau was so pathetic that his conduct constituted deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Since Vazquez does not argue that the facts asserted by the plaintiffs, even if altogether true, fail to show deliberate indifference--he argues instead what his counsel termed at oral argument \"the absence of facts,\" i.e., that the facts asserted by the plaintiffs are untrue, unproven, warrant a different spin, tell only a small part of the story, and are presented out of context--the district court's determination is not reviewable on an interlocutory appeal.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span> (1996).  We conclude that our holding in Stella remains fully intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before discussing the issue of appealability vel non, we first set the stage.  In 1984, Miguel Daz Martnez (Officer Daz) became a member of the Puerto Rico Police Force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He inspired approximately eighteen disciplinary complaints, many of which involved the profligate brandishing or use of his official firearm without adequate cause.  The piece de resistance occurred on August 17, 1989, when, after assaulting and threatening to kill his wife, Officer Daz captured a police station at gunpoint and held several fellow officers hostage.  As a result of this incident, he was cashiered and involuntarily committed to a mental institution for three weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little daunted, Officer Daz pressed an administrative appeal.  Despite his earlier escapades, he eventually regained his position on the force.  At the time of his reinstatement (March 25, 1993), and throughout the period material hereto, the appellant, Tomas Vazquez Rivera (Vazquez), served as an assistant superintendent of the police force and the director of its \"Auxiliary Superintendency for Inspections and Disciplinary Affairs\" (having assumed that post in August 1990).  In this capacity, Vazquez was responsible, inter alia, for maintaining administrative complaint records, identifying recidivist officers (those who repeatedly violated disciplinary standards), and ensuring that \"problem\" officers received special training.  The plaintiffs allege that, when Officer Daz rejoined the force, the personnel director ordered an investigation preliminary to authorizing him to carry a firearm, and that one of the appellant's subordinates gave Daz a clean bill of health, informing the assigned investigator that Daz's file did not contain any mention of past complaints or any other indicium of his disquieting history.  They also allege that Vazquez, in derogation of his assigned duties, did not maintain up-to-date files, and, consequently, neither identified Daz as a recidivist officer nor recommended that he undergo remedial training.  As a result, Officer Daz returned to duty without enduring any probationary period, without receiving any remedial training, and, after a delay to permit the completion of the personnel director's investigation, without having any restrictions on his right to carry a firearm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On his second day of armed duty, September 8, 1993, Officer Daz was stationed at the Barbosa Public Housing Project, a location which the police regarded as a high-tension area.  That afternoon, while on guard duty, he accosted the plaintiffs' decedent, Jose Manuel Rosario Daz (Jose), a 19-year-old resident of the project, and ordered him to retrieve identification documents from his apartment.  When Jose did not comply with sufficient alacrity, Officer Daz shouted obscenities at him.  Jose's sister, Mara Rosario Daz (Mara), attempted to intervene.  A scuffle ensued.  Officer Daz drew his police revolver, fired a bullet at Mara (wounding her), and then shot and killed Jose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, Mara and other family members brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994).  They alleged that Officer Daz and several supervisory police officials, including Vazquez, had violated Mara's and Jose's constitutional rights.  Vazquez moved for summary judgment, raising, inter alia, a qualified immunity defense.  The district court denied his motion.  Vazquez now prosecutes this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1983 provides for a private right of action against public officials who, under color of state law, deprive individuals of rights declared by the Constitution or laws of the United States.  Nonetheless, a public official accused of civil rights violations is shielded from claims for damages under section 1983 as long as his conduct did not violate rights that were \"clearly established\" under the Constitution or under federal law.  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For purposes of this defense, a right is clearly established if the \"contours of the right [are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\"  Anderson v. Creighton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 640, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (1994).  But where, as here, a defendant seeks the shelter of qualified immunity by means of a pretrial motion and the nisi prius court denies the requested relief, a different result sometimes obtains.  If the pretrial rejection of the qualified immunity defense is based on a purely legal ground, such as a finding that the conduct described by the plaintiff, assuming it occurred, transgressed a clearly established right, then the denial may be challenged through an interlocutory appeal.  See Johnson, 515 U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2155-56.   Conversely, \"a defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified-immunity defense, may not appeal a district court's summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a 'genuine' issue of fact for trial.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2159.   The dividing line that separates an immediately appealable order from a nonappealable one in these purlieus is not always easy to visualize.  In Stella, we attempted to illuminate it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Thus, on the one hand, a district court's pretrial rejection of a proffered qualified immunity defense remains immediately appealable as a collateral order to the extent that it turns on a pure issue of law, notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.  On the other hand, a district court's pretrial rejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately appealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact or an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact.  In such a situation, the movant must await the entry of final judgment before appealing the adverse ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stella, 63 F.3d at 74 (citations omitted).  Under Johnson and Stella, then, a defendant who, like Vazquez, has unsuccessfully sought summary judgment based on qualified immunity is permitted to appeal the resultant denial on an interlocutory basis only to the extent that the qualified immunity defense turns upon a \"purely legal\" question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Behrens marks the Supreme Court's latest effort to shed light upon the timing of qualified immunity appeals.  There, the Court noted that \"[d]enial of summary judgment often includes a determination that there are controverted issues of material fact\" and admonished that Johnson \"does not mean that every such denial of summary judgment is nonappealable.\"  Behrens, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 842.   Rather, when a court, in denying a motion for summary judgment premised on qualified immunity, determines that certain conduct attributed to a defendant, if proven, will suffice to show a violation of clearly established law, the defendant may assert on interlocutory appeal \"that all of the conduct which the District Court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment met the Harlow standard of 'objective legal reasonableness.' \"  Id. (quoting Harlow ).   To this extent, Behrens places a gloss on Johnson and reopens an appellate avenue that some had thought Johnson foreclosed.  Still, this court anticipated the Behrens gloss in Stella, where we wrote that a summary judgment \"order that determines whether certain given facts demonstrate, under clearly established law, a violation of some federally protected right\" may be reviewed on an intermediate appeal, Johnson notwithstanding, without awaiting the post-trial entry of final judgment.  Stella, 63 F.3d at 74-75.   Thus, Stella survives the emergence of Behrens fully intact and remains the law of this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal at hand withers in the hot glare of these precedents.  Under section 1983, a supervisor may be found liable on the basis of his own acts or omissions.  See Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 581-82 (1st Cir.1994).  Such liability can arise out of participation in a custom that leads to a violation of constitutional rights, see, e.g., id. at 582 (citing other cases), or by acting with deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of others, see, e.g., Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527780\"><a href=\"/opinion/527780/carlos-a-gutierrez-rodriguez-v-desiderio-cartagena-and-domingo-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 562 (1st Cir.1989) (citing other cases).  The plaintiffs' case against Vazquez hinges on his alleged deliberate indifference;  they claim, in essence, that if he had minded the store, the shootings would not have transpired because Officer Daz, given his horrendous record, would not have been rearmed (or, at least, would not have been rearmed without first having been retrained and rehabilitated), and therefore, that the tragic events of September 8 would not have occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vazquez's motion for brevis disposition challenged this theory, legally and factually.  In adjudicating it, the district court made a binary determination.  First, the court ruled that a reasonable official in Vazquez's position would have known that the \"failure to take ... remedial actions concerning [a rogue officer] could create supervisory liability.\"   This is a pure conclusion of law as to which, in the qualified immunity context, an immediate appeal lies.  See Behrens, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 839;  Stella, 63 F.3d at 77;  see also Mitchell v. Forsyth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 528 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></a></span>, 2816 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span> (1985) (acknowledging that the question of whether the conduct attributed by a plaintiff to a particular defendant violates a clearly established right is a \"purely legal\" question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we agree with the lower court that the applicable law was clearly established;  it is beyond serious question that, at the times relevant hereto, a reasonable police supervisor, charged with the duties that Vazquez bore, would have understood that he could be held constitutionally liable for failing to identify and take remedial action concerning an officer with demonstrably dangerous predilections and a checkered history of grave disciplinary problems.  See Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562-64;  see generally Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 582 (explaining that a showing of gross negligence on a supervisory official's part \"can signify deliberate indifference and serve as a basis for supervisory liability if it is causally connected to the actions that work the direct constitutional injury\").  To the extent that Vazquez's appeal seeks to contest this verity, it is baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of the purely legal question, we are left with Vazquez's asseveration that the district court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment because, regardless of legal theory, the evidence was insufficient to establish deliberate indifference on his part, and, thus, he was entitled (at the least) to qualified immunity.  But Judge Laffitte rejected this argument on the basis that the record contained controverted facts and that, if a factfinder were to resolve those disputes favorably to the plaintiffs, he could then find that Vazquez's supervision of the disciplinary affairs bureau was so pathetic that his conduct constituted deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs' rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Since Vazquez does not argue that the facts asserted by the plaintiffs, even if altogether true, fail to show deliberate indifference--he argues instead what his counsel termed at oral argument \"the absence of facts,\" i.e., that the facts asserted by the plaintiffs are untrue, unproven, warrant a different spin, tell only a small part of the story, and are presented out of context--the district court's determination is not reviewable on an interlocutory appeal.  See Behrens, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 842;  Johnson, 515 U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2156-59;  Berdecia-Perez v.
