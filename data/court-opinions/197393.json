This appeal is  a sequel to\r                                            \r\n\nSimon v. Navon, 71 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 1995), in which we affirmed a\r                        \r\n\nMay 19,  1994 judgment for  plaintiff Simon against  Jonathan and\r\n\nGershon Navon on a breach of contract action, reversed a judgment\r\n\non  an abuse  of  process  claim,  and  vacated  and  remanded  a\r\n\ndefamation  claim.  After the  case was returned  to the district\r\n\ncourt, both Navons then  being debtors in bankruptcy proceedings,\r\n\nfurther  action was  suspended  until the  bankruptcy cases  were\r\n\nterminated, Jonathan's by  a discharge in April  and Gershon's by\r\n\ndismissal in June of 1996.\r\n\n     Subsequently, defendant Gershon Navon, on the basis of newly\r\n\nacquired information,  on September 6,  1996, filed a  motion for\r\n\nrelief from the breach of contract judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\n60(b)(3) and (6),1 claiming that Simon had  given false testimony\r\n\nat trial and had withheld documents during discovery.\r\n\n     The district  court, without  granting further  discovery or\r\n\nhearing, denied the motion for relief, ruling as follows:\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  In relevant part, Rules 60(b)(3) and (6) state:\r\n\n          On motion . . . the court may relieve a party . .\r\n     . from a final judgment . . . for the following\r\n     reasons: . . . (3) fraud . . . , misrepresentation, or\r\n     other misconduct of an adverse party; . . . or (6) any\r\n     other reason justifying relief from the operation of\r\n     the judgment.  The motion shall be made within a\r\n     reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not\r\n     more than one year after the judgment . . . .  This\r\n     rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain\r\n     an independent action to relieve a party from a\r\n     judgment . . . or to set aside a judgment for fraud\r\n     upon the court.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     1.  Defendant's motion  is untimely in that it  was not\r\n     filed within one year  following judgment of this case,\r\n     in accordance with Rule 60(b)(3).\r\n\n     2.  Even if  timely filed, the defendant has  failed to\r\n     make  out a showing  of fraud, in  accordance with Rule\r\n     60(b)(6).\r\n\n     We  are  confronted  with  three questions.    The  first is\r\n\nwhether  the court erred in  ruling that the  60(b)(3) motion was\r\n\nuntimely filed, i.e., after the expiration  of the maximum period\r\n\nof  one  year.   More precisely,  we  must consider  the implicit\r\n\nruling that the  pendency of bankruptcy proceedings  did not toll\r\n\nthe running  of the  one year  period.   The  second question  is\r\n\nwhether  the  court erred  in  ruling  that appellant  failed  to\r\n\ndemonstrate  a 60(b)(6)  claim for  \"any other  reason justifying\r\n\nrelief,\" a claim  not subject to  a specific limitations  period.\r\n\nAnd finally, we address the  subset of 60(b)(6), the denial of  a\r\n\nclaim asserting fraud upon the court.\r\n\n     These questions turn out to raise purely legal issues, as to\r\n\nwhich our standard of review  is plenary.  We take the  facts \"as\r\n\nthe  moving party alleges, to see whether those facts, if proven,\r\n\nwould warrant  relief.\"   Teamsters,  Chauffers Local  No. 59  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSuperline Transportation  Co., 953  F.2d 17,  18 (1st  Cir. 1992)\r                                       \r\n\n(citing  United States  v. Baus,  834 F.2d  1114, 1121  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1987)).  We conclude that the district court did not err.\r\n\n            I. Timeliness of the Rule 60(b)(3) Filing\r\n\n     The motion for relief  was filed on September 6,  1996, some\r\n\ntwo years, three and a half months after  the amended judgment of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nMay 19, 1994.   This, of course,  exceeded the maximum period  of\r\n\none year allowed by the rule for (b)(3) claims.  \r\n\n     Appellant devotes one paragraph of his brief to the argument\r\n\nthat the one year period does not begin  to run from the entry of\r\n\njudgment following trial, but rather from November  27, 1995, the\r\n\ndate  of our  decision  in the  prior  appeal.   This  is so,  he\r\n\nasserts, because we \"substantially altered\" the earlier judgment,\r\n\nand  he cites  as  support 11  Charles Alan  Wright  &amp; Arthur  R.\r\n\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure,   2866, at 390-91 (2d ed.\r                                                \r\n\n1995).   But  the breach  of contract  ruling, the  only judgment\r\n\nplaced in  issue by the motion for relief, was not altered in any\r\n\nway.  As the Supreme Court stated in a similar context: \r\n\n     The test is a  practical one.  The question  is whether\r\n     the .  . . court .  . . has disturbed  or revised legal\r\n     rights and  obligations which, by [the] prior judgment,\r\n     had been plainly and properly settled with finality.\r\n\nFTC  v. Minneapolis-Honeywell  Regulator Co.,  344 U.S.  206, 212\r                                                      \r\n\n(1952) (timeliness  of petition  for certiorari).   The situation\r\n\nhere is  legally indistinguishable from that  in Transit Casualty\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo. v. Security Trust  Co., 441 F.2d 788, 790-91 (5th Cir. 1971),\r                                    \r\n\nwhere an amended judgment  merely changed a dismissal from  \"with\r\n\nprejudice\" to \"without  prejudice,\" and the  court noted that  in\r\n\nthe suit at  issue, \"plaintiffs  stood in the  exact position  as\r\n\nthey  did [after the original  order].\"  See  also Gegenheimer v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGalan, 920 F.2d 307, 309-310  (5th Cir. 1991).  This  argument is\r               \r\n\ntherefore unavailing.\r\n\n     Appellant's more  labored argument focuses on  the effect of\r\n\nbankruptcy proceedings in extending time limits in non-bankruptcy\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncases involving  the bankruptcy debtor.   An involuntary petition\r\n\nin  bankruptcy was filed against  Gershon Navon on  May 14, 1994,\r\n\nand was dismissed on June  11, 1996.  Appellant makes a  two-step\r\n\nargument.   He first invokes 11 U.S.C.   108(c) of the Bankruptcy\r\n\nCode, which states in part:\r\n\n     [I]f applicable  nonbankruptcy law . . . fixes a period\r\n     for commencing or continuing a civil action . . . on  a\r\n     claim against the debtor, . . . and such period has not\r\n     expired before the date of the filing of  the petition,\r\n     then such period does not expire until the later of --\r\n\n          (1)  the end  of such  period, including  any\r\n          suspension of  such  period occurring  on  or\r\n          after the commencement of the case; or\r\n\n          (2)  30 days after  notice of the termination\r\n          or expiration of the stay under section 362 .\r\n\n          . .\r\n\n     This section is  applicable, appellant  argues, because  his\r\n\nmotion for relief sought to continue the civil action on  a claim\r\n\noriginally filed against the debtor.  Then, relying on subsection\r\n\n(1),  he  assumes,  without   citation  of  authority,  that  the\r\n\n\"suspension  of such period\" was  triggered by the automatic stay\r\n\nprovision  of the Bankruptcy  Code, 11 U.S.C.    362(a)(1), which\r\n\nstates:\r\n\n     [A bankruptcy petition] . . . operates as a stay  . . .\r\n     of .  . . the commencement  or continuation . .  . of a\r\n     judicial  . . . action or proceeding against the debtor\r\n     . . . .\r\n\n     Appellee  counters with  three  arguments.   He first  urges\r\n\nthat,  given the  passage of  27 months  from the  date  of final\r\n\njudgment,  the district court did  not abuse its  discretion.  He\r\n\nnext argues that the automatic stay of   362 is inapplicable when\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\na debtor in possession undertakes affirmative action for his  own\r\n\nbenefit, citing  Autoskill, Inc. v. National  Educ. Support Sys.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n994  F.2d 1476 (10th  Cir. 1993).   Finally,  he asserts  that 11\r\n\nU.S.C.   108(c) is inapplicable to actions brought by the debtor.\r\n\nInstead,  he invokes     108(a), concerning  the commencement  of\r\n\nactions by debtors,  which in  his view would  impose an  outside\r\n\nlimit of two years from the May 1994 judgment.\r\n\n     All  of appellee's arguments  misfire.  To  begin, the issue\r\n\nbeing purely  legal, abuse of  discretion is not  the appropriate\r\n\nstandard of review.  Secondly, the  fact that it was the  debtor,\r\n\nrather than a creditor, who took this particular step of filing a\r\n\nmotion,  does   not  alter  the   fact  that  it   constitutes  a\r\n\n\"continuation\" of  an \"action  or proceeding against  the debtor\"\r\n\nwithin the terms of   362.  The Ninth Circuit, in Parker v. Bain,\r                                                                          \r\n\n68  F.3d   1131,  1135-36  (9th   Cir.  1995),  dealt   with  the\r\n\napplicability of   362 to an appeal by a debtor, raising the same\r\n\nissue.   It said that it  did not need to \"spill  a great deal of\r\n\nink\"  on the  assertion  \"that an  appeal  by the  debtor  cannot\r                                                       \r\n\nconstitute the continuation of an action against the debtor.\"  It\r                                                          \r\n\nobserved that  seven other circuits had  rejected that rationale.\r\n\nWe now make the number nine.\r\n\n     Parker v. Bain  also noted  Autoskill, see 68  F.3d at  1136\r                                                         \r\n\nn.8,  which had held that Bankruptcy Rule 6009, allowing a debtor\r\n\nin possession  \"[w]ith or  without court approval\"  to \"prosecute\r\n\nany action or proceeding  in behalf of the estate,\"  obviated any\r\n\nneed  to obtain leave of court or release of stay before bringing\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nan appeal.  994 F.2d at 1486.  The Parker court was crystal clear\r                                                   \r\n\nthat \"Rule 6009 does  not trump the code's  automatic stay.\"   It\r\n\nrelied on the analysis of Rule 6009's history  and purpose by the\r\n\nBankruptcy Court in In  re Capgro Leasing Assocs., 169  B.R. 305,\r                                                           \r\n\n309-313 (Bankr.  E.D.N.Y.  1994), which  held  that a  debtor  in\r\n\npossession  may not proceed with  an appeal of  an action brought\r\n\nagainst him \"absent an  order granting relief from  the automatic\r\n\nstay,\"  id. at 313.   The Bankruptcy Court  concluded that, while\r                     \r\n\nRule 6009 means  that a trustee  (or debtor in possession)  is no\r\n\nlonger required  to have  the  approval of  the bankruptcy  judge\r\n\nbefore deciding to commence or defend an  action on behalf of the\r\n\nestate, the bankruptcy judge retains power under section  362 \"to\r\n\ndecide  when to  let such  action go  forward.\"   Id.   The Ninth\r                                                              \r\n\nCircuit therefore parted company from Autoskill, and so do we.2\r                                                         \r\n\n     As  for the applicability of    108(a), our  short answer is\r\n\nthat by its terms it refers only to periods within which a debtor\r\n\nmay  \"commence an  action\";  here, the  action  is one  that  was\r\n\ncommenced against the debtor.\r\n\n     But  while  appellee  has  not  come  close  to  the target,\r\n\nappellant's thrusts have also fallen short.  As we have noted, he\r\n\nhas assumed that  the mere existence of an automatic stay under  \r\n\n362 triggers the \"suspension\" referred to in    108(c).  This may\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2 Indeed, the court in Capgro noted that eight of the twelve\r                                            \r\ncircuits at that time had held that the automatic stay prevents a\r\ndebtor from appealing the decision of a non-bankruptcy forum,\r\nwhere that action was originally commenced against the debtor. \r\n169 B.R. at 310.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nbe a  common sense  reading,  but it  is not  the  law.

In some jurisdictions state law may dictate\r\n     suspension  of   a  statute   of  limitations   when  a\r\n     bankruptcy or  another court proceeding  has stayed the\r\n     initiation  of  an  action.     Such  suspension  would\r\n     presumably  be  included within  the  terms of  section\r\n     108(c),  adding  the entire  duration of  the automatic\r\n     stay to the applicable time period.

After stating that subsection (c) of  \r\n\n108  extends the statute of limitations  for creditors (which, as\r\n\nwe have pointed out, it also does for debtors in possession), the\r\n\nreport states: \r\n\n     [I]f a creditor is stayed from commencing or continuing\r\n     an action against the  debtor because of the bankruptcy\r\n     case, then  the creditor is permitted  an additional 30\r\n     days after notice  of the  event by which  the stay  is\r\n     terminated,  whether  that  event  be  relief from  the\r\n     automatic  stay  .   .  .  ,  [or]the  closing  of  the\r\n     bankruptcy case (which terminates the stay) . . . .\r\n\nH.R.

Eagle Lake Water &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nSewer Dist., 615 A.2d 600, 603-604 (Me. 1992).  In that case, the\r                     \r\n\ncourt made  known its views  as to  the meaning of  the identical\r\n\n\"any suspension\" language  of 11 U.S.C.    108(b).   It chose  to\r\n\nadopt the reasoning of  the Bankruptcy Court for the  District of\r\n\nMaine that    362 \"does not stay the running of any time period,\"\r\n\nbut  only prevents  an entity  from exercising  a power,  such as\r\n\nenforcing a judgment.  In re Thom, 95 B.R. 261, 262-63 (Bankr. D.\r                                           \r\n\nMe. 1989).\r\n\n     The  motion for relief having  been filed more  than 30 days\r\n\nafter notice  of the termination of  bankruptcy proceedings,3 and\r\n\nthere  having  been  no suspension  of  the  one  year period  of\r\n\nlimitations,  we  hold that  the district  court  did not  err in\r\n\ndeclaring it untimely.\r\n\n             II. Viability of the Rule 60(b)(6) Claim\r\n\n     Appellant faces  formidable hurdles  in pursuing a  60(b)(6)\r\n\nclaim.  There must exist \"exceptional\" circumstances that justify\r\n\n\"extraordinary\" relief.

Aldridge, 969 F.2d 1315, 1317 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                     \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3 We discuss infra at page 11 our assumption of notice.\r                                 \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n     We  begin by  accepting for purposes  of our  legal analysis\r\n\nappellant's  summary,  in his  reply  brief,  of his  motion  for\r\n\nrelief,   which   he   contends   describes   both   \"exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances\" and a \"fraud upon the court\":\r\n\n     For the purposes of this appeal, Simon has acknowledged\r\n     that he  deceived not only Gershon Navon,  but also the\r\n     judicial  system, including  both the  bankruptcy court\r\n     and  the federal  district court,  with respect  to the\r\n     nature  and  extent  of  his interest  in  ACI's  claim\r\n     against Maine Coast.  Simon not only consciously failed\r\n     to  reveal to  Gershon Navon  [a fellow  stockholder in\r\n     Maine Coast], the creditors of Maine Coast, the Trustee\r\n     in the Maine Coast  bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Court\r\n     that  he  held  100%  of the  interest  in  ACI's claim\r\n     against Maine Coast while  professing at all times that\r\n     his  interest was  indirect  and negligible.   He  even\r\n     testified  at  the  trial   that  ACI  was  still  owed\r\n     considerable sums of money, when he previously had paid\r\n     to  ACI  the  amount owed  to  the  penny  and took  an\r\n     assignment of ACI's claim.  No wonder Simon always took\r\n     the position Maine  Coast had no  defense or offset  to\r\n     ACI's claim.\r\n\n     Appellant's first hurdle is  the rule of mutual exclusivity,\r\n\nthat is, that a  motion under Rule 60(b)(6) \"is  only appropriate\r\n\nwhen none of the first five subsections pertain,\" Cotto v. United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates, 993 F.2d 274, 278 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Liljeberg  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHealth Services  Acquisition  Corp., 486  U.S.  847, 863  &amp;  n.11\r                                             \r\n\n(1988);  Wright &amp; Miller, supra,   2864 at 357.  One rationale of\r                                         \r\n\nthis  rule is obvious and  relevant here:   were Rule 60(b)(6) to\r\n\nallow a second out-of-time bite at the same apple, the stringent,\r\n\nfinality-enforcing  limitation period  of  60(b)(1)-(3) would  be\r\n\neviscerated.  This rule, however, does have a small escape hatch,\r\n\nin  the event  of  \"extraordinary  circumstances.\"  Ackermann  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nUnited States, 340 U.S.  193, 197-202 (1950); Cotto, 993  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n278; Wright &amp; Miller, supra,   2864 at 365.\r                                     \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n     Here, however,  nothing which  could fall under  that rubric\r\n\nhas been suggested.   The 60(b)(6) claim is one solely for deceit\r\n\nand fraud on the part  of one party toward another, with  nothing\r\n\nto distinguish it from a timely 60(b)(3) claim except that it was\r\n\nfiled some two months beyond the 30 days after the termination of\r\n\nbankruptcy proceedings allowed by   108(c).\r\n\n     The   circumstances   of  this   delay   demonstrate  rather\r\n\nforcefully   the   absence   of   any    special   justification.\r\n\nCommendably,  appellant's counsel  has  candidly acknowledged  by\r\n\naffidavit  that he  first learned  in December  1995 of  leads to\r\n\ninformation that Simon  had misled defendants, and  that over the\r\n\nnext  couple  of months  he  received  documents and  information\r\n\nsupportive of a motion for relief from judgment.  His reasons for\r\n\nnot filing such  a motion  earlier were that  (1) he  anticipated\r\n\nthat  more  information  would  be forthcoming,  and  thought  it\r\n\n\"prudent  to  collect  as  much information  as  possible  before\r\n\nfiling\"; (2) that he considered that all activity in the case was\r\n\nstayed by the bankruptcy  proceedings of the two Navons;  and (3)\r\n\nthat he had no notice of the dismissal of his client's bankruptcy\r\n\nproceedings  until late July or  early August when  he was orally\r\n\ninformed by counsel for Simon.\r\n\n     On this state of  the record, we must assume  that appellant\r\n\nreceived notice  of the  dismissal of his  involuntary bankruptcy\r\n\ncase.  Bankruptcy  Rule 2002(f)  requires that the  clerk of  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court \"or some  other person as the Court  may direct,\r\n\nshall give the debtor . . . notice by mail of . . . (2) dismissal\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nof the case .  . . .\"  There  is no suggestion that this  was not\r\n\ndone.\r\n\n     In  effect, appellant  asks  us to  allow  a tardy  60(b)(3)\r\n\nmotion to parade under the raiment of 60(b)(6), where the reasons\r\n\nfor  the  tardiness lay  in  counsel's  strategic preference  and\r\n\nmistaken legal  assumption concerning the effect  of an automatic\r\n\nstay,  and  the  failure  of  communication  between  client  and\r\n\ncounsel.  These are not the kind of \"extraordinary circumstances\"\r\n\njustifying departure  from the normal maximum  limitations period\r\n\nrequired by Rule 60(b)(3).\r\n\n                    III.  Fraud Upon the Court\r\n\n     Rule 60(b),  after delineating the  six bases  of a  motion,\r\n\ngoes  on to  state that  the  power of  a  court to  set aside  a\r\n\njudgment for fraud upon the court is not limited by the rule.  It\r\n\nis an explicit recognition of the traditional inherent power of a\r\n\ncourt to protect its own essential functioning and integrity.  It\r\n\nis, however, a power rarely to be used. \r\n\n     We  recently had occasion to review the scope of \"fraud upon\r\n\nthe  court\" in connection with the parallel provision of the rule\r\n\nallowing  a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a\r\n\nparty from a judgment for fraud upon the court.

Navon, 71 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.1995), in which we affirmed a May 19, 1994 judgment for plaintiff Simon against Jonathan and Gershon Navon on a breach of contract action, reversed a judgment on an abuse of process claim, and vacated and remanded a defamation claim.  After the case was returned to the district court, both Navons then being debtors in bankruptcy proceedings, further action was suspended until the bankruptcy cases were terminated, Jonathan's by a discharge in April and Gershon's by dismissal in June of 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, defendant Gershon Navon, on the basis of newly acquired information, on September 6, 1996, filed a motion for relief from the breach of contract judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) and (6),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> claiming that Simon had given false testimony at trial and had withheld documents during discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, without granting further discovery or hearing, denied the motion for relief, ruling as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>1.  Defendant's motion is untimely in that it was not filed within one year following judgment of this case, in accordance with Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>2. Even if timely filed, the defendant has failed to make out a showing of fraud, in accordance with Rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are confronted with three questions.  The first is whether the court erred in ruling that the 60(b)(3) motion was untimely filed, i.e., after the expiration of the maximum period of one year.  More precisely, we must consider the implicit ruling that the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings did not toll the running of the one year period.  The second question is whether the court erred in ruling that appellant failed to demonstrate a 60(b)(6) claim for \"any other reason justifying relief,\" a claim not subject to a specific limitations period.  And finally, we address the subset of 60(b)(6), the denial of a claim asserting fraud upon the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These questions turn out to raise purely legal issues, as to which our standard of review is plenary.  We take the facts \"as the moving party alleges, to see whether those facts, if proven, would warrant relief.\"  Teamsters, Chauffeurs Local No. 59 v. Superline Transportation Co., 953 F.2d 17, 18 (1st Cir.1992) (citing United States v. Baus, 834 F.2d 1114, 1121 (1st Cir.1987)).  We conclude that the district court did not err.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Timeliness of the Rule 60(b)(3) Filing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for relief was filed on September 6, 1996, some two years, three and a half months after the amended judgment of May 19, 1994.  This, of course, exceeded the maximum period of one year allowed by the rule for (b)(3) claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant devotes one paragraph of his brief to the argument that the one year period does not begin to run from the entry of judgment following trial, but rather from November 27, 1995, the date of our decision in the prior appeal.  This is so, he asserts, because we \"substantially altered\" the earlier judgment, and he cites as support 11 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, &#167; 2866, at 390-91 (2d ed.1995).  But the breach of contract ruling, the only judgment placed in issue by the motion for relief, was not altered in any way.  As the Supreme Court stated in a similar context:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The test is a practical one.  The question is whether the ... court ... has disturbed or revised legal rights and obligations which, by [the] prior judgment, had been plainly and properly settled with finality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FTC v.

The situation here is legally indistinguishable from that in Transit Casualty Co. v. Security Trust Co., 441 F.2d 788, 790-91 (5th Cir.1971), where an amended judgment merely changed a dismissal from \"with prejudice\" to \"without prejudice,\" and the court noted that in the suit at issue, \"plaintiffs stood in the exact position as they did [after the original order].\"  See also Gegenheimer v. Galan, 920 F.2d 307, 309-310 (5th Cir.1991).  This argument is therefore unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's more labored argument focuses on the effect of bankruptcy proceedings in extending time limits in non-bankruptcy cases involving the bankruptcy debtor.  An involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against Gershon Navon on May 14, 1994, and was dismissed on June 11, 1996.  Appellant makes a two-step argument.  He first invokes 11 U.S.C. &#167; 108(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[I]f applicable nonbankruptcy law ... fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action ... on a claim against the debtor, ... and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, then such period does not expire until the later of--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>(2) 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay under section 362 ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This section is applicable, appellant argues, because his motion for relief sought to continue the civil action on a claim originally filed against the debtor.  Then, relying on subsection (1), he assumes, without citation of authority, that the \"suspension of such period\" was triggered by the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(1), which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>[A bankruptcy petition] ... operates as a stay ... of ... the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial ... action or proceeding against the debtor....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee counters with three arguments.  He first urges that, given the passage of 27 months from the date of final judgment, the district court did not abuse its discretion.  He next argues that the automatic stay of &#167; 362 is inapplicable when a debtor in possession undertakes affirmative action for his own benefit, citing Autoskill, Inc. v. National Educ. Support Systems, 994 F.2d 1476 (10th Cir.1993).  Finally, he asserts that 11 U.S.C. &#167; 108(c) is inapplicable to actions brought by the debtor.  Instead, he invokes &#167; 108(a), concerning the commencement of actions by debtors, which in his view would impose an outside limit of two years from the May 1994 judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of appellee's arguments misfire.  To begin, the issue being purely legal, abuse of discretion is not the appropriate standard of review.  Secondly, the fact that it was the debtor, rather than a creditor, who took this particular step of filing a motion, does not alter the fact that it constitutes a \"continuation\" of an \"action or proceeding against the debtor\" within the terms of &#167; 362.  The Ninth Circuit, in Parker v. Bain, 68 F.3d 1131, 1135-36 (9th Cir.1995), dealt with the applicability of &#167; 362 to an appeal by a debtor, raising the same issue.  It said that it did not need to \"spill a great deal of ink\" on the assertion \"that an appeal by the debtor cannot constitute the continuation of an action against the debtor.\"   It observed that seven other circuits had rejected that rationale.  We now make the number nine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker v. Bain also noted Autoskill, see 68 F.3d at 1136 n. 8, which had held that Bankruptcy Rule 6009, allowing a debtor in possession \"[w]ith or without court approval\" to \"prosecute any action or proceeding in behalf of the estate,\" obviated any need to obtain leave of court or release of stay before bringing an appeal.  994 F.2d at 1486.   The Parker court was crystal clear that \"Rule 6009 does not trump the code's automatic stay.\"   It relied on the analysis of Rule 6009's history and purpose by the Bankruptcy Court in In re Capgro Leasing Assocs., 169 B.R. 305, 309-313 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1994), which held that a debtor in possession may not proceed with an appeal of an action brought against him \"absent an order granting relief from the automatic stay,\" id. at 313.   The Bankruptcy Court concluded that, while Rule 6009 means that a trustee (or debtor in possession) is no longer required to have the approval of the bankruptcy judge before deciding to commence or defend an action on behalf of the estate, the bankruptcy judge retains power under section 362 \"to decide when to let such action go forward.\"  Id. The Ninth Circuit therefore parted company from Autoskill, and so do we.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the applicability of &#167; 108(a), our short answer is that by its terms it refers only to periods within which a debtor may \"commence an action\";  here, the action is one that was commenced against the debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while appellee has not come close to the target, appellant's thrusts have also fallen short.  As we have noted, he has assumed that the mere existence of an automatic stay under &#167; 362 triggers the \"suspension\" referred to in &#167; 108(c).  This may be a common sense reading, but it is not the law.  Collier Bankruptcy Manual sets forth the vital caveat to \"such suspension\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Such a suspension may result from either state or federal law....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... In some jurisdictions state law may dictate suspension of a statute of limitations when a bankruptcy or another court proceeding has stayed the initiation of an action.  Such suspension would presumably be included within the terms of section 108(c), adding the entire duration of the automatic stay to the applicable time period.  [Footnote omitted.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, absent such a provision in state law, a statute of limitations or other deadline for an action against a debtor ... is extended for only the second period set forth in section 108(c), 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the automatic stay....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence P. King, ed., 1 Collier Bankruptcy Manual, p 108.04 at 108-14, 15 (3d ed.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation also accords with the contemporaneous analysis of the section in the House Report accompanying the 1977 Bankruptcy Code revision.  After stating that subsection (c) of &#167; 108 extends the statute of limitations for creditors (which, as we have pointed out, it also does for debtors in possession), the report states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>[I]f a creditor is stayed from commencing or continuing an action against the debtor because of the bankruptcy case, then the creditor is permitted an additional 30 days after notice of the event by which the stay is terminated, whether that event be relief from the automatic stay ..., [or]the closing of the bankruptcy case (which terminates the stay)....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, at 318 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only Maine statute we have found that bears on this issue is Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 5803, which mandates continuance of actions for recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy during bankruptcy proceedings, but only \"on petition of ... creditors before or after the commencement of the action.\"   This is of no avail to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have, however, conclusive evidence of the absence of any suspension-extending provision of Maine law in a recent decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, Duprey v. Eagle Lake Water &amp; Sewer Dist., 615 A.2d 600, 603-604 (Me.1992).  In that case, the court made known its views as to the meaning of the identical \"any suspension\" language of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 108(b).  It chose to adopt the reasoning of the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maine that &#167; 362 \"does not stay the running of any time period,\" but only prevents an entity from exercising a power, such as enforcing a judgment.  In re Thom, 95 B.R. 261, 262-63 (Bankr.D.Me.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for relief having been filed more than 30 days after notice of the termination of bankruptcy proceedings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and there having been no suspension of the one year period of limitations, we hold that the district court did not err in declaring it untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Viability of the Rule 60(b)(6) Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant faces formidable hurdles in pursuing a 60(b)(6) claim.  There must exist \"exceptional\" circumstances that justify \"extraordinary\" relief.  Valley Citizens for a Safe Environment v. Aldridge, 969 F.2d 1315, 1317 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by accepting for purposes of our legal analysis appellant's summary, in his reply brief, of his motion for relief, which he contends describes both \"exceptional circumstances\" and a \"fraud upon the court\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>For the purposes of this appeal, Simon has acknowledged that he deceived not only Gershon Navon, but also the judicial system, including both the bankruptcy court and the federal district court, with respect to the nature and extent of his interest in ACI's claim against Maine Coast.  Simon not only consciously failed to reveal to Gershon Navon [a fellow stockholder in Maine Coast], the creditors of Maine Coast, the Trustee in the Maine Coast bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Court that he held 100% of the interest in ACI's claim against Maine Coast while professing at all times that his interest was indirect and negligible.  He even testified at the trial that ACI was still owed considerable sums of money, when he previously had paid to ACI the amount owed to the penny and took an assignment of ACI's claim.  No wonder Simon always took the position Maine Coast had no defense or offset to ACI's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's first hurdle is the rule of mutual exclusivity, that is, that a motion under Rule 60(b)(6) \"is only appropriate when none of the first five subsections pertain,\" Cotto v. United States, 993 F.2d 274, 278 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 &amp; n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 2204 &amp; n. 11, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988);  Wright &amp; Miller, Kane, supra, &#167; 2864 at 357.  One rationale of this rule is obvious and relevant here:  were Rule 60(b)(6) to allow a second out-of-time bite at the same apple, the stringent, finalityenforcing limitation period of 60(b)(1)-(3) would be eviscerated.  This rule, however, does have a small escape hatch, in the event of \"extraordinary circumstances.\"  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 197-202, 71 S.Ct. 209, 211-14, 95 L.Ed. 207 (1950);  Cotto, 993 F.2d at 278;  Wright &amp; Miller, Kane, supra, &#167; 2864 at 365.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, nothing which could fall under that rubric has been suggested.  The 60(b)(6) claim is one solely for deceit and fraud on the part of one party toward another, with nothing to distinguish it from a timely 60(b)(3) claim except that it was filed some two months beyond the 30 days after the termination of bankruptcy proceedings allowed by &#167; 108(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances of this delay demonstrate rather forcefully the absence of any special justification.  Commendably, appellant's counsel has candidly acknowledged by affidavit that he first learned in December 1995 of leads to information that Simon had misled defendants, and that over the next couple of months he received documents and information supportive of a motion for relief from judgment.  His reasons for not filing such a motion earlier were that (1) he anticipated that more information would be forthcoming, and thought it \"prudent to collect as much information as possible before filing\";  (2) that he considered that all activity in the case was stayed by the bankruptcy proceedings of the two Navons;  and (3) that he had no notice of the dismissal of his client's bankruptcy proceedings until late July or early August when he was orally informed by counsel for Simon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this state of the record, we must assume that appellant received notice of the dismissal of his involuntary bankruptcy case.  Bankruptcy Rule 2002(f) requires that the clerk of the bankruptcy court \"or some other person as the Court may direct, shall give the debtor ... notice by mail of ... (2) dismissal of the case....\"  There is no suggestion that this was not done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, appellant asks us to allow a tardy 60(b)(3) motion to parade under the raiment of 60(b)(6), where the reasons for the tardiness lay in counsel's strategic preference and mistaken legal assumption concerning the effect of an automatic stay, and the failure of communication between client and counsel.  These are not the kind of \"extraordinary circumstances\" justifying departure from the normal maximum limitations period required by Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Fraud Upon the Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 60(b), after delineating the six bases of a motion, goes on to state that the power of a court to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court is not limited by the rule.  It is an explicit recognition of the traditional inherent power of a court to protect its own essential functioning and integrity.  It is, however, a power rarely to be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently had occasion to review the scope of \"fraud upon the court\" in connection with the parallel provision of the rule allowing a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment for fraud upon the court.  Geo. P. Reintjes Co. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 71 F.3d 44, 46-49 (1st Cir.1995).  In that opinion, we noted the effect of Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944), overruled on other grounds, Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 429 U.S. 17, 97 S.Ct. 31, 50 L.Ed.2d 21 (1976), in expanding the range of fraud not subject to the one-year limitation to \"include fraud committed by 'officers of the court.' \"  Id. at 47-48.   We also characterized our concept of fraud upon the court in Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d 1115, 1118 (1st Cir.1989), as consisting of an \" 'unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system's ability impartially to adjudicate a matter' involving an officer of the court.\"  Reintjes, 71 F.3d at 48 n. 5. We noted a sharp demarcation, saying, \"In sum, perjury alone, absent allegation of involvement by an officer of the court ... has never been sufficient.\"  Id. at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, nothing has been suggested or even insinuated that takes this case beyond allegations of garden variety deceit and fraud by a party.  As a matter of law, appellant's allegations do not rise to the level of a Rule 60(b)(6) claim or to fraud upon the court.  The district court did not err in denying the motion for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, Rules 60(b)(3) and (6) state:</p>\n        <p>On motion ... the court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment ... for the following reasons:  ... (3) fraud ..., misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;  ...  or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.  The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment....

After the case was returned to the district court, both Navons then being debtors in bankruptcy proceedings, further action was suspended until the bankruptcy cases were terminated, Jonathan's by a discharge in April and Gershon's by dismissal in June of 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, defendant Gershon Navon, on the basis of newly acquired information, on September 6, 1996, filed a motion for relief from the breach of contract judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) and (6),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> claiming that Simon had given false testimony at trial and had withheld documents during discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, without granting further discovery or hearing, denied the motion for relief, ruling as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>1.

The first is whether the court erred in ruling that the 60(b)(3) motion was untimely filed, i.e., after the expiration of the maximum period of one year.  More precisely, we must consider the implicit ruling that the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings did not toll the running of the one year period.  The second question is whether the court erred in ruling that appellant failed to demonstrate a 60(b)(6) claim for \"any other reason justifying relief,\" a claim not subject to a specific limitations period.  And finally, we address the subset of 60(b)(6), the denial of a claim asserting fraud upon the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These questions turn out to raise purely legal issues, as to which our standard of review is plenary.

This, of course, exceeded the maximum period of one year allowed by the rule for (b)(3) claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant devotes one paragraph of his brief to the argument that the one year period does not begin to run from the entry of judgment following trial, but rather from November 27, 1995, the date of our decision in the prior appeal.  This is so, he asserts, because we \"substantially altered\" the earlier judgment, and he cites as support 11 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, &#167; 2866, at 390-91 (2d ed.1995).  But the breach of contract ruling, the only judgment placed in issue by the motion for relief, was not altered in any way.

An involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against Gershon Navon on May 14, 1994, and was dismissed on June 11, 1996.  Appellant makes a two-step argument.  He first invokes 11 U.S.C. &#167; 108(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[I]f applicable nonbankruptcy law ... fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action ... on a claim against the debtor, ... and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, then such period does not expire until the later of--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>(2) 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay under section 362 ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This section is applicable, appellant argues, because his motion for relief sought to continue the civil action on a claim originally filed against the debtor.  Then, relying on subsection (1), he assumes, without citation of authority, that the \"suspension of such period\" was triggered by the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(1), which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>[A bankruptcy petition] ... operates as a stay ... of ... the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial ... action or proceeding against the debtor....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee counters with three arguments.  He first urges that, given the passage of 27 months from the date of final judgment, the district court did not abuse its discretion.  He next argues that the automatic stay of &#167; 362 is inapplicable when a debtor in possession undertakes affirmative action for his own benefit, citing Autoskill, Inc. v. National Educ. Support Systems, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608143\"><a href=\"/opinion/608143/autoskill-inc-a-canadian-corporation-v-national-educational-support/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1476</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1993).  Finally, he asserts that 11 U.S.C. &#167; 108(c) is inapplicable to actions brought by the debtor.  Instead, he invokes &#167; 108(a), concerning the commencement of actions by debtors, which in his view would impose an outside limit of two years from the May 1994 judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of appellee's arguments misfire.  To begin, the issue being purely legal, abuse of discretion is not the appropriate standard of review.  Secondly, the fact that it was the debtor, rather than a creditor, who took this particular step of filing a motion, does not alter the fact that it constitutes a \"continuation\" of an \"action or proceeding against the debtor\" within the terms of &#167; 362.  The Ninth Circuit, in Parker v. Bain, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706877\"><a href=\"/opinion/706877/g-steven-parker-v-david-l-bain-esq-pacific-ship-repair-fabrication/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span>, 1135-36 (9th Cir.1995), dealt with the applicability of &#167; 362 to an appeal by a debtor, raising the same issue.  It said that it did not need to \"spill a great deal of ink\" on the assertion \"that an appeal by the debtor cannot constitute the continuation of an action against the debtor.\"   It observed that seven other circuits had rejected that rationale.  We now make the number nine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parker v. Bain also noted Autoskill, see 68 F.3d at 1136 n. 8, which had held that Bankruptcy Rule 6009, allowing a debtor in possession \"[w]ith or without court approval\" to \"prosecute any action or proceeding in behalf of the estate,\" obviated any need to obtain leave of court or release of stay before bringing an appeal.  994 F.2d at 1486.   The Parker court was crystal clear that \"Rule 6009 does not trump the code's automatic stay.\"   It relied on the analysis of Rule 6009's history and purpose by the Bankruptcy Court in In re Capgro Leasing Assocs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1828491\"><a href=\"/opinion/1828491/in-re-capgro-leasing-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 309-313 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1994), which held that a debtor in possession may not proceed with an appeal of an action brought against him \"absent an order granting relief from the automatic stay,\" id. at 313.   The Bankruptcy Court concluded that, while Rule 6009 means that a trustee (or debtor in possession) is no longer required to have the approval of the bankruptcy judge before deciding to commence or defend an action on behalf of the estate, the bankruptcy judge retains power under section 362 \"to decide when to let such action go forward.\"  Id. The Ninth Circuit therefore parted company from Autoskill, and so do we.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the applicability of &#167; 108(a), our short answer is that by its terms it refers only to periods within which a debtor may \"commence an action\";  here, the action is one that was commenced against the debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while appellee has not come close to the target, appellant's thrusts have also fallen short.  As we have noted, he has assumed that the mere existence of an automatic stay under &#167; 362 triggers the \"suspension\" referred to in &#167; 108(c).  This may be a common sense reading, but it is not the law.  Collier Bankruptcy Manual sets forth the vital caveat to \"such suspension\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Such a suspension may result from either state or federal law....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... In some jurisdictions state law may dictate suspension of a statute of limitations when a bankruptcy or another court proceeding has stayed the initiation of an action.  Such suspension would presumably be included within the terms of section 108(c), adding the entire duration of the automatic stay to the applicable time period.  [Footnote omitted.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, absent such a provision in state law, a statute of limitations or other deadline for an action against a debtor ... is extended for only the second period set forth in section 108(c), 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the automatic stay....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence P.

After stating that subsection (c) of &#167; 108 extends the statute of limitations for creditors (which, as we have pointed out, it also does for debtors in possession), the report states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>[I]f a creditor is stayed from commencing or continuing an action against the debtor because of the bankruptcy case, then the creditor is permitted an additional 30 days after notice of the event by which the stay is terminated, whether that event be relief from the automatic stay ..., [or]the closing of the bankruptcy case (which terminates the stay)....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep.

Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 5803, which mandates continuance of actions for recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy during bankruptcy proceedings, but only \"on petition of ... creditors before or after the commencement of the action.\"   This is of no avail to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have, however, conclusive evidence of the absence of any suspension-extending provision of Maine law in a recent decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, Duprey v.

In that case, the court made known its views as to the meaning of the identical \"any suspension\" language of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 108(b).  It chose to adopt the reasoning of the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maine that &#167; 362 \"does not stay the running of any time period,\" but only prevents an entity from exercising a power, such as enforcing a judgment.

Simon not only consciously failed to reveal to Gershon Navon [a fellow stockholder in Maine Coast], the creditors of Maine Coast, the Trustee in the Maine Coast bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Court that he held 100% of the interest in ACI's claim against Maine Coast while professing at all times that his interest was indirect and negligible.  He even testified at the trial that ACI was still owed considerable sums of money, when he previously had paid to ACI the amount owed to the penny and took an assignment of ACI's claim.

One rationale of this rule is obvious and relevant here:  were Rule 60(b)(6) to allow a second out-of-time bite at the same apple, the stringent, finalityenforcing limitation period of 60(b)(1)-(3) would be eviscerated.

The 60(b)(6) claim is one solely for deceit and fraud on the part of one party toward another, with nothing to distinguish it from a timely 60(b)(3) claim except that it was filed some two months beyond the 30 days after the termination of bankruptcy proceedings allowed by &#167; 108(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances of this delay demonstrate rather forcefully the absence of any special justification.  Commendably, appellant's counsel has candidly acknowledged by affidavit that he first learned in December 1995 of leads to information that Simon had misled defendants, and that over the next couple of months he received documents and information supportive of a motion for relief from judgment.  His reasons for not filing such a motion earlier were that (1) he anticipated that more information would be forthcoming, and thought it \"prudent to collect as much information as possible before filing\";  (2) that he considered that all activity in the case was stayed by the bankruptcy proceedings of the two Navons;  and (3) that he had no notice of the dismissal of his client's bankruptcy proceedings until late July or early August when he was orally informed by counsel for Simon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this state of the record, we must assume that appellant received notice of the dismissal of his involuntary bankruptcy case.  Bankruptcy Rule 2002(f) requires that the clerk of the bankruptcy court \"or some other person as the Court may direct, shall give the debtor ... notice by mail of ... (2) dismissal of the case....\"  There is no suggestion that this was not done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, appellant asks us to allow a tardy 60(b)(3) motion to parade under the raiment of 60(b)(6), where the reasons for the tardiness lay in counsel's strategic preference and mistaken legal assumption concerning the effect of an automatic stay, and the failure of communication between client and counsel.  These are not the kind of \"extraordinary circumstances\" justifying departure from the normal maximum limitations period required by Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.
