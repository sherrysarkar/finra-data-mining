Appellant Yanokura Feliz \r\npleaded guilty in federal district court in Maine to one count of\r\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \r\n841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).  Prior to entering his guilty plea, Feliz\r\nfiled a motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence on\r\nthe ground that the warrant authorizing the search was not based on\r\nprobable cause.  The district court ruled that probable cause was\r\nlacking, but that the evidence was nevertheless admissible under\r\nthe \"good faith exception\" recognized in United States v. Leon, 468\r\nU.S. 897 (1984).  We agree that the evidence was admissible and\r\naffirm Feliz's conviction.\r\n                       I.  BACKGROUND \r\nOn December 3, 1997, a Maine grand jury returned a two-\r\ncount indictment charging Feliz with trafficking in cocaine.  A \r\nMaine Superior Court judge subsequently issued an arrest warrant\r\nfor Feliz.  \r\nThereafter, on December 29, 1997, Agent John L. Dumas, a\r\nSpecial Agent of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency who was\r\ninvestigating Feliz for drug trafficking, submitted an affidavit in\r\nsupport of a search warrant for Feliz's residence, located at 401\r\nCumberland Avenue, Apartment # 1006 in the City of Portland, Maine. \r\nThe affidavit sought a warrant to search Feliz's residence for\r\nevidence of drug trafficking including documents, records, and sums\r\nof money.  \r\nThe following facts were alleged in Agent Dumas's\r\naffidavit.  On September 22, 1997, Agent Dumas debriefed a \r\ncooperating individual (\"CI\") concerning CI's knowledge of drug\r\ntrafficking in Southern Maine.  CI reported to Agent Dumas that\r\nhe/she had purchased cocaine from a Domician male known as \"John\"\r\n(CI did not believe this to be the man's real name) since the\r\nsummer of 1985.  CI also reported that he/she initially had to\r\ntravel to New Hampshire or Massachusetts to buy cocaine from\r\n\"John,\" but that during the summer of 1997 \"John\" moved to Portland\r\nand, thereafter, CI continued to purchase cocaine from \"John.\" \r\nAgent Dumas showed a picture of Feliz to CI, who confirmed that the\r\nman in the photo was the man known to CI as \"John.\"\r\nCI made two controlled purchases of cocaine from Feliz. \r\nOn September 18, 1997, Feliz sold approximately 8 grams of cocaine\r\nto CI in exchange for $400.  The purchase took place on Oak Street\r\nin Portland.  Prior to the meeting, CI and Feliz spoke on the phone\r\nand agreed to meet at the Wit's End, a tavern on Congress Street. \r\nWhen Feliz arrived at the Wit's End in a green Toyota Forerunner,\r\nhe motioned for CI to follow him, then turned left onto Oak Street. \r\nCI walked to Oak Street and entered the Forerunner.  CI handed\r\nFeliz the $400 and Feliz handed CI 8.4 grams of cocaine.  CI then\r\ngot out of the Forerunner and Feliz drove away.  CI gave the\r\ncocaine to  a Special Agent of the Maine DEA, who in turn sent it\r\nto the laboratory for analysis.  The laboratory analysis confirmed\r\nthat the substance was cocaine. \r\nOn September 24, 1997, CI made a second controlled\r\npurchase of cocaine from Feliz.  Again, CI and Feliz arranged by\r\ntelephone to meet, this time at Gold's Gym in South Portland, where\r\nFeliz agreed to deliver 7 grams of cocaine in exchange for $400. \r\nAgent Dumas drove CI to Gold's Gym and watched as CI met with Feliz\r\nand the two exchanged the money for the cocaine.  Feliz went into\r\nthe gym and CI joined Agent Dumas in his car, where CI turned over\r\nthe cocaine.  A subsequent laboratory analysis confirmed that the\r\nsubstance delivered to CI was 7 grams of cocaine. \r\nShortly after this second controlled purchase, Feliz\r\nrefused to sell CI any more cocaine.  According to CI, Feliz\r\nchanged his cellular phone number and pager number.  CI told Dumas\r\nthat Feliz had stated he (Feliz) was going to invest the profits\r\nfrom drug sales into a \"legitimate\" business.  According to CI,\r\nFeliz said that he was going to open a cigar store.  In December,\r\n1997, Agent Dumas confirmed that Feliz had opened \"Fortune Cigars\"\r\nin November, 1997.   \r\nOn November 16, 1997, a cooperating defendant (\"CD\") was\r\narrested on cocaine trafficking charges.  CD told Agent Dumas that\r\nhe/she knew a Dominican male from Lawrence who called himself\r\n\"John\" and lived in Portland on Cumberland Avenue in a \"really tall\r\napartment building.\"  CD also told Agent Dumas that \"John\" sold\r\ncocaine and had large sums of money.  Paragraph III. F. of Agent\r\nDumas's affidavit further stated: \"According to CD#1, FELIZ talked\r\nwith CD#1 sometime in the late summer or early fall of 1997, and\r\ndiscussed the possible sale of 1 kilo of cocaine from CD#1 to\r\nFELIZ.\"\r\nAgent Dumas subsequently learned that Feliz lived in an\r\napartment at 401 Cumberland Avenue, a sixteen-story apartment\r\nbuilding.  On December 29, 1997, Agent Dumas spoke with an\r\nassistant manager at the apartment complex, who informed him that\r\nFeliz lived in apartment # 1006. \r\nIn addition to the information provided by CI and CD,\r\nAgent Dumas's search warrant affidavit contained a paragraph\r\nsetting forth in detail his training and experience in the\r\ninvestigation of drug trafficking crimes.  Agent Dumas stated that\r\nhe had been a law enforcement officer for approximately four years,\r\nand was sworn as a Special Agent of the Maine DEA in May, 1996.\r\nAgent Dumas further stated that \r\n  [f]rom my experience, education, training\r\nand/or study, I know it to be quite common for\r\nthose involved in the illegal\r\ntrafficking/furnishing of scheduled drugs to\r\npossess, maintain and keep with them, near\r\nthem, and/or in their residences business\r\nrecords and journals relating to the\r\ntrafficking and/or furnishing of scheduled\r\ndrugs. . . . \r\n\nAgent Dumas continued:\r\n\n  In particular, I know that, where, as here, an\r\nindividual is demonstrated to be trafficking\r\nin drugs, it is not uncommon for there to be\r\nevidence of their drug trafficking activities,\r\nsuch as drug records, telephone numbers of\r\nsuppliers and customers, drug trafficking\r\nparaphernalia, drug proceeds and/or evidence\r\nof transfer, expenditures or investment of\r\ndrug proceeds kept at the trafficker's\r\nresidence. \r\n\nFinally, with regard to sums of money in the possession of drug\r\ntraffickers, Agent Dumas stated that in his experience it was\r\n  common for those involved in the illegal\r\ntrafficking/furnishing of scheduled drugs to\r\npossess and keep with them, near them, and/or\r\nat their residences, sums of money . . .\r\neither as a result of scheduled drug sales or\r\nfor the purpose of purchasing scheduled drugs\r\nor facilitating scheduled drug sales with\r\nothers.  Because such moneys are not usually\r\nsafely disposed of legitimately (e.g.,\r\ndeposited in a bank or declared as taxable\r\nincome), it is common for those who traffick\r\nor furnish illegal scheduled drugs to keep\r\nthese sums on their person or near them, in a\r\nsafe location, frequently in their residences,\r\nand/or at/near their residences, and/or near\r\nthe same location where they keep their drugs,\r\nor maintain drug operations.\r\n\nOn December 29, 1997, a Maine District Court judge issued\r\na warrant authorizing the search of apartment #1006 at 401\r\nCumberland Avenue in Portland for documents, records, and sums of\r\nmoney related to drug trafficking.  While executing the search\r\nwarrant and an arrest warrant at Feliz's apartment, Agent Dumas,\r\nalong with other agents, seized approximately 516 grams of\r\ncocaine.\r\nOn December 30, Agent Dumas swore out a complaint against\r\nFeliz in Maine federal district court.  On January 21, 1998, a\r\nfederal grand jury returned an indictment charging Feliz with\r\npossession with the intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \r\n841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).  Feliz moved to suppress the evidence seized\r\nfrom his apartment on the ground that the warrant was not supported\r\nby probable cause.  Feliz argued in particular that the facts set\r\nforth in Agent Dumas's affidavit failed to establish a \"nexus\"\r\nbetween the drug trafficking information and his apartment.  The\r\ndistrict court ruled that the warrant was not supported by probable\r\ncause, but nevertheless denied Feliz's  suppression motion on the\r\nground that the Leon \"good faith exception\" applied.  See Leon,468\r\nU.S. at 922 (holding that evidence seized in reasonable good-faith\r\nreliance on a search warrant, which is later found defective, may\r\nbe admitted at trial).  Shortly thereafter, Feliz pleaded guilty,\r\nreserving his right to challenge on appeal the denial of the motion\r\nto suppress.\r\n                      II.  DISCUSSION  \r\nA warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to\r\nbelieve that (1) a crime has been committed   the \"commission\"\r\nelement, and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found\r\nat the place to be searched -- the so-called \"nexus\" element.  See\r\nUnited States v. Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1996).  With\r\nregard to the \"nexus\" element, the task of a magistrate in\r\ndetermining whether probable cause exists is \"to make a practical,\r\ncommon-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set\r\nforth in the affidavit before him . . . there is a fair probability\r\nthat contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a\r\nparticular place.\"  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983). \r\nIn order to establish probable cause, the facts presented to the\r\nmagistrate need only \"warrant a man of reasonable caution\" to\r\nbelieve that evidence of a crime will be found.  Texas v. Brown,\r\n460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983) (plurality opinion).  The probable cause\r\nstandard \"does not demand showing that such a belief be correct or\r\nmore likely true than false.\"  Id.  \r\nAs a reviewing court, we too must examine the affidavit\r\nin a practical, commonsense fashion, and we accord \"considerable\r\ndeference\" to a magistrate's determination that information in a\r\nparticular affidavit establishes probable cause.  Zayas-Diaz, 95\r\nF.3d at 111 (quoting United States v. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3, 6 (1st\r\nCir.), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 944 (1993)).  Our inquiry is whether\r\nthe magistrate had a \"substantial basis\" for concluding that\r\nprobable cause existed.  Taylor, 985 F.2d at 5. \r\nThe district court concluded that Agent Dumas's affidavit\r\ndid not set forth facts showing a sufficient nexus between the\r\nprobable criminal activity described in the search warrant and\r\nFeliz's apartment.  The government urges us to reverse the district\r\ncourt's probable cause ruling and to uphold the warrant without\r\nreliance upon the Leon good faith exception.  See Leon, 468 U.S. at\r\n925 (courts have discretion to consider the issue of officers' good\r\nfaith without first addressing Fourth Amendment issue).  We agree\r\nwith the government that in all the circumstances the affidavit\r\ncontained sufficient evidence of probable cause to permit the\r\nmagistrate to issue a warrant to search Feliz's residence.\r\n The affidavit included information from two informants\r\nwho relayed their first-hand observations of drug trafficking\r\ninvolving an individual whom they knew as \"John.\"  CI identified\r\na photograph of Feliz shown to him by Agent Dumas as the \"John\"\r\nfrom whom he had purchase cocaine on several prior occasions,\r\nbeginning as early as 1985.  CI also provided details concerning\r\nhis conversations with Feliz prior to each of the two controlled\r\npurchases, including the name and address of the places where they\r\nagreed to meet.  CI provided further details, later confirmed by\r\nthe investigating agents, concerning the color, make, and\r\nregistration number of Feliz's car.  One of the controlled\r\npurchases was observed directly by Agent Dumas.  The affidavit\r\nfurther stated that after each sale, the drugs were sent to a\r\nlaboratory for analysis, which confirmed that a specific amount of\r\ncocaine was present.  In sum, the affidavit contained substantial,\r\ndetailed information indicating that Feliz had engaged in illegal\r\ndrug trafficking for at least twelve years, most recently in the\r\nPortland area.\r\nFeliz argues that because the drug transactions described\r\nin the affidavit took place approximately three months prior to\r\nissuance of the warrant they were \"stale.\"  But courts have upheld\r\ndeterminations of probable cause in trafficking cases involving\r\nsimilar or even longer periods.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nGreany, 929 F.2d 523, 525 (9th Cir. 1991) (two year-old information\r\nrelating to marijuana operation not stale); Rivera v. United\r\nStates, 928 F.2d 592, 602 (2d Cir. 1991) (noting that in drug\r\ntrafficking cases, information may be months old).  Based upon CI's\r\ntwo controlled purchases of cocaine in September, and CI's\r\nstatement that he had been purchasing drugs from Feliz for\r\napproximately twelve years, the agents could reasonably have\r\nbelieved that Feliz's drug trafficking was of a continuous and\r\nongoing nature.\r\nFeliz's only argument of any strength is that Agent\r\nDumas's affidavit did not establish a sufficient connection between\r\nthe alleged criminal activity and his 401 Cumberland Avenue\r\napartment.  He points out that none of the drug sales occurred at\r\nor near his apartment, and contends that Agent Dumas's experience\r\nin drug trafficking cases and his opinions regarding the habits of\r\ndrug traffickers with regard to retention of drug trafficking\r\nrecords and proceeds are inadequate to supply the required nexus. \r\nThe district court agreed.  \r\nWe disagree with the district court's conclusion that\r\nprobable cause to search Feliz's apartment was lacking.  The\r\ncriterion, as we have noted, is whether the facts presented in the\r\naffidavit would \"warrant a man of reasonable caution\" to believe\r\nthat evidence of crime will be found.  Brown, 460 U.S. at 742. \r\nThere is no requirement that the belief be shown to be necessarily\r\ncorrect or more likely true than false.  See Spinelli v. United\r\nStates, 393 U.S. 410, 419 (1969) (\"only the probability, and not a\r\nprima facie showing\" is required).  A \"practical, commonsense\"\r\nassessment, providing a substantial basis for the magistrate's\r\nfinding of probable cause, is what is called for.  Gates, 462 U.S.\r\nat 238.  See also Taylor, 985 F.2d at 5.  \r\nIn addition to Agent Dumas's experience and opinions, to\r\nwhich the magistrate was entitled to accord some weight, see Brown,\r\n460 U.S. at 742-43, the affidavit presents facts from which a\r\nreasonable inference could be drawn as to the probable presence of\r\nincriminating evidence at Feliz's apartment.  CI, whose information\r\nwas corroborated by Agent Dumas, identified Feliz as a long-time,\r\nsuccessful, drug trafficker.  It could reasonably be supposed that\r\na regular trafficker like Feliz possessed documents showing the\r\nnames and telephone numbers of customers and suppliers as well as\r\naccounts showing the monies paid and collected.  It was also\r\nreasonable to suppose that he kept the money he collected and used\r\nin his business in some safe yet accessible place.  The affidavit\r\nindicated that Felix resided in apartment #1006 at 401 Cumberland\r\nAvenue, Portland.  No other residence or drug-dealing headquarters\r\nof his was identified in the affidavit.  It followed that a \r\nlikely place to seek to find incriminating items would be Feliz's\r\nresidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Angulo-Lopez, 791 F.2d\r\n1394, 1399 (9th Cir. 1986) (stating that \"[i]n the case of drug\r\ndealers, evidence is likely to be found where the dealers live\"). \r\nIf he did not maintain his accounts and records, and the presumably\r\nlarge sums of money received in the course of his dealings, at his\r\napartment, where else would he keep them?  \r\nIn saying this, we do not suggest that, in all criminal\r\ncases, there will automatically be probable cause to search a\r\nsuspect's residence.  All factors must be weighed in each case in\r\norder to assess the reasonableness of inferring that evidence of\r\nthe crime can be found at the suspect's home.  We say only that\r\ninterpreting a search warrant affidavit in the proper \"commonsense\r\nand realistic fashion,\" United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102,\r\n108 (1965), may result in the inference of probable cause to\r\nbelieve that criminal objects are located in a particular place,\r\nsuch as a suspect's residence, to which they have not been tied by\r\ndirect evidence.  \r\nThe nexus between the objects to be seized and the\r\npremises searched need not, and often will not, rest on direct\r\nobservation, but rather \"can be inferred from the type of crime,\r\nthe nature of the items sought, the extent of an opportunity for\r\nconcealment and normal inferences as to where a criminal would hide\r\n[evidence of a crime]. . . .\"  United States v. Charest, 602 F.2d\r\n1015, 1017 (1st Cir. 1979).  In the case of drug peddlers like\r\nFeliz, other circuits have upheld searches of the suspect's\r\nresidence in circumstances somewhat similar to these.  See Angulo-\r\nLopez, 791 F.2d at 1399 (holding that direct evidence that\r\ncontraband or evidence indicating drug trafficking is at a\r\nsuspect's residence is not essential to establish probable cause);\r\nUnited States v. Thomas, 989 F.2d 1252, 1255 (D.C. Cir. 1993)(per\r\ncuriam) (observations of drug trafficking occurring away from\r\nsuspect's residence can provide probable cause for search of\r\nhouse); United States v. Williams, 974 F.2d 480, 482 (4th Cir. 1992)\r\n(per curiam) (affidavit establishing that known drug dealer\r\ncurrently resided in motel room held sufficient to establish\r\nprobable cause that drug paraphernalia would be found in room);\r\nUnited States v. Cruz, 785 F.2d 399, 406 (2d Cir. 1986) (probable\r\ncause for search of drug dealer's apartment even though defendant\r\nwas not seen using apartment).  We do not find it unreasonable for\r\nthe issuing judge in this case to have relied upon her common\r\nsense, buttressed by affiant's opinion as a law enforcement\r\nofficer, that Feliz would be likely to keep proceeds from his drug\r\ntrafficking and records relating to drug transactions at his\r\napartment.  \r\nAs in the totality of circumstances here there was a\r\nsufficient showing of probable cause, we see no need to pursue the\r\nissue of good faith under Leon, although we have no doubt the\r\ndistrict court was well justified in applying the Leon criteria in\r\nthis case had that been necessary.\r\nAffirmed. \r\n",

CI told Dumas\r\nthat Feliz had stated he (Feliz) was going to invest the profits\r\nfrom drug sales into a \"legitimate\" business.  According to CI,\r\nFeliz said that he was going to open a cigar store.  In December,\r\n1997, Agent Dumas confirmed that Feliz had opened \"Fortune Cigars\"\r\nin November, 1997.   \r\nOn November 16, 1997, a cooperating defendant (\"CD\") was\r\narrested on cocaine trafficking charges.  CD told Agent Dumas that\r\nhe/she knew a Dominican male from Lawrence who called himself\r\n\"John\" and lived in Portland on Cumberland Avenue in a \"really tall\r\napartment building.\"  CD also told Agent Dumas that \"John\" sold\r\ncocaine and had large sums of money.  Paragraph III. F. of Agent\r\nDumas's affidavit further stated: \"According to CD#1, FELIZ talked\r\nwith CD#1 sometime in the late summer or early fall of 1997, and\r\ndiscussed the possible sale of 1 kilo of cocaine from CD#1 to\r\nFELIZ.\"\r\nAgent Dumas subsequently learned that Feliz lived in an\r\napartment at 401 Cumberland Avenue, a sixteen-story apartment\r\nbuilding.  On December 29, 1997, Agent Dumas spoke with an\r\nassistant manager at the apartment complex, who informed him that\r\nFeliz lived in apartment # 1006. \r\nIn addition to the information provided by CI and CD,\r\nAgent Dumas's search warrant affidavit contained a paragraph\r\nsetting forth in detail his training and experience in the\r\ninvestigation of drug trafficking crimes.  Agent Dumas stated that\r\nhe had been a law enforcement officer for approximately four years,\r\nand was sworn as a Special Agent of the Maine DEA in May, 1996.\r\nAgent Dumas further stated that \r\n  [f]rom my experience, education, training\r\nand/or study, I know it to be quite common for\r\nthose involved in the illegal\r\ntrafficking/furnishing of scheduled drugs to\r\npossess, maintain and keep with them, near\r\nthem, and/or in their residences business\r\nrecords and journals relating to the\r\ntrafficking and/or furnishing of scheduled\r\ndrugs. . . . \r\n\nAgent Dumas continued:\r\n\n  In particular, I know that, where, as here, an\r\nindividual is demonstrated to be trafficking\r\nin drugs, it is not uncommon for there to be\r\nevidence of their drug trafficking activities,\r\nsuch as drug records, telephone numbers of\r\nsuppliers and customers, drug trafficking\r\nparaphernalia, drug proceeds and/or evidence\r\nof transfer, expenditures or investment of\r\ndrug proceeds kept at the trafficker's\r\nresidence. \r\n\nFinally, with regard to sums of money in the possession of drug\r\ntraffickers, Agent Dumas stated that in his experience it was\r\n  common for those involved in the illegal\r\ntrafficking/furnishing of scheduled drugs to\r\npossess and keep with them, near them, and/or\r\nat their residences, sums of money . . .\r\neither as a result of scheduled drug sales or\r\nfor the purpose of purchasing scheduled drugs\r\nor facilitating scheduled drug sales with\r\nothers.  Because such moneys are not usually\r\nsafely disposed of legitimately (e.g.,\r\ndeposited in a bank or declared as taxable\r\nincome), it is common for those who traffick\r\nor furnish illegal scheduled drugs to keep\r\nthese sums on their person or near them, in a\r\nsafe location, frequently in their residences,\r\nand/or at/near their residences, and/or near\r\nthe same location where they keep their drugs,\r\nor maintain drug operations.\r\n\nOn December 29, 1997, a Maine District Court judge issued\r\na warrant authorizing the search of apartment #1006 at 401\r\nCumberland Avenue in Portland for documents, records, and sums of\r\nmoney related to drug trafficking.  While executing the search\r\nwarrant and an arrest warrant at Feliz's apartment, Agent Dumas,\r\nalong with other agents, seized approximately 516 grams of\r\ncocaine.\r\nOn December 30, Agent Dumas swore out a complaint against\r\nFeliz in Maine federal district court.  On January 21, 1998, a\r\nfederal grand jury returned an indictment charging Feliz with\r\npossession with the intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \r\n841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).  Feliz moved to suppress the evidence seized\r\nfrom his apartment on the ground that the warrant was not supported\r\nby probable cause.  Feliz argued in particular that the facts set\r\nforth in Agent Dumas's affidavit failed to establish a \"nexus\"\r\nbetween the drug trafficking information and his apartment.  The\r\ndistrict court ruled that the warrant was not supported by probable\r\ncause, but nevertheless denied Feliz's  suppression motion on the\r\nground that the Leon \"good faith exception\" applied.  See Leon,468\r\nU.S. at 922 (holding that evidence seized in reasonable good-faith\r\nreliance on a search warrant, which is later found defective, may\r\nbe admitted at trial).  Shortly thereafter, Feliz pleaded guilty,\r\nreserving his right to challenge on appeal the denial of the motion\r\nto suppress.\r\n                      II.  DISCUSSION  \r\nA warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to\r\nbelieve that (1) a crime has been committed   the \"commission\"\r\nelement, and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found\r\nat the place to be searched -- the so-called \"nexus\" element.  See\r\nUnited States v. Zayas-Diaz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196972\"><a href=\"/opinion/196972/united-states-v-zayas-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (1st Cir. 1996).  With\r\nregard to the \"nexus\" element, the task of a magistrate in\r\ndetermining whether probable cause exists is \"to make a practical,\r\ncommon-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set\r\nforth in the affidavit before him . . . there is a fair probability\r\nthat contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a\r\nparticular place.\"  Illinois v. Gates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238 (1983). \r\nIn order to establish probable cause, the facts presented to the\r\nmagistrate need only \"warrant a man of reasonable caution\" to\r\nbelieve that evidence of a crime will be found.  Texas v. Brown,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110901\"><a href=\"/opinion/110901/texas-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742 (1983) (plurality opinion).  The probable cause\r\nstandard \"does not demand showing that such a belief be correct or\r\nmore likely true than false.\"  Id.  \r\nAs a reviewing court, we too must examine the affidavit\r\nin a practical, commonsense fashion, and we accord \"considerable\r\ndeference\" to a magistrate's determination that information in a\r\nparticular affidavit establishes probable cause.  Zayas-Diaz, 95\r\nF.3d at 111 (quoting United States v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599284\"><a href=\"/opinion/599284/united-states-v-jean-m-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st\r\nCir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993)).  Our inquiry is whether\r\nthe magistrate had a \"substantial basis\" for concluding that\r\nprobable cause existed.  Taylor, 985 F.2d at 5. \r\nThe district court concluded that Agent Dumas's affidavit\r\ndid not set forth facts showing a sufficient nexus between the\r\nprobable criminal activity described in the search warrant and\r\nFeliz's apartment.  The government urges us to reverse the district\r\ncourt's probable cause ruling and to uphold the warrant without\r\nreliance upon the Leon good faith exception.  See Leon, 468 U.S. at\r\n925 (courts have discretion to consider the issue of officers' good\r\nfaith without first addressing Fourth Amendment issue).  We agree\r\nwith the government that in all the circumstances the affidavit\r\ncontained sufficient evidence of probable cause to permit the\r\nmagistrate to issue a warrant to search Feliz's residence.\r\n The affidavit included information from two informants\r\nwho relayed their first-hand observations of drug trafficking\r\ninvolving an individual whom they knew as \"John.\"  CI identified\r\na photograph of Feliz shown to him by Agent Dumas as the \"John\"\r\nfrom whom he had purchase cocaine on several prior occasions,\r\nbeginning as early as 1985.  CI also provided details concerning\r\nhis conversations with Feliz prior to each of the two controlled\r\npurchases, including the name and address of the places where they\r\nagreed to meet.  CI provided further details, later confirmed by\r\nthe investigating agents, concerning the color, make, and\r\nregistration number of Feliz's car.  One of the controlled\r\npurchases was observed directly by Agent Dumas.  The affidavit\r\nfurther stated that after each sale, the drugs were sent to a\r\nlaboratory for analysis, which confirmed that a specific amount of\r\ncocaine was present.  In sum, the affidavit contained substantial,\r\ndetailed information indicating that Feliz had engaged in illegal\r\ndrug trafficking for at least twelve years, most recently in the\r\nPortland area.\r\nFeliz argues that because the drug transactions described\r\nin the affidavit took place approximately three months prior to\r\nissuance of the warrant they were \"stale.\"  But courts have upheld\r\ndeterminations of probable cause in trafficking cases involving\r\nsimilar or even longer periods.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nGreany, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558133\"><a href=\"/opinion/558133/united-states-v-patrick-joseph-greany/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525 (9th Cir. 1991) (two year-old information\r\nrelating to marijuana operation not stale); Rivera v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557798\"><a href=\"/opinion/557798/maria-rivera-angel-santana-diana-penaloza-arce-enrique-arce-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 602 (2d Cir. 1991) (noting that in drug\r\ntrafficking cases, information may be months old).  Based upon CI's\r\ntwo controlled purchases of cocaine in September, and CI's\r\nstatement that he had been purchasing drugs from Feliz for\r\napproximately twelve years, the agents could reasonably have\r\nbelieved that Feliz's drug trafficking was of a continuous and\r\nongoing nature.\r\nFeliz's only argument of any strength is that Agent\r\nDumas's affidavit did not establish a sufficient connection between\r\nthe alleged criminal activity and his 401 Cumberland Avenue\r\napartment.  He points out that none of the drug sales occurred at\r\nor near his apartment, and contends that Agent Dumas's experience\r\nin drug trafficking cases and his opinions regarding the habits of\r\ndrug traffickers with regard to retention of drug trafficking\r\nrecords and proceeds are inadequate to supply the required nexus. \r\nThe district court agreed.  \r\nWe disagree with the district court's conclusion that\r\nprobable cause to search Feliz's apartment was lacking.  The\r\ncriterion, as we have noted, is whether the facts presented in the\r\naffidavit would \"warrant a man of reasonable caution\" to believe\r\nthat evidence of crime will be found.  Brown, 460 U.S. at 742. \r\nThere is no requirement that the belief be shown to be necessarily\r\ncorrect or more likely true than false.  See Spinelli v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107831\"><a href=\"/opinion/107831/spinelli-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 419 (1969) (\"only the probability, and not a\r\nprima facie showing\" is required).  A \"practical, commonsense\"\r\nassessment, providing a substantial basis for the magistrate's\r\nfinding of probable cause, is what is called for.  Gates, 462 U.S.\r\nat 238.  See also Taylor, 985 F.2d at 5.  \r\nIn addition to Agent Dumas's experience and opinions, to\r\nwhich the magistrate was entitled to accord some weight, see Brown,\r\n460 U.S. at 742-43, the affidavit presents facts from which a\r\nreasonable inference could be drawn as to the probable presence of\r\nincriminating evidence at Feliz's apartment.  CI, whose information\r\nwas corroborated by Agent Dumas, identified Feliz as a long-time,\r\nsuccessful, drug trafficker.  It could reasonably be supposed that\r\na regular trafficker like Feliz possessed documents showing the\r\nnames and telephone numbers of customers and suppliers as well as\r\naccounts showing the monies paid and collected.  It was also\r\nreasonable to suppose that he kept the money he collected and used\r\nin his business in some safe yet accessible place.  The affidavit\r\nindicated that Felix resided in apartment #1006 at 401 Cumberland\r\nAvenue, Portland.  No other residence or drug-dealing headquarters\r\nof his was identified in the affidavit.  It followed that a \r\nlikely place to seek to find incriminating items would be Feliz's\r\nresidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Angulo-Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471009\"><a href=\"/opinion/471009/united-states-v-candelario-angulo-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1399 (9th Cir. 1986) (stating that \"[i]n the case of drug\r\ndealers, evidence is likely to be found where the dealers live\"). \r\nIf he did not maintain his accounts and records, and the presumably\r\nlarge sums of money received in the course of his dealings, at his\r\napartment, where else would he keep them?  \r\nIn saying this, we do not suggest that, in all criminal\r\ncases, there will automatically be probable cause to search a\r\nsuspect's residence.  All factors must be weighed in each case in\r\norder to assess the reasonableness of inferring that evidence of\r\nthe crime can be found at the suspect's home.  We say only that\r\ninterpreting a search warrant affidavit in the proper \"commonsense\r\nand realistic fashion,\" United States v. Ventresca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106990\"><a href=\"/opinion/106990/united-states-v-ventresca/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n108 (1965), may result in the inference of probable cause to\r\nbelieve that criminal objects are located in a particular place,\r\nsuch as a suspect's residence, to which they have not been tied by\r\ndirect evidence.  \r\nThe nexus between the objects to be seized and the\r\npremises searched need not, and often will not, rest on direct\r\nobservation, but rather \"can be inferred from the type of crime,\r\nthe nature of the items sought, the extent of an opportunity for\r\nconcealment and normal inferences as to where a criminal would hide\r\n[evidence of a crime]. . . .\"  United States v.

In the case of drug peddlers like\r\nFeliz, other circuits have upheld searches of the suspect's\r\nresidence in circumstances somewhat similar to these.  See Angulo-\r\nLopez, 791 F.2d at 1399 (holding that direct evidence that\r\ncontraband or evidence indicating drug trafficking is at a\r\nsuspect's residence is not essential to establish probable cause);\r\nUnited States v.
