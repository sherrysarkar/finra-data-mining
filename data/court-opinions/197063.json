Morris and\r\n\nStuart L. Smith on charges of conspiracy to  distribute marijuana\r\n\nbars  the  government from  now  prosecuting them  on  charges of\r\n\nconspiracy  to defraud the  Internal Revenue Service  (IRS).  The\r\n\ndistrict  court   answered  this   question   in  the   negative.\r\n\nConcluding, as we do, that neither double jeopardy nor collateral\r\n\nestoppel  principles preclude  continued prosecution  of the  tax\r\n\nconspiracy charge, we affirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          In 1994,  a federal  grand jury returned  a three-count\r\n\nindictment against  the  appellants  and  seven  other  persons.1\r\n\nCount  1 charged the  appellants (and others)  with conspiracy to\r\n\ndistribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, in\r\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1) &amp; 846 (1994).  Count 2 sought\r\n\ncriminal forfeiture  of  property used  in  or derived  from  the\r\n\nmarijuana  conspiracy.   See 21  U.S.C.    853  (1994).   Count 3\r                                      \r\n\ncharged the  appellants (and  others) with conspiracy  to defraud\r\n\nthe IRS in the  determination and collection of income  taxes, in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   371 (1994).\r\n\n          The  district court  severed count  3 and  proceeded to\r\n\ntrial on  the other  counts.  The  jury returned  a \"not  guilty\"\r\n\nverdict  on  count 1,  putting an  end  to that  charge  and also\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Because  these appeals  do  not involve  any  of the  seven\r\ncodefendants,  we   minimize  further  references   to  them   in\r\ndescribing the indictment and ensuing trial.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\neviscerating count 2.  The appellants then moved to dismiss count\r\n\n3  on  double jeopardy  and  collateral  estoppel grounds.    The\r\n\ndistrict court  denied the motions.   These interlocutory appeals\r\n\nensued.   See Abney v.  United States, 431  U.S. 651, 662  (1977)\r                                               \r\n\n(holding that  pretrial orders rejecting  double jeopardy  claims\r\n\npremised on successive prosecutions are immediately appealable).2\r\n\nInasmuch   as  the   appeals  challenge   the   district  court's\r\n\napplication of the law rather than its factfinding, our review is\r\n\nplenary.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                         Double Jeopardy\r                                   Double Jeopardy\r                                                  \r\n\n          The  Double Jeopardy  Clause  provides that  no  person\r\n\nshall  \"be  subject  for the  same  offence  to be  twice  put in\r\n\njeopardy of  life or limb .  . . .\"   U.S. Const. amend.  V.  The\r\n\nClause has three aspects:   it shields a defendant  from a second\r\n\nprosecution  for  the same  offense  after  either conviction  or\r\n\nacquittal,  and it  also prohibits  multiple punishments  for the\r\n\nsame  offense.   See United States  v. Stoller, 78  F.3d 710, 714\r                                                        \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Abney  involved multiple  prosecutions.   431 U.S.  at 662.\r                     \r\nCases   that  implicate   multiple  punishments   arguably  raise\r\ndifferent  jurisdictional  concerns for  appellate  courts.

Rivera-Martinez, 931\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  148, 152  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  502 U.S.  862 (1991).\r                                                   \r\n\nHere,  the  appellants  invoke  the  Clause's  protection against\r\n\nsuccessive prosecutions.   The resolution of their claim turns on\r\n\nwhether the tax conspiracy  is the same offense as  the marijuana\r\n\nconspiracy for double jeopardy purposes.\r\n\n          The Supreme Court has  authored a black-letter rule for\r\n\nuse  in  determining  when  double jeopardy  principles  prohibit\r\n\nprosecution under two distinct  statutory provisions:  \"where the\r\n\nsame  act  or  transaction  constitutes  a  violation  of  [both]\r\n\nstatutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether\r\n\nthere are two  offenses or  only one, is  whether each  provision\r\n\nrequires  proof of a fact which the other does not.\"  Blockburger\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  United States,  284  U.S. 299,  304 (1932).    If the  crimes\r                           \r\n\ncharged  are  discrete  offenses  within   the  contemplation  of\r\n\nBlockburger,  the defendant may  be prosecuted  consecutively for\r                     \r\n\nthem, even if the crimes arise out of the same conduct or nucleus\r\n\nof operative  facts.   See United  States v.  Parrilla-Tirado, 22\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  368, 372  (1st  Cir. 1994).    Thus, the  Blockburger  rule\r                                                                     \r\n\ndepends on statutory analysis, not on evidentiary comparisons.\r\n\n          Having carefully  examined the record, we  conclude, as\r\n\ndid  the court below, that  the tax conspiracy  and the marijuana\r\n\nconspiracy  are   separate  offenses.    To   establish  the  tax\r\n\nconspiracy,  the  government  must  prove  that  the   conspiracy\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nexisted,  that the  defendants agreed to  participate in  it, and\r\n\nthat at least one overt act was perpetrated in furtherance of the\r\n\ngoal  of  defrauding the  United States.    See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCambara,  902 F.2d 144, 146-47 (1st Cir. 1990).  To establish the\r                 \r\n\nmarijuana  conspiracy,  the  government  had to  prove  that  the\r\n\nconspiracy existed, that the  defendants agreed to participate in\r\n\nit, and that they  intended to possess and  distribute marijuana.\r\n\nSee  United States  v. Sepulveda,  15 F.3d  1161, 1173  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1993), cert.  denied, 114 S. Ct. 2714  (1994).  Thus, the primary\r                              \r\n\nobjects  of the two conspiracies  are different, and  each of the\r\n\ncharged crimes includes an element that the other does not.\r\n\n          These  differences  are  brought  home  by  parsing the\r\n\nindictment  in this case.  In respect  to count 3, the government\r\n\nneeds to prove at trial that the appellants specifically intended\r\n\nto defraud the IRS and that they undertook at least one overt act\r\n\nin furtherance of that  conspiracy   proof that is  extraneous to\r\n\nestablishing  the marijuana conspiracy.   In respect  to count 1,\r\n\nhowever,  the  government  needed  to prove  at  trial  that  the\r\n\nappellants  intended  to distribute  marijuana     proof that  is\r\n\nextraneous to  establishing the tax  conspiracy.  On  this basis,\r\n\nthe two charges constitute  distinct offenses under  Blockburger.\r                                                                          \r\n\nSee, e.g.,  United States  v. Gomez-Pabon,  911 F.2d 847,  861-62\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1990) (holding that a conspiracy to import cocaine and\r\n\na  conspiracy to  possess cocaine  with intent to  distribute are\r\n\ndistinct offenses because  they differ \"in  what they specify  as\r\n\nthe proscribed object of the conspiracy\"), cert. denied, 498 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n1074 (1991); United States  v.

Hence,\r\n\ntrying  the appellants  on count  3 will  not violate  the Double\r\n\nJeopardy Clause.\r\n\n          The  appellants  decry  this  analysis  as  excessively\r\n\ntechnical.   They hawk  three separate, but  related, rejoinders:\r\n\n(1) that the government will introduce at a future trial much the\r\n\nsame  evidence  which it  used in  the  previous trial;  (2) that\r\n\ndespite  the  proliferation  of  counts the  government  in  fact\r\n\nalleged  only  a  single  conspiracy  involving  distribution  of\r\n\nmarijuana and  concealment of the profits  derived therefrom; and\r                       \r\n\n(3)  that the district court misapplied this court's gloss on the\r\n\ntest for determining when two separately charged conspiracies are\r\n\ndeemed  synonymous   for   double  jeopardy   purposes.     These\r\n\nasseverations lack force.\r\n\n          1.    Same  Evidence.   The  Supreme  Court  has  never\r                    1.    Same  Evidence.\r                                        \r\n\nendorsed a blanket rule prohibiting the government from using the\r\n\nsame evidence to  prove two different  offenses against a  single\r\n\ndefendant.    To  be sure,  at  the  high-water  mark for  double\r\n\njeopardy protection  the Court  briefly adopted a  \"same conduct\"\r\n\ntest.   See Grady v. Corbin,  495 U.S. 508, 521  (1990).  But the\r                                     \r\n\nCourt laid waste  to Grady  in fairly short  order and  confirmed\r                                    \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthat  the performance  of  a Blockburger  analysis completes  the\r                                                  \r\n\njudicial  task in  a  successive prosecution  case.

As we\r\n\nalready  have shown, Congress defined  the tax conspiracy and the\r\n\nmarijuana conspiracy such that each requires proof of a fact that\r\n\nthe other does not.\r\n\n          3.

Here, four-fifths of the test falls neatly into place:\r\n\nit is  undisputed that  the tax and  marijuana conspiracies  took\r\n\nplace  contemporaneously  (or  nearly  so);  that  they  involved\r\n\nessentially the same  personnel; that they  occurred at much  the\r\n\nsame  places; and that most  of the evidence  that the government\r\n\nintroduced in its failed effort to prove the marijuana conspiracy\r\n\nwill  be  offered anew  in a  future  endeavor to  prove  the tax\r\n\nconspiracy.     Nevertheless,  there  is  a   missing  link;  the\r\n\nappellants cannot pass the fifth part of the test because the two\r\n\nconspiracies are premised on separate statutory provisions.\r\n\n          This divagation is fatal to the appellants' contention.\r\n\nThe rationale  underlying Booth stems  from a recognition  of the\r                                         \r\n\ndanger  that, in  conspiracy cases,  the government  might comply\r\n\nwith  the  letter of  Blockburger  while  evading its  spirit  by\r                                           \r\n\npartitioning a single conspiracy into separate prosecutions.

The Booth  test is  thus  aimed at  limiting prosecutorial\r                          \r\n\nabuse,  not  at  circumscribing  congressional  power  to  define\r\n\nmultiple offenses that occur  during a single course of  conduct.\r\n\nBecause  separate statutory  provisions are  involved in  the two\r\n\nconspiracies  limned in  this case,  a subsequent  prosecution on\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ncount 3 will  not offend the Double Jeopardy  Clause.

Of course, we must interpret this  statement of\r\n\nthe appellants' task in a practical manner:  a criminal defendant\r\n\nwho  raises a potential collateral  estoppel bar should  not be  \r\n\nand is not   held to a standard of absolute certainty.  A court's\r\n\napproach must be pragmatic in order to prevent the rejection of a\r\n\ncollateral  estoppel  defense in  every case  in which  the prior\r\n\njudgment  was based on a general verdict of acquittal.  See Ashe,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n397 U.S. at  444 (warning against  courts being too  \"technically\r\n\nrestrictive\").   If all proffered  explanations for why  a jury's\r\n\nverdict  does  not  decide  an  issue  are  frankly  implausible,\r\n\ncollateral  estoppel ought to bar relitigation of the issue.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nDray, 901 F.2d at 1137.\r              \r\n\n          It is against this  legal backdrop that we inspect  the\r\n\nparticulars  of  the  case at  bar.    To  determine whether  the\r\n\nappellants  can clear  the  collateral estoppel  hurdle, we  must\r\n\nundertake whole-record review.  See, e.g., Rossetti v. Curran, 80\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 1, 4  (1st Cir. 1996).  After all, collateral estoppel cases\r\n\nnecessarily  \"require  an examination  of  the  entire record  to\r\n\ndetermine whether the jury could have `grounded its  verdict upon\r\n\nan issue other than  that which the defendant seeks  to foreclose\r\n\nfrom consideration.'\"  Schiro, 510 U.S. at 236 (quoting Ashe).\r                                                                      \r\n\n          The appellants  argue vehemently  that the jury  at the\r\n\nfirst trial must have  determined that they were not  involved in\r\n\nthe conspiracy described  in count  1   a  conspiracy which  they\r\n\nvisualize as  encompassing  three facets:   obtaining  marijuana,\r\n\ndistributing it, and hiding the proceeds from the government.  We\r\n\nthink  that this  characterization misstates the  conspiracy that\r\n\nthe government alleged.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          Our explanation starts with an acknowledgement that the\r\n\npremise  implicit in the appellants' argument is sound.  Under an\r\n\nindictment  alleging that  a  defendant's role  in the  marijuana\r\n\nconspiracy  was   to   conceal  the   proceeds,  that   defendant\r\n\npotentially could be found guilty of conspiracy to distribute and\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\npossess with intent  to distribute marijuana  even though he  did\r\n\nnot personally deal drugs.  See generally United States v. David,\r                                                                          \r\n\n940 F.2d 722, 735 (1st Cir.) (noting that, in a chain conspiracy,\r\n\nthe  law holds a conspirator \"accountable for the earlier acts of\r\n\nhis  coconspirators in  furtherance  of the  conspiracy\"),  cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied,  502 U.S. 989 (1991);  United States v.

But count 1  of the indictment\r\n\nin this case is too  narrowly drawn to animate that premise    it\r\n\nalleged in effect that Smith and Morris were directly involved in\r                                                               \r\n\nmarijuana distribution   and the trial judge instructed the  jury\r\n\nthat the government  must prove \"the conspiracy  described in the\r\n\nindictment.\"  Thus, the jury would have been bound under count  1\r\n\nand  the district court's elucidation of it to acquit a defendant\r\n\nwhose  only involvement was to launder the funds generated by the\r\n\nprincipals' operation of the marijuana conspiracy.\r\n\n          Equally as  important, count  1 of the  indictment sets\r\n\nout a  conspiracy  to  distribute  and  possess  with  intent  to\r\n\ndistribute  marijuana, not a conspiracy  to defraud the  IRS.  In\r\n\nit,  the   government  avers  that   the  appellants  \"consigned,\r\n\nentrusted,  and  distributed marijuana,\"  but  the count  nowhere\r\n\nattempts to describe how  the conspirators concealed the proceeds\r\n\nof  the marijuana distribution from  prying eyes.3   This lack of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The closest count  1 comes to  stating that the  appellants\r\nconspired  to defraud  the IRS  is its  averment that  they \"used\r\ncash,  bank checks, and money orders to further the objectives of\r\nthe  conspiracy,  to  wit,  the  acquisition,  receipt,  storage,\r\nconsignment  and  distribution  of large  amounts  of  marijuana,\r\nthereby deriving substantial cash proceeds.\"  But this allegation\r\nfalls  far short  of  specifying whether  (and  if so,  how)  the\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nconnectedness  is critical,  for,  as we  mentioned earlier,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  instructed the  jury that  the government  had to\r\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt \"that the conspiracy described in\r\n\n[count  1] was willfully formed  and was existing  at on or about\r\n\nthe  time alleged in the indictment.\"  Hence, the jury's decision\r\n\nthat the appellants were  not guilty of the conduct  described in\r\n\ncount 1 does  not rule  out the possibility  that the  appellants\r\n\nnonetheless may have conspired  to defraud the IRS as  alleged in\r\n\ncount 3.4   Because the record as  a whole (i.e., the indictment,\r\n\nthe   evidence,  the   arguments   of  counsel,   and  the   jury\r\n\ninstructions)  reveals  more than  one  plausible  basis for  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nappellants  conspired to  launder drug  proceeds and  deprive the\r\ngovernment of tax revenue.\r\n\n     4This point  is driven home by  a reading of count  3 of the\r\nindictment, which  discusses in detail the  conspirators' actions\r\nto  hide the income that flowed their way, alleging, for example,\r\nthat Morris  and Smith used marijuana-generated  cash to renovate\r\nand improve real property  (a specie of money laundering  that is\r\nnot mentioned in count 1).\r\n      In fairness,  we  also  note that  count  3  contains  some\r\nallegations tending to blur the distinction between the marijuana\r\nconspiracy  and the tax conspiracy.  Thus, Count 3 accuses Morris\r\nand  Smith   of  \"earn[ing]  income   by  acquiring,   receiving,\r\npossessing,   storing,  repackaging,   transporting,  consigning,\r\nentrusting, and distributing  marijuana, and fail[ing]  to report\r\nsuch sums to the  Internal Revenue Service.\"  To  the extent that\r\nsuch evidence  is probative  of the appellants'  participation in\r\nthe tax conspiracy,  the government is free to introduce  it in a\r\nsubsequent trial,  despite the previous acquittal.   See Dowling,\r                                                                          \r\n493 U.S. at 348  (declining to extend the doctrine  of collateral\r\nestoppel  to  require  exclusion  of  relevant  evidence  \"simply\r\nbecause  it relates  to  alleged  criminal  conduct for  which  a\r\ndefendant has been acquitted\").

See Dray, 901  F.2d at 1139 (explaining that there  is no\r                          \r\n\ncollateral  estoppel if an inquiring court is \"left with a choice\r\n\namong  a  variety  of plausible  theories\"  as  to  why the  jury\r\n\nacquitted at an earlier trial).\r\n\n          To  put some meat on the bare bones of this conclusion,\r\n\nwe sketch the  scenarios that  in our judgment  suffice to  leave\r\n\nopen  the possibility that the appellants may yet be found guilty\r\n\nof  conspiracy to defraud the IRS without doing violence to their\r\n\nearlier  acquittals on  drug-related charges.   In the  course of\r\n\nthis exercise, we treat Smith and Morris separately.\r\n\n          1.   Smith's Collateral  Estoppel Claim.   The district\r                    1.   Smith's Collateral  Estoppel Claim.\r                                                           \r\n\ncourt properly instructed the jury that the government must prove\r\n\n\"the specific offense charged in the indictment,\" and, thus, that\r\n\nSmith had  the specific  intent to  further  the distribution  or\r\n\npossession of marijuana.  The record leaves room for at least one\r\n\nsubstantial possibility consistent  with permitting  Smith to  be\r\n\ntried on the tax conspiracy charge.\r\n\n          The  proof showed  that Smith engaged  in a  variety of\r\n\nentrepreneurial ventures,  including  buying and  selling  coins,\r\n\nantiques, posters, prints, stamps, collectibles, and real estate.\r\n\nAt trial, his  own counsel described him  as \"a hustler.\"   Smith\r\n\nconducted his affairs largely  in cash and  kept no records.   Of\r\n\nparticular pertinence for present purposes, he had close business\r\n\nconnections with Gary Dethlefs, a central figure in the marijuana\r\n\nconspiracy.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n          Both the evidence and the jury's verdict are consistent\r\n\nwith a  finding that  Dethlefs made  enormous profits  buying and\r\n\nselling marijuana.  Smith worked as  the general manager of G &amp; A\r\n\nDevelopment   Corporation,  a   construction  company   owned  by\r\n\nDethlefs.   Smith had  direct responsibility for  the firm's land\r\n\nacquisitions.     He  also   teamed  with  Dethlefs   to  acquire\r\n\nrestaurants,  and he joined Dethlefs  on at least  one sojourn to\r\n\nLos  Angeles  in  regard to  a  venture  in  the music  recording\r\n\nindustry.\r\n\n          In   his   trial  testimony,   Smith  swore   that  his\r\n\ninvolvement with Dethlefs extended only to  legitimate businesses\r\n\nand   that  he   had  no   knowledge  that   Dethlefs'  seemingly\r\n\ninexhaustible  wealth  came  from  drugs.    He  stated  that  he\r\n\nsolicited Dethlefs to back  his investments because Dethlefs \"had\r\n\nmoney.\"    Given  the magnitude  of  Dethlefs'  drug  dealing and\r\n\nSmith's  close  ties  with him,  the  jury  certainly could  have\r\n\nbelieved that marijuana trafficking kept Dethlefs' coffers full  \r\n\nand that Smith knew as much.   The jury, however, also could have\r\n\nconcluded  that Smith was not involved in trafficking per se, but\r\n\nsimply helped  to launder  the proceeds of  Dethlefs' operation.5\r\n\nSuch a conclusion would  be consistent with both an  acquittal on\r\n\ncount 1 and a subsequent conviction on count 3.\r\n\n          Of course,  the record does not  conclusively establish\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Smith's track  record as a wheeler-dealer  tends to fortify\r\nsuch a conclusion;  the evidence  introduced at  the first  trial\r\nshowed that he had an entrepreneurial background in  business and\r\nreal estate  which included  other relevant experience  in hiding\r\nincome from the government.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nthat Smith intended to defraud the United States, but that is not\r\n\nthe issue today.  What matters now is that, giving full effect to\r\n\nthe jury's  verdict, the record  does not foreclose  the scenario\r\n\nspelled out  above.   Moreover, though  the line for  determining\r\n\nwhether theories explaining a jury's acquittal are too farfetched\r\n\nto  be given  weight  in  the  collateral  estoppel  calculus  is\r\n\ninherently tenebrous, that imprecision poses no problem where, as\r\n\nhere, the  proffered  explanation  is  a  plausible  one.    Much\r\n\nevidence in the record is consistent with both the jury's verdict\r\n\nand the appellants' participation in a conspiracy to defraud  the\r\n\nIRS.  Smith's collateral estoppel claim therefore founders.\r\n\n          2.    Morris'  Collateral   Estoppel  Claim.    We  are\r                    2.    Morris'  Collateral   Estoppel  Claim.\r                                                               \r\n\nsatisfied that Morris, too, failed to carry the burden of showing\r\n\nthat his acquittal on the marijuana conspiracy charge necessarily\r\n\ndecided  his  lack of  involvement in  the  tax conspiracy.   The\r\n\nrecord leaves open  the realistic possibility  of a jury  finding\r\n\nthat he did not intend to distribute marijuana.\r\n\n          Morris  claims that  he  does construction  work for  a\r\n\nliving.   He  frequently  works  \"under  the table\";  he  accepts\r\n\npayment in cash  for services  rendered and does  not report  the\r\n\nincome.   One witness testified  that, between 1985  and 1992, he\r\n\nalone paid Morris $21,000 in cash for work done off the books.\r\n\n          William Hesketh  cooperated  with the  prosecution  and\r\n\ntestified at the  first trial.   He admitted  dealing drugs  from\r\n\n1985 through 1988.  During that period he bought large quantities\r\n\nof marijuana (as much as 100 pounds at a time) from Dethlefs.  He\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nalso testified that  he both  gave and sold  marijuana to  Morris\r\n\n(who worked for him  on virtually a full-time  basis in 1987  and\r\n\n1988).  Morris built  a chimney for Hesketh, remodeled  the upper\r\n\nstory  of Hesketh's home, and constructed two buildings for D and\r\n\nS Moulding Company (a business that Hesketh controlled).  Hesketh\r\n\nalways paid Morris in cash.  While the verdict indicates that the\r\n\njurors turned down the  government's theory that Morris purchased\r\n\nmarijuana from  Hesketh for  resale, they nonetheless  could have\r\n\ninferred knowledge on Morris' part that Hesketh's money came from\r\n\nmarijuana sales.\r\n\n          Thus, if the jury thought  that Morris, though aware of\r\n\nthe source of Hesketh's funds, had no stake in the success of the\r\n\nmarijuana-purveying enterprise,  it would be obliged  to return a\r\n\n\"not guilty\"  verdict on count 1 of the indictment as drawn   but\r\n\nthat verdict  would not  tell us  anything  of consequence  about\r\n\nMorris'  guilt or innocence vis- -vis the tax conspiracy.  In all\r\n\nevents, this scenario is sufficient  (and sufficiently plausible)\r\n\nto  overcome  Morris'  argument  that  collateral   estoppel  now\r\n\nprevents his trial on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the IRS.6\r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          We  need  go  no further.    For  the  reasons we  have\r\n\ndiscussed,  neither  double  jeopardy  nor   collateral  estoppel\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6If more were needed   and  we do not think that it is    we\r\nnote that  only count 3 (the tax  conspiracy charge), not count 1\r\n(the marijuana conspiracy charge), alleges that Morris  renovated\r\nand improved real and personal property with cash.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\npreclude  the  government  from  prosecuting  the  appellants  on\r\n\ncharges  of  conspiracy  to  defraud the  United  States  in  the\r\n\ndetermination and collection of  income taxes.  Consequently, the\r\n\ndistrict court did not err in refusing to dismiss count  3 of the\r\n\nindictment.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                17\r\r\n",

Morris and Stuart L. Smith on charges of conspiracy to distribute marijuana bars the government from now prosecuting them on charges of conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The district court answered this question in the negative.  Concluding, as we do, that neither double jeopardy nor collateral estoppel principles preclude continued prosecution of the tax conspiracy charge, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, a federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment against the appellants and seven other persons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Count 1 charged the appellants (and others) with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846 (1994).  Count 2 sought criminal forfeiture of property used in or derived from the marijuana conspiracy.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853 (1994).  Count 3 charged the appellants (and others) with conspiracy to defraud the IRS in the determination and collection of income taxes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court severed count 3 and proceeded to trial on the other counts.  The jury returned a \"not guilty\" verdict on count 1, putting an end to that charge and also eviscerating count 2.  The appellants then moved to dismiss count 3 on double jeopardy and collateral estoppel grounds.  The district court denied the motions.  These interlocutory appeals ensued.  See Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 2041-42, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977) (holding that pretrial orders rejecting double jeopardy claims premised on successive prosecutions are immediately appealable).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Inasmuch as the appeals challenge the district court's application of the law rather than its factfinding, our review is plenary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb....\"  U.S. Const. amend.  V.  The Clause has three aspects:  it shields a defendant from a second prosecution for the same offense after either conviction or acquittal, and it also prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.  See United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 714 (1st Cir.1996), cert. dismissed, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 378, 136 L.Ed.2d 297 (1996);  United States v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 391 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 862, 112 S.Ct. 184, 116 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991).  Here, the appellants invoke the Clause's protection against successive prosecutions.  The resolution of their claim turns on whether the tax conspiracy is the same offense as the marijuana conspiracy for double jeopardy purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has authored a black-letter rule for use in determining when double jeopardy principles prohibit prosecution under two distinct statutory provisions:  \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of [both] statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\"  Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).  If the crimes charged are discrete offenses within the contemplation of Blockburger, the defendant may be prosecuted consecutively for them, even if the crimes arise out of the same conduct or nucleus of operative facts.  See United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 372 (1st Cir.1994).  Thus, the Blockburger rule depends on statutory analysis, not on evidentiary comparisons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having carefully examined the record, we conclude, as did the court below, that the tax conspiracy and the marijuana conspiracy are separate offenses.  To establish the tax conspiracy, the government must prove that the conspiracy existed, that the defendants agreed to participate in it, and that at least one overt act was perpetrated in furtherance of the goal of defrauding the United States.  See United States v. Cambara, 902 F.2d 144, 146-47 (1st Cir.1990).  To establish the marijuana conspiracy, the government had to prove that the conspiracy existed, that the defendants agreed to participate in it, and that they intended to possess and distribute marijuana.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1223, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994).  Thus, the primary objects of the two conspiracies are different, and each of the charged crimes includes an element that the other does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These differences are brought home by parsing the indictment in this case.  In respect to count 3, the government needs to prove at trial that the appellants specifically intended to defraud the IRS and that they undertook at least one overt act in furtherance of that conspiracy--proof that is extraneous to establishing the marijuana conspiracy.  In respect to count 1, however, the government needed to prove at trial that the appellants intended to distribute marijuana--proof that is extraneous to establishing the tax conspiracy.  On this basis, the two charges constitute distinct offenses under Blockburger.   See, e.g., United States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 861-62 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that a conspiracy to import cocaine and a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute are distinct offenses because they differ \"in what they specify as the proscribed object of the conspiracy\"), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1074, 111 S.Ct. 801, 112 L.Ed.2d 862 (1991);  United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 817 (1st Cir.1988) (holding that conspiracy to distribute cocaine and aiding and abetting the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute are distinct offenses and may be charged separately even if both arise out of the same transaction because each requires proof of an element that the other does not).  Hence, trying the appellants on count 3 will not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants decry this analysis as excessively technical.  They hawk three separate, but related, rejoinders:  (1) that the government will introduce at a future trial much the same evidence which it used in the previous trial;  (2) that despite the proliferation of counts the government in fact alleged only a single conspiracy involving distribution of marijuana and concealment of the profits derived therefrom;  and (3) that the district court misapplied this court's gloss on the test for determining when two separately charged conspiracies are deemed synonymous for double jeopardy purposes.  These asseverations lack force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Same Evidence.   The Supreme Court has never endorsed a blanket rule prohibiting the government from using the same evidence to prove two different offenses against a single defendant.  To be sure, at the high-water mark for double jeopardy protection the Court briefly adopted a \"same conduct\" test.  See Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508, 521, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 2093, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990).  But the Court laid waste to Grady in fairly short order and confirmed that the performance of a Blockburger analysis completes the judicial task in a successive prosecution case.  See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 712, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 2864, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993) (overruling Grady ).   Consequently, the appellants' \"same evidence\" argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Singularity of the Conspiracy.   The appellants' assertion that the government alleged only one overarching conspiracy is no more than a play on words.  Even if the transactions on which the charges rest are intertwined--the \"best case\" assumption for the appellants, and a matter on which we need not opine--this datum would not alter the outcome of a Blockburger inquiry.  \"It is well settled that a single transaction can give rise to distinct offenses under separate statutes without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause,\" and this tenet \"is true even though the 'single transaction' is an agreement or conspiracy.\"  Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. 333, 344 n. 3, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1145 n. 3, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a particular course of conduct involves one or more distinct offenses depends on congressional choice, and the Double Jeopardy Clause offers little limitation on that choice.  See Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 69-70, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 2181-82, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978).  This principle readily disposes of the appellants' argument.  As we already have shown, Congress defined the tax conspiracy and the marijuana conspiracy such that each requires proof of a fact that the other does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Segregating Distinct Conspiracies.   Finally, the appellants urge us to find that they are shielded from prosecution for the tax conspiracy because of the imbrication between it and the marijuana conspiracy.  In framing this exhortation the appellants pin their hopes on United States v. Booth, 673 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 978, 102 S.Ct. 2245, 72 L.Ed.2d 853 (1982), in which we set out a five-part test for determining whether two conspiracies are synonymous for double jeopardy purposes.  Here, four-fifths of the test falls neatly into place:  it is undisputed that the tax and marijuana conspiracies took place contemporaneously (or nearly so);  that they involved essentially the same personnel;  that they occurred at much the same places;  and that most of the evidence that the government introduced in its failed effort to prove the marijuana conspiracy will be offered anew in a future endeavor to prove the tax conspiracy.  Nevertheless, there is a missing link;  the appellants cannot pass the fifth part of the test because the two conspiracies are premised on separate statutory provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This divagation is fatal to the appellants' contention.  The rationale underlying Booth stems from a recognition of the danger that, in conspiracy cases, the government might comply with the letter of Blockburger while evading its spirit by partitioning a single conspiracy into separate prosecutions.  See id.   The Booth test is thus aimed at limiting prosecutorial abuse, not at circumscribing congressional power to define multiple offenses that occur during a single course of conduct.  Because separate statutory provisions are involved in the two conspiracies limned in this case, a subsequent prosecution on count 3 will not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d at 861-62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Collateral Estoppel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled beyond cavil that the Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses the doctrine of collateral estoppel.  See Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 444-45, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1194-95, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970);  United States v. Dray, 901 F.2d 1132, 1135 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 895, 111 S.Ct. 245, 112 L.Ed.2d 204 (1990).  This doctrine ensures that \"when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\"  Ashe, 397 U.S. at 443, 90 S.Ct. at 1194.   In a criminal case, a defendant who wishes to wield this doctrinal weapon against the government bears the burden of demonstrating that the issue he seeks to foreclose was in fact settled by the first proceeding.  See Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 350-51, 110 S.Ct. 668, 673-74, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants thus face a formidable task:  they must show that the first trial necessarily decided that they were not involved in the tax conspiracy.  See Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. 222, 236, 114 S.Ct. 783, 792, 127 L.Ed.2d 47 (1994).  Of course, we must interpret this statement of the appellants' task in a practical manner:  a criminal defendant who raises a potential collateral estoppel bar should not be--and is not--held to a standard of absolute certainty.  A court's approach must be pragmatic in order to prevent the rejection of a collateral estoppel defense in every case in which the prior judgment was based on a general verdict of acquittal.  See Ashe, 397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. at 1194 (warning against courts being too \"technically restrictive\").  If all proffered explanations for why a jury's verdict does not decide an issue are frankly implausible, collateral estoppel ought to bar relitigation of the issue.  See Dray, 901 F.2d at 1137.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this legal backdrop that we inspect the particulars of the case at bar.  To determine whether the appellants can clear the collateral estoppel hurdle, we must undertake whole-record review.  See, e.g., Rossetti v. Curran, 80 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1996).  After all, collateral estoppel cases necessarily \"require an examination of the entire record to determine whether the jury could have 'grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.' \"  Schiro, 510 U.S. at 236, 114 S.Ct. at 792 (quoting Ashe ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue vehemently that the jury at the first trial must have determined that they were not involved in the conspiracy described in count 1--a conspiracy which they visualize as encompassing three facets:  obtaining marijuana, distributing it, and hiding the proceeds from the government.  We think that this characterization misstates the conspiracy that the government alleged.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our explanation starts with an acknowledgement that the premise implicit in the appellants' argument is sound.  Under an indictment alleging that a defendant's role in the marijuana conspiracy was to conceal the proceeds, that defendant potentially could be found guilty of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana even though he did not personally deal drugs.  See generally United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 735 (1st Cir.)  (noting that, in a chain conspiracy, the law holds a conspirator \"accountable for the earlier acts of his coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy\"), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 989, 112 S.Ct. 605, 116 L.Ed.2d 628 (1991);  United States v. Baines, 812 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir.1987) (similar).  But count 1 of the indictment in this case is too narrowly drawn to animate that premise--it alleged in effect that Smith and Morris were directly involved in marijuana distribution--and the trial judge instructed the jury that the government must prove \"the conspiracy described in the indictment.\"   Thus, the jury would have been bound under count 1 and the district court's elucidation of it to acquit a defendant whose only involvement was to launder the funds generated by the principals' operation of the marijuana conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally as important, count 1 of the indictment sets out a conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana, not a conspiracy to defraud the IRS.  In it, the government avers that the appellants \"consigned, entrusted, and distributed marijuana,\" but the count nowhere attempts to describe how the conspirators concealed the proceeds of the marijuana distribution from prying eyes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This lack of connectedness is critical, for, as we mentioned earlier, the district court instructed the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt \"that the conspiracy described in [count 1] was willfully formed and was existing at on or about the time alleged in the indictment.\"   Hence, the jury's decision that the appellants were not guilty of the conduct described in count 1 does not rule out the possibility that the appellants nonetheless may have conspired to defraud the IRS as alleged in count 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Because the record as a whole (i.e., the indictment, the evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the jury instructions) reveals more than one plausible basis for the acquittals, we must reject the appellants' collateral estoppel claim.  See Dray, 901 F.2d at 1139 (explaining that there is no collateral estoppel if an inquiring court is \"left with a choice among a variety of plausible theories\" as to why the jury acquitted at an earlier trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To put some meat on the bare bones of this conclusion, we sketch the scenarios that in our judgment suffice to leave open the possibility that the appellants may yet be found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the IRS without doing violence to their earlier acquittals on drug-related charges.  In the course of this exercise, we treat Smith and Morris separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Smith's Collateral Estoppel Claim.   The district court properly instructed the jury that the government must prove \"the specific offense charged in the indictment,\" and, thus, that Smith had the specific intent to further the distribution or possession of marijuana.  The record leaves room for at least one substantial possibility consistent with permitting Smith to be tried on the tax conspiracy charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof showed that Smith engaged in a variety of entrepreneurial ventures, including buying and selling coins, antiques, posters, prints, stamps, collectibles, and real estate.  At trial, his own counsel described him as \"a hustler.\"   Smith conducted his affairs largely in cash and kept no records.  Of particular pertinence for present purposes, he had close business connections with Gary Dethlefs, a central figure in the marijuana conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the evidence and the jury's verdict are consistent with a finding that Dethlefs made enormous profits buying and selling marijuana.  Smith worked as the general manager of G &amp; A Development Corporation, a construction company owned by Dethlefs.  Smith had direct responsibility for the firm's land acquisitions.  He also teamed with Dethlefs to acquire restaurants, and he joined Dethlefs on at least one sojourn to Los Angeles in regard to a venture in the music recording industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his trial testimony, Smith swore that his involvement with Dethlefs extended only to legitimate businesses and that he had no knowledge that Dethlefs' seemingly inexhaustible wealth came from drugs.  He stated that he solicited Dethlefs to back his investments because Dethlefs \"had money.\"   Given the magnitude of Dethlefs' drug dealing and Smith's close ties with him, the jury certainly could have believed that marijuana trafficking kept Dethlefs' coffers full--and that Smith knew as much.  The jury, however, also could have concluded that Smith was not involved in trafficking per se, but simply helped to launder the proceeds of Dethlefs' operation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Such a conclusion would be consistent with both an acquittal on count 1 and a subsequent conviction on count 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the record does not conclusively establish that Smith intended to defraud the United States, but that is not the issue today.  What matters now is that, giving full effect to the jury's verdict, the record does not foreclose the scenario spelled out above.  Moreover, though the line for determining whether theories explaining a jury's acquittal are too farfetched to be given weight in the collateral estoppel calculus is inherently tenebrous, that imprecision poses no problem where, as here, the proffered explanation is a plausible one.  Much evidence in the record is consistent with both the jury's verdict and the appellants' participation in a conspiracy to defraud the IRS.  Smith's collateral estoppel claim therefore founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Morris' Collateral Estoppel Claim.   We are satisfied that Morris, too, failed to carry the burden of showing that his acquittal on the marijuana conspiracy charge necessarily decided his lack of involvement in the tax conspiracy.  The record leaves open the realistic possibility of a jury finding that he did not intend to distribute marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morris claims that he does construction work for a living.  He frequently works \"under the table\";  he accepts payment in cash for services rendered and does not report the income.  One witness testified that, between 1985 and 1992, he alone paid Morris $21,000 in cash for work done off the books.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Hesketh cooperated with the prosecution and testified at the first trial.  He admitted dealing drugs from 1985 through 1988.  During that period he bought large quantities of marijuana (as much as 100 pounds at a time) from Dethlefs.  He also testified that he both gave and sold marijuana to Morris (who worked for him on virtually a full-time basis in 1987 and 1988).  Morris built a chimney for Hesketh, remodeled the upper story of Hesketh's home, and constructed two buildings for D and S Moulding Company (a business that Hesketh controlled).  Hesketh always paid Morris in cash.  While the verdict indicates that the jurors turned down the government's theory that Morris purchased marijuana from Hesketh for resale, they nonetheless could have inferred knowledge on Morris' part that Hesketh's money came from marijuana sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if the jury thought that Morris, though aware of the source of Hesketh's funds, had no stake in the success of the marijuana-purveying enterprise, it would be obliged to return a \"not guilty\" verdict on count 1 of the indictment as drawn--but that verdict would not tell us anything of consequence about Morris' guilt or innocence vis-a-vis the tax conspiracy.  In all events, this scenario is sufficient (and sufficiently plausible) to overcome Morris' argument that collateral estoppel now prevents his trial on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the IRS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For the reasons we have discussed, neither double jeopardy nor collateral estoppel preclude the government from prosecuting the appellants on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States in the determination and collection of income taxes.  Consequently, the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss count 3 of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because these appeals do not involve any of the seven codefendants, we minimize further references to them in describing the indictment and ensuing trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Abney involved multiple prosecutions.  431 U.S. at 662, 97 S.Ct. at 2041-42.

Ramirez-Burgos, 44 F.3d 17, 18-19 (1st Cir.1995) (dismissing for want of jurisdiction an interlocutory appeal stemming from the rejection of a multiple punishments claim asserted in connection with parallel counts contained in a single indictment);  see also United States v.

Because these appeals, like Abney itself, involve the successive prosecution branch of the Double Jeopardy Clause, we have jurisdiction to hear and determine them prior to trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The closest count 1 comes to stating that the appellants conspired to defraud the IRS is its averment that they \"used cash, bank checks, and money orders to further the objectives of the conspiracy, to wit, the acquisition, receipt, storage, consignment and distribution of large amounts of marijuana, thereby deriving substantial cash proceeds.\"   But this allegation falls far short of specifying whether (and if so, how) the appellants conspired to launder drug proceeds and deprive the government of tax revenue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This point is driven home by a reading of count 3 of the indictment, which discusses in detail the conspirators' actions to hide the income that flowed their way, alleging, for example, that Morris and Smith used marijuana-generated cash to renovate and improve real property (a specie of money laundering that is not mentioned in count 1)</p>\n        <p>In fairness, we also note that count 3 contains some allegations tending to blur the distinction between the marijuana conspiracy and the tax conspiracy.  Thus, Count 3 accuses Morris and Smith of \"earn[ing] income by acquiring, receiving, possessing, storing, repackaging, transporting, consigning, entrusting, and distributing marijuana, and fail[ing] to report such sums to the Internal Revenue Service.\"   To the extent that such evidence is probative of the appellants' participation in the tax conspiracy, the government is free to introduce it in a subsequent trial, despite the previous acquittal.  See Dowling, 493 U.S. at 348, 110 S.Ct. at 672 (declining to extend the doctrine of collateral estoppel to require exclusion of relevant evidence \"simply because it relates to alleged criminal conduct for which a defendant has been acquitted\").  However, nothing in this opinion is intended to circumscribe the district court's discretion either in making in limine orders or in fashioning appropriate limiting instructions regarding how (if at all) evidence of the appellants' putative involvement in the marijuana conspiracy may now be used.

Count 2 sought criminal forfeiture of property used in or derived from the marijuana conspiracy.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853 (1994).  Count 3 charged the appellants (and others) with conspiracy to defraud the IRS in the determination and collection of income taxes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court severed count 3 and proceeded to trial on the other counts.  The jury returned a \"not guilty\" verdict on count 1, putting an end to that charge and also eviscerating count 2.

If the crimes charged are discrete offenses within the contemplation of Blockburger, the defendant may be prosecuted consecutively for them, even if the crimes arise out of the same conduct or nucleus of operative facts.  See United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 372 (1st Cir.1994).  Thus, the Blockburger rule depends on statutory analysis, not on evidentiary comparisons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having carefully examined the record, we conclude, as did the court below, that the tax conspiracy and the marijuana conspiracy are separate offenses.  To establish the tax conspiracy, the government must prove that the conspiracy existed, that the defendants agreed to participate in it, and that at least one overt act was perpetrated in furtherance of the goal of defrauding the United States.  See United States v. Cambara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540782\"><a href=\"/opinion/540782/united-states-v-joaquin-cambara-united-states-of-america-v-jose-cambara/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 146-47 (1st Cir.1990).  To establish the marijuana conspiracy, the government had to prove that the conspiracy existed, that the defendants agreed to participate in it, and that they intended to possess and distribute marijuana.  See United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1173 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></span> (1994).  Thus, the primary objects of the two conspiracies are different, and each of the charged crimes includes an element that the other does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These differences are brought home by parsing the indictment in this case.  In respect to count 3, the government needs to prove at trial that the appellants specifically intended to defraud the IRS and that they undertook at least one overt act in furtherance of that conspiracy--proof that is extraneous to establishing the marijuana conspiracy.  In respect to count 1, however, the government needed to prove at trial that the appellants intended to distribute marijuana--proof that is extraneous to establishing the tax conspiracy.  On this basis, the two charges constitute distinct offenses under Blockburger.   See, e.g., United States v. Gomez-Pabon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546890\"><a href=\"/opinion/546890/united-states-v-luis-e-gomez-pabon-united-states-v-wilfredo/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 861-62 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that a conspiracy to import cocaine and a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute are distinct offenses because they differ \"in what they specify as the proscribed object of the conspiracy\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hence, trying the appellants on count 3 will not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants decry this analysis as excessively technical.  They hawk three separate, but related, rejoinders:  (1) that the government will introduce at a future trial much the same evidence which it used in the previous trial;  (2) that despite the proliferation of counts the government in fact alleged only a single conspiracy involving distribution of marijuana and concealment of the profits derived therefrom;  and (3) that the district court misapplied this court's gloss on the test for determining when two separately charged conspiracies are deemed synonymous for double jeopardy purposes.  These asseverations lack force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Same Evidence.   The Supreme Court has never endorsed a blanket rule prohibiting the government from using the same evidence to prove two different offenses against a single defendant.  To be sure, at the high-water mark for double jeopardy protection the Court briefly adopted a \"same conduct\" test.  See Grady v. Corbin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112432\"><a href=\"/opinion/112432/grady-v-corbin/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span>, 521, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112432\"><a href=\"/opinion/112432/grady-v-corbin/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span> (1990).  But the Court laid waste to Grady in fairly short order and confirmed that the performance of a Blockburger analysis completes the judicial task in a successive prosecution case.  See United States v. Dixon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112906\"><a href=\"/opinion/112906/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, 712, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112906\"><a href=\"/opinion/112906/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span> (1993) (overruling Grady ).   Consequently, the appellants' \"same evidence\" argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Singularity of the Conspiracy.   The appellants' assertion that the government alleged only one overarching conspiracy is no more than a play on words.  Even if the transactions on which the charges rest are intertwined--the \"best case\" assumption for the appellants, and a matter on which we need not opine--this datum would not alter the outcome of a Blockburger inquiry.  \"It is well settled that a single transaction can give rise to distinct offenses under separate statutes without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause,\" and this tenet \"is true even though the 'single transaction' is an agreement or conspiracy.\"  Albernaz v.

Segregating Distinct Conspiracies.   Finally, the appellants urge us to find that they are shielded from prosecution for the tax conspiracy because of the imbrication between it and the marijuana conspiracy.  In framing this exhortation the appellants pin their hopes on United States v. Booth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"400942\"><a href=\"/opinion/400942/united-states-v-michael-booth-aka-dennis-allen-harper-larry-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></span> (1982), in which we set out a five-part test for determining whether two conspiracies are synonymous for double jeopardy purposes.  Here, four-fifths of the test falls neatly into place:  it is undisputed that the tax and marijuana conspiracies took place contemporaneously (or nearly so);  that they involved essentially the same personnel;  that they occurred at much the same places;  and that most of the evidence that the government introduced in its failed effort to prove the marijuana conspiracy will be offered anew in a future endeavor to prove the tax conspiracy.  Nevertheless, there is a missing link;  the appellants cannot pass the fifth part of the test because the two conspiracies are premised on separate statutory provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This divagation is fatal to the appellants' contention.  The rationale underlying Booth stems from a recognition of the danger that, in conspiracy cases, the government might comply with the letter of Blockburger while evading its spirit by partitioning a single conspiracy into separate prosecutions.  See id.   The Booth test is thus aimed at limiting prosecutorial abuse, not at circumscribing congressional power to define multiple offenses that occur during a single course of conduct.  Because separate statutory provisions are involved in the two conspiracies limned in this case, a subsequent prosecution on count 3 will not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d at 861-62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Collateral Estoppel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled beyond cavil that the Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses the doctrine of collateral estoppel.

In a criminal case, a defendant who wishes to wield this doctrinal weapon against the government bears the burden of demonstrating that the issue he seeks to foreclose was in fact settled by the first proceeding.  See Dowling v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 350-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Schiro v. Farley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112922\"><a href=\"/opinion/112922/schiro-v-farley/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span>, 236, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112922\"><a href=\"/opinion/112922/schiro-v-farley/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span> (1994).  Of course, we must interpret this statement of the appellants' task in a practical manner:  a criminal defendant who raises a potential collateral estoppel bar should not be--and is not--held to a standard of absolute certainty.  A court's approach must be pragmatic in order to prevent the rejection of a collateral estoppel defense in every case in which the prior judgment was based on a general verdict of acquittal.  See Ashe, 397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. at 1194 (warning against courts being too \"technically restrictive\").  If all proffered explanations for why a jury's verdict does not decide an issue are frankly implausible, collateral estoppel ought to bar relitigation of the issue.  See Dray, 901 F.2d at 1137.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this legal backdrop that we inspect the particulars of the case at bar.  To determine whether the appellants can clear the collateral estoppel hurdle, we must undertake whole-record review.  See, e.g., Rossetti v. Curran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196645\"><a href=\"/opinion/196645/rossetti-v-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1996).  After all, collateral estoppel cases necessarily \"require an examination of the entire record to determine whether the jury could have 'grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.' \"  Schiro, 510 U.S. at 236, 114 S.Ct. at 792 (quoting Ashe ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue vehemently that the jury at the first trial must have determined that they were not involved in the conspiracy described in count 1--a conspiracy which they visualize as encompassing three facets:  obtaining marijuana, distributing it, and hiding the proceeds from the government.  We think that this characterization misstates the conspiracy that the government alleged.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our explanation starts with an acknowledgement that the premise implicit in the appellants' argument is sound.  Under an indictment alleging that a defendant's role in the marijuana conspiracy was to conceal the proceeds, that defendant potentially could be found guilty of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana even though he did not personally deal drugs.  See generally United States v. David, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 735 (1st Cir.)  (noting that, in a chain conspiracy, the law holds a conspirator \"accountable for the earlier acts of his coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></span> (1991);  United States v. Baines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483545\"><a href=\"/opinion/483545/united-states-v-robert-s-baines/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1987) (similar).  But count 1 of the indictment in this case is too narrowly drawn to animate that premise--it alleged in effect that Smith and Morris were directly involved in marijuana distribution--and the trial judge instructed the jury that the government must prove \"the conspiracy described in the indictment.\"   Thus, the jury would have been bound under count 1 and the district court's elucidation of it to acquit a defendant whose only involvement was to launder the funds generated by the principals' operation of the marijuana conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally as important, count 1 of the indictment sets out a conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana, not a conspiracy to defraud the IRS.  In it, the government avers that the appellants \"consigned, entrusted, and distributed marijuana,\" but the count nowhere attempts to describe how the conspirators concealed the proceeds of the marijuana distribution from prying eyes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This lack of connectedness is critical, for, as we mentioned earlier, the district court instructed the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt \"that the conspiracy described in [count 1] was willfully formed and was existing at on or about the time alleged in the indictment.\"   Hence, the jury's decision that the appellants were not guilty of the conduct described in count 1 does not rule out the possibility that the appellants nonetheless may have conspired to defraud the IRS as alleged in count 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Because the record as a whole (i.e., the indictment, the evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the jury instructions) reveals more than one plausible basis for the acquittals, we must reject the appellants' collateral estoppel claim.  See Dray, 901 F.2d at 1139 (explaining that there is no collateral estoppel if an inquiring court is \"left with a choice among a variety of plausible theories\" as to why the jury acquitted at an earlier trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To put some meat on the bare bones of this conclusion, we sketch the scenarios that in our judgment suffice to leave open the possibility that the appellants may yet be found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the IRS without doing violence to their earlier acquittals on drug-related charges.  In the course of this exercise, we treat Smith and Morris separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Smith's Collateral Estoppel Claim.   The district court properly instructed the jury that the government must prove \"the specific offense charged in the indictment,\" and, thus, that Smith had the specific intent to further the distribution or possession of marijuana.  The record leaves room for at least one substantial possibility consistent with permitting Smith to be tried on the tax conspiracy charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof showed that Smith engaged in a variety of entrepreneurial ventures, including buying and selling coins, antiques, posters, prints, stamps, collectibles, and real estate.  At trial, his own counsel described him as \"a hustler.\"   Smith conducted his affairs largely in cash and kept no records.  Of particular pertinence for present purposes, he had close business connections with Gary Dethlefs, a central figure in the marijuana conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the evidence and the jury's verdict are consistent with a finding that Dethlefs made enormous profits buying and selling marijuana.  Smith worked as the general manager of G &amp; A Development Corporation, a construction company owned by Dethlefs.  Smith had direct responsibility for the firm's land acquisitions.  He also teamed with Dethlefs to acquire restaurants, and he joined Dethlefs on at least one sojourn to Los Angeles in regard to a venture in the music recording industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his trial testimony, Smith swore that his involvement with Dethlefs extended only to legitimate businesses and that he had no knowledge that Dethlefs' seemingly inexhaustible wealth came from drugs.  He stated that he solicited Dethlefs to back his investments because Dethlefs \"had money.\"   Given the magnitude of Dethlefs' drug dealing and Smith's close ties with him, the jury certainly could have believed that marijuana trafficking kept Dethlefs' coffers full--and that Smith knew as much.  The jury, however, also could have concluded that Smith was not involved in trafficking per se, but simply helped to launder the proceeds of Dethlefs' operation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Such a conclusion would be consistent with both an acquittal on count 1 and a subsequent conviction on count 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the record does not conclusively establish that Smith intended to defraud the United States, but that is not the issue today.  What matters now is that, giving full effect to the jury's verdict, the record does not foreclose the scenario spelled out above.  Moreover, though the line for determining whether theories explaining a jury's acquittal are too farfetched to be given weight in the collateral estoppel calculus is inherently tenebrous, that imprecision poses no problem where, as here, the proffered explanation is a plausible one.  Much evidence in the record is consistent with both the jury's verdict and the appellants' participation in a conspiracy to defraud the IRS.  Smith's collateral estoppel claim therefore founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Morris' Collateral Estoppel Claim.   We are satisfied that Morris, too, failed to carry the burden of showing that his acquittal on the marijuana conspiracy charge necessarily decided his lack of involvement in the tax conspiracy.  The record leaves open the realistic possibility of a jury finding that he did not intend to distribute marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morris claims that he does construction work for a living.  He frequently works \"under the table\";  he accepts payment in cash for services rendered and does not report the income.  One witness testified that, between 1985 and 1992, he alone paid Morris $21,000 in cash for work done off the books.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Hesketh cooperated with the prosecution and testified at the first trial.  He admitted dealing drugs from 1985 through 1988.  During that period he bought large quantities of marijuana (as much as 100 pounds at a time) from Dethlefs.  He also testified that he both gave and sold marijuana to Morris (who worked for him on virtually a full-time basis in 1987 and 1988).  Morris built a chimney for Hesketh, remodeled the upper story of Hesketh's home, and constructed two buildings for D and S Moulding Company (a business that Hesketh controlled).  Hesketh always paid Morris in cash.  While the verdict indicates that the jurors turned down the government's theory that Morris purchased marijuana from Hesketh for resale, they nonetheless could have inferred knowledge on Morris' part that Hesketh's money came from marijuana sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if the jury thought that Morris, though aware of the source of Hesketh's funds, had no stake in the success of the marijuana-purveying enterprise, it would be obliged to return a \"not guilty\" verdict on count 1 of the indictment as drawn--but that verdict would not tell us anything of consequence about Morris' guilt or innocence vis-a-vis the tax conspiracy.  In all events, this scenario is sufficient (and sufficiently plausible) to overcome Morris' argument that collateral estoppel now prevents his trial on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the IRS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For the reasons we have discussed, neither double jeopardy nor collateral estoppel preclude the government from prosecuting the appellants on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States in the determination and collection of income taxes.  Consequently, the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss count 3 of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because these appeals do not involve any of the seven codefendants, we minimize further references to them in describing the indictment and ensuing trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Abney involved multiple prosecutions.  431 U.S. at 662, 97 S.Ct. at 2041-42.

Because these appeals, like Abney itself, involve the successive prosecution branch of the Double Jeopardy Clause, we have jurisdiction to hear and determine them prior to trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The closest count 1 comes to stating that the appellants conspired to defraud the IRS is its averment that they \"used cash, bank checks, and money orders to further the objectives of the conspiracy, to wit, the acquisition, receipt, storage, consignment and distribution of large amounts of marijuana, thereby deriving substantial cash proceeds.\"   But this allegation falls far short of specifying whether (and if so, how) the appellants conspired to launder drug proceeds and deprive the government of tax revenue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This point is driven home by a reading of count 3 of the indictment, which discusses in detail the conspirators' actions to hide the income that flowed their way, alleging, for example, that Morris and Smith used marijuana-generated cash to renovate and improve real property (a specie of money laundering that is not mentioned in count 1)</p>\n        <p>In fairness, we also note that count 3 contains some allegations tending to blur the distinction between the marijuana conspiracy and the tax conspiracy.  Thus, Count 3 accuses Morris and Smith of \"earn[ing] income by acquiring, receiving, possessing, storing, repackaging, transporting, consigning, entrusting, and distributing marijuana, and fail[ing] to report such sums to the Internal Revenue Service.\"   To the extent that such evidence is probative of the appellants' participation in the tax conspiracy, the government is free to introduce it in a subsequent trial, despite the previous acquittal.  See Dowling, 493 U.S. at 348, 110 S.Ct. at 672 (declining to extend the doctrine of collateral estoppel to require exclusion of relevant evidence \"simply because it relates to alleged criminal conduct for which a defendant has been acquitted\").  However, nothing in this opinion is intended to circumscribe the district court's discretion either in making in limine orders or in fashioning appropriate limiting instructions regarding how (if at all) evidence of the appellants' putative involvement in the marijuana conspiracy may now be used.
