Before  trial,  the district  court denied\r\n\nElmwood's  motion for  partial  summary judgment.

Background\r                                   II.  Background\r\n\n          The  facts of  the case  are not  in dispute.   Elmwood\r\n\nmanufactures and sells  thermostats.  Ionics  makes hot and  cold\r\n\nwater dispensers, which  it leases  to its customers.   On  three\r\n\nseparate occasions, Ionics purchased thermostats from Elmwood for\r\n\nuse in its water dispensers.1  Every  time Ionics made a purchase\r\n\nof  thermostats from Elmwood, it sent the latter a purchase order\r\n\nform which  contained, in small  type, various \"conditions.\"   Of\r\n\nthe20 conditions onthe order form,two areof particular relevance:\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Orders were placed in March, June, and September 1990.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n            18.    REMEDIES -- The  remedies provided\r\n            Buyer herein shall  be cumulative, and in\r\n            addition to any  other remedies  provided\r\n            by law or equity.   A waiver of  a breach\r\n            of   any   provision  hereof   shall  not\r\n            constitute a waiver of any  other breach.\r\n            The  laws of the  state shown  in Buyer's\r\n            address printed  on the masthead  of this\r\n            order  shall  apply  in the  construction\r\n            hereof.\r\n\n            19.    ACCEPTANCE  --  Acceptance  by the\r\n            Seller of  this order  shall be upon  the\r\n            terms and conditions set forth in items 1\r\n            to  17 inclusive,  and elsewhere  in this\r\n            order.   Said  order  can be  so accepted\r\n            only on  the exact  terms herein  and set\r\n            forth.  No terms  which are in any manner\r\n            additional  to  or  different from  those\r\n            herein set  forth shall become a part of,\r\n            alter or in any way control the terms and\r\n            conditions herein set forth.\r\n\n          Near  the time when  Ionics placed its  first order, it\r\n\nsent Elmwood a letter that it  sends to all of its new suppliers.\r\n\nThe letter states, in part:\r\n\n            The   information   preprinted,   written\r\n            and/or  typed  on our  purchase  order is\r\n            especially important  to us.   Should you\r\n            take   exception  to   this  information,\r\n            please  clearly express  any reservations\r\n            to us in writing.  If you do not, we will\r\n            assume  that  you  have  agreed   to  the\r\n            specified terms and that you will fulfill\r\n            your   obligations   according   to   our\r\n            purchase  order.   If necessary,  we will\r\n            change  your invoice and pay your invoice\r\n            according to our purchase order.\r\n\n          Following receipt  of each order, Elmwood  prepared and\r\n\nsent an  \"Acknowledgment\" form containing the  following language\r\n\nin small type:\r\n\n            THIS WILL ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT  OF BUYER'S\r\n            ORDER AND STATE  SELLER'S WILLINGNESS  TO\r\n            SELL THE GOODS ORDERED BUT ONLY UPON  THE\r\n            TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN AND\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n            ON   THE   REVERSE  SIDE   HEREOF   AS  A\r\n            COUNTEROFFER.   BUYER SHALL BE  DEEMED TO\r\n            HAVE ACCEPTED SUCH COUNTEROFFER UNLESS IT\r\n            IS  REJECTED IN  WRITING WITHIN  TEN (10)\r\n            DAYS  OF  THE  RECEIPT  HEREOF,  AND  ALL\r\n            SUBSEQUENT  ACTION  SHALL BE  PURSUANT TO\r\n            THE   TERMS   AND   CONDITIONS  OF   THIS\r\n            COUNTEROFFER  ONLY;   ANY  ADDITIONAL  OR\r\n            DIFFERENT  TERMS  ARE HEREBY  OBJECTED TO\r\n            AND SHALL NOT BE BINDING UPON THE PARTIES\r\n            UNLESS SPECIFICALLY AGREED TO  IN WRITING\r\n            BY SELLER.\r\n\n          Although  this passage refers  to a  \"counteroffer,\" we\r\n\nwish to emphasize  that this  language is not  controlling.   The\r\n\nform   on   which   the   language   appears   is   labelled   an\r\n\n\"Acknowledgment\"  and the  language  comes under  a heading  that\r\n\nreads \"Notice of Receipt of Order.\"  The form, taken  as a whole,\r\n\nappears  to contemplate  an order's  confirmation rather  than an\r\n\norder's rejection in the form of a counteroffer.\r\n\n          It  is undisputed that  the Acknowledgment was received\r\n\nprior  to the  arrival of  the shipment  of goods.   Although the\r\n\ndistrict court,  in its ruling  on the  summary judgment  motion,\r\n\nstates that \"with each  shipment of thermostats, Elmwood included\r\n\nan Acknowledgment Form,\" Order of the District  Court, August 23,\r\n\n1995, this statement cannot  reasonably be taken as a  finding in\r\n\nsupport of the  claim that  the Acknowledgment  and the  shipment\r\n\narrived together.   First, in its certification order,  the court\r\n\nstates that \"[t]he purchaser, after receiving the Acknowledgment,\r                                             \r\n\naccepted  delivery  of  the  goods  without  objection.\"    Order\r\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C.    1292(b), Nov. 6, 1995  (emphasis added).\r\n\nThis  language is  clearer  and more  precise  than the  previous\r\n\nstatement and suggests that  the former was simply a  poor choice\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nof phrasing.   Furthermore, Ionics has  not disputed the  arrival\r\n\ntime  of the  Acknowledgment.   In its  Memorandum in  Support of\r\n\nDefendant's Motion for  Partial Summary Judgment Elmwood  stated,\r\n\nunder the heading  of \"Statements of Undisputed Facts,\" that \"for\r\n\neach  of the  three  orders, Ionics  received the  Acknowledgment\r\n\nprior to receiving the  shipment of thermostats.\"  Memorandum  in\r\n\nSupport of Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, at 3.\r\n\nIn  its own memorandum, Ionics argued that there existed disputed\r\n\nissues of material  fact, but did not  contradict Elmwood's claim\r\n\nregarding  the   arrival  of   the  Acknowledgment  Form.     See\r                                                                           \r\n\nPlaintiff's  Memorandum   in   Support  of   its  Opposition   to\r\n\nDefendant's  Motion   for  Partial  Summary   Judgment  at  4-10.\r\n\nFurthermore,  in its appellate brief,  Ionics does not argue that\r\n\nthe time of  arrival of  the Acknowledgment Form  is in  dispute.\r\n\nIonics  repeats  language  from   the  district  court's  summary\r\n\njudgment ruling that \"with  each shipment of thermostats, Elmwood\r\n\nincluded an Acknowledgment Form,\" Appellee's Brief at 7, but does\r\n\nnot argue that the issue  is in dispute or confront  the language\r\n\nin Elmwood's brief which states that \"[i]t is undisputed that for\r\n\neach  of the  three  orders, Ionics  received the  Acknowledgment\r\n\nprior  to receiving  the shipment  of thermostats.\"   Appellant's\r\n\nBrief at 6.\r\n\n          As  we have  noted, the  Acknowledgment Form  expressed\r\n\nElmwood's  willingness  to   sell  thermostats   on  \"terms   and\r\n\nconditions\" that the  Form indicated were  listed on the  reverse\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nside.  Among the terms and conditions listed on the  back was the\r\n\nfollowing:\r\n\n            9. WARRANTY\r\n               All  goods   manufactured  by  Elmwood\r\n            Sensors, Inc. are  guaranteed to be  free\r\n            of  defects  in material  and workmanship\r\n            for a  period of ninety  (90) days  after\r\n            receipt  of  such   goods  by  Buyer   or\r\n            eighteen   months   from   the  date   of\r\n            manufacturer [sic] (as  evidenced by  the\r\n            manufacturer's   date   code),  whichever\r\n            shall be  longer.   THERE  IS NO  IMPLIED\r\n            WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND  NO OTHER\r\n            WARRANTY,  EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED,  EXCEPT\r\n            SUCH  AS IS  EXPRESSLY SET  FORTH HEREIN.\r\n            SELLER   WILL  NOT  BE   LIABLE  FOR  ANY\r\n            GENERAL,   CONSEQUENTIAL   OR  INCIDENTAL\r\n            DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY\r\n            DAMAGES  FROM LOSS  OF PROFITS,  FROM ANY\r\n            BREACH  OF  WARRANTY  OR FOR  NEGLIGENCE,\r\n            SELLER'S LIABILITY  AND BUYER'S EXCLUSIVE\r\n            REMEDY  BEING  EXPRESSLY  LIMITED TO  THE\r\n            REPAIR  OF  DEFECTIVE  GOODS  F.O.B.  THE\r\n            SHIPPING  POINT  INDICATED  ON  THE  FACE\r\n            HEREOF  OR THE REPAYMENT  OF THE PURCHASE\r\n            PRICE UPON THE RETURN OF THE GOODS OR THE\r\n            GRANTING  OF  A  REASONABLE ALLOWANCE  ON\r\n            ACCOUNT OF  ANY  DEFECTS, AS  SELLER  MAY\r\n            ELECT.\r\n\n          Neither party  disputes that they entered  into a valid\r\n\ncontract  and  neither  disputes  the  quantity   of  thermostats\r\n\npurchased,  the price paid, or  the manner and  time of delivery.\r\n\nThe only issue in dispute is the extent of Elmwood's liability.\r\n\n          In  summary, Ionics'  order  included language  stating\r\n\nthat  the contract  would be  governed exclusively  by  the terms\r\n\nincluded  on the purchase  order and that  all remedies available\r\n\nunder state law would  be available to Ionics.   In a  subsequent\r\n\nletter, Ionics added that Elmwood must indicate any objections to\r\n\nthese  conditions in writing.   Elmwood, in turn,  sent Ionics an\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nAcknowledgment stating that the contract was governed exclusively\r\n\nby the terms in the Acknowledgment, and Ionics was given ten days\r\n\nto reject this \"counteroffer.\"   Among the terms included  in the\r\n\nAcknowledgment is a  limitation on Elmwood's  liability.  As  the\r\n\ndistrict court  stated, \"the  terms are diametrically  opposed to\r\n\neach other on the issue of whether all warranties  implied by law\r\n\nwere  reserved or waived.\"   Order of the  District Court, August\r\n\n23, 1995.\r\n\n          We face, therefore,  a battle  of the forms.   This  is\r\n\npurely a  question of  law.   The dispute  turns  on whether  the\r\n\ncontract is governed  by the  language after  the comma  in    2-\r\n\n207(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code, according to the rule laid\r\n\ndown by this court in Roto-Lith, Ltd. v. F.P. Bartlett &amp; Co., 297\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 497 (1st Cir. 1962), or whether it is governed by subsection\r\n\n(3) of  the Code  provision, as  enacted  by both  Massachusetts,\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch. 106,   2-207  (1990 and 1996 Supp.), and Rhode\r\n\nIsland, R.I. Gen. Laws    6A-2-207 (1992).2  We find the  rule of\r\n\nRoto-Lith  to be in conflict  with the purposes  of section 2-207\r                   \r\n\nand, accordingly, we overrule  Roto-Lith and find that subsection\r                                                  \r\n\n(3) governs the contract.3   Analyzing the case under  section 2-\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  There  is   some  uncertainty   on  the  question   of  whether\r\nMassachusetts or Rhode Island  law governs.  We need  not address\r\nthis issue, however, because the two states have adopted versions\r\nof  section  2-207  of  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code  that  are\r\nvirtually equivalent.\r\n\n  Although panel  decisions of this court  are ordinarily binding\r\non  newly  constituted  panels,  that  rule does  not  obtain  in\r\ninstances where, as here, a departure is compelled by controlling\r\nauthority  (such as  the interpreted  statute  itself).

Legal Analysis\r                                 III.  Legal Analysis\r\n\n          Our analysis  begins with  the statute.   Section 2-207\r\n\nreads as follows:\r\n\n              2-207.   Additional Terms in Acceptance\r\n            or Confirmation\r\n\n            (1)  A definite and seasonable expression\r\n            of acceptance or  a written  confirmation\r\n            which  is sent  within a  reasonable time\r\n            operates as an  acceptance even though it\r\n            states terms additional  to or  different\r\n            from those offered or agreed upon, unless\r\n            acceptance is  expressly made conditional\r\n            on assent to the additional  or different\r\n            terms.\r\n\n            (2)   The  additional or  different terms\r\n            are  to be  construed  as  proposals  for\r\n            addition  to  the   contract.     Between\r\n            merchants  such terms become  part of the\r\n            contract unless:\r\n               (a)    the  offer expressly  limits\r\n               acceptance  to  the  terms  of  the\r\n               offer;\r\n               (b)  they materially alter it; or\r\n               (c)  notification  of objection  to\r\n               them has already  been given or  is\r\n               given  within   a  reasonable  time\r\n               after notice of them is received. \r\n\n            (3)    Conduct   by  both  parties  which\r\n            recognizes the existence of a contract is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthe  proposed overruling  opinion to  all  active members  of the\r\ncourt  prior  to publication  even  though the  need  to overrule\r\nprecedent is reasonably clear.  See, e.g., Wright v. Park, 5 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n586, 591 n.7 (1st  Cir. 1994); Trailer Marine Transport  Corp. v.\r                                                                        \r\nRivera  V zquez,  977  F.2d  1, 9  n.5  (1st  Cir.  1992).   This\r                         \r\nprocedure  is,  of  course, informal,  and  does  not  preclude a\r\nsuggestion of rehearing  en banc on any issue.   We have followed\r\nthat praxis here and can report that none of the active judges of\r\nthis  court  has  objected to  the  panel's  analysis  or to  its\r\nconclusion that Roto-Lith has  outlived its usefulness as circuit\r                                   \r\nprecedent.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n            sufficient  to  establish a  contract for\r\n            sale although the writings of the parties\r\n            do  not  otherwise establish  a contract.\r\n            In  such case the terms of the particular\r\n            contract consist of  those terms on which\r\n            the  writings  of   the  parties   agree,\r\n            together  with  any  supplementary  terms\r\n            incorporated  under any  other provisions\r\n            of this chapter.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 106,   2-207 (1990 and 1996 Supp.).\r\n\n          In  Roto-Lith,  Roto-Lith  sent  a  purchase  order  to\r                                 \r\n\nBartlett,  who responded  with  an  acknowledgment that  included\r\n\nlanguage purporting to limit Bartlett's liability.  Roto-Lith did\r\n\nnot object.  Roto-Lith, 297 F.2d at 498-99.  This court held that\r                                \r\n\n\"a  response which  states  a condition  materially altering  the\r\n\nobligation solely  to  the  disadvantage  of the  offeror  is  an\r\n\n'acceptance * * *  expressly * * * conditional  on assent to  the\r\n\nadditional *  * * terms.'\"   Id. at 500.   This holding  took the\r                                          \r\n\ncase outside of section 2-207 by applying the exception after the\r\n\ncomma in subsection  (1).  The court then reverted  to common law\r\n\nand concluded  that Roto-Lith \"accepted the  goods with knowledge\r\n\nof the  conditions specified in the  acknowledgment [and thereby]\r\n\nbecame bound.\"  Id. at 500.  In other words,  the Roto-Lith court\r                                                                     \r\n\nconcluded  that  the defendant's  acceptance  was conditional  on\r\n\nassent,   by  the  buyer,  to  the   new  terms  and,  therefore,\r\n\nconstituted  a counter  offer rather  than an  acceptance.   When\r\n\nRoto-Lith  accepted  the  goods   with  knowledge  of  Bartlett's\r\n\nconditions,  it  accepted the  counteroffer and  Bartlett's terms\r\n\ngoverned the contract.  Elmwood argues that Roto-Lith governs the\r                                                               \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ninstant   appeal,   implying   that  the   terms   of   Elmwood's\r\n\nacknowledgment govern.\r\n\n          Ionics claims that the instant  case is distinguishable\r\n\nbecause  in Roto-Lith \"the  seller's language limiting warranties\r                               \r\n\nimplied  at law was  proposed as an  addition to, but  was not in\r\n\nconflict  with, the explicit terms of  the buyer's form.  [In the\r\n\ninstant case] the explicit  terms of the parties'  forms conflict\r\n\nwith and reject each other.\"  Appellee's Brief at 21.\r\n\n          We do  not believe  that Ionics'  position sufficiently\r\n\ndistinguishes  Roto-Lith.   It  would  be  artificial to  enforce\r                                  \r\n\nlanguage  that  conflicts  with  background  legal   rules  while\r\n\nrefusing  to enforce  language  that conflicts  with the  express\r\n\nterms  of the contract.  Every contract is assumed to incorporate\r\n\nthe existing legal norms that  are in place.  It is  not required\r\n\nthat every contract explicitly spell out the governing law of the\r\n\njurisdiction.  Allowing  later forms  to govern  with respect  to\r\n\ndeviations  from the background rules but not deviations from the\r\n\nterms in  the contract  would imply  that only the  terms in  the\r\n\ncontract  could be relied upon.   Aside from  being an artificial\r\n\nand arbitrary distinction, such a  standard would, no doubt, lead\r\n\nparties  to include more of the background rules in their initial\r\n\nforms, making forms  longer and more  complicated.  Longer  forms\r\n\nwould  be more difficult and  time consuming to  read -- implying\r\n\nthat  even  fewer forms  would be  read  than under  the existing\r\n\nrules.  It is the failure of  firms to read their forms that  has\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nbrought this case before us, and we do not wish  to engender more\r\n\nof this type of litigation.\r\n\n          Our inquiry,  however, is  not complete.   Having found\r\n\nthat we cannot distinguish  this case from Roto-Lith, we  turn to\r                                                              \r\n\nthe Uniform  Commercial  Code, quoted  above.   A plain  language\r\n\nreading of section 2-207 suggests that subsection (3) governs the\r\n\ninstant  case.   Ionics sent  an initial  offer to  which Elmwood\r\n\nresponded with its \"Acknowledgment.\"   Thereafter, the conduct of\r\n\nthe parties established  the existence of a  contract as required\r\n\nby section 2-207(3).\r\n\n          Furthermore,  the case before  us is squarely addressed\r\n\nin comment 6, which states:\r\n\n            6.   If  no answer  is received  within a\r\n            reasonable  time  after additional  terms\r\n            are   proposed,  it  is   both  fair  and\r\n            commercially sound to  assume that  their\r\n            inclusion  has been  assented to.   Where\r\n            clauses on confirming forms sent  by both\r\n            parties  conflict[,]  each party  must be\r\n            assumed  to  object to  a  clause of  the\r\n            other   conflicting   with  one   on  the\r\n            confirmation  sent  by  himself.    As  a\r\n            result[,] the requirement  that there  be\r\n            notice of  objection  which is  found  in\r\n            subsection  (2) [of   2-207] is satisfied\r\n            and the  conflicting terms do  not become\r\n            part  of the contract.  The contract then\r\n            consists   of    the   terms   originally\r\n            expressly agreed  to, terms on  which the\r\n            confirmations  agree, and  terms supplied\r\n            by this Act.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch.  106,   2-207, Uniform Commercial  Code Comment\r\n\n6.  This  Comment addresses  precisely the facts  of the  instant\r\n\ncase.   Any  attempt at  distinguishing the  case before  us from\r\n\nsection 2-207 strikes us as disingenuous.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          We are faced, therefore, with a contradiction between a\r\n\nclear precedent of this court, Roto-Lith, which suggests that the\r                                                  \r\n\nlanguage after the comma in subsection (1) governs, and the clear\r\n\ndictates  of the  Uniform  Commercial Code,  which indicate  that\r\n\nsubsection (3) governs.  It  is our view that the two  cannot co-\r\n\nexist and  the case at  bar offers a graphic  illustration of the\r\n\nconflict.   We  have, therefore,  no choice  but to  overrule our\r\n\nprevious  decision in Roto-Lith, Ltd. v. F.P. Bartlett &amp; Co., 297\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 497 (1st  Cir. 1962).   Our decision brings this  circuit in\r\n\nline with the  majority view on  the subject and  puts to rest  a\r\n\ncase  that has  provoked considerable  criticism from  courts and\r\n\ncommentators and alike.4\r\n\n           We  hold, consistent  with section 2-207  and Official\r\n\nComment 6, that where  the terms in two forms  are contradictory,\r\n\neach  party is assumed to object to the other party's conflicting\r\n\nclause.   As a result, mere acceptance  of the goods by the buyer\r\n\nis  insufficient to infer consent to the seller's terms under the\r\n\nlanguage of  subsection (1).5  Nor  do such terms  become part of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  See, e.g.,  Step-Saver Data  Systems, Inc. v.

Elmwood  suggests that  \"a seller's  expressly conditional\r\n\nacknowledgment  constitutes  a counteroffer  where  it materially\r\n\nalters  the terms proposed by  the buyer, and  the seller's terms\r\n\ngovern the  contract between the  parties when the  buyer accepts\r\n\nand pays  for the goods.\"   Appellant's Brief at 12.   Under this\r\n\nview, section 2-207 would no longer apply to cases in which forms\r\n\nhave been exchanged and subsequent disputes reveal that the forms\r\n\nare contradictory.  That is, the last form would always govern.\r\n\n          The purpose  of section 2-207, as  stated in Roto-Lith,\r                                                                          \r\n\n\"was to modify the strict principle that a response not precisely\r\n\nin accordance with the offer was a rejection and a counteroffer.\"\r\n\nRoto-Lith,  297 F.2d at 500; see  also Dorton v. Collins &amp; Aikman\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp.,  453 F.2d  1161,  1165-66 (6th  Cir.  1972) (stating  that\r               \r\n\nsection  2-207 \"was  intended to  alter the  'ribbon-matching' or\r\n\n'mirror'  rule of  common  law,  under  which  the  terms  of  an\r\n\nacceptance  or confirmation were required to  be identical to the\r\n\nterms of the offer\").    Under the holding advocated  by Elmwood,\r\n\nvirtually any response that added to or altered the terms of  the\r\n\noffer would be  a rejection and a counteroffer.   We do not think\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nparty.\").\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nthat such a result is consistent with the intent of section 2-207\r\n\nand we believe it to be expressly contradicted by Comment 6.\r\n\n          Applied  to  this  case,   our  holding  leads  to  the\r\n\nconclusion  that the  contract is  governed by  section 2-207(3).\r\n\nSection 2-207(1) is inapplicable because Elmwood's acknowledgment\r\n\nis conditional on assent to the additional terms.  The additional\r\n\nterms do not become a part of the contract under section 2-207(2)\r\n\nbecause notification of objection  to conflicting terms was given\r\n\non  the order  form and  because the  new terms  materially alter\r\n\nthose  in the  offer.    Finally,  the  conduct  of  the  parties\r\n\ndemonstrates the existence of a  contract, as required by section\r\n\n2-207(3).   Thus, section 2-207(3)  applies and the  terms of the\r\n\ncontract are to be determined in accordance with that subsection.\r\n\n          We conclude, therefore, that section  2-207(3) prevails\r\n\nand  \"the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms\r\n\non which the  writings of  the parties agree,  together with  any\r\n\nsupplementary terms incorporated  under any  other provisions  of\r\n\nthis chapter.\"  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 106,   2-207(3).\r\n\n          The reality of modern commercial dealings, as this case\r\n\ndemonstrates, is that not all participants read their forms.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nJames J. White &amp; Robert S.

To  uphold Elmwood's view would not only\r\n\nfly  in the face  of Official Comment  6 to section  2-207 of the\r\n\nUniform Commercial Code, and the overall purpose of that section,\r\n\nit would also fly in the  face of good sense.  The sender  of the\r\n\nlast  form  (in  the  instant  case,  the  seller)  could  insert\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nvirtually any conditions it  chooses into the contract, including\r\n\nconditions  contrary to  those in  the initial  form.   The final\r\n\nform,  therefore, would give its sender the power to re-write the\r\n\ncontract.   Under our holding  today, we at  least ensure that  a\r\n\nparty will not be held to terms that are directly contrary to the\r\n\nterms it has included in its own form.  Rather than assuming that\r\n\na failure to object to the  offeree's conflicting terms indicates\r\n\nofferor's   assent  to  those  terms,  we  shall  make  the  more\r\n\nreasonable inference that  each party continues to  object to the\r\n\nother's contradictory terms.  We think  it too much to grant  the\r\n\nsecond form the power to contradict and override the terms in the\r\n\nfirst form.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n                         IV.

Ionics  makes hot and  cold\r\n\nwater dispensers, which  it leases  to its customers.   On  three\r\n\nseparate occasions, Ionics purchased thermostats from Elmwood for\r\n\nuse in its water dispensers.1  Every  time Ionics made a purchase\r\n\nof  thermostats from Elmwood, it sent the latter a purchase order\r\n\nform which  contained, in small  type, various \"conditions.\"   Of\r\n\nthe20 conditions onthe order form,two areof particular relevance:\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Orders were placed in March, June, and September 1990.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n            18.    REMEDIES -- The  remedies provided\r\n            Buyer herein shall  be cumulative, and in\r\n            addition to any  other remedies  provided\r\n            by law or equity.   A waiver of  a breach\r\n            of   any   provision  hereof   shall  not\r\n            constitute a waiver of any  other breach.\r\n            The  laws of the  state shown  in Buyer's\r\n            address printed  on the masthead  of this\r\n            order  shall  apply  in the  construction\r\n            hereof.\r\n\n            19.    ACCEPTANCE  --  Acceptance  by the\r\n            Seller of  this order  shall be upon  the\r\n            terms and conditions set forth in items 1\r\n            to  17 inclusive,  and elsewhere  in this\r\n            order.   Said  order  can be  so accepted\r\n            only on  the exact  terms herein  and set\r\n            forth.  No terms  which are in any manner\r\n            additional  to  or  different from  those\r\n            herein set  forth shall become a part of,\r\n            alter or in any way control the terms and\r\n            conditions herein set forth.\r\n\n          Near  the time when  Ionics placed its  first order, it\r\n\nsent Elmwood a letter that it  sends to all of its new suppliers.\r\n\nThe letter states, in part:\r\n\n            The   information   preprinted,   written\r\n            and/or  typed  on our  purchase  order is\r\n            especially important  to us.   Should you\r\n            take   exception  to   this  information,\r\n            please  clearly express  any reservations\r\n            to us in writing.  If you do not, we will\r\n            assume  that  you  have  agreed   to  the\r\n            specified terms and that you will fulfill\r\n            your   obligations   according   to   our\r\n            purchase  order.   If necessary,  we will\r\n            change  your invoice and pay your invoice\r\n            according to our purchase order.\r\n\n          Following receipt  of each order, Elmwood  prepared and\r\n\nsent an  \"Acknowledgment\" form containing the  following language\r\n\nin small type:\r\n\n            THIS WILL ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT  OF BUYER'S\r\n            ORDER AND STATE  SELLER'S WILLINGNESS  TO\r\n            SELL THE GOODS ORDERED BUT ONLY UPON  THE\r\n            TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN AND\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n            ON   THE   REVERSE  SIDE   HEREOF   AS  A\r\n            COUNTEROFFER.   BUYER SHALL BE  DEEMED TO\r\n            HAVE ACCEPTED SUCH COUNTEROFFER UNLESS IT\r\n            IS  REJECTED IN  WRITING WITHIN  TEN (10)\r\n            DAYS  OF  THE  RECEIPT  HEREOF,  AND  ALL\r\n            SUBSEQUENT  ACTION  SHALL BE  PURSUANT TO\r\n            THE   TERMS   AND   CONDITIONS  OF   THIS\r\n            COUNTEROFFER  ONLY;   ANY  ADDITIONAL  OR\r\n            DIFFERENT  TERMS  ARE HEREBY  OBJECTED TO\r\n            AND SHALL NOT BE BINDING UPON THE PARTIES\r\n            UNLESS SPECIFICALLY AGREED TO  IN WRITING\r\n            BY SELLER.\r\n\n          Although  this passage refers  to a  \"counteroffer,\" we\r\n\nwish to emphasize  that this  language is not  controlling.   The\r\n\nform   on   which   the   language   appears   is   labelled   an\r\n\n\"Acknowledgment\"  and the  language  comes under  a heading  that\r\n\nreads \"Notice of Receipt of Order.\"  The form, taken  as a whole,\r\n\nappears  to contemplate  an order's  confirmation rather  than an\r\n\norder's rejection in the form of a counteroffer.\r\n\n          It  is undisputed that  the Acknowledgment was received\r\n\nprior  to the  arrival of  the shipment  of goods.   Although the\r\n\ndistrict court,  in its ruling  on the  summary judgment  motion,\r\n\nstates that \"with each  shipment of thermostats, Elmwood included\r\n\nan Acknowledgment Form,\" Order of the District  Court, August 23,\r\n\n1995, this statement cannot  reasonably be taken as a  finding in\r\n\nsupport of the  claim that  the Acknowledgment  and the  shipment\r\n\narrived together.   First, in its certification order,  the court\r\n\nstates that \"[t]he purchaser, after receiving the Acknowledgment,\r                                             \r\n\naccepted  delivery  of  the  goods  without  objection.\"    Order\r\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C.    1292(b), Nov. 6, 1995  (emphasis added).\r\n\nThis  language is  clearer  and more  precise  than the  previous\r\n\nstatement and suggests that  the former was simply a  poor choice\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nof phrasing.   Furthermore, Ionics has  not disputed the  arrival\r\n\ntime  of the  Acknowledgment.   In its  Memorandum in  Support of\r\n\nDefendant's Motion for  Partial Summary Judgment Elmwood  stated,\r\n\nunder the heading  of \"Statements of Undisputed Facts,\" that \"for\r\n\neach  of the  three  orders, Ionics  received the  Acknowledgment\r\n\nprior to receiving the  shipment of thermostats.\"  Memorandum  in\r\n\nSupport of Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, at 3.\r\n\nIn  its own memorandum, Ionics argued that there existed disputed\r\n\nissues of material  fact, but did not  contradict Elmwood's claim\r\n\nregarding  the   arrival  of   the  Acknowledgment  Form.     See\r                                                                           \r\n\nPlaintiff's  Memorandum   in   Support  of   its  Opposition   to\r\n\nDefendant's  Motion   for  Partial  Summary   Judgment  at  4-10.\r\n\nFurthermore,  in its appellate brief,  Ionics does not argue that\r\n\nthe time of  arrival of  the Acknowledgment Form  is in  dispute.\r\n\nIonics  repeats  language  from   the  district  court's  summary\r\n\njudgment ruling that \"with  each shipment of thermostats, Elmwood\r\n\nincluded an Acknowledgment Form,\" Appellee's Brief at 7, but does\r\n\nnot argue that the issue  is in dispute or confront  the language\r\n\nin Elmwood's brief which states that \"[i]t is undisputed that for\r\n\neach  of the  three  orders, Ionics  received the  Acknowledgment\r\n\nprior  to receiving  the shipment  of thermostats.\"   Appellant's\r\n\nBrief at 6.\r\n\n          As  we have  noted, the  Acknowledgment Form  expressed\r\n\nElmwood's  willingness  to   sell  thermostats   on  \"terms   and\r\n\nconditions\" that the  Form indicated were  listed on the  reverse\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nside.  Among the terms and conditions listed on the  back was the\r\n\nfollowing:\r\n\n            9. WARRANTY\r\n               All  goods   manufactured  by  Elmwood\r\n            Sensors, Inc. are  guaranteed to be  free\r\n            of  defects  in material  and workmanship\r\n            for a  period of ninety  (90) days  after\r\n            receipt  of  such   goods  by  Buyer   or\r\n            eighteen   months   from   the  date   of\r\n            manufacturer [sic] (as  evidenced by  the\r\n            manufacturer's   date   code),  whichever\r\n            shall be  longer.   THERE  IS NO  IMPLIED\r\n            WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND  NO OTHER\r\n            WARRANTY,  EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED,  EXCEPT\r\n            SUCH  AS IS  EXPRESSLY SET  FORTH HEREIN.\r\n            SELLER   WILL  NOT  BE   LIABLE  FOR  ANY\r\n            GENERAL,   CONSEQUENTIAL   OR  INCIDENTAL\r\n            DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY\r\n            DAMAGES  FROM LOSS  OF PROFITS,  FROM ANY\r\n            BREACH  OF  WARRANTY  OR FOR  NEGLIGENCE,\r\n            SELLER'S LIABILITY  AND BUYER'S EXCLUSIVE\r\n            REMEDY  BEING  EXPRESSLY  LIMITED TO  THE\r\n            REPAIR  OF  DEFECTIVE  GOODS  F.O.B.  THE\r\n            SHIPPING  POINT  INDICATED  ON  THE  FACE\r\n            HEREOF  OR THE REPAYMENT  OF THE PURCHASE\r\n            PRICE UPON THE RETURN OF THE GOODS OR THE\r\n            GRANTING  OF  A  REASONABLE ALLOWANCE  ON\r\n            ACCOUNT OF  ANY  DEFECTS, AS  SELLER  MAY\r\n            ELECT.\r\n\n          Neither party  disputes that they entered  into a valid\r\n\ncontract  and  neither  disputes  the  quantity   of  thermostats\r\n\npurchased,  the price paid, or  the manner and  time of delivery.\r\n\nThe only issue in dispute is the extent of Elmwood's liability.\r\n\n          In  summary, Ionics'  order  included language  stating\r\n\nthat  the contract  would be  governed exclusively  by  the terms\r\n\nincluded  on the purchase  order and that  all remedies available\r\n\nunder state law would  be available to Ionics.   In a  subsequent\r\n\nletter, Ionics added that Elmwood must indicate any objections to\r\n\nthese  conditions in writing.   Elmwood, in turn,  sent Ionics an\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nAcknowledgment stating that the contract was governed exclusively\r\n\nby the terms in the Acknowledgment, and Ionics was given ten days\r\n\nto reject this \"counteroffer.\"   Among the terms included  in the\r\n\nAcknowledgment is a  limitation on Elmwood's  liability.  As  the\r\n\ndistrict court  stated, \"the  terms are diametrically  opposed to\r\n\neach other on the issue of whether all warranties  implied by law\r\n\nwere  reserved or waived.\"   Order of the  District Court, August\r\n\n23, 1995.\r\n\n          We face, therefore,  a battle  of the forms.   This  is\r\n\npurely a  question of  law.   The dispute  turns  on whether  the\r\n\ncontract is governed  by the  language after  the comma  in    2-\r\n\n207(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code, according to the rule laid\r\n\ndown by this court in Roto-Lith, Ltd. v. F.P. Bartlett &amp; Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"255814\"><a href=\"/opinion/255814/roto-lith-ltd-v-f-p-bartlett-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span>\r                                                                      \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1962), or whether it is governed by subsection\r\n\n(3) of  the Code  provision, as  enacted  by both  Massachusetts,\r\n\nMass.

Laws    6A-2-207 (1992).2  We find the  rule of\r\n\nRoto-Lith  to be in conflict  with the purposes  of section 2-207\r                   \r\n\nand, accordingly, we overrule  Roto-Lith and find that subsection\r                                                  \r\n\n(3) governs the contract.3   Analyzing the case under  section 2-\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  There  is   some  uncertainty   on  the  question   of  whether\r\nMassachusetts or Rhode Island  law governs.  We need  not address\r\nthis issue, however, because the two states have adopted versions\r\nof  section  2-207  of  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code  that  are\r\nvirtually equivalent.\r\n\n  Although panel  decisions of this court  are ordinarily binding\r\non  newly  constituted  panels,  that  rule does  not  obtain  in\r\ninstances where, as here, a departure is compelled by controlling\r\nauthority  (such as  the interpreted  statute  itself).

Additional Terms in Acceptance\r\n            or Confirmation\r\n\n            (1)  A definite and seasonable expression\r\n            of acceptance or  a written  confirmation\r\n            which  is sent  within a  reasonable time\r\n            operates as an  acceptance even though it\r\n            states terms additional  to or  different\r\n            from those offered or agreed upon, unless\r\n            acceptance is  expressly made conditional\r\n            on assent to the additional  or different\r\n            terms.\r\n\n            (2)   The  additional or  different terms\r\n            are  to be  construed  as  proposals  for\r\n            addition  to  the   contract.     Between\r\n            merchants  such terms become  part of the\r\n            contract unless:\r\n               (a)    the  offer expressly  limits\r\n               acceptance  to  the  terms  of  the\r\n               offer;\r\n               (b)  they materially alter it; or\r\n               (c)  notification  of objection  to\r\n               them has already  been given or  is\r\n               given  within   a  reasonable  time\r\n               after notice of them is received. \r\n\n            (3)    Conduct   by  both  parties  which\r\n            recognizes the existence of a contract is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthe  proposed overruling  opinion to  all  active members  of the\r\ncourt  prior  to publication  even  though the  need  to overrule\r\nprecedent is reasonably clear.

Gen. L. ch. 106,   2-207 (1990 and 1996 Supp.).\r\n\n          In  Roto-Lith,  Roto-Lith  sent  a  purchase  order  to\r                                 \r\n\nBartlett,  who responded  with  an  acknowledgment that  included\r\n\nlanguage purporting to limit Bartlett's liability.  Roto-Lith did\r\n\nnot object.  Roto-Lith, 297 F.2d at 498-99.  This court held that\r                                \r\n\n\"a  response which  states  a condition  materially altering  the\r\n\nobligation solely  to  the  disadvantage  of the  offeror  is  an\r\n\n'acceptance * * *  expressly * * * conditional  on assent to  the\r\n\nadditional *  * * terms.'\"   Id. at 500.   This holding  took the\r                                          \r\n\ncase outside of section 2-207 by applying the exception after the\r\n\ncomma in subsection  (1).  The court then reverted  to common law\r\n\nand concluded  that Roto-Lith \"accepted the  goods with knowledge\r\n\nof the  conditions specified in the  acknowledgment [and thereby]\r\n\nbecame bound.\"  Id. at 500.  In other words,  the Roto-Lith court\r                                                                     \r\n\nconcluded  that  the defendant's  acceptance  was conditional  on\r\n\nassent,   by  the  buyer,  to  the   new  terms  and,  therefore,\r\n\nconstituted  a counter  offer rather  than an  acceptance.   When\r\n\nRoto-Lith  accepted  the  goods   with  knowledge  of  Bartlett's\r\n\nconditions,  it  accepted the  counteroffer and  Bartlett's terms\r\n\ngoverned the contract.  Elmwood argues that Roto-Lith governs the\r                                                               \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ninstant   appeal,   implying   that  the   terms   of   Elmwood's\r\n\nacknowledgment govern.\r\n\n          Ionics claims that the instant  case is distinguishable\r\n\nbecause  in Roto-Lith \"the  seller's language limiting warranties\r                               \r\n\nimplied  at law was  proposed as an  addition to, but  was not in\r\n\nconflict  with, the explicit terms of  the buyer's form.  [In the\r\n\ninstant case] the explicit  terms of the parties'  forms conflict\r\n\nwith and reject each other.\"  Appellee's Brief at 21.\r\n\n          We do  not believe  that Ionics'  position sufficiently\r\n\ndistinguishes  Roto-Lith.   It  would  be  artificial to  enforce\r                                  \r\n\nlanguage  that  conflicts  with  background  legal   rules  while\r\n\nrefusing  to enforce  language  that conflicts  with the  express\r\n\nterms  of the contract.  Every contract is assumed to incorporate\r\n\nthe existing legal norms that  are in place.  It is  not required\r\n\nthat every contract explicitly spell out the governing law of the\r\n\njurisdiction.  Allowing  later forms  to govern  with respect  to\r\n\ndeviations  from the background rules but not deviations from the\r\n\nterms in  the contract  would imply  that only the  terms in  the\r\n\ncontract  could be relied upon.   Aside from  being an artificial\r\n\nand arbitrary distinction, such a  standard would, no doubt, lead\r\n\nparties  to include more of the background rules in their initial\r\n\nforms, making forms  longer and more  complicated.  Longer  forms\r\n\nwould  be more difficult and  time consuming to  read -- implying\r\n\nthat  even  fewer forms  would be  read  than under  the existing\r\n\nrules.  It is the failure of  firms to read their forms that  has\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nbrought this case before us, and we do not wish  to engender more\r\n\nof this type of litigation.\r\n\n          Our inquiry,  however, is  not complete.   Having found\r\n\nthat we cannot distinguish  this case from Roto-Lith, we  turn to\r                                                              \r\n\nthe Uniform  Commercial  Code, quoted  above.   A plain  language\r\n\nreading of section 2-207 suggests that subsection (3) governs the\r\n\ninstant  case.   Ionics sent  an initial  offer to  which Elmwood\r\n\nresponded with its \"Acknowledgment.\"   Thereafter, the conduct of\r\n\nthe parties established  the existence of a  contract as required\r\n\nby section 2-207(3).\r\n\n          Furthermore,  the case before  us is squarely addressed\r\n\nin comment 6, which states:\r\n\n            6.   If  no answer  is received  within a\r\n            reasonable  time  after additional  terms\r\n            are   proposed,  it  is   both  fair  and\r\n            commercially sound to  assume that  their\r\n            inclusion  has been  assented to.   Where\r\n            clauses on confirming forms sent  by both\r\n            parties  conflict[,]  each party  must be\r\n            assumed  to  object to  a  clause of  the\r\n            other   conflicting   with  one   on  the\r\n            confirmation  sent  by  himself.    As  a\r\n            result[,] the requirement  that there  be\r\n            notice of  objection  which is  found  in\r\n            subsection  (2) [of   2-207] is satisfied\r\n            and the  conflicting terms do  not become\r\n            part  of the contract.  The contract then\r\n            consists   of    the   terms   originally\r\n            expressly agreed  to, terms on  which the\r\n            confirmations  agree, and  terms supplied\r\n            by this Act.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch.  106,   2-207, Uniform Commercial  Code Comment\r\n\n6.  This  Comment addresses  precisely the facts  of the  instant\r\n\ncase.   Any  attempt at  distinguishing the  case before  us from\r\n\nsection 2-207 strikes us as disingenuous.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          We are faced, therefore, with a contradiction between a\r\n\nclear precedent of this court, Roto-Lith, which suggests that the\r                                                  \r\n\nlanguage after the comma in subsection (1) governs, and the clear\r\n\ndictates  of the  Uniform  Commercial Code,  which indicate  that\r\n\nsubsection (3) governs.  It  is our view that the two  cannot co-\r\n\nexist and  the case at  bar offers a graphic  illustration of the\r\n\nconflict.   We  have, therefore,  no choice  but to  overrule our\r\n\nprevious  decision in Roto-Lith, Ltd. v. F.P.

As a result, mere acceptance  of the goods by the buyer\r\n\nis  insufficient to infer consent to the seller's terms under the\r\n\nlanguage of  subsection (1).5  Nor  do such terms  become part of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  See, e.g.,  Step-Saver Data  Systems, Inc. v.

Under the holding advocated  by Elmwood,\r\n\nvirtually any response that added to or altered the terms of  the\r\n\noffer would be  a rejection and a counteroffer.   We do not think\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nparty.\").\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nthat such a result is consistent with the intent of section 2-207\r\n\nand we believe it to be expressly contradicted by Comment 6.\r\n\n          Applied  to  this  case,   our  holding  leads  to  the\r\n\nconclusion  that the  contract is  governed by  section 2-207(3).\r\n\nSection 2-207(1) is inapplicable because Elmwood's acknowledgment\r\n\nis conditional on assent to the additional terms.  The additional\r\n\nterms do not become a part of the contract under section 2-207(2)\r\n\nbecause notification of objection  to conflicting terms was given\r\n\non  the order  form and  because the  new terms  materially alter\r\n\nthose  in the  offer.    Finally,  the  conduct  of  the  parties\r\n\ndemonstrates the existence of a  contract, as required by section\r\n\n2-207(3).   Thus, section 2-207(3)  applies and the  terms of the\r\n\ncontract are to be determined in accordance with that subsection.\r\n\n          We conclude, therefore, that section  2-207(3) prevails\r\n\nand  \"the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms\r\n\non which the  writings of  the parties agree,  together with  any\r\n\nsupplementary terms incorporated  under any  other provisions  of\r\n\nthis chapter.\"  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 106,   2-207(3).\r\n\n          The reality of modern commercial dealings, as this case\r\n\ndemonstrates, is that not all participants read their forms.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nJames J. White &amp; Robert S.

To  uphold Elmwood's view would not only\r\n\nfly  in the face  of Official Comment  6 to section  2-207 of the\r\n\nUniform Commercial Code, and the overall purpose of that section,\r\n\nit would also fly in the  face of good sense.  The sender  of the\r\n\nlast  form  (in  the  instant  case,  the  seller)  could  insert\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nvirtually any conditions it  chooses into the contract, including\r\n\nconditions  contrary to  those in  the initial  form.   The final\r\n\nform,  therefore, would give its sender the power to re-write the\r\n\ncontract.   Under our holding  today, we at  least ensure that  a\r\n\nparty will not be held to terms that are directly contrary to the\r\n\nterms it has included in its own form.  Rather than assuming that\r\n\na failure to object to the  offeree's conflicting terms indicates\r\n\nofferor's   assent  to  those  terms,  we  shall  make  the  more\r\n\nreasonable inference that  each party continues to  object to the\r\n\nother's contradictory terms.  We think  it too much to grant  the\r\n\nsecond form the power to contradict and override the terms in the\r\n\nfirst form.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n                         IV.  Conclusion\r                                   IV.  Conclusion\r\n\n          For  the reasons  stated herein,  the district  court's\r\n\norder denying  Elmwood's motion  for partial summary  judgment is\r\n\naffirmed  and  the case  is remanded  to  the district  court for\r          affirmed                    remanded  \r                                              \r\n\nfurther proceedings.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n</pre>",
