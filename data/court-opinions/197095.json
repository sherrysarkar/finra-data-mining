These appeals  require us  to\r                    SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nrevisit the legal standard  which courts must apply to  resolve a\r\n\nclaim  that a  police  pursuit has  been  conducted in  a  manner\r\n\nantithetical  to  the  protections  afforded  by the  substantive\r\n\naspect of  the Due Process  Clause.   The question arises  in the\r\n\ncontext of a civil action brought against the City  of Boston and\r\n\ntwo of  its police  officers after  a motor vehicle  driven by  a\r\n\nsuspected  drug dealer fleeing from the police struck and injured\r\n\na  youthful pedestrian,  Marie Evans.   The  district court  took\r\n\nEvans' civil rights claims  from the jury, and Evans  now appeals\r\n\nboth the court's  direction of a verdict  in favor of the  police\r\n\nofficers  and its earlier grant  of summary judgment  in favor of\r\n\nthe  City.  At the same time,  the City cross-appeals from a jury\r\n\nverdict  in favor of Evans'  parents on a  related state-law tort\r\n\nclaim.  We affirm the judgment below in all respects.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We assess  the  facts  of  record  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to the plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Veranda Beach Club Ltd.\r                                                                           \r\n\nPartnership  v. Western Sur. Co.,  936 F.2d 1364,  1375 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1991) (elucidating  standard of  review  for directed  verdicts);\r\n\nGarside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990) (same\r                                    \r\n\nre  summary judgments).  No  further elaboration of  the facts is\r\n\nneeded for disposition of the cross-appeal.\r\n\n          The events  that fomented this lawsuit  occurred in the\r\n\ntwinkling  of an eye.   At approximately 6:00  p.m. on August 12,\r\n\n1992, officers  Terrace Avery  and John J.  Greene were  cruising\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthrough a  residential neighborhood in the  Dorchester section of\r\n\nBoston.  They spotted suspicious  activity at the intersection of\r\n\nNixon  and  Centre Streets:   an  individual  who appeared  to be\r\n\nstartled at their  presence yelled excitedly,  threw a paper  bag\r\n\nthrough the open window of a parked Oldsmobile,  and vaulted into\r\n\nthe  front passenger seat.  The driver immediately headed west on\r\n\nCentre St. at 20-25 m.p.h.  Greene decided to stop the automobile\r\n\nand detain  its occupants.  He  executed a U-turn, set  out after\r\n\nthe  Oldsmobile,  and activated  his  siren  and wig-wag  lights.\r\n\nInstead of stopping, the suspects' car accelerated.  The officers\r\n\ntook up the  chase in  earnest, travelling at  roughly 45  m.p.h.\r\n\nWhen  the  officers  observed  the occupants  of  the  Oldsmobile\r\n\nplacing small items in  their mouths and passing  a jug back  and\r\n\nforth, they concluded that the suspects were swallowing potential\r\n\nevidence.\r\n\n          As the Oldsmobile approached  Codman Square   a complex\r\n\nintersection at  which Centre  St., Washington St.,  Norfolk St.,\r\n\nand Talbot Ave. meet    it crossed to the wrong side of the road,\r\n\npassed three  cars waiting  at a  red light,  and turned  left on\r\n\nWashington St., travelling  as fast  as 50 m.p.h.   The  officers\r\n\nremained  close  behind.    Approximately 300  feet  from  Codman\r\n\nSquare, the  suspects' vehicle struck a  ten-year-old girl, Marie\r\n\nEvans, who was attempting to cross Washington St.  Greene stopped\r\n\nhis car and  Avery alighted  to assist the  victim.  Greene  then\r\n\ncontinued his pursuit  of the  Oldsmobile.   The entire  incident\r\n\nlasted no more than two minutes.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          The plaintiffs'  evidence shows that traffic  was heavy\r\n\nat  the  time of  the chase  and  that numerous  pedestrians were\r\n\nabout.   Both Greene and  Avery were familiar  with Codman Square\r\n\nand knew that it was a busy shopping venue adjacent  to a densely\r\n\npopulated residential  area.   They  also  knew that  Centre  St.\r\n\naffords limited visibility of the Codman Square intersection.\r\n\n          Marie Evans sued the  officers pursuant to 42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1983 (1994); she sued the City  pursuant to the same statute; and\r\n\nshe and her parents, Muriel and Billy Evans, sued the  City under\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch. 258,   2  (1988).1  The district court (Young,\r\n\nU.S.D.J.) granted summary judgment in favor of the City on Evans'\r\n\nsection  1983 claim.  Ruling ore tenus, the court determined that\r                                                \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The statute provides in relevant part:\r\n\n               Public  employers  shall  be liable  for\r\n          injury or loss of property or personal injury\r\n          or death caused by the negligent or  wrongful\r\n          act or omission of  any public employee while\r\n          acting  within  the scope  of  his office  or\r\n          employment,  in  the same  manner and  to the\r\n          same  extent  as a  private  individual under\r\n          like   circumstances,   except  that   public\r\n          employers  shall  not be  liable  .  . .  for\r\n          punitive damages or for any amount in  excess\r\n          of  one   hundred  thousand  dollars.     The\r\n          remedies  provided by  this chapter  shall be\r\n          exclusive   of  any  other  civil  action  or\r\n          proceeding  by  reason  of the  same  subject\r\n          matter  against the  public employer  or, the\r\n          public  employee .  .  .  whose negligent  or\r\n          wrongful act  or omission gave  rise to  such\r\n          claim,  and no  such  public employee  . .  .\r\n          shall  be liable  for any  injury or  loss of\r\n          property or  personal injury or  death caused\r\n          by his  negligent or wrongful act or omission\r\n          while  acting within the  scope of his office\r\n          or employment; . . . .\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 258,   2 (1988).\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthe plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence sufficient to prove a\r\n\npolicy or  custom of deliberate indifference  attributable to the\r\n\nCity.    The  parties  thereafter  consented  to  trial before  a\r\n\nmagistrate judge.  See 28 U.S.C.   636(c) (1994); Fed. R. Civ. P.\r                                \r\n\n73(a).  At the  conclusion of the evidence, the  court (Collings,\r\n\nU.S.M.J.) took the remaining section 1983 claim from the jury and\r\n\ngranted  the officers' motions for  judgment as a  matter of law.\r\n\nSee Evans v. Avery, 897  F. Supp. 21 (D.  Mass. 1995).  The  jury\r                            \r\n\nthen considered the  pendent claims and awarded  damages to Evans\r\n\nand  each of  her parents  in  the amount  of  $100,000 (the  per\r\n\nclaimant maximum  allowable under state  law, see supra  note 1).\r                                                                 \r\n\nThese appeals followed.\r\n\nII.  THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE OFFICERS\r          II.  THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE OFFICERS\r\n\n          Marie Evans asserts that the nisi prius  court erred in\r\n\ndirecting  a verdict for the police officers.  She argues, in the\r\n\nalternative, that the court applied the wrong legal standard, and\r\n\nthat, whatever legal standard obtains, the evidence established a\r\n\njury question  as to whether  the officers' conduct  violated her\r\n\nright to substantive due process.\r\n\n          Section 1983 supplies a private right of action against\r\n\na  person  who, under  color of  state  law, deprives  another of\r\n\nrights secured by  the Constitution  or by federal  law.   Evans'\r\n\nmishap involved  neither physical  contact with a  police officer\r\n\nnor  police action  directed at  her.   In  short, it  was not  a\r\n\nseizure  and it  was therefore  not in  derogation of  her Fourth\r\n\nAmendment  rights.  See Brower  v. County of  Inyo, 489 U.S. 593,\r                                                            \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n596-97  (1989) (distinguishing  between  police  action  directed\r\n\ntoward  producing  a particular  result  and  police action  that\r\n\nhappens  to  cause  an  unintended, if  foreseeable,  result  and\r\n\nholding  that only the former  can constitute a seizure); Landol-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRivera v. Cruz Cosme, 906  F.2d 791, 796 (1st Cir. 1990)  (\"It is\r                              \r\n\nintervention directed at a specific individual that furnishes the\r\n\nbasis  for  a  Fourth  Amendment claim.\").    Nevertheless,  even\r\n\noutside the  context of  a seizure, appellate  courts have  noted\r\n\nthat  a person  injured  as a  result  of police  misconduct  may\r\n\nprosecute  a substantive  due process  claim under  section 1983.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Sinaloa Lake Owners Ass'n v.  City of Simi Valley, 882\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 1398, 1408 n.10 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1016\r                                                            \r\n\n(1990);  see  also  Landol-Rivera,  906  F.2d  at  796  (assuming\r                                           \r\n\nproposition).   The initial  question that confronts  us concerns\r\n\nthe  legal standard  by  which the  officers'  conduct should  be\r\n\njudged in such instances.\r\n\n          We begin  with an  historical perspective.   In Landol-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRivera  we ruled  that police  officers who  were engaged  in hot\r                \r\n\npursuit  of  a  suspect  could  not  be  held  liable  under  the\r\n\nsubstantive  aspect of the Due Process Clause for the shooting of\r\n\na hostage.    906 F.2d  at 798.   We  premised that  ruling on  a\r\n\ndetermination  that  the  officers'  conduct did  not  reflect  a\r\n\nreckless  or callous indifference  to the hostage's  rights.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at  796-98.   Two  things  about  this  articulation of  the\r             \r\n\napplicable legal standard  are noteworthy.   In the first  place,\r\n\nour  use of the \"deliberate indifference\" test did not broach new\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nground,   but,   rather,  reflected   a   fairly  straightforward\r\n\napplication  of our earlier holding in Germany v. Vance, 868 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n9 (1st Cir. 1989), in  which we posited that reckless or  callous\r\n\nindifference to  an individual's rights is  a necessary predicate\r\n\nto  triggering the  substantive  protections of  the Due  Process\r\n\nClause.   See id. at 17-19.2   In the second place, Landol-Rivera\r                                                                           \r\n\ndid  not  presume to  undertake a  full  formulation of  the test\r\n\napplicable  to  substantive due  process  claims  in creation  of\r\n\ndanger cases;  instead, the court went only  as far as was needed\r\n\nto show the infirmity of the particular claim before it.3\r\n\n          After  this court  decided Landol-Rivera,  the Justices\r                                                            \r\n\nrevisited the jurisprudence of substantive due process in Collins\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986).   There,\r                                            \r\nthe Court held that mere negligence is insufficient  to implicate\r\nthe  substantive protections of  the Due Process  Clause but left\r\nopen  the question  of  whether something  less than  intentional\r\nconduct might be enough to trigger those protections.  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n334 n.3.\r\n\n     3In Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 582 (1st\r                                                   \r\nCir.  1989), we  upheld a  section 1983  substantive due  process\r\nclaim  under  the \"reckless  or  callous  indifference\" standard.\r\nThere, four  armed plainclothes police officers  approached a car\r\noccupied by a young couple admiring  the view at a secluded spot.\r\nWhen the swain saw  the unidentified men, he started his  car and\r\nbegan to drive away.

See  Lewis   v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSacramento County,      F.3d    ,      (9th Cir.  1996) [1996  WL\r                           \r\n\n577835 at  *5] (holding that deliberate  indifference or reckless\r\n\ndisregard  \"is the minimum required to sustain  a   1983 claim in\r\n\nthe context of a high-speed police pursuit\").\r\n\n          We  are persuaded that the majority view of the minimum\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nthreshold in cases like  this is correct.4  Accordingly,  we hold\r\n\nthat  police  officers'  deliberate indifference  to  a  victim's\r\n\nrights,  standing alone,  is  not a  sufficient  predicate for  a\r\n\nsubstantive  due process claim in a police pursuit case.  Rather,\r\n\nin such a  case, the plaintiff must also show  that the officers'\r\n\nconduct shocks the conscience.  Though that benchmark is mandated\r\n\nfor  creation  of  danger  cases  under the  fairest  reading  of\r\n\nCollins,  we add that  it is particularly  appropriate to measure\r                 \r\n\npolice  pursuits  in that  way.   Police  chases  are not  only a\r\n\nnecessary concomitant of maintaining order in our modern society,\r\n\nbut  they are also inherently  hazardous.  By  their very nature,\r\n\nthey  inevitably  create  some  risk  of  injury  to  bystanders.\r\n\nOfficers must decide the balance between law enforcement and risk\r\n\nto public  safety quickly and while  under considerable pressure.\r\n\nIn such circumstances, permitting the Due Process Clause to serve\r\n\nas a surrogate  for state tort law would hamstring  the police in\r\n\ntheir performance of vital duties.\r\n\n          We   think,  moreover,  that   this  standard   is  not\r\n\ninconsistent with, but is  merely a refinement of, Landol-Rivera.\r                                                                          \r\n\nAs  in Landol-Rivera, a plaintiff  is still required  to show the\r                              \r\n\npolice  officers' deliberate  indifference  to his  rights.   The\r\n\nplaintiff in Landol-Rivera could not clear this hurdle, so we had\r                                    \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4We refuse to follow Lewis because we believe that the panel\r                                         \r\npaid insufficient attention both to Collins and to the legitimate\r                                                     \r\ndemands of law enforcement when it  asserted, without engaging in\r\nany analysis, that \"deliberate indifference is always sufficient\"\r\nto  maintain  a  section  1983 substantive  due  process  action.\r\nLewis,     F.3d at     [1996 WL 577835 at *5].\r               \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nno  occasion to  explore whether any  further hurdle  blocked his\r\n\npath.5  Today, we move forward and hold that in order for a high-\r\n\nspeed  police pursuit  to  intrude upon  substantive due  process\r\n\nprotections,  the  officers'  conduct  must  not   only  manifest\r\n\ndeliberate indifference to the  plaintiff's rights, but must also\r\n\nshock the conscience.\r\n\n          Having clarified the applicable legal standard, we need\r\n\nnot tarry.   The evidence of record here, taken in the light most\r\n\nsalutary  to  Evans'  case,  does  not  satisfy  the  \"shock  the\r\n\nconscience\"  test.  The chase  was brief in  duration, lasting no\r\n\nmore  than  two minutes.   It  covered about  half  a mile.   The\r\n\nvehicles'  speeds never exceeded 50 m.p.h.  The officers had good\r\n\ncause  to believe that the  suspects were trafficking in cocaine.\r\n\nThough  Evans is  not  bereft of  talking  points    the  pursuit\r\n\noccurred in a densely  populated residential area at a  time when\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Even if, as Evans  urges, Landol-Rivera announced a broadly\r                                                       \r\napplicable rule to the effect that deliberate indifference is the\r\nbe-all in creation of danger cases   a proposition that we do not\r\naccept     Evans  would not  be  helped.    While under  ordinary\r\ncircumstances we  would be bound to follow  a predecessor panel's\r\nlead,  see, e.g., Jusino  v. Zayas, 875  F.2d 986,  993 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n1989)  (explaining   that  in   a   multi-panel  circuit,   newly\r\nconstituted panels customarily are bound by prior panel decisions\r\nclosely in  point), there is  a well-recognized exception  to the\r\nrule for   situations  in which  a panel  opinion is  undercut by\r\ncontrolling authority, subsequently announced.  See, e.g., Stella\r                                                                           \r\nv. Kelley,  63 F.3d 71,  74 (1st Cir.  1995) (refusing  to follow\r                   \r\nUnwin v.

If Landol-Rivera\r                                                                           \r\nwere to be read in the manner urged by Evans, the Supreme Court's\r\nsubsequent decision  in Collins  would require us  to invoke  the\r                                         \r\nexception here.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\npeople  would likely be ambling  about, and the  officers did not\r\n\nseriously consider  alternatives to  hot pursuit    these points,\r\n\ntaken  most favorably to  Evans, add up to  no more than possible\r\n\nnegligence.  Considering the totality of the circumstances, we do\r\n\nnot believe  that  either the  officers' decision  to pursue  the\r\n\napparent  perpetrators  of a  serious  offense  or their  actions\r\n\nduring  the chase  were so raw  as to  shock the  conscience of a\r\n\nreasonable factfinder.\r\n\n          A  comparison of  the facts  of this  case to  those of\r\n\nother police pursuit  cases in which  the officers' behavior  has\r\n\nbeen held not  to shock the conscience  fortifies our conclusion.\r\n\nFor example, Fagan involved a lengthy pursuit at speeds up to  80\r                            \r\n\nm.p.h.  through a plethora of red lights.   See Fagan, 22 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n1299-1300.  Similarly, Temkin, 945 F.2d at 718, involved a police\r                                       \r\n\nofficer who pursued an individual suspected of stealing $17 worth\r\n\nof gasoline  at speeds  up to  105 m.p.h.  on a  narrow, two-lane\r\n\nhighway, with the  result that  both the police  cruiser and  the\r\n\npursued vehicle  struck the plaintiff.   The Fourth  Circuit held\r\n\nthat  the officer's  conduct,  \"while disturbing  and lacking  in\r\n\njudgment,\"  did  not   transgress  the  \"shock   the  conscience\"\r\n\nstandard.   Id. at  723.   The actions of  the officers  in those\r                         \r\n\ncases  were far more egregious than the actions of officers Avery\r\n\nand  Greene.   Although the  \"shock the  conscience\" test  is not\r\n\nmathematically precise, the imprecision occurs at the edges   and\r\n\nthis case, fairly viewed, does not present a close call.\r\n\n          To  sum up, \"shock the conscience\" is the standard that\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nguides our decision, and the conduct of officers Avery and Greene\r\n\nwhen measured  against that benchmark is  manifestly insufficient\r\n\nto  support a substantive due process claim.  We therefore reject\r\n\nMarie Evans' principal assignment of error.\r\n\nIII.  THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE CITY\r          III.  THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE CITY\r\n\n          Evans  next argues  that  the district  court erred  in\r\n\ngranting summary judgment on  her section 1983 claim  against the\r\n\nCity of Boston.   She asserts that the City  exhibited deliberate\r\n\nindifference  to individual  rights both  through its  failure to\r\n\nmonitor  police pursuits  and  through its  failure to  supervise\r\n\npolice officers involved  in such  pursuits.  We  need not  probe\r\n\nEvans'  charge that the City's policies  were inadequate in these\r\n\nrespects.  As we  explain below, the fact  that Avery and  Greene\r\n\ndid not violate Evans' constitutional rights means  that the City\r\n\nis not liable to her under section 1983.\r\n\n          This  result  is  compelled   by  the  Supreme  Court's\r\n\ndecision in  City of Los  Angeles v. Heller, 475  U.S. 796 (1986)\r                                                     \r\n\n(per curiam).   In that case, the plaintiff sued a police officer\r\n\nfor making an  arrest with excessive  force and without  probable\r\n\ncause;  he  also sued  the officer's  employer,  the City  of Los\r\n\nAngeles, for  promulgating a constitutionally deficient policy in\r\n\nregard to police officers' use of force.  The jury  found for the\r\n\nofficer but against the municipality.  The district court entered\r\n\njudgment for the  gendarme but  overrode the second  part of  the\r\n\njury's verdict and  dismissed the  claim against the  city.   The\r\n\ncourt  of appeals  reversed the  order of  dismissal but  did not\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\ndisturb  the  judgment that  had  been entered  in  the officer's\r\n\nfavor.   See  Heller v.  Bushey, 759  F.2d 1371,  1376  (9th Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1985).  The city then appealed.  The Supreme Court reinstated the\r\n\ndismissal, declaring that it had never\r\n\n          authorize[d]  the award of  damages against a\r\n          municipal corporation based on the actions of\r\n          one of its officers when in fact the jury has\r\n          concluded  that  the  officer   inflicted  no\r\n          constitutional  harm.     If  a  person   has\r\n          suffered  no  constitutional  injury  at  the\r\n          hands  of the individual  police officer, the\r\n          fact that the departmental  regulations might\r\n          have authorized the  use of  constitutionally\r                                   \r\n          excessive force is quite beside the point.\r\n\nHeller, 475 U.S. at 799 (emphasis in original).\r                \r\n\n          While Heller  provides a durable basis  for determining\r                                \r\n\nthat  a municipality cannot be  liable under section  1983 for an\r\n\ninadequate public  safety policy in  a situation where,  as here,\r\n\nthe  officers whose  actions actually caused  the harm  have been\r\n\nexonerated at trial,  we note that a  panel of the  Third Circuit\r\n\nfound Heller inapplicable in a case much like this one.  In Fagan\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Evans invites us  to adopt this analysis.\r                               \r\n\nWe decline the invitation because we believe that the Fagan panel\r                                                                     \r\n\nimproperly applied the Supreme Court's teachings.\r\n\n          In Collins, the Court emphasized that\r                              \r\n\n          proper analysis requires  us to separate  two\r\n          different  issues  when  a     1983 claim  is\r\n          asserted against a municipality:  (1) whether\r\n          plaintiff's    harm    was   caused    by   a\r\n          constitutional  violation,  and  (2)  if  so,\r\n          whether  the  city  is  responsible  for that\r\n          violation.\r\n\nCollins,  503 U.S.  at  120.    The  Fagan  panel  described  the\r                                                    \r\n\n\"deliberate  indifference\" test  as  a \"different  theor[y]\"  for\r\n\nmunicipal  liability,  22  F.3d  at  1292,  but  the  \"deliberate\r\n\nindifference\"  test is not an independent theory at all.  Rather,\r\n\ndeliberate indifference  is merely an articulation  of the second\r\n\nprong of the  Collins framework, adapted  to \"policy and  custom\"\r                               \r\n\ncases.   In treating it  as a  separate theory,  the Fagan  panel\r                                                                    \r\n\nignored the first segment of the framework:  the requirement that\r\n\nthe  plaintiff's harm  be caused  by a  constitutional violation.\r\n\nSee  Thompson v.

THE CROSS-APPEAL\r          IV.  THE CROSS-APPEAL\r\n\n          The City of Boston appeals the jury's verdicts for loss\r\n\nof  consortium in favor of  Muriel and Billy  Evans (Marie Evans'\r\n\nparents).  It advances a single isthmian ground in support of its\r\n\ncross-appeal, arguing that the trial court erred in formulating a\r\n\njury instruction.\r\n\n          We  frame the  assignment of  error.   Over the  City's\r\n\nobjection,  the lower  court instructed the  jury that  state law\r\n\nlimited  the damages  that  could be  awarded  on each  claim  to\r\n\n$100,000.    See  supra  note  1.    The  City  argues  that this\r                                 \r\n\ninstruction was  unfairly prejudicial inasmuch as  it \"caused the\r\n\njury  to decide the  amount of damages  on emotion.\"   The City's\r\n\npremise is that, once the jury  knew of the cap, it realized that\r\n\nit  could  not fully  compensate  Marie Evans  for  her extremely\r\n\nsevere  injuries    and   therefore  decided  to  circumvent  the\r\n\nstatutory impediment by remunerating Marie's family as generously\r\n\nas possible.7\r\n\n          This   asseveration   lacks   merit.      Neither   the\r\n\nMassachusetts statute  nor the cases discussing  it prohibit such\r\n\nan  instruction, and the City cites no case from any jurisdiction\r\n\nwhich holds that in  such circumstances a trial court  abuses its\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7Marie Evans presented testimony indicating that her damages\r\nmay  have totalled as much  as $2,000,000.   The jury, apparently\r\nheedful of the magistrate's instructions concerning the statutory\r\ncap,  awarded her  $100,000.   The  City  has not  appealed  that\r\nverdict.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\ndiscretion  by informing a jury  of a statutory  cap on damages.8\r\n\nTo  the contrary, the cases upon which  the City relies stand for\r\n\nnothing more than  the proposition  that a trial  court does  not\r\n\nabuse its  discretion in refusing  to inform the  jury of such  a\r\n\nlimit.   See, e.g.,   Thompson  v. Sanford,  663 S.W.2d  932, 935\r                                                    \r\n\n(Ark.  1984); State  v. Bouras,  423 N.E.2d  741, 744  (Ind. App.\r                                        \r\n\n1981).\r\n\n          The wisdom  of telling  a jury about  such a  statutory\r\n\nlimitation is  debatable, and we  do not recommend  the practice.\r\n\nStill,  we customarily  cede wide discretion  to trial  courts to\r\n\nfashion jury instructions as  they see fit, see United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHoulihan,  92  F.3d  1271,  1299  n.31  (1st  Cir. 1966);  Putnam\r                                                                           \r\n\nResources  v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 462  (1st Cir. 1992), and we\r                               \r\n\nsee no reason to second-guess the court in this instance.\r\n\n          This conclusion is reinforced by other incidents of the\r\n\ncase at hand.  For one thing, the awards to the parents are amply\r\n\nsupported by  evidence in the  record   and  almost none  of this\r\n\nevidence  has  been  contradicted.    For  another  thing,  after\r\n\nproperly  instructing  the  jurors  on loss  of  consortium,  the\r\n\nmagistrate  told them  that \"[t]he  claims for  Muriel and  Billy\r\n\nEvans for loss of consortium are  separate claims and each is  to\r\n\nbe judged separately.\"  Jurors are presumed to follow the court's\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8This  is not a case like Sasaki  v. Class, 92 F.3d 232 (4th\r                                                         \r\nCir. 1996), in which the trial court, though forbidden by statute\r\nfrom  informing the jury of a cap on damages, nonetheless allowed\r\ncounsel to do so.  See id.  at 235-37 (remanding for a new  trial\r                                    \r\ndue  to  a violation  of  42 U.S.C.     1981a(c)(2)).   Here, the\r\nMassachusetts  legislature wrote a statute that is silent on this\r\npoint, and we decline to speak for it.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ninstructions,  see Houlihan,  92 F.3d at  1287; United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993,  999 (1st Cir. 1995), and the City has\r                      \r\n\nnot   offered  sufficient   justification  for   overcoming  this\r\n\npresumption.  In  the last  analysis, the City's  claim that  the\r\n\nmere mention of the statutory cap inspired the jury to ignore the\r\n\ncharge  and   instead  do   rough  remedial  justice   is  wholly\r\n\nspeculative.\r\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go  no further.   In a police pursuit  case not\r\n\ninvolving a seizure, the officers may be held liable on the basis\r\n\nof  substantive due process only if their actions (whether or not\r\n\nreckless or deliberately indifferent  to public safety) shock the\r\n\nconscience.   Here, Marie Evans'  injuries are not  the result of\r\n\nconscience-shocking  conduct on  the  part of  officers Avery  or\r\n\nGreene.  Section 1983  therefore provides no remedy against  them\r\n\n(or against the City of Boston, for that matter).9\r\n\n          No error appearing, the judgment below will be\r\n\nAffirmed.  All parties shall bear their own costs.\r          Affirmed.  All parties shall bear their own costs.\r                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9We emphasize that we are asked  to determine as a matter of\r\nfederal  law only whether Marie  Evans has a constitutional right\r\nto recover damages under  the Due Process Clause.   The questions\r\nof whether  or to what extent she may maintain a suit under state\r\ntort law must  be answered according  to that body  of law.   The\r\nCommonwealth  of  Massachusetts  has  chosen to  provide  only  a\r\nlimited tort remedy,  and, though  that choice has  a very  harsh\r\nresult  here,  we must  recognize the  state's suzerainty  in its\r\nlegitimate province.   It is not the  function of a federal court\r\nto  force state tort law into unfamiliar contours under the guise\r\nof constitutional interpretation.\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n",

The question arises in the context of a civil action brought against the City of Boston and two of its police officers after a motor vehicle driven by a suspected drug dealer fleeing from the police struck and injured a youthful pedestrian, Marie Evans. The district court took Evans' civil rights claims from the jury, and Evans now appeals both the court's direction of a verdict in favor of the police officers and its earlier grant of summary judgment in favor of the City. At the same time, the City cross-appeals from a jury verdict in favor of Evans' parents on a related state-law tort claim. We affirm the judgment below in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assess the facts of record in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. See, e.g., Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1375 (1st Cir. 1991) (elucidating standard of review for directed verdicts); Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990) (same re summary judgments). No further elaboration of the facts is needed for disposition of the cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The events that fomented this lawsuit occurred in the twinkling of an eye. At approximately 6:00 p.m. on August 12, 1992, officers Terrace Avery and John J. Greene were cruising through a residential neighborhood in the Dorchester section of Boston. They spotted suspicious activity at the intersection of Nixon and Centre Streets: an individual who appeared to be startled at their presence yelled excitedly, threw a paper bag through the open window of a parked Oldsmobile, and vaulted into the front passenger seat. The driver immediately headed west on Centre St. at 20-25 m.p.h. Greene decided to stop the automobile and detain its occupants. He executed a U-turn, set out after the Oldsmobile, and activated his siren and wig-wag lights. Instead of stopping, the suspects' car accelerated. The officers took up the chase in earnest, travelling at roughly 45 m.p.h. When the officers observed the occupants of the Oldsmobile placing small items in their mouths and passing a jug back and forth, they concluded that the suspects were swallowing potential evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Oldsmobile approached Codman Square -- a complex intersection at which Centre St., Washington St., Norfolk St., and Talbot Ave. meet -- it crossed to the wrong side of the road, passed three cars waiting at a red light, and turned left on Washington St., travelling as fast as 50 m.p.h. The officers remained close behind. Approximately 300 feet from Codman Square, the suspects' vehicle struck a ten-year-old girl, Marie Evans, who was attempting to cross Washington St. Greene stopped his car and Avery alighted to assist the victim. Greene then continued his pursuit of the Oldsmobile. The entire incident lasted no more than two minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' evidence shows that traffic was heavy at the time of the chase and that numerous pedestrians were about. Both Greene and Avery were familiar with Codman Square and knew that it was a busy shopping venue adjacent to a densely populated residential area. They also knew that Centre St. affords limited visibility of the Codman Square intersection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie Evans sued the officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section(s) 1983 (1994); she sued the City pursuant to the same statute; and she and her parents, Muriel and Billy Evans, sued the City under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, Section(s) 2 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court (Young, U.S.D.J.) granted summary judgment in favor of the City on Evans' section 1983 claim. Ruling ore tenus, the court determined that the plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence sufficient to prove a policy or custom of deliberate indifference attributable to the City. The parties thereafter consented to trial before a magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 636(c) (1994); Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(a). At the conclusion of the evidence, the court (Collings, U.S.M.J.) took the remaining section 1983 claim from the jury and granted the officers' motions for judgment as a matter of law. See Evans v. Avery, 897 F. Supp. 21 (D. Mass. 1995). The jury then considered the pendent claims and awarded damages to Evans and each of her parents in the amount of $100,000 (the per claimant maximum allowable under state law, see supra note 1). These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE OFFICERS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie Evans asserts that the nisi prius court erred in directing a verdict for the police officers. She argues, in the alternative, that the court applied the wrong legal standard, and that, whatever legal standard obtains, the evidence established a jury question as to whether the officers' conduct violated her right to substantive due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1983 supplies a private right of action against a person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law. Evans' mishap involved neither physical contact with a police officer nor police action directed at her. In short, it was not a seizure and it was therefore not in derogation of her Fourth Amendment rights. See Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596-97 (1989) (distinguishing between police action directed toward producing a particular result and police action that happens to cause an unintended, if foreseeable, result and holding that only the former can constitute a seizure); Landol-Rivera v. Cruz Cosme, 906 F.2d 791, 796 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is intervention directed at a specific individual that furnishes the basis for a Fourth Amendment claim.\"). Nevertheless, even outside the context of a seizure, appellate courts have noted that a person injured as a result of police misconduct may prosecute a substantive due process claim under section 1983. See, e.g., Sinaloa Lake Owners Ass'n v. City of Simi Valley, 882 F.2d 1398, 1408 n.10 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1016 (1990); see also Landol-Rivera, 906 F.2d at 796 (assuming proposition). The initial question that confronts us concerns the legal standard by which the officers' conduct should be judged in such instances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an historical perspective. In Landol-Rivera we ruled that police officers who were engaged in hot pursuit of a suspect could not be held liable under the substantive aspect of the Due Process Clause for the shooting of a hostage. 906 F.2d at 798. We premised that ruling on a determination that the officers' conduct did not reflect a reckless or callous indifference to the hostage's rights. See id. at 796-98. Two things about this articulation of the applicable legal standard are noteworthy. In the first place, our use of the \"deliberate indifference\" test did not broach new ground, but, rather, reflected a fairly straightforward application of our earlier holding in Germany v. Vance, 868 F.2d 9 (1st Cir. 1989), in which we posited that reckless or callous indifference to an individual's rights is a necessary predicate to triggering the substantive protections of the Due Process Clause. See id. at 17-19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the second place, Landol-Rivera did not presume to undertake a full formulation of the test applicable to substantive due process claims in creation of danger cases; instead, the court went only as far as was needed to show the infirmity of the particular claim before it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this court decided Landol-Rivera, the Justices revisited the jurisprudence of substantive due process in Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115 (1992). In that case, the widow of an asphyxiated sanitation department employee claimed that her deceased husband had \"a constitutional right to be free from unreasonable risks of harm to his body, mind and emotions and a constitutional right to be protected from the [city's] custom and policy of deliberate indifference toward the safety of its employees.\" Id. at 117. Noting its traditional reluctance \"to expand the concept of substantive due process,\" id. at 125, the Court recharacterized the plaintiff's \"deliberate indifference\" claim to include an additional element, namely, \"that the city's `deliberate indifference' to Collins' safety was arbitrary government action that . . . `shock[s] the conscience' of federal judges.\" Id. at 126. The Court reiterated this standard when it determined that the city's alleged failure to train or warn its employees was not actionable as a substantive due process violation because the city's conduct could not \"be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.\" Id. at 128. Rather, the Court held petitioner's claim to be \"analogous to a fairly typical state-law tort claim,\" and noted that it had \"previously rejected claims that the Due Process Clause should be interpreted to impose federal duties that are analogous to those traditionally imposed by state tort law.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Collins was decided in 1992, two of our sister circuits, faced with the need to construct a template for substantive due process claims arising out of the state's creation of danger, have held squarely that the \"shock the conscience\" rubric furnishes the appropriate test. The Third Circuit, sitting en banc, adopted this standard in a police pursuit case. See Fagan v. City of Vineland, 22 F.3d 1296, 1306-07 (3d Cir. 1994) (en banc) (\"In light of the Supreme Court's unanimous adherence to the `shocks the conscience' test in Collins, the reckless indifference of government employees is an insufficient basis upon which to ground their liability for a police pursuit under the Due Process Clause.\"). In a different factual context, the Tenth Circuit relied on Collins for the proposition that the \"shock the conscience\" test governs substantive due process claims in all creation of danger cases. See Uhlrig v. Harder, 64 F.3d 567, 571 (10th Cir. 1995), cert. denied 116 S. Ct. 924 (1996). Moreover, at least two other courts of appeals, anticipating Collins, adopted the \"shock the conscience\" standard in police pursuit cases prior to 1992 (and still adhere to it). See Temkin v. Frederick County Comm'rs, 945 F.2d 716, 723 (4th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1095 (1992); Checki v. Webb, 785 F.2d 534, 538 (5th Cir. 1986). To be sure, the position taken by these courts is not uncontroversial. Judge Cowen wrote a vociferous dissent in Fagan, 22 F.3d at 1309, and the Ninth Circuit recently rejected the \"shock the conscience\" test, Collins notwithstanding. See Lewis v. Sacramento County, 98 F.3d 434, 440 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that deliberate indifference or reckless disregard \"is the minimum required to sustain a Section(s) 1983 claim in the context of a high-speed police pursuit\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are persuaded that the majority view of the minimum threshold in cases like this is correct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Accordingly, we hold that police officers' deliberate indifference to a victim's rights, standing alone, is not a sufficient predicate for a substantive due process claim in a police pursuit case. Rather, in such a case, the plaintiff must also show that the officers' conduct shocks the conscience. Though that benchmark is mandated for creation of danger cases under the fairest reading of Collins, we add that it is particularly appropriate to measure police pursuits in that way. Police chases are not only a necessary concomitant of maintaining order in our modern society, but they are also inherently hazardous. By their very nature, they inevitably create some risk of injury to bystanders. Officers must decide the balance between law enforcement and risk to public safety quickly and while under considerable pressure. In such circumstances, permitting the Due Process Clause to serve as a surrogate for state tort law would hamstring the police in their performance of vital duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, moreover, that this standard is not inconsistent with, but is merely a refinement of, Landol-Rivera. As in Landol-Rivera, a plaintiff is still required to show the police officers' deliberate indifference to his rights. The plaintiff in Landol-Rivera could not clear this hurdle, so we had no occasion to explore whether any further hurdle blocked his path.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Today, we move forward and hold that in order for a high-speed police pursuit to intrude upon substantive due process protections, the officers' conduct must not only manifest deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's rights, but must also shock the conscience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having clarified the applicable legal standard, we need not tarry. The evidence of record here, taken in the light most salutary to Evans' case, does not satisfy the \"shock the conscience\" test. The chase was brief in duration, lasting no more than two minutes. It covered about half a mile. The vehicles' speeds never exceeded 50 m.p.h. The officers had good cause to believe that the suspects were trafficking in cocaine. Though Evans is not bereft of talking points -- the pursuit occurred in a densely populated residential area at a time when people would likely be ambling about, and the officers did not seriously consider alternatives to hot pursuit -- these points, taken most favorably to Evans, add up to no more than possible negligence. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we do not believe that either the officers' decision to pursue the apparent perpetrators of a serious offense or their actions during the chase were so raw as to shock the conscience of a reasonable factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A comparison of the facts of this case to those of other police pursuit cases in which the officers' behavior has been held not to shock the conscience fortifies our conclusion. For example, Fagan involved a lengthy pursuit at speeds up to 80 m.p.h. through a plethora of red lights. See Fagan, 22 F.3d at 1299-1300. Similarly, Temkin, 945 F.2d at 718, involved a police officer who pursued an individual suspected of stealing $17 worth of gasoline at speeds up to 105 m.p.h. on a narrow, two-lane highway, with the result that both the police cruiser and the pursued vehicle struck the plaintiff. The Fourth Circuit held that the officer's conduct, \"while disturbing and lacking in judgment,\" did not transgress the \"shock the conscience\" standard. Id. at 723. The actions of the officers in those cases were far more egregious than the actions of officers Avery and Greene. Although the \"shock the conscience\" test is not mathematically precise, the imprecision occurs at the edges -- and this case, fairly viewed, does not present a close call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, \"shock the conscience\" is the standard that guides our decision, and the conduct of officers Avery and Greene when measured against that benchmark is manifestly insufficient to support a substantive due process claim. We therefore reject Marie Evans' principal assignment of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE CITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evans next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her section 1983 claim against the City of Boston. She asserts that the City exhibited deliberate indifference to individual rights both through its failure to monitor police pursuits and through its failure to supervise police officers involved in such pursuits. We need not probe Evans' charge that the City's policies were inadequate in these respects. As we explain below, the fact that Avery and Greene did not violate Evans' constitutional rights means that the City is not liable to her under section 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result is compelled by the Supreme Court's decision in City of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796 (1986) (per curiam). In that case, the plaintiff sued a police officer for making an arrest with excessive force and without probable cause; he also sued the officer's employer, the City of Los Angeles, for promulgating a constitutionally deficient policy in regard to police officers' use of force. The jury found for the officer but against the municipality. The district court entered judgment for the gendarme but overrode the second part of the jury's verdict and dismissed the claim against the city. The court of appeals reversed the order of dismissal but did not disturb the judgment that had been entered in the officer's favor. See Heller v. Bushey, 759 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1985). The city then appealed. The Supreme Court reinstated the dismissal, declaring that it had never</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">authorize[d] the award of damages against a municipal corporation based on the actions of one of its officers when in fact the jury has concluded that the officer inflicted no constitutional harm. If a person has suffered no constitutional injury at the hands of the individual police officer, the fact that the departmental regulations might have authorized the use of constitutionally excessive force is quite beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Heller, 475 U.S. at 799 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Heller provides a durable basis for determining that a municipality cannot be liable under section 1983 for an inadequate public safety policy in a situation where, as here, the officers whose actions actually caused the harm have been exonerated at trial, we note that a panel of the Third Circuit found Heller inapplicable in a case much like this one. In Fagan v. City of Vineland, 22 F.3d 1283 (3d Cir. 1994) (panel opinion), the court stated that \"in a substantive due process case arising out of a police pursuit, an underlying constitutional tort can still exist even if no individual police officer violated the Constitution.\" Id. at 1292.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court reasoned that the claim against the officers and the claim against the municipality were based on two different theories: the officers would be liable if their conduct \"shocked the conscience,\" while the city would be liable if its policymakers, acting with deliberate indifference, implemented a policy that encouraged the officers to conduct an unsafe pursuit. Id. Evans invites us to adopt this analysis. We decline the invitation because we believe that the Fagan panel improperly applied the Supreme Court's teachings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Collins, the Court emphasized that proper analysis requires us to separate two different issues when a Section(s) 1983 claim is asserted against a municipality: (1) whether plaintiff's harm was caused by a constitutional violation, and (2) if so, whether the city is responsible for that violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins, 503 U.S. at 120. The Fagan panel described the \"deliberate indifference\" test as a \"different theor[y]\" for municipal liability, 22 F.3d at 1292, but the \"deliberate indifference\" test is not an independent theory at all. Rather, deliberate indifference is merely an articulation of the second prong of the Collins framework, adapted to \"policy and custom\" cases. In treating it as a separate theory, the Fagan panel ignored the first segment of the framework: the requirement that the plaintiff's harm be caused by a constitutional violation. See Thompson v. Boggs, 33 F.3d 847, 859 n.11 (7th Cir. 1994) (rejecting the holding of the Fagan panel opinion), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1692 (1995); see also Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 51 F.3d 1137, 1153 n.13 (3d Cir.) (questioning the analysis contained in the Fagan panel opinion), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 165 (1995). Consequently, we follow Heller's clear rule and hold that the City cannot be held liable absent a constitutional violation by its officers. See de Feliciano v. de Jesus, 873 F.2d 447, 449 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 850 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Boston appeals the jury's verdicts for loss of consortium in favor of Muriel and Billy Evans (Marie Evans' parents). It advances a single isthmian ground in support of its cross-appeal, arguing that the trial court erred in formulating a jury instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We frame the assignment of error. Over the City's objection, the lower court instructed the jury that state law limited the damages that could be awarded on each claim to $100,000. See supra note 1. The City argues that this instruction was unfairly prejudicial inasmuch as it \"caused the jury to decide the amount of damages on emotion.\" The City's premise is that, once the jury knew of the cap, it realized that it could not fully compensate Marie Evans for her extremely severe injuries and therefore decided to circumvent the statutory impediment by remunerating Marie's family as generously as possible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This asseveration lacks merit. Neither the Massachusetts statute nor the cases discussing it prohibit such an instruction, and the City cites no case from any jurisdiction which holds that in such circumstances a trial court abuses its discretion by informing a jury of a statutory cap on damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> To the contrary, the cases upon which the City relies stand for nothing more than the proposition that a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing to inform the jury of such a limit. See, e.g., Thompson v. Sanford, 663 S.W.2d 932, 935 (Ark. 1984); State v. Bouras, 423 N.E.2d 741, 744 (Ind. App. 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wisdom of telling a jury about such a statutory limitation is debatable, and we do not recommend the practice. Still, we customarily cede wide discretion to trial courts to fashion jury instructions as they see fit, see United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1299 n.31 (1st Cir. 1966); Putnam Resources v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 462 (1st Cir. 1992), and we see no reason to second-guess the court in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by other incidents of the case at hand. For one thing, the awards to the parents are amply supported by evidence in the record -- and almost none of this evidence has been contradicted. For another thing, after properly instructing the jurors on loss of consortium, the magistrate told them that \"[t]he claims for Muriel and Billy Evans for loss of consortium are separate claims and each is to be judged separately.\" Jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions, see Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1287; United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir. 1995), and the City has not offered sufficient justification for overcoming this presumption. In the last analysis, the City's claim that the mere mention of the statutory cap inspired the jury to ignore the charge and instead do rough remedial justice is wholly speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. In a police pursuit case not involving a seizure, the officers may be held liable on the basis of substantive due process only if their actions (whether or not reckless or deliberately indifferent to public safety) shock the conscience. Here, Marie Evans' injuries are not the result of conscience-shocking conduct on the part of officers Avery or Greene. Section 1983 therefore provides no remedy against them (or against the City of Boston, for that matter).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No error appearing, the judgment below will be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986). There, the Court held that mere negligence is insufficient to implicate the substantive protections of the Due Process Clause but left open the question of whether something less than intentional conduct might be enough to trigger those protections. See id. at 334 n.3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 582 (1st Cir. 1989), we upheld a section 1983 substantive due process claim under the \"reckless or callous indifference\" standard. There, four armed plainclothes police officers approached a car occupied by a young couple admiring the view at a secluded spot. When the swain saw the unidentified men, he started his car and began to drive away. Without warning, the officers opened fire and severely injured him. See id. at 557. Because the parties in Gutierrez-Rodriguez tried the case on the assumption that \"reckless and callous indifference\" constituted the rule of decision for section 1983 substantive due process claims -- and argued in the same vein on appeal -- we had no occasion to address whether anything beyond that standard might be required. In all events, the behavior exhibited by the police in Gutierrez-Rodriguez would shock even an unusually jaded conscience</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We refuse to follow Lewis because we believe that the panel paid insufficient attention both to Collins and to the legitimate demands of law enforcement when it asserted, without engaging in any analysis, that \"deliberate indifference is always sufficient\" to maintain a section 1983 substantive due process action.

While under ordinary circumstances we would be bound to follow a predecessor panel's lead, see, e.g., Jusino v. Zayas, 875 F.2d 986, 993 (1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that in a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels customarily are bound by prior panel decisions closely in point), there is a well-recognized exception to the rule for situations in which a panel opinion is undercut by controlling authority, subsequently announced. See, e.g., Stella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1995) (refusing to follow Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F.2d 124 (1st Cir. 1988), in light of Johnson v. Jones, 115 S.

At approximately 6:00 p.m. on August 12, 1992, officers Terrace Avery and John J. Greene were cruising through a residential neighborhood in the Dorchester section of Boston. They spotted suspicious activity at the intersection of Nixon and Centre Streets: an individual who appeared to be startled at their presence yelled excitedly, threw a paper bag through the open window of a parked Oldsmobile, and vaulted into the front passenger seat. The driver immediately headed west on Centre St. at 20-25 m.p.h. Greene decided to stop the automobile and detain its occupants. He executed a U-turn, set out after the Oldsmobile, and activated his siren and wig-wag lights. Instead of stopping, the suspects' car accelerated. The officers took up the chase in earnest, travelling at roughly 45 m.p.h. When the officers observed the occupants of the Oldsmobile placing small items in their mouths and passing a jug back and forth, they concluded that the suspects were swallowing potential evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Oldsmobile approached Codman Square -- a complex intersection at which Centre St., Washington St., Norfolk St., and Talbot Ave. meet -- it crossed to the wrong side of the road, passed three cars waiting at a red light, and turned left on Washington St., travelling as fast as 50 m.p.h. The officers remained close behind. Approximately 300 feet from Codman Square, the suspects' vehicle struck a ten-year-old girl, Marie Evans, who was attempting to cross Washington St. Greene stopped his car and Avery alighted to assist the victim. Greene then continued his pursuit of the Oldsmobile. The entire incident lasted no more than two minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' evidence shows that traffic was heavy at the time of the chase and that numerous pedestrians were about. Both Greene and Avery were familiar with Codman Square and knew that it was a busy shopping venue adjacent to a densely populated residential area. They also knew that Centre St. affords limited visibility of the Codman Square intersection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie Evans sued the officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section(s) 1983 (1994); she sued the City pursuant to the same statute; and she and her parents, Muriel and Billy Evans, sued the City under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 258, Section(s) 2 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court (Young, U.S.D.J.) granted summary judgment in favor of the City on Evans' section 1983 claim. Ruling ore tenus, the court determined that the plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence sufficient to prove a policy or custom of deliberate indifference attributable to the City. The parties thereafter consented to trial before a magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 636(c) (1994); Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(a). At the conclusion of the evidence, the court (Collings, U.S.M.J.) took the remaining section 1983 claim from the jury and granted the officers' motions for judgment as a matter of law. See Evans v. Avery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1470435\"><a href=\"/opinion/1470435/evans-v-avery/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span> (D. Mass. 1995). The jury then considered the pendent claims and awarded damages to Evans and each of her parents in the amount of $100,000 (the per claimant maximum allowable under state law, see supra note 1). These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE OFFICERS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie Evans asserts that the nisi prius court erred in directing a verdict for the police officers. She argues, in the alternative, that the court applied the wrong legal standard, and that, whatever legal standard obtains, the evidence established a jury question as to whether the officers' conduct violated her right to substantive due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1983 supplies a private right of action against a person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law. Evans' mishap involved neither physical contact with a police officer nor police action directed at her. In short, it was not a seizure and it was therefore not in derogation of her Fourth Amendment rights. See Brower v. County of Inyo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112218\"><a href=\"/opinion/112218/brower-v-county-of-inyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, 596-97 (1989) (distinguishing between police action directed toward producing a particular result and police action that happens to cause an unintended, if foreseeable, result and holding that only the former can constitute a seizure); Landol-Rivera v. Cruz Cosme, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543722\"><a href=\"/opinion/543722/bradier-steve-landol-rivera-etc-v-gilberto-cruz-cosme-and-jaime-cintron/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 796 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is intervention directed at a specific individual that furnishes the basis for a Fourth Amendment claim.\"). Nevertheless, even outside the context of a seizure, appellate courts have noted that a person injured as a result of police misconduct may prosecute a substantive due process claim under section 1983. See, e.g., Sinaloa Lake Owners Ass'n v. City of Simi Valley, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1398</span></span>, 1408 n.10 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></span> (1990); see also Landol-Rivera, 906 F.2d at 796 (assuming proposition). The initial question that confronts us concerns the legal standard by which the officers' conduct should be judged in such instances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an historical perspective. In Landol-Rivera we ruled that police officers who were engaged in hot pursuit of a suspect could not be held liable under the substantive aspect of the Due Process Clause for the shooting of a hostage. 906 F.2d at 798. We premised that ruling on a determination that the officers' conduct did not reflect a reckless or callous indifference to the hostage's rights. See id. at 796-98. Two things about this articulation of the applicable legal standard are noteworthy. In the first place, our use of the \"deliberate indifference\" test did not broach new ground, but, rather, reflected a fairly straightforward application of our earlier holding in Germany v. Vance, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518738\"><a href=\"/opinion/518738/suzanne-germany-v-carol-vance-suzanne-germany-v-carol-vance/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1989), in which we posited that reckless or callous indifference to an individual's rights is a necessary predicate to triggering the substantive protections of the Due Process Clause. See id. at 17-19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the second place, Landol-Rivera did not presume to undertake a full formulation of the test applicable to substantive due process claims in creation of danger cases; instead, the court went only as far as was needed to show the infirmity of the particular claim before it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this court decided Landol-Rivera, the Justices revisited the jurisprudence of substantive due process in Collins v. City of Harker Heights, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112699\"><a href=\"/opinion/112699/collins-v-harker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span> (1992). In that case, the widow of an asphyxiated sanitation department employee claimed that her deceased husband had \"a constitutional right to be free from unreasonable risks of harm to his body, mind and emotions and a constitutional right to be protected from the [city's] custom and policy of deliberate indifference toward the safety of its employees.\" Id. at 117. Noting its traditional reluctance \"to expand the concept of substantive due process,\" id. at 125, the Court recharacterized the plaintiff's \"deliberate indifference\" claim to include an additional element, namely, \"that the city's `deliberate indifference' to Collins' safety was arbitrary government action that . . . `shock[s] the conscience' of federal judges.\" Id. at 126. The Court reiterated this standard when it determined that the city's alleged failure to train or warn its employees was not actionable as a substantive due process violation because the city's conduct could not \"be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.\" Id. at 128. Rather, the Court held petitioner's claim to be \"analogous to a fairly typical state-law tort claim,\" and noted that it had \"previously rejected claims that the Due Process Clause should be interpreted to impose federal duties that are analogous to those traditionally imposed by state tort law.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Collins was decided in 1992, two of our sister circuits, faced with the need to construct a template for substantive due process claims arising out of the state's creation of danger, have held squarely that the \"shock the conscience\" rubric furnishes the appropriate test. The Third Circuit, sitting en banc, adopted this standard in a police pursuit case. See Fagan v. City of Vineland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669076\"><a href=\"/opinion/669076/sarah-e-fagan-general-administratrix-and-administratrix-ad-prosequendum/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>, 1306-07 (3d Cir. 1994) (en banc) (\"In light of the Supreme Court's unanimous adherence to the `shocks the conscience' test in Collins, the reckless indifference of government employees is an insufficient basis upon which to ground their liability for a police pursuit under the Due Process Clause.\"). In a different factual context, the Tenth Circuit relied on Collins for the proposition that the \"shock the conscience\" test governs substantive due process claims in all creation of danger cases. See Uhlrig v. Harder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702619\"><a href=\"/opinion/702619/gregg-d-uhlrig-of-the-estate-of-stephanie-uhlrig-deceased-gregg-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 571 (10th Cir. 1995), cert. denied <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></span> (1996). Moreover, at least two other courts of appeals, anticipating Collins, adopted the \"shock the conscience\" standard in police pursuit cases prior to 1992 (and still adhere to it). See Temkin v. Frederick County Comm'rs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569115\"><a href=\"/opinion/569115/sharon-temkin-bruce-m-temkin-v-frederick-county-commissioners-glen-marion/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span>, 723 (4th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></span> (1992); Checki v. Webb, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466102\"><a href=\"/opinion/466102/ron-checki-v-richard-webb/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 538 (5th Cir. 1986). To be sure, the position taken by these courts is not uncontroversial. Judge Cowen wrote a vociferous dissent in Fagan, 22 F.3d at 1309, and the Ninth Circuit recently rejected the \"shock the conscience\" test, Collins notwithstanding. See Lewis v. Sacramento County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728048\"><a href=\"/opinion/728048/teri-lewis-and-thomas-lewis-personal-representatives-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 440 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that deliberate indifference or reckless disregard \"is the minimum required to sustain a Section(s) 1983 claim in the context of a high-speed police pursuit\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are persuaded that the majority view of the minimum threshold in cases like this is correct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Accordingly, we hold that police officers' deliberate indifference to a victim's rights, standing alone, is not a sufficient predicate for a substantive due process claim in a police pursuit case. Rather, in such a case, the plaintiff must also show that the officers' conduct shocks the conscience. Though that benchmark is mandated for creation of danger cases under the fairest reading of Collins, we add that it is particularly appropriate to measure police pursuits in that way. Police chases are not only a necessary concomitant of maintaining order in our modern society, but they are also inherently hazardous. By their very nature, they inevitably create some risk of injury to bystanders. Officers must decide the balance between law enforcement and risk to public safety quickly and while under considerable pressure. In such circumstances, permitting the Due Process Clause to serve as a surrogate for state tort law would hamstring the police in their performance of vital duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, moreover, that this standard is not inconsistent with, but is merely a refinement of, Landol-Rivera. As in Landol-Rivera, a plaintiff is still required to show the police officers' deliberate indifference to his rights. The plaintiff in Landol-Rivera could not clear this hurdle, so we had no occasion to explore whether any further hurdle blocked his path.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Today, we move forward and hold that in order for a high-speed police pursuit to intrude upon substantive due process protections, the officers' conduct must not only manifest deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's rights, but must also shock the conscience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having clarified the applicable legal standard, we need not tarry. The evidence of record here, taken in the light most salutary to Evans' case, does not satisfy the \"shock the conscience\" test. The chase was brief in duration, lasting no more than two minutes. It covered about half a mile. The vehicles' speeds never exceeded 50 m.p.h. The officers had good cause to believe that the suspects were trafficking in cocaine. Though Evans is not bereft of talking points -- the pursuit occurred in a densely populated residential area at a time when people would likely be ambling about, and the officers did not seriously consider alternatives to hot pursuit -- these points, taken most favorably to Evans, add up to no more than possible negligence. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we do not believe that either the officers' decision to pursue the apparent perpetrators of a serious offense or their actions during the chase were so raw as to shock the conscience of a reasonable factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A comparison of the facts of this case to those of other police pursuit cases in which the officers' behavior has been held not to shock the conscience fortifies our conclusion. For example, Fagan involved a lengthy pursuit at speeds up to 80 m.p.h. through a plethora of red lights. See Fagan, 22 F.3d at 1299-1300. Similarly, Temkin, 945 F.2d at 718, involved a police officer who pursued an individual suspected of stealing $17 worth of gasoline at speeds up to 105 m.p.h. on a narrow, two-lane highway, with the result that both the police cruiser and the pursued vehicle struck the plaintiff. The Fourth Circuit held that the officer's conduct, \"while disturbing and lacking in judgment,\" did not transgress the \"shock the conscience\" standard. Id. at 723. The actions of the officers in those cases were far more egregious than the actions of officers Avery and Greene. Although the \"shock the conscience\" test is not mathematically precise, the imprecision occurs at the edges -- and this case, fairly viewed, does not present a close call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, \"shock the conscience\" is the standard that guides our decision, and the conduct of officers Avery and Greene when measured against that benchmark is manifestly insufficient to support a substantive due process claim. We therefore reject Marie Evans' principal assignment of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM AGAINST THE CITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evans next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her section 1983 claim against the City of Boston. She asserts that the City exhibited deliberate indifference to individual rights both through its failure to monitor police pursuits and through its failure to supervise police officers involved in such pursuits. We need not probe Evans' charge that the City's policies were inadequate in these respects. As we explain below, the fact that Avery and Greene did not violate Evans' constitutional rights means that the City is not liable to her under section 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result is compelled by the Supreme Court's decision in City of Los Angeles v. Heller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111630\"><a href=\"/opinion/111630/los-angeles-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span> (1986) (per curiam). In that case, the plaintiff sued a police officer for making an arrest with excessive force and without probable cause; he also sued the officer's employer, the City of Los Angeles, for promulgating a constitutionally deficient policy in regard to police officers' use of force. The jury found for the officer but against the municipality. The district court entered judgment for the gendarme but overrode the second part of the jury's verdict and dismissed the claim against the city. The court of appeals reversed the order of dismissal but did not disturb the judgment that had been entered in the officer's favor. See Heller v. Bushey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450763\"><a href=\"/opinion/450763/ronald-heller-v-craig-bushey/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></a></span>, 1376 (9th Cir. 1985). The city then appealed. The Supreme Court reinstated the dismissal, declaring that it had never</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">authorize[d] the award of damages against a municipal corporation based on the actions of one of its officers when in fact the jury has concluded that the officer inflicted no constitutional harm. If a person has suffered no constitutional injury at the hands of the individual police officer, the fact that the departmental regulations might have authorized the use of constitutionally excessive force is quite beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Heller, 475 U.S. at 799 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Heller provides a durable basis for determining that a municipality cannot be liable under section 1983 for an inadequate public safety policy in a situation where, as here, the officers whose actions actually caused the harm have been exonerated at trial, we note that a panel of the Third Circuit found Heller inapplicable in a case much like this one. In Fagan v. City of Vineland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669075\"><a href=\"/opinion/669075/fagan-v-city-of-vineland/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1994) (panel opinion), the court stated that \"in a substantive due process case arising out of a police pursuit, an underlying constitutional tort can still exist even if no individual police officer violated the Constitution.\" Id. at 1292.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court reasoned that the claim against the officers and the claim against the municipality were based on two different theories: the officers would be liable if their conduct \"shocked the conscience,\" while the city would be liable if its policymakers, acting with deliberate indifference, implemented a policy that encouraged the officers to conduct an unsafe pursuit. Id. Evans invites us to adopt this analysis. We decline the invitation because we believe that the Fagan panel improperly applied the Supreme Court's teachings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Collins, the Court emphasized that proper analysis requires us to separate two different issues when a Section(s) 1983 claim is asserted against a municipality: (1) whether plaintiff's harm was caused by a constitutional violation, and (2) if so, whether the city is responsible for that violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collins, 503 U.S. at 120. The Fagan panel described the \"deliberate indifference\" test as a \"different theor[y]\" for municipal liability, 22 F.3d at 1292, but the \"deliberate indifference\" test is not an independent theory at all. Rather, deliberate indifference is merely an articulation of the second prong of the Collins framework, adapted to \"policy and custom\" cases. In treating it as a separate theory, the Fagan panel ignored the first segment of the framework: the requirement that the plaintiff's harm be caused by a constitutional violation. See Thompson v. Boggs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677079\"><a href=\"/opinion/677079/robert-thompson-v-rod-boggs-police-officer-of-the-city-of-havana/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 859 n.11 (7th Cir. 1994) (rejecting the holding of the Fagan panel opinion), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See de Feliciano v. de Jesus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522148\"><a href=\"/opinion/522148/margarita-rivera-de-feliciano-etc-v-francisco-de-jesus-etc-farm/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 449 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></span> (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Boston appeals the jury's verdicts for loss of consortium in favor of Muriel and Billy Evans (Marie Evans' parents). It advances a single isthmian ground in support of its cross-appeal, arguing that the trial court erred in formulating a jury instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We frame the assignment of error. Over the City's objection, the lower court instructed the jury that state law limited the damages that could be awarded on each claim to $100,000. See supra note 1. The City argues that this instruction was unfairly prejudicial inasmuch as it \"caused the jury to decide the amount of damages on emotion.\" The City's premise is that, once the jury knew of the cap, it realized that it could not fully compensate Marie Evans for her extremely severe injuries and therefore decided to circumvent the statutory impediment by remunerating Marie's family as generously as possible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This asseveration lacks merit. Neither the Massachusetts statute nor the cases discussing it prohibit such an instruction, and the City cites no case from any jurisdiction which holds that in such circumstances a trial court abuses its discretion by informing a jury of a statutory cap on damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> To the contrary, the cases upon which the City relies stand for nothing more than the proposition that a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing to inform the jury of such a limit. See, e.g., Thompson v. Sanford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2398195\"><a href=\"/opinion/2398195/thompson-v-sanford/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 935 (Ark. 1984); State v. Bouras, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2100684\"><a href=\"/opinion/2100684/state-v-bouras/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>, 744 (Ind. App. 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wisdom of telling a jury about such a statutory limitation is debatable, and we do not recommend the practice. Still, we customarily cede wide discretion to trial courts to fashion jury instructions as they see fit, see United States v. Houlihan, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></span>, 1299 n.31 (1st Cir. 1966); Putnam Resources v. Pateman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579198\"><a href=\"/opinion/579198/putnam-resources-v-ronald-m-pateman-ronald-m-pateman-v-frenkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 462 (1st Cir. 1992), and we see no reason to second-guess the court in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by other incidents of the case at hand. For one thing, the awards to the parents are amply supported by evidence in the record -- and almost none of this evidence has been contradicted. For another thing, after properly instructing the jurors on loss of consortium, the magistrate told them that \"[t]he claims for Muriel and Billy Evans for loss of consortium are separate claims and each is to be judged separately.\" Jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions, see Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1287; United States v. Rivera-Gomez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705988\"><a href=\"/opinion/705988/united-states-v-luis-raul-rivera-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir. 1995), and the City has not offered sufficient justification for overcoming this presumption. In the last analysis, the City's claim that the mere mention of the statutory cap inspired the jury to ignore the charge and instead do rough remedial justice is wholly speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. In a police pursuit case not involving a seizure, the officers may be held liable on the basis of substantive due process only if their actions (whether or not reckless or deliberately indifferent to public safety) shock the conscience. Here, Marie Evans' injuries are not the result of conscience-shocking conduct on the part of officers Avery or Greene. Section 1983 therefore provides no remedy against them (or against the City of Boston, for that matter).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No error appearing, the judgment below will be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

There, four armed plainclothes police officers approached a car occupied by a young couple admiring the view at a secluded spot. When the swain saw the unidentified men, he started his car and began to drive away. Without warning, the officers opened fire and severely injured him. See id. at 557. Because the parties in Gutierrez-Rodriguez tried the case on the assumption that \"reckless and callous indifference\" constituted the rule of decision for section 1983 substantive due process claims -- and argued in the same vein on appeal -- we had no occasion to address whether anything beyond that standard might be required. In all events, the behavior exhibited by the police in Gutierrez-Rodriguez would shock even an unusually jaded conscience</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We refuse to follow Lewis because we believe that the panel paid insufficient attention both to Collins and to the legitimate demands of law enforcement when it asserted, without engaging in any analysis, that \"deliberate indifference is always sufficient\" to maintain a section 1983 substantive due process action.

See id. at 235-37 (remanding for a new trial due to a violation of 42 U.S.C. Section(s) 1981a(c)(2)).

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has chosen to provide only a limited tort remedy, and, though that choice has a very harsh result here, we must recognize the state's suzerainty in its legitimate province. It is not the function of a federal court to force state tort law into unfamiliar contours under the guise of constitutional interpretation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
