Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and DiClerico,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Carolyn M. Latti with whom Latti & Anderson LLP was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     William H. Welte with whom Welte & Welte, P.A. was on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n     *Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f                         October 29, 2001\n\n\n\n\n           BOUDIN, Chief Judge. In June 1998, Timothy Hopkins was\n\ninjured at sea while serving aboard the F/V Jamie & Ashley.         The\n\naccident occurred while the ship was letting out a fishing net\n\nfrom a reel mounted at the aft end of the vessel.        The reel was\n\ncontrolled by another crew member, Ben Farrington, who operated\n\nhydraulic controls on the port side.        Hopkins was standing on\n\nthe starboard side of the reel as the net unwound into the sea.\n\n           During the unwinding, a portion of the net slipped off\n\nthe port side of the reel, falling over the edge of the flange\n\nextending upward on either side of the reel.      Farrington stopped\n\nthe mechanism and climbed up the side of the reel to stow the\n\nloose portion.   Hopkins approached the reel from the other side\n\nto assist as Farrington finished and descended.        Hopkins stooped\n\nover, either (depending on whose testimony is believed) to free\n\nthe net from entanglement with a scallop ring near the base of\n\nthe reel or to pick up something from the deck.\n\n           While bent over, Hopkins was struck in the back by a\n\ncan that was one of many attached to the net as a buoy to keep\n\nit from sinking when in the water.      Hopkins alleged that this\n\noccurred   because   Farrington   started   up   the   reel   mechanism\n\n                                  -2-\n\fwithout first making sure that Hopkins was clear of the area\n\nand, more broadly, that the accident occurred because the reel\n\nflanges were not high enough to contain a net of this size.\n\nFarrington denied starting the reel while Hopkins was in the\n\nway.\n\n            Having suffered a herniated disk in the accident,\n\nHopkins sued the ship owner, Jordan Marine, Inc., charging that\n\nthe ship was unseaworthy because the net bulged over the edge of\n\nthe flanges and for other reasons and that under the Jones Act,\n\n46   U.S.C.   ยง     688    (1994),   the    ship    owner   was   liable    for\n\nFarrington's      alleged    negligence      and    for   negligence   of   the\n\ncaptain in several different respects.              Jordan Marine's position\n\nwas that the flanges were adequate, that the can had fallen\n\nbecause a portion of the net had parted from hard use (as nets\n\nsometimes     do)    and    that   Hopkins    was    himself   negligent     in\n\nstraying--without warning Farrington--into a \"blind spot\" in\n\nwhich the reel blocked the control operator's view.\n\n            The jury returned a verdict against Hopkins, finding\n\nseparately that Jordan Marine had not been proved negligent and\n\nthe vessel had not been proved unseaworthy.               The district court\n\ndenied Hopkins' motion for a new trial and he appeals.                 In this\n\ncourt he contends that the district court erred in two respects\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fin instructing the jury.           He also says that Jordan Marine's\n\nexpert was not qualified to testify.\n\n            Of   the    three    claimed   errors,   one    is   of   general\n\ninterest.      In a charge extending over 53 transcript pages, the\n\ndistrict court        at one point told the jury: \"If you find that\n\nthe plaintiff's alleged injuries were the result of his failing\n\nto   observe     an    obvious   condition,   you    will   find      for   the\n\ndefendant.\"      This, argues Hopkins, invited the jury to reject\n\nhis claims based on the doctrine that a plaintiff may not\n\nrecover for risks that he knowingly assumed.           Jordan Marine says\n\nthat the objection was not adequately preserved but we think\n\nthat it may have been and will assume that it was.1\n\n            Assumption of the risk is a doctrine associated with\n\ncommon law tort liability.         Like many such phrases, it has been\n\nused in more than one way, Prosser and Keeton on Torts, ยง 68 at\n\n480-98 (5th ed. 1984); Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 318\n\nU.S. 54, 68-69 (1943)(Frankfurter, J., concurring); but in one\n\nversion, the doctrine was understood to block an employee from\n\nrecovering for negligent behavior or conditions for which the\n\n\n     1\n     Hopkins' counsel did object to the instructions after they\nwere given on the ground that the Supreme Court had barred\nassumption of the risk as a defense, although counsel seemingly\npointed to two other references in the charge.     The original\ncharging conference was not transcribed, but the judge's\nresponse to the post-charge objection indicates that the same\nobjection had been made and rejected at the charge conference.\n\n                                     -4-\n\femployer   was      responsible    if     the   risk   was    apparent    to    the\n\nemployee     and    the   employee        continued     voluntarily       in    his\n\nemployment, thereby \"assuming the risk.\"\n\n           Through stages that need not be described, see Gilmore\n\n& Black, The Law of Admiralty 351-57 (2d. ed. 1975), assumption\n\nof   the   risk     has   now     been     eliminated    as       a   defense       to\n\nunseaworthiness claims and to claims for negligence under the\n\nJones Act.     Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, 305 U.S. 424, 429\n\n(1939); The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U.S. 110, 122 (1936).                       But\n\ncontributory negligence remains as a defense to both sets of\n\nclaims; the jury is told that if the plaintiff's own negligence\n\nplayed a part in causing the injury, then any liability of the\n\ndefendant is to be reduced by the percentage or proportion by\n\nwhich the plaintiff contributed to his own injuries.                    Wilson v.\n\nMaritime Overseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1998); 5 Sand,\n\net al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Inst. 90-29 at 90-52\n\n(2001).2\n\n           In this case, the instruction quoted above--\"failing\n\nto   observe   an    obvious    condition\"--appears          at   the   end    of    a\n\nparagraph that occurs after the court had described both the\n\n\n\n      2\n     This version of contributory negligence is more accurately\ndescribed as comparative negligence, see Prosser & Keeton on\nTorts ยง 67, and the case law and model jury instructions cited\nbelow sometimes refer to it as such.\n\n                                         -5-\n\funseaworthiness       and   negligence      claims    and   had    turned     to\n\ndescribing the defense of contributory negligence.                 Wrapping up\n\nthe discussion, the court then doubled back to say that the ship\n\nowner's duty was to provide a ship safe for a crew member \"who\n\nexercise[s]     ordinary    care\"    but    not   necessarily      to   provide\n\n\"notice of a danger which is obvious through the use of ordinary\n\nsenses.\"    There then followed the objected to sentence which\n\ncompleted the paragraph.\n\n           The sentence does not say that assumption of an obvious\n\nrisk is a defense to unseaworthiness or negligence on the part\n\nof   the   shipowner.       Rather,    it    says    that   a    ship   is   not\n\nunseaworthy or an owner negligent merely because the ship owner\n\ndoes not anticipate that a crew member will behave negligently.\n\nPossibly the statement goes a shade too far (perhaps in some\n\nrepeat situations carelessness should be anticipated); but it is\n\ncertainly not an instruction that--on account of the seaman's\n\ncarelessness--the owner or ship can escape liability for its own\n\nnegligent act or      unseaworthy condition.\n\n           Indeed, in the next two paragraphs, the district court\n\nwent out of its way to refute the inference drawn by Hopkins.\n\nThe court said that while the plaintiff must act reasonably to\n\navoid apparent dangers, a \"seaman does not assume the risk\n\ncreated    by   the   failure   of    the   ship     to   take    [reasonable]\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fprecautions\" and \"that a seaman does not assume the risk of\n\ninjury or illness from even obvious dangers or conditions if the\n\ncause of the injury is the ship's negligence, the failure to\n\nprovide him with a safe place to work, or the failure to provide\n\na safe and seaworthy vessel.\"\n\n            Past    judicial      decisions      dealing      with    individual\n\ninstructions claimed to violate Socony-Vacuum are not much help\n\nbecause each package tends to be different.                  However, we have\n\nupheld instructions much closer to the line than this one, Myers\n\nv. Isthmian Lines, Inc., 282 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1960), cert.\n\ndenied, 365 U.S. 804 (1961), and Hopkins offers no precedent\n\nthat   condemns     a    combination      of    warning     and    qualification\n\nanything like the one in this case.                   That said, there is\n\ncertainly an argument for a good set of pattern instructions in\n\nthis area.\n\n            Hopkins' other claims of error can be dealt with more\n\nswiftly.     He     objects     because    at   two   other       points   in    the\n\ninstructions, the district court twice referred to the need to\n\nshow that    defendant's negligence was \"the\" proximate cause of\n\nHopkin's injury.         True, it would be enough to show that such\n\nnegligence    was       \"a\"   proximate    cause;     the    wrongful      act    or\n\ncondition need not be sole and exclusive cause.                        Rogers v.\n\nMissouri Pac. R.R., 352 U.S. 500, 506 (1957).                 But the district\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fcourt gave an emphatic instruction to this effect at the outset\n\n(emphasis added):\n\n           Under the law the defendant's negligence is\n           a legal cause of an injury or damage if that\n           negligence played any part, no matter how\n           small, in bringing about or causing the\n           injury or damage.    Therefore, even if the\n           defendant's    negligence     operated    in\n           combination with the act of another or in\n           combination with some other cause, the\n           defendant's negligence is a legal cause of\n           the plaintiffs injury or damage if it played\n           any part no matter how small in bringing\n           about or causing the injury or damage.\n\nThere were several other briefer statements to the same effect.\n\n           Although the slip-of-the-tongue references to \"the\"\n\nproximate cause are unfortunate, the test of jury instructions\n\nis   not   abstract   perfection.     Instead,   we   consider   jury\n\ninstructions as a whole to determine whether they correctly\n\nsummarize the relevant law.     Kelley v. Airborne Freight Corp.,\n\n140 F.3d 335, 349-50 (1st Cir.),      cert. denied, 525 U.S. 932\n\n(1998).    No harm was done by the two passing uses of the\n\ndefinite article, juxtaposed with the very clear and explicit\n\nstatement just quoted advising the jury that negligence playing\n\n\"any part, no matter how small\" was enough.\n\n           Finally, Hopkins says that Jordan Marine's expert was\n\nnot qualified.    The expert was a graduate of the Coast Guard\n\nAcademy who had served as an inspector of ships for the Coast\n\nGuard followed by years of consulting work in ship inspection\n\n                                -8-\n\fand   investigating    maritime   accidents.   In   no   way   did   the\n\ndistrict court abuse its discretion in permitting this expert to\n\ntestify.   See Diefenbach v. Sheridan Transp., 229 F.3d 27, 30-31\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

The accident occurred while the ship was letting out a fishing net from a reel mounted at the aft end of the vessel.

Farrington stopped the mechanism and climbed up the side of the reel to stow the loose portion. Hopkins approached the reel from the other side to assist as Farrington finished and descended. Hopkins stooped over, either (depending on whose testimony is believed) to free the net from entanglement with a scallop ring near the base of the reel or to pick up something from the deck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While bent over, Hopkins was struck in the back by a can that was one of many attached to the net as a buoy to keep it from sinking when in the water. Hopkins alleged that this occurred because Farrington started up the reel mechanism without first making sure that Hopkins was clear of the area and, more broadly, that the accident occurred because the reel flanges were not high enough to contain a net of this size. Farrington denied starting the reel while Hopkins was in the way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having suffered a herniated disk in the accident, Hopkins sued the ship owner, Jordan Marine, Inc., charging that the ship was unseaworthy because the net bulged over the edge of the flanges and for other reasons and that under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167; 688 (1994), the ship owner was liable for Farrington's alleged negligence and for negligence of the captain in several different respects. Jordan Marine's position was that the flanges were adequate, that the can had fallen because a portion of the net had parted from hard use (as nets sometimes do) and that Hopkins was himself negligent in straying--without warning Farrington--into a \"blind spot\" in which the reel blocked the control operator's view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict against Hopkins, finding separately that Jordan Marine had not been proved negligent and the vessel had not been proved unseaworthy. The district court denied Hopkins' motion for a new trial and he appeals. In this court he contends that the district court erred in two respects in instructing the jury.

In a charge extending over 53 transcript pages, the district court at one point told the jury: \"If you find that the plaintiff's alleged injuries were the result of his failing to observe an obvious condition, you will find for the defendant.\" This, argues Hopkins, invited the jury to reject his claims based on the doctrine that a plaintiff may not recover for risks that he knowingly assumed. Jordan Marine says that the objection was not adequately preserved but we think that it may have been and will assume that it was.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assumption of the risk is a doctrine associated with common law tort liability.

Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, 305 U.S. 424, 429 (1939); The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U.S. 110, 122 (1936). But contributory negligence remains as a defense to both sets of claims; the jury is told that if the plaintiff's own negligence played a part in causing the injury, then any liability of the defendant is to be reduced by the percentage or proportion by which the plaintiff contributed to his own injuries. Wilson v.

Wrapping up the discussion, the court then doubled back to say that the ship owner's duty was to provide a ship safe for a crew member \"who exercise[s] ordinary care\" but not necessarily to provide \"notice of a danger which is obvious through the use of ordinary senses.\" There then followed the objected to sentence which completed the paragraph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence does not say that assumption of an obvious risk is a defense to unseaworthiness or negligence on the part of the shipowner. Rather, it says that a ship is not unseaworthy or an owner negligent merely because the ship owner does not anticipate that a crew member will behave negligently. Possibly the statement goes a shade too far (perhaps in some repeat situations carelessness should be anticipated); but it is certainly not an instruction that--on account of the seaman's carelessness--the owner or ship can escape liability for its own negligent act or unseaworthy condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, in the next two paragraphs, the district court went out of its way to refute the inference drawn by Hopkins. The court said that while the plaintiff must act reasonably to avoid apparent dangers, a \"seaman does not assume the risk created by the failure of the ship to take [reasonable] precautions\" and \"that a seaman does not assume the risk of injury or illness from even obvious dangers or conditions if the cause of the injury is the ship's negligence, the failure to provide him with a safe place to work, or the failure to provide a safe and seaworthy vessel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Past judicial decisions dealing with individual instructions claimed to violate Socony-Vacuum are not much help because each package tends to be different.

He objects because at two other points in the instructions, the district court twice referred to the need to show that defendant's negligence was \"the\" proximate cause of Hopkin's injury. True, it would be enough to show that such negligence was \"a\" proximate cause; the wrongful act or condition need not be sole and exclusive cause. Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R.R., 352 U.S. 500, 506 (1957).

Therefore, even if the defendant's negligence operated in combination with the act of another or in combination with some other cause, the defendant's negligence is a legal cause of the plaintiffs injury or damage if it played any part no matter how small in bringing about or causing the injury or damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were several other briefer statements to the same effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the slip-of-the-tongue references to \"the\" proximate cause are unfortunate, the test of jury instructions is not abstract perfection.

Airborne Freight Corp., 140 F.3d 335, 349-50 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 932 (1998).

Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carolyn M. Latti with whom Latti &amp; Anderson LLP was on brief for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William H. Welte with whom Welte &amp; Welte, P.A. was on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before  Boudin, Chief Judge, Lynch, Circuit Judge, and DiClerico,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> District Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, Timothy Hopkins was injured at sea while serving aboard the F/V Jamie &amp; Ashley. The accident occurred while the ship was letting out a fishing net from a reel mounted at the aft end of the vessel. The reel was controlled by another crew member, Ben Farrington, who operated hydraulic controls on the port side. Hopkins was standing on the starboard side of the reel as the net unwound into the sea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the unwinding, a portion of the net slipped off the port side of the reel, falling over the edge of the flange extending upward on either side of the reel. Farrington stopped the mechanism and climbed up the side of the reel to stow the loose portion. Hopkins approached the reel from the other side to assist as Farrington finished and descended. Hopkins stooped over, either (depending on whose testimony is believed) to free the net from entanglement with a scallop ring near the base of the reel or to pick up something from the deck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While bent over, Hopkins was struck in the back by a can that was one of many attached to the net as a buoy to keep it from sinking when in the water. Hopkins alleged that this occurred because Farrington started up the reel mechanism without first making sure that Hopkins was clear of the area and, more broadly, that the accident occurred because the reel flanges were not high enough to contain a net of this size. Farrington denied starting the reel while Hopkins was in the way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having suffered a herniated disk in the accident, Hopkins sued the ship owner, Jordan Marine, Inc., charging that the ship was unseaworthy because the net bulged over the edge of the flanges and for other reasons and that under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167; 688 (1994), the ship owner was liable for Farrington's alleged negligence and for negligence of the captain in several different respects. Jordan Marine's position was that the flanges were adequate, that the can had fallen because a portion of the net had parted from hard use (as nets sometimes do) and that Hopkins was himself negligent in straying--without warning Farrington--into a \"blind spot\" in which the reel blocked the control operator's view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict against Hopkins, finding separately that Jordan Marine had not been proved negligent and the vessel had not been proved unseaworthy. The district court denied Hopkins' motion for a new trial and he appeals. In this court he contends that the district court erred in two respects in instructing the jury. He also says that Jordan Marine's expert was not qualified to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the three claimed errors, one is of general interest. In a charge extending over 53 transcript pages, the district court at one point told the jury: \"If you find that the plaintiff's alleged injuries were the result of his failing to observe an obvious condition, you will find for the defendant.\" This, argues Hopkins, invited the jury to reject his claims based on the doctrine that a plaintiff may not recover for risks that he knowingly assumed. Jordan Marine says that the objection was not adequately preserved but we think that it may have been and will assume that it was.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assumption of the risk is a doctrine associated with common law tort liability. Like many such phrases, it has been used in more than one way, Prosser and Keeton on Torts, &#167; 68 at 480-98 (5th ed. 1984); Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103768\"><a href=\"/opinion/103768/tiller-v-atlantic-coast-line-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 68-69 (1943)(Frankfurter, J., concurring); but in one version, the doctrine was understood to block an employee from recovering for negligent behavior or conditions for which the employer was responsible if the risk was apparent to the employee and the employee continued voluntarily in his employment, thereby \"assuming the risk.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through stages that need not be described, see Gilmore &amp; Black, The Law of Admiralty 351-57 (2d. ed. 1975), assumption of the risk has now been eliminated as a defense to unseaworthiness claims and to claims for negligence under the Jones Act. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103121\"><a href=\"/opinion/103121/socony-vacuum-oil-co-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 429 (1939); The Arizona v. Anelich, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102648\"><a href=\"/opinion/102648/the-arizona-v-anelich/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 122 (1936). But contributory negligence remains as a defense to both sets of claims; the jury is told that if the plaintiff's own negligence played a part in causing the injury, then any liability of the defendant is to be reduced by the percentage or proportion by which the plaintiff contributed to his own injuries. Wilson v. Maritime Overseas Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756417\"><a href=\"/opinion/756417/eric-wilson-v-maritime-overseas-corporation-and-cambridge-tankers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 1998); 5 Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Inst. 90-29 at 90-52 (2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the instruction quoted above--\"failing to observe an obvious condition\"--appears at the end of a paragraph that occurs after the court had described both the unseaworthiness and negligence claims and had turned to describing the defense of contributory negligence. Wrapping up the discussion, the court then doubled back to say that the ship owner's duty was to provide a ship safe for a crew member \"who exercise[s] ordinary care\" but not necessarily to provide \"notice of a danger which is obvious through the use of ordinary senses.\" There then followed the objected to sentence which completed the paragraph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence does not say that assumption of an obvious risk is a defense to unseaworthiness or negligence on the part of the shipowner. Rather, it says that a ship is not unseaworthy or an owner negligent merely because the ship owner does not anticipate that a crew member will behave negligently. Possibly the statement goes a shade too far (perhaps in some repeat situations carelessness should be anticipated); but it is certainly not an instruction that--on account of the seaman's carelessness--the owner or ship can escape liability for its own negligent act or unseaworthy condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, in the next two paragraphs, the district court went out of its way to refute the inference drawn by Hopkins. The court said that while the plaintiff must act reasonably to avoid apparent dangers, a \"seaman does not assume the risk created by the failure of the ship to take [reasonable] precautions\" and \"that a seaman does not assume the risk of injury or illness from even obvious dangers or conditions if the cause of the injury is the ship's negligence, the failure to provide him with a safe place to work, or the failure to provide a safe and seaworthy vessel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Past judicial decisions dealing with individual instructions claimed to violate Socony-Vacuum are not much help because each package tends to be different. However, we have upheld instructions much closer to the line than this one, Myers v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"251808\"><a href=\"/opinion/251808/carter-myers-v-isthmian-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir. 1960), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></span> (1961), and Hopkins offers no precedent that condemns a combination of warning and qualification anything like the one in this case. That said, there is certainly an argument for a good set of pattern instructions in this area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hopkins' other claims of error can be dealt with more swiftly. He objects because at two other points in the instructions, the district court twice referred to the need to show that defendant's negligence was \"the\" proximate cause of Hopkin's injury. True, it would be enough to show that such negligence was \"a\" proximate cause; the wrongful act or condition need not be sole and exclusive cause. Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105460\"><a href=\"/opinion/105460/rogers-v-missouri-pacific-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 506 (1957). But the district court gave an emphatic instruction to this effect at the outset (emphasis added):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the law the defendant's negligence is a legal cause of an injury or damage if that negligence played any part, no matter how small, in bringing about or causing the injury or damage.
