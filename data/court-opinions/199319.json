See 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a) & (b) (providing\n\nfor dismissal on preliminary review of prisoner complaints\n\nagainst government officers or employees if the complaints\n\ndo    not    state    a    claim     for    relief).         In    doing    so,      the\n\nmagistrate judge suggested that it would be futile to amend\n\nthe       complaint       to    assert     a     RICO     claim    alleged      in     a\n\nsupplemental         complaint       filed       by   the   appellant.

We affirm.\n\n              On     appeal,       Michaud       argues     that   he     adequately\n\nalleged a RICO pattern of racketeering based on defendants'\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fpast and ongoing obstruction of justice, but we disagree.\n\nThe facts he asserted either failed to show conduct that\n\nwould   constitute    obstruction       of   justice,   or    failed   to\n\ndescribe conduct that would be indictable under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1503.
