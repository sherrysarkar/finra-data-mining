Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n         Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Defender, with whom Federal\nDefender Office was on brief, for appellant.\n\n     Jean B. Weld, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, and Michael J. Gunnison,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         July 19, 2001\n\f             BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge. The defendant-appellant,\n\nAlexander Blastos, was convicted by a jury of one count of wire\n\nfraud.   He was sentenced to sixty months in prison, three years\n\nof supervised release, and a special assessment of $100.00.                     On\n\nappeal, the defendant argues that his conviction should be\n\nreversed and he should be awarded a new trial because the jury\n\ninstruction     was   erroneous.       He    also   contends     that,   if    the\n\nconviction is affirmed, the case should be remanded to the\n\ndistrict court for resentencing because the district court erred\n\nin calculating the \"loss\" under section 2F1.1(b)(M) of the\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\").                  We disagree\n\non both points and affirm the district court.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n             On January 28, 1999, a grand jury in the District of\n\nNew   Hampshire      returned   a    one   count    indictment    against     the\n\ndefendant, charging him with wire fraud in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   ยง   1343.      The   indictment     charged    the    defendant      with\n\ndevising \"a scheme and artifice to defraud, and for obtaining\n\nmoney and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses,\n\nrepresentations and promises.\"             The indictment alleged that the\n\ndefendant \"falsely and fraudulently posed as a man of vast\n\nwealth, and used this and other misrepresentations to attempt to\n\nobtain at auction a yacht known as the 'Argo' or 'Christina'\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffrom the Government of Greece.\"      The yacht had been owned by\n\nAristotle Onassis.   The indictment also alleged that, as part of\n\nthe scheme and artifice, the defendant obtained and attempted to\n\nobtain various other goods and services, including loans, travel\n\nexpenses, meals, a Mycenaean dagger blade, and yacht management,\n\ndesign, and engineering services.      The indictment listed ten\n\ninterstate and international telefaxes made or caused to be made\n\nby the defendant.\n\n         The evidence at trial in fact showed that the defendant\n\nposed as a man of great wealth by falsifying loan agreements,\n\ninvestment statements and his net worth.      When in 1993, the\n\ndefendant bid $2.1 million on the yacht, his bid was accepted by\n\nthe Greek government.    Over the course of the next year, his\n\ncharade continued.   He used \"his\" yacht, which in reality he did\n\nnot yet own, as collateral for other business ventures and\n\nengaging yacht decorators and designers.    The facts make clear\n\nthat Blastos was far from the wealthy man he pretended to be;\n\nfor the years 1991 through 1995, the defendant reported income\n\ntotaling only $2,600.   He was the ultimate con man.\n\n         Jury trial commenced on April 4, 2000.     At the close\n\nof the government's case, the defendant moved, pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 29, for a directed verdict of acquittal; this motion\n\nwas denied.   The defendant rested without calling any witnesses.\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fHe then renewed his Rule 29 motion for a directed verdict of\n\nacquittal; this motion was also denied.\n\n            The      district   court      instructed     the     jury   and     the\n\ndefendant objected to the jury charge, arguing that \"materiality\n\nshould have been alleged as a separate element of the offense of\n\nwire fraud.\"         He also argued that the district court should have\n\ninstructed the jury pursuant to his proposed jury instruction,\n\nwhich included, inter alia, what the defendant contended was the\n\n\"materiality\" element of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1343.                The district court\n\ndenied the defendant's objection.              The jury returned a guilty\n\nverdict.     On August 21, 2000, the district court sentenced the\n\ndefendant       to    sixty   months'      imprisonment,    three        years    of\n\nsupervised release, and a special assessment of $100.00.                       This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                II.   Discussion\n\nA.      Jury Instruction\n\n            The defendant first argues that the district court\n\nerroneously instructed the jury on the element of materiality.\n\nHe contends that the district court's instruction failed to\n\ncomply with the Supreme Court's decision in                     Neder v. United\n\nStates, 527 U.S. 1, aff'd after remand, 197 F.3d 1122 (11th Cir.\n\n1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1261 (2000), which held, inter\n\nalia,    that    materiality     is   an   element   of    wire    fraud.        The\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fgovernment   argues     that,   although      the   instruction   \"may   not\n\nstrictly comply with the holding of Neder . . ., the issue of\n\n'materiality' was squarely placed before the jury in the court's\n\ninstructions . . . [and] the jury verdict would have been the\n\nsame even if the court had specifically instructed the jury that\n\n'materiality'     was    an   element    of   'scheme   and   artifice    to\n\ndefraud.'\"\n\n          In Neder, the Court held that \"the omission of an\n\nelement is an error that is subject to harmless-error analysis.\"\n\n527 U.S. at 15.     Assuming arguendo the district court omitted a\n\nsufficient materiality instruction, we apply a harmless-error\n\nanalysis and ask whether the conviction can stand because the\n\nerror was harmless, 1 that is, whether \"it appears beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute\n\nto the verdict obtained.\"       Neder, 527 U.S. at 15 (citing Chapman\n\nv. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967));               see also Sustache-\n\nRivera v. United States, 221 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied,      U.S.       , 121 S. Ct. 1364 (2000); United States v.\n\n\n\n\n    1 The government admittedly \"splits hairs\" when discussing\nwhich standard of review we should apply--either \"harmless-\nerror\" or \"plain error\"--depending on whether a proper objection\nwas made thereby preserving the argument. We need not discuss\nthe intricacies of this point because we ultimately determine\nthat the defendant's argument cannot survive even a harmless\nerror review.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fEscobar-De Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 162 (1st Cir. 1999), cert.\n\ndenied, 528 U.S. 1176 (2000).\n\n         The defendant requested that the district court include\n\nthe following instruction in its charge to the jury:\n\n                The indictment charges the defendant\n         with Wire Fraud.\n\n                In order to sustain this charge, the\n         government must prove each of the following\n         elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n                First, that there was scheme and\n         artifice to defraud or to obtain money or\n         property by false and fraudulent pretenses,\n         representations or promises, as alleged in\n         the indictment;\n\n                Second,   that        such   pretenses,\n         representations,    or        promises    were\n         material[;]\n\n                Third, that the defendant knowingly\n         and willfully participated in the scheme or\n         artifice to defraud, with knowledge of its\n         fraudulent nature and with specific intent\n         to defraud; and\n\n                Fourth, that in execution of that\n         scheme, the defendant used or caused the use\n         of wire communication in interstate or\n         foreign   commerce  as   specified  in   the\n         indictment.\n\n                           * * * *\n\n                The second element that the government\n         must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that\n         the false and fraudulent representation\n         [sic]   pretenses,    representations,    and\n         promises related to a material fact or\n         matter.    A material fact is one which a\n         reasonable person would consider important\n\n                                -6-\n\f         in determining his or her choice of action\n         in the transaction in question.        The\n         government does not have to prove that a\n         victim or victims actually relied on that\n         representation in making a decision.\n\n         The district court instructed the jury on the elements\n\nof the crime of wire fraud as follows:\n\n                In order to carry its burden of proof\n         with regard to the crime of wire fraud, as\n         charged in the indictment, the government\n         must prove each of the following essential\n         elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n                First, the existence of a scheme to\n         defraud or to obtain money or property by\n         means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\n         substantially as charged in the indictment.\n\n                Second, the defendant's knowing and\n         willful participation in this scheme with\n         the intent to defraud.\n\n                And third, the use of interstate or\n         foreign wire communications, on or about the\n         dates alleged, in furtherance of this\n         scheme.\n\n                           * * * *\n\n                The term false or fraudulent pretenses\n         means any false statements or assertions\n         that concern a material aspect of the matter\n         in question, that were either known to be\n         untrue when made or that were made with\n         reckless indifference to their truth and\n         that were made with the intent to defraud.\n         They include actual, direct false statements\n         as well as half-truths and the knowing\n         concealment of facts.\n\n               A material fact or matter is one that\n         has a natural tendency to influence or be\n\n\n                             -7-\n\f           capable of influencing the decision-maker to\n           whom it was addressed. . . .\n\n           The Supreme Court has held that \"a false statement is\n\nmaterial if it has a natural tendency to influence, or [is]\n\ncapable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body\n\nto which it was addressed.\"        Neder, 527 U.S. at 16 (alteration\n\nin original) (internal quotation marks omitted).                 After review\n\nof the entire record, we hold that no jury could reasonably find\n\nthat the false and fraudulent pretenses, representations or\n\npromises made by the defendant were not material as they had the\n\nnatural tendency to influence the decisionmaker.\n\n           The   record    establishes        that    the    defendant    was   a\n\nconvincing    liar.       The   record       is   replete    with   deliberate\n\nmisrepresentations made by the defendant with the intent to\n\ninfluence the decisionmaker.             Some examples of this are as\n\nfollows.\n\n           From the time that the defendant's $2.1 million bid for\n\nthe   yacht   was   accepted,     he    constantly      assured     the   Greek\n\ngovernment that he had sufficient funds to take possession of\n\nthe yacht, when in fact he did not.               To that end, the defendant\n\ndirected his assistant, Judith Tonks, to draw up a fictitious\n\npayment bond in the amount of $2,122,449 under the fictitious\n\nname \"Trans Global Guarantee Company, Ltd.\"                 This fake bond was\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fforged with a signature of S. Abraham Goldberg, and was faxed to\n\nthe Greek government.\n\n         The defendant further directed Tonks to send a letter\n\nto the representative of the Greek government saying:                     \"To\n\nfurther answer your query in regard to the status of funds, be\n\nassured that the $2,146,000 US dollars for the acquisition of\n\nthe boat is currently and has been available.\"             In a letter sent\n\nthree months later, the defendant assured the Government of\n\nGreece that five deposits representing payment for the yacht\n\nwould be made to the proper account by the end of the week.                  A\n\nfew days later, the defendant directed Tonks to send a telefax\n\nstating that he would forward $500,000 from his personal funds,\n\nbut would need to delay payment in full.\n\n         The Government of Greece, however, never saw a penny.\n\nThe fact that the Greek government did not sell the yacht to the\n\nnext highest bidder and allowed the defendant to drag his feet\n\nfor nearly seven months, keeping the yacht off the market for\n\nthat time, is strong evidence that it relied on the defendant's\n\nstatements.         Others   relied   on    the   defendant's      fraudulent\n\nstatements    and    misrepresentations.          For   example,   the   yacht\n\nbroker testified that she spent six months working on behalf of\n\nthe defendant and incurred considerable expense in the process.\n\nShe testified that she relied on the defendant's claim that he\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fowned    the     Christina.          On     this       uncontroverted         record,       no\n\nreasonable jury could find that the defendant was anything but\n\na liar and a con man, who deliberately made misrepresentations,\n\nwith the intent to influence the decisionmaker.\n\n               The failure to instruct the jury on \"materiality\" as\n\na specific element of wire fraud was therefore harmless error.\n\nMoreover, we note that the district court gave an instruction on\n\nmateriality          that,    although          it   did    not    meet     the    specific\n\nrequirements of Neder, accomplished the same purpose.                               Finding\n\nthat     the    error        was   harmless,         we    affirm     the    defendant's\n\nconviction.\n\nB.      Sentencing\n\n               Having affirmed the defendant's conviction, we turn now\n\nto his second argument on appeal, which concerns his sentence.\n\nThe    defendant       contends          that    the      district    court        erred    in\n\ncalculating the \"loss\" under U.S.S.G. ยง 2F1.1(b) (1994) and\n\nurges    us     to    remand       the    case       to    the    district        court    for\n\nresentencing.          At sentencing, the district court increased the\n\nbase offense level by twelve levels after calculating the loss\n\nto be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million.                         The district court\n\nfound a reasonable estimate of the potential or intended loss to\n\nbe the face value of the $2.1 million fraudulent bond issued by\n\nthe    fictitious       Trans       Global       Guarantee        Company     Ltd.         The\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\fdefendant argues that the loss should be measured only by the\n\nactual goods or services rendered to him.\n\n            We review the district court's interpretation of the\n\nloss provisions of the Guidelines de novo and review its factual\n\nfindings only for clear error.      United States v. Carrington, 96\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996).         \"In fraudulent loan application\n\ncases . . . the loss is the actual loss to the victim . . . .\n\nHowever, where the intended loss is greater than the actual\n\nloss, the intended loss is to be used.\"             U.S.S.G. ยง 2F1.1,\n\napplication note 7(b).         We have held, in United States v.\n\nHaggert, 980 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1992), that there are two\n\ntypes of fraud:\n\n            The first type of fraud implicates the \"true\n            con artist,\" who never intends to perform\n            the undertaking, such as the terms of the\n            contract or loan repayments, but who intends\n            only to pocket the money without rendering\n            any service in return. The second type of\n            fraud involves a person who would not have\n            attained the contract or loan but for the\n            fraud, but who fully intends to perform. In\n            the latter case, and only in the latter\n            case, is the intended loss not to be\n            considered for sentencing.\n\nId.   at   12-13   (footnote   omitted)   (citing   United   States   v.\n\nSchneider, 930 F.2d 555, 558 (7th Cir. 1991)).        It is clear from\n\nthe record that the defendant was the \"true con artist,\" and\n\ntherefore that the district court committed no legal error in\n\nsentencing the defendant according to the intended loss.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f              We    have     held    that     \"[i]ntended         loss      need    not    be\n\ndetermined         with    precision:         [t]he      court    need      only    make    a\n\nreasonable          estimate    of      the     loss,      given       the     available\n\ninformation.\"             United States v.          Stein, 233 F.3d 6, 18 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied,                    U.S.          , 121 S. Ct. 1406 (2000)\n\n(internal      quotation        marks       omitted)      (second        alteration        in\n\noriginal).         Based on the evidence, the district court determined\n\nthe reasonable estimate of the intended loss to be the face\n\nvalue    of    the    $2.1     million      fraudulent       bond      issued       by    the\n\nfictitious Trans Global Guarantee Company.                       After careful review\n\nof the record, we hold that this does not constitute clear\n\nerror.        The    district       court    properly      calculated        the     \"loss\"\n\nprovision      of    the    Guidelines        and   we    affirm      the    defendant's\n\nsentence.\n\n                                 III.

He was sentenced to sixty months in prison, three years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100.00. On appeal, the defendant argues that his conviction should be reversed and he should be awarded a new trial because the jury instruction was erroneous. He also contends that, if the conviction is affirmed, the case should be remanded to the district court for resentencing because the district court erred in calculating the \"loss\" under section 2F1.1(b)(M) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\"). We disagree on both points and affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 1999, a grand jury in the District of New Hampshire returned a one count indictment against the defendant, charging him with wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1343. The indictment charged the defendant with devising \"a scheme and artifice to defraud, and for obtaining money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises.\" The indictment alleged that the defendant \"falsely and fraudulently posed as a man of vast wealth, and used this and other misrepresentations to attempt to obtain at auction a yacht known as the 'Argo' or 'Christina' from the Government of Greece.\" The yacht had been owned by Aristotle Onassis. The indictment also alleged that, as part of the scheme and artifice, the defendant obtained and attempted to obtain various other goods and services, including loans, travel expenses, meals, a Mycenaean dagger blade, and yacht management, design, and engineering services. The indictment listed ten interstate and international telefaxes made or caused to be made by the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence at trial in fact showed that the defendant posed as a man of great wealth by falsifying loan agreements, investment statements and his net worth. When in 1993, the defendant bid $2.1 million on the yacht, his bid was accepted by the Greek government. Over the course of the next year, his charade continued. He used \"his\" yacht, which in reality he did not yet own, as collateral for other business ventures and engaging yacht decorators and designers. The facts make clear that Blastos was far from the wealthy man he pretended to be; for the years 1991 through 1995, the defendant reported income totaling only $2,600. He was the ultimate con man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury trial commenced on April 4, 2000. At the close of the government's case, the defendant moved, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29, for a directed verdict of acquittal; this motion was denied. The defendant rested without calling any witnesses. He then renewed his Rule 29 motion for a directed verdict of acquittal; this motion was also denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury and the defendant objected to the jury charge, arguing that \"materiality should have been alleged as a separate element of the offense of wire fraud.\" He also argued that the district court should have instructed the jury pursuant to his proposed jury instruction, which included, inter alia, what the defendant contended was the \"materiality\" element of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1343. The district court denied the defendant's objection. The jury returned a guilty verdict. On August 21, 2000, the district court sentenced the defendant to sixty months' imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100.00. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jury Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant first argues that the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the element of materiality. He contends that the district court's instruction failed to comply with the Supreme Court's decision in Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, aff'd after remand, 197 F.3d 1122 (11th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1261 (2000), which held, inter alia, that materiality is an element of wire fraud. The government argues that, although the instruction \"may not strictly comply with the holding of Neder . . ., the issue of 'materiality' was squarely placed before the jury in the court's instructions . . . [and] the jury verdict would have been the same even if the court had specifically instructed the jury that 'materiality' was an element of 'scheme and artifice to defraud.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Neder, the Court held that \"the omission of an element is an error that is subject to harmless-error analysis.\" 527 U.S. at 15. Assuming arguendo the district court omitted a sufficient materiality instruction, we apply a harmless-error analysis and ask whether the conviction can stand because the error was harmless,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that is, whether \"it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 15 (citing Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)); see also Sustache-Rivera v. United States, 221 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 121 S. Ct. 1364 (2000); United States v. Escobar-De Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 162 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1176 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant requested that the district court include the following instruction in its charge to the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charges the defendant with Wire Fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to sustain this charge, the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, that there was scheme and artifice to defraud or to obtain money or property by false and fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, as alleged in the indictment;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, that such pretenses, representations, or promises were material[;]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, that the defendant knowingly and willfully participated in the scheme or artifice to defraud, with knowledge of its fraudulent nature and with specific intent to defraud; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, that in execution of that scheme, the defendant used or caused the use of wire communication in interstate or foreign commerce as specified in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second element that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the false and fraudulent representation [sic] pretenses, representations, and promises related to a material fact or matter. A material fact is one which a reasonable person would consider important in determining his or her choice of action in the transaction in question. The government does not have to prove that a victim or victims actually relied on that representation in making a decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury on the elements of the crime of wire fraud as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to carry its burden of proof with regard to the crime of wire fraud, as charged in the indictment, the government must prove each of the following essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the existence of a scheme to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, substantially as charged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the defendant's knowing and willful participation in this scheme with the intent to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And third, the use of interstate or foreign wire communications, on or about the dates alleged, in furtherance of this scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term false or fraudulent pretenses means any false statements or assertions that concern a material aspect of the matter in question, that were either known to be untrue when made or that were made with reckless indifference to their truth and that were made with the intent to defraud. They include actual, direct false statements as well as half-truths and the knowing concealment of facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A material fact or matter is one that has a natural tendency to influence or be capable of influencing the decision-maker to whom it was addressed. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that \"a false statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence, or [is] capable of influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it was addressed.\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 16 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). After review of the entire record, we hold that no jury could reasonably find that the false and fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises made by the defendant were not material as they had the natural tendency to influence the decision maker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record establishes that the defendant was a convincing liar. The record is replete with deliberate misrepresentations made by the defendant with the intent to influence the decision maker. Some examples of this are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the time that the defendant's $2.1 million bid for the yacht was accepted, he constantly assured the Greek government that he had sufficient funds to take possession of the yacht, when in fact he did not. To that end, the defendant directed his assistant, Judith Tonks, to draw up a fictitious payment bond in the amount of $2,122,449 under the fictitious name \"Trans Global Guarantee Company, Ltd.\" This fake bond was forged with a signature of S. Abraham Goldberg, and was faxed to the Greek government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant further directed Tonks to send a letter to the representative of the Greek government saying: \"To further answer your query in regard to the status of funds, be assured that the $2,146,000 US dollars for the acquisition of the boat is currently and has been available.\" In a letter sent three months later, the defendant assured the Government of Greece that five deposits representing payment for the yacht would be made to the proper account by the end of the week. A few days later, the defendant directed Tonks to send a telefax stating that he would forward $500,000 from his personal funds, but would need to delay payment in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government of Greece, however, never saw a penny. The fact that the Greek government did not sell the yacht to the next highest bidder and allowed the defendant to drag his feet for nearly seven months, keeping the yacht off the market for that time, is strong evidence that it relied on the defendant's statements. Others relied on the defendant's fraudulent statements and misrepresentations. For example, the yacht broker testified that she spent six months working on behalf of the defendant and incurred considerable expense in the process. She testified that she relied on the defendant's claim that he owned the Christina. On this uncontroverted record, no reasonable jury could find that the defendant was anything but a liar and a con man, who deliberately made misrepresentations, with the intent to influence the decision maker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The failure to instruct the jury on \"materiality\" as a specific element of wire fraud was therefore harmless error. Moreover, we note that the district court gave an instruction on materiality that, although it did not meet the specific requirements of Neder, accomplished the same purpose. Finding that the error was harmless, we affirm the defendant's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having affirmed the defendant's conviction, we turn now to his second argument on appeal, which concerns his sentence. The defendant contends that the district court erred in calculating the \"loss\" under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2F1.1(b) (1994) and urges us to remand the case to the district court for resentencing. At sentencing, the district court increased the base offense level by twelve levels after calculating the loss to be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million. The district court found a reasonable estimate of the potential or intended loss to be the face value of the $2.1 million fraudulent bond issued by the fictitious Trans Global Guarantee Company Ltd. The defendant argues that the loss should be measured only by the actual goods or services rendered to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's interpretation of the loss provisions of the Guidelines de novo and review its factual findings only for clear error. United States v. Carrington, 96 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996). \"In fraudulent loan application cases . . . the loss is the actual loss to the victim . . . . However, where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, the intended loss is to be used.\" U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2F1.1, application note 7(b). We have held, in United States v. Haggert, 980 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1992), that there are two types of fraud:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first type of fraud implicates the \"true con artist,\" who never intends to perform the undertaking, such as the terms of the contract or loan repayments, but who intends only to pocket the money without rendering any service in return. The second type of fraud involves a person who would not have attained the contract or loan but for the fraud, but who fully intends to perform. In the latter case, and only in the latter case, is the intended loss not to be considered for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 12-13 (footnote omitted) (citing United States v. Schneider, 930 F.2d 555, 558 (7th Cir. 1991)). It is clear from the record that the defendant was the \"true con artist,\" and therefore that the district court committed no legal error in sentencing the defendant according to the intended loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that \"[i]ntended loss need not be determined with precision: [t]he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\" United States v. Stein, 233 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 121 S. Ct. 1406 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (second alteration in original). Based on the evidence, the district court determined the reasonable estimate of the intended loss to be the face value of the $2.1 million fraudulent bond issued by the fictitious Trans Global Guarantee Company. After careful review of the record, we hold that this does not constitute clear error. The district court properly calculated the \"loss\" provision of the Guidelines and we affirm the defendant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm both the defendant's conviction and his sentence. Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The government admittedly \"splits hairs\" when discussing which standard of review we should apply--either \"harmless-error\" or \"plain error\"--depending on whether a proper objection was made thereby preserving the argument. We need not discuss the intricacies of this point because we ultimately determine that the defendant's argument cannot survive even a harmless error review.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

After review of the entire record, we hold that no jury could reasonably find that the false and fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises made by the defendant were not material as they had the natural tendency to influence the decision maker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record establishes that the defendant was a convincing liar. The record is replete with deliberate misrepresentations made by the defendant with the intent to influence the decision maker. Some examples of this are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the time that the defendant's $2.1 million bid for the yacht was accepted, he constantly assured the Greek government that he had sufficient funds to take possession of the yacht, when in fact he did not. To that end, the defendant directed his assistant, Judith Tonks, to draw up a fictitious payment bond in the amount of $2,122,449 under the fictitious name \"Trans Global Guarantee Company, Ltd.\" This fake bond was forged with a signature of S. Abraham Goldberg, and was faxed to the Greek government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant further directed Tonks to send a letter to the representative of the Greek government saying: \"To further answer your query in regard to the status of funds, be assured that the $2,146,000 US dollars for the acquisition of the boat is currently and has been available.\" In a letter sent three months later, the defendant assured the Government of Greece that five deposits representing payment for the yacht would be made to the proper account by the end of the week. A few days later, the defendant directed Tonks to send a telefax stating that he would forward $500,000 from his personal funds, but would need to delay payment in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government of Greece, however, never saw a penny. The fact that the Greek government did not sell the yacht to the next highest bidder and allowed the defendant to drag his feet for nearly seven months, keeping the yacht off the market for that time, is strong evidence that it relied on the defendant's statements. Others relied on the defendant's fraudulent statements and misrepresentations. For example, the yacht broker testified that she spent six months working on behalf of the defendant and incurred considerable expense in the process. She testified that she relied on the defendant's claim that he owned the Christina. On this uncontroverted record, no reasonable jury could find that the defendant was anything but a liar and a con man, who deliberately made misrepresentations, with the intent to influence the decision maker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The failure to instruct the jury on \"materiality\" as a specific element of wire fraud was therefore harmless error. Moreover, we note that the district court gave an instruction on materiality that, although it did not meet the specific requirements of Neder, accomplished the same purpose. Finding that the error was harmless, we affirm the defendant's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having affirmed the defendant's conviction, we turn now to his second argument on appeal, which concerns his sentence. The defendant contends that the district court erred in calculating the \"loss\" under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2F1.1(b) (1994) and urges us to remand the case to the district court for resentencing. At sentencing, the district court increased the base offense level by twelve levels after calculating the loss to be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million. The district court found a reasonable estimate of the potential or intended loss to be the face value of the $2.1 million fraudulent bond issued by the fictitious Trans Global Guarantee Company Ltd. The defendant argues that the loss should be measured only by the actual goods or services rendered to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's interpretation of the loss provisions of the Guidelines de novo and review its factual findings only for clear error.

Carrington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196983\"><a href=\"/opinion/196983/united-states-v-carrington/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 1996). \"In fraudulent loan application cases . . . the loss is the actual loss to the victim . . . . However, where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, the intended loss is to be used.\" U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2F1.1, application note 7(b). We have held, in United States v. Haggert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595476\"><a href=\"/opinion/595476/united-states-v-lloyd-r-haggert/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 1992), that there are two types of fraud:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first type of fraud implicates the \"true con artist,\" who never intends to perform the undertaking, such as the terms of the contract or loan repayments, but who intends only to pocket the money without rendering any service in return. The second type of fraud involves a person who would not have attained the contract or loan but for the fraud, but who fully intends to perform. In the latter case, and only in the latter case, is the intended loss not to be considered for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 12-13 (footnote omitted) (citing United States v.

It is clear from the record that the defendant was the \"true con artist,\" and therefore that the district court committed no legal error in sentencing the defendant according to the intended loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that \"[i]ntended loss need not be determined with precision: [t]he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\" United States v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1406</span></span> (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (second alteration in original). Based on the evidence, the district court determined the reasonable estimate of the intended loss to be the face value of the $2.1 million fraudulent bond issued by the fictitious Trans Global Guarantee Company. After careful review of the record, we hold that this does not constitute clear error. The district court properly calculated the \"loss\" provision of the Guidelines and we affirm the defendant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm both the defendant's conviction and his sentence.
