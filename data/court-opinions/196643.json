Young was  convicted with co-\r\n\ndefendant Dennis Johnson (\"Johnson\") (1) of conspiring to possess\r\n\nwith intent to  distribute heroin  in violation of  21 U.S.C.    \r\n\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 846, and (2)  of possession of heroin\r\n\nwith  intent  to  distribute it  in  violation  of  21 U.S.C.    \r\n\n841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C).   After the close of evidence  in his\r\n\njury trial, he waived his right to trial by jury and submitted to\r\n\na verdict  by the court.  The district court found him guilty and\r\n\nsentenced him to ninety-two  months' imprisonment, to be followed\r\n\nby five years of supervised release.  We affirm both the judgment\r\n\nand the sentence of the district court.  \r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In December 1994, Young  met Al Hendricks (\"Hendricks\")\r\n\nwhile  the two men were enrolled in a drug detoxification program\r\n\nat  a Maine hospital.   At trial, Young  testified that Hendricks\r\n\nconstantly talked about drugs, disrupting Young's therapy.  Young\r\n\nand Hendricks continued  to communicate after Young  had left the\r\n\ndetoxification   program.     Shortly  thereafter,   starting  on\r\n\nDecember 27,  Hendricks,  on  his own  initiative,  taped  twelve\r\n\nconversations with Young.\r\n\n          On the first tape,  Young told Hendricks he had  sent a\r\n\ncar to retrieve twenty-one grams of an unspecified substance, and\r\n\nwhen Hendricks  said he  wanted some drugs,  Young and  Hendricks\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nagreed  on  a  meeting place.    On  January  5, 1995,  Hendricks\r\n\ncontacted the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).  On January 9, 1995,\r\n\nHendricks was  formally enrolled  as an informer.   Subsequently,\r\n\nHendricks and DEA Agent  Henry J. O'Donoghue (\"Agent O'Donoghue\")\r\n\narranged a deal  whereby Young  and Johnson would  travel to  the\r\n\nBronx to purchase heroin,  which they would then resell  to Agent\r\n\nO'Donoghue (the \"controlled  buy\").  On  January 13, 1995,  Young\r\n\nwas  arrested at the  Greyhound Bus terminal  in Portland, Maine,\r\n\nafter he conveyed heroin to Agent O'Donoghue.\r\n\n          Although  not  included in  the  charge  before it,  at\r\n\nsentencing the  district court  included two other  quantities of\r\n\ndrugs under the rubric of relevant conduct pursuant to the United\r\n\nStates  Sentencing Commission's Sentencing Guidelines.  First, in\r\n\nNovember  1994, Officer Brian  Higgins of the  Maine State Police\r\n\nfound Young unconscious in Machias, Maine, in an automobile owned\r\n\nby  Johnson,  and in  possession  of approximately  11  ounces of\r\n\ncocaine.   The district court took this cocaine into account (the\r\n\n\"Machias cocaine\")  in computing Young's sentence  in the instant\r\n\nconviction.  Additionally, Johnson  testified that Young had sold\r\n\nhim heroin for almost  two years previous to Young's  January 13,\r\n\n1995,  arrest.   The district  court also  took this  heroin into\r\n\naccount (the  \"Johnson heroin\") in computing  Young's sentence in\r\n\nthe instant conviction.\r\n\n          At trial, after the  district court refused to instruct\r\n\nthe jury on the defense of entrapment, Young  waived his right to\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\na jury trial,  submitted to a verdict of  the district court, and\r\n\nwas convicted and sentenced.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n             A.  The Requested Entrapment Instruction\r                       A.  The Requested Entrapment Instruction\r\n\n          Young  challenges  the  district  court's   refusal  to\r\n\ninstruct the jury on  his defense of entrapment.   \"[A] defendant\r\n\nis  entitled  to a  jury instruction  on  entrapment if  there is\r\n\nrecord  evidence  which  fairly   supports  the  claims  of  both\r\n\ngovernment  inducement  of  the  crime and  defendant's  lack  of\r\n\npredisposition to engage in it.\"  United States v. Rodr guez, 858\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  809,  814 (1st  Cir.  1988).   The record  must  show \"hard\r\n\nevidence,\" which if believed by a rational juror,  \"would suffice\r\n\nto  create a  reasonable doubt  as to  whether  government actors\r\n\ninduced the defendant to perform  a criminal act that he was  not\r\n\npredisposed  to commit.\"  Id.   The existence  or nonexistence of\r                                       \r\n\nthe required quantity of evidence in a given case is  a matter of\r\n\nlaw for  the  court, see  id.  at 809,  and  thus our  review  is\r                                       \r\n\nplenary, reading the record evidence  in the light most favorable\r\n\nto  the defense.  See United States  v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 217\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992);  Rodr guez, 858 F.2d  at 814.  Once  a defendant\r                                     \r\n\ncarries  his or her entry-level burden,  the government may prove\r\n\nthe absence of  entrapment by showing, beyond a reasonable doubt,\r\n\n\"that the defendant was disposed to commit the criminal act prior\r\n\nto  being first  approached by  government agents.\"   Gifford, 17\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          We conclude  that even assuming all  of Hendricks' acts\r\n\ncould be  considered government conduct,1 the  district court did\r\n\nnot err in finding a  lack of \"hard evidence,\" which if  believed\r\n\nby a rational juror,  would suffice to create a  reasonable doubt\r\n\nas  to whether Hendricks committed acts that would meet the legal\r\n\ndefinition  of entrapment.2  To be entitled to the instruction on\r\n\nentrapment,  a  defendant  must   show  hard  evidence  that,  if\r\n\nbelieved,  would  lead  a  reasonable  person  to  the  requisite\r\n\nconclusion; it  is not enough that there  be doubt in the absence\r\n\nof evidence  on a given point.   See United States  v. Pratt, 913\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 982, 988 (1st Cir. 1990); Rodr guez, 858 F.2d at 814.  As we\r                                                  \r\n\nhave previously stated,\r\n\n            [i]f an accused suggests  that entrapment\r\n            belongs in the case, it  seems not unfair\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Young argues that  all of Hendricks'  acts, dating from their\r\nfirst  meeting,  should  come  under  the  lens  of  entrapment's\r\nexamination for improper government  action that contaminated the\r\nprosecution.   Young asserts that Hendricks  intended to become a\r\ngovernment agent  from the  beginning, when he  befriended Young,\r\nand  thus all of Hendricks'  actions constitute the  actions of a\r\ngovernment  agent.  Relying on Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n369  (1958), Young contends that even though there is no \"private\r\nentrapment\" defense,  see United States v. Gendron,  18 F.3d 955,\r                                                            \r\n962  (1st Cir.  1994) (collecting  cases), because  Hendricks may\r\nwell  have began his association  with Young with  a view towards\r\nturning   government   informant,   the   government   \"ratified\"\r\nHendricks' acts, including those committed before Hendricks first\r\ncontacted O'Donoghue.\r\n\n   Because we find no  hard evidence of inducement even  those of\r\nHendricks'  acts that pre-date  his enrollment  with the  DEA, we\r\nassume the  validity of  Young's  novel theory  of entrapment  by\r\ngovernment ratification without ruling on it.\r\n\n2  We do not consider this definition with respect to O'Donoghue,\r\nbecause  the  record,   including  Young's  testimony  (described\r\ninfra),  shows that  O'Donoghue  had minimal  contact with  Young\r               \r\nbefore the controlled buy that led to this appeal.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n            to expect  him to  point to a  modicum of\r\n            evidence  supportive  of his  suggestion.\r\n            The alternative --  that the  prosecution\r\n            be forced to disprove entrapment in every\r\n            case -- seems plainly unacceptable.\r\n\nId. at 813-14  (citations omitted).   In the entrapment  context,\r             \r\n\ninducement must be such that it implicates concerns of government\r\n\n\"overreaching,\" see  Gendron, 18 F.3d at  962; solicitation alone\r                                      \r\n\ndoes not suffice as inducement,  see id. at 961.  This  court has\r                                                  \r\n\npreviously stated that \r\n\n            [a]n improper \"inducement,\" however, goes\r\n            beyond providing an ordinary \"opportunity\r\n            to  commit a  crime.\"    An  \"inducement\"\r\n            consists   of   an   \"opportunity\"   plus\r                                                               \r\n            something  else  -- typically,  excessive\r\n            pressure  by  the  government   upon  the\r\n            defendant  or   the  government's  taking\r\n            advantage of an alternative, non-criminal\r\n            type of motive.\r\n\nSee id. (citation omitted) (emphasis  in original).  Examples  of\r                 \r\n\nimproper  \"inducement\"  include  intimidation,   threats,  dogged\r\n\ninsistence,   and  \"arm-twisting   based   on   need,   sympathy,\r\n\nfriendship,  or the like.\"  United  States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n468; see also Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.\r                               \r\n\n          The  district  court concluded  that  Young essentially\r\n\ntestified  that  there was  no inducement  on  the part  of Agent\r\n\nO'Donoghue.   Reviewing  the record,  we agree.   In  response to\r\n\nrepeated questioning on cross-examination,  Young failed to point\r\n\nto  any  statement  or  action  of  Agent O'Donoghue  that  Young\r\n\nconsidered inducement.   In  fact, by  his  own testimony,  Young\r\n\npinpointed  the  time  of  any  inducement to  his  contact  with\r\n\nHendricks  in the  hospital.   With  respect to  Hendricks, Young\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nattempted  to depict  a pattern of  inducement.   Young testified\r\n\nthat  Hendricks  allegedly  induced  him  to  sell  narcotics  by\r\n\nbefriending him  while both were  in treatment,  by telling  \"war\r\n\nstories,\"  by \"com[ing] into [his]  hospital room,\" and by saying\r\n\nthat he could arrange for Young to obtain drugs.  Young testified\r\n\nthat Hendricks  allegedly led him  into selling drugs  by telling\r\n\nYoung \"to trust him,\" and that \"[b]y just being there,\" Hendricks\r\n\n\"was the answer to everything.\"\r\n\n          Even  viewing the  record most  favorably to  Young, we\r\n\nfind  that the district court  properly found that  Young did not\r\n\nproduce   \"hard   evidence\"   that   Hendricks   used   coercion,\r\n\nintimidation  or   any  promise   of  benefits  other   than  the\r\n\nopportunity to commit the crime.  Young's own trial testimony was\r\n\nthat  Hendricks'  actions  amounted   to  talking  about   drugs,\r\n\nreferring  to  the  availability  of  drugs,  and  arranging  the\r\n\npurchase  with  O'Donoghue.   There  was  no  testimony or  other\r\n\nevidence, let alone \"hard evidence,\" of coercion or intimidation.\r\n\nCf., e.g.,  United States v. Becerra, 992 F.2d 960, 963 (9th Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1993) (describing government officials who used threats against a\r\n\ndefendant's family);  United States v.  Groll, 992 F.2d  755, 759\r                                                       \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1993) (describing government officials who called every\r\n\nday and \"began threatening\" the defendant).  Unlike in Sherman v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States, 356 U.S. 369  (1958), there was  no evidence that\r                        \r\n\nHendricks feigned physical suffering due  to withdrawal symptoms.\r\n\nId.  at 373.   While  there was  testimony that  Hendricks showed\r             \r\n\nYoung his track marks,  there was no testimony by  Young, nor any\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nother  evidence, of any attempt  to attract sympathy  in order to\r\n\nobtain  drugs  for Hendricks  or  O'Donoghue.   With  respect  to\r\n\ncoercion  or emotional appeals to sympathy, then, we find no hard\r\n\nevidence  in the record regarding  the instant offense that would\r\n\nsatisfy the required showing of inducement, that is, \"opportunity\r\n\nplus something else.\"\r\n\n          Similarly, while  there have been cases  in which pleas\r\n\nbased  upon  a  defendant's  friendship with  an  informant  have\r\n\njustified a finding of entrapment,  see, e.g., Sorrells v. United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates, 287  U.S. 435,  440-41  (1932) (using  sentiment of  \"one\r                \r\n\nformer  war  buddy  . .  .  for  another\"  to  get liquor  during\r\n\nprohibition),  there was no such  evidence here.   There was hard\r\n\nevidence, in the form of Young's testimony, from which a rational\r\n\njury  could have inferred  a friendship with  Hendricks, albeit a\r\n\nrecently established one.  There was no testimony from Young, nor\r\n\nwas there any other  hard evidence, that Hendricks made  any plea\r\n\nbased  upon any  degree  of  friendship  that  the  two  men  had\r\n\nestablished  during  their  brief acquaintanceship,  which  Young\r\n\ntestified began on or about December 23, 1994, to encourage Young\r\n\nto do  anything that he  was not  predisposed to do.   We  cannot\r\n\nfind, and Young does not cite authority for, the proposition that\r\n\nfriendship, without  a plea predicated upon  friendship, suffices\r\n\nlegally as inducement; indeed case law suggests that, as a matter\r\n\nof  law,  friendship   alone  does   not  constitute   sufficient\r\n\ninducement.  See,  e.g., United  States v. Ford,  918 F.2d  1343,\r                                                         \r\n\n1348  (8th Cir.  1990) (concluding  that, \"as  a matter  of law,\"\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nevidence that a defendant thought he or she was doing a favor for\r\n\na  friend by selling that  friend illegal drugs  does not suffice\r\n\nfor showing inducement to obtain  entrapment instruction); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Jones, 487 F.2d 676, 678 (9th Cir. 1973) (\"[f]riendship\r                         \r\n\nis  not,  by  itself,   a  sufficient  inducement  to  constitute\r\n\nentrapment as a matter of law\").  The sole  evidence pertinent to\r\n\nhow  Hendricks purportedly  managed  to \"lead\"  Young to  selling\r\n\ndrugs  to Agent  O'Donoghue is  Young's testimony  that Hendricks\r\n\nsaid \"I have a  friend that wants heroin and I  will set you up.\"\r\n\nThere is no accompanying allegation of coercion, threat, or  plea\r\n\nbased upon friendship or sympathy that would constitute more than\r\n\nmere  opportunity,   which  alone  cannot   suffice  legally   as\r\n\ninducement.  See Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.3\r                                  \r\n\n          Furthermore,  while  Young   contends  that   Hendricks\r\n\ndisrupted his drug treatment  program by bringing up the  subject\r\n\nof  drugs in  conversation,  we can  find  no authority  for  the\r\n\nproposition  that  merely affording  the opportunity  for illegal\r\n\nactivity can qualify legally as  inducement simply because of the\r\n\ncontext, were Young to make such an argument.  In fact, authority\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3    Accordingly, we  need not  consider the  additional required\r\nfinding  of predisposition.    However, we  note that  Hendricks'\r\nfirst tape, from  December 27, 1994, contains strong  evidence of\r\nYoung's interest in  providing drugs to  Hendricks.  Without  any\r\nrequest  from Hendricks,  Young brings  up the  subject of  a car\r\n\"going in  five minutes\" that is  going to obtain 21  grams of an\r\nunidentified  substance that  would be \"enough  for all  of you.\"\r\nWhat hard evidence existed regarding predisposition suggests that\r\nnot  only did Hendricks not  offer more than  an opportunity, but\r\nalso,  in fact, that Young  may already have  been predisposed to\r\nsell  or provide  drugs  to  others,  and  that  Young  may  have\r\ninitiated the  component of his relationship  with Hendricks that\r\ninvolved the buying and selling of illegal drugs.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nexists for the  proposition that context  is irrelevant where  an\r\n\ninformant's action was \"nothing more than a solicitation to act.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.

The December 27 recording, in fact, shows that Young was in\r\n\nthe process of obtaining drugs before offering them to his friend\r\n\nHendricks.   In  fact, at  trial,  Young provided  the  following\r\n\nsummary of how Hendricks \"led\" him into selling drugs: \"[b]y just\r\n\nbeing there, he was the answer to everything.\"  Assuming, without\r\n\nconcluding,  that Hendricks was a government agent, we might find\r\n\nit distasteful that  a government agent was  even present talking\r\n\nabout drugs in  a detoxification  center.  But  this circuit  has\r\n\nnever  held, and we  do not now  hold, that the  context in which\r\n\ngovernment conduct  occurs waives the defendant's  burden to show\r\n\nhard  evidence of  legally  sufficient inducement.   Without  the\r\n\nrequisite evidence, as here, we conclude that  the district court\r\n\nproperly  found  that  Young was  not  entitled  to  have a  jury\r\n\nconsider  his entrapment  defense,  and therefore  we affirm  the\r\n\ndistrict court's decision.\r\n\n                         B.  The Sentence\r                                   B.  The Sentence\r\n\n          At sentencing, the district  court found the total drug\r\n\nquantity  attributable  to  Young  to  be  equivalent  to  284.41\r\n\nkilograms  of marijuana, resulting in a Base Offense Level of 26.\r\n\nSee U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c)(7).  In making this finding, the District\r             \r\n\nCourt found three distinct quantities of illicit drugs: (1) 17.96\r\n\ngrams of heroin involved  in the controlled buy which  formed the\r\n\npredicate  for  the  prosecution  (translating  to  17.96  kg  of\r\n\nmarijuana  equivalent); (2)  453  grams of  cocaine  representing\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ndrugs found on the defendant upon his arrest in Machias, Maine in\r\n\nNovember   of  1994   (translating  to   90.6  kg   of  marijuana\r\n\nequivalent);  and (3) 176 grams of  heroin representing drugs the\r\n\ndistrict court found that  Young had sold to Johnson  over a two-\r\n\nyear period preceding the subject prosecution (translating to 176\r\n\nkg of marijuana equivalent).\r\n\n          On appeal, Young contends that the district court erred\r\n\nby including both the  Machias cocaine and the Johnson  heroin in\r\n\ncalculating his sentence.   According to Young, the circumstances\r\n\nsurrounding the Machias cocaine and the Johnson heroin should not\r\n\nhave been  factored into \"relevant  conduct\" for the  purposes of\r\n\nhis sentence,  because sufficient nexus with  his charged conduct\r\n\ndid not exist.\r\n\n          To bring  uncharged conduct  into play, the  government\r\n\nmust  show a sufficient nexus between the conduct and the offense\r\n\nof conviction by  a preponderance  of the evidence.   See  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Sklar, 920  F.2d 107, 110  (1st Cir. 1990).   Absent a\r                          \r\n\nmistake  of  law, we  review only  for  clear error  the district\r\n\ncourt's conclusions that drugs  were part of the same  conduct or\r\n\nscheme or plan.  See id. at 110-11.\r                                  \r\n\n          Under  the  Sentencing  Guidelines, \"relevant  conduct\"\r\n\nincludes all acts \"that  were part of the same course  of conduct\r\n\nor  common  scheme  or  plan  as  the offense  of  conviction[.]\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.3.  For two or more offenses to be considered part\r\n\nof a common scheme or plan, \"they must be substantially connected\r\n\nto each  other by  at least  one  common factor,  such as  common\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nvictims,  common accomplices,  common purpose,  or similar  modus\r                                                                           \r\n\noperandi.\"  U.S.S.G.   1B1.3, comment. (n.9(A)).\r                  \r\n\n          We  conclude  that  the circumstances  surrounding  the\r\n\nMachias  cocaine and the charged  offense4 were part  of a common\r\n\nscheme or plan because  they evince at least two  common factors:\r\n\na common source for the drugs in New York and common transport of\r\n\nthe drugs  to Maine.  In his appellate brief, Young concedes that\r\n\nhe obtained both the  Machias cocaine and the heroin  involved in\r\n\nthe  charged   offense  from  the   same  source  in   New  York.\r\n\nAdditionally, as  in the  charged offense, he  apparently brought\r\n\nthe drugs from  there to  Maine.  Furthermore,  at trial,  agents\r\n\ntestified  that a subsequent search  of his house  turned up used\r\n\nand unused syringes,  several sets of  scales covered with  white\r\n\npowder, marijuana, pills and other drug residue.  Thus, there was\r\n\nevidence tending to tie the circumstances surrounding the Machias\r\n\ncocaine  and the  offense conduct  together as  part of  a common\r\n\nscheme whereby Young conveyed drugs from his supplier in New York\r\n\nto buyers in Maine.5\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  Because we find  proper the district court's inclusion of  the\r\nMachias cocaine,  we do not  consider whether the  Johnson heroin\r\nwas correctly included,  since even  if the  Johnson heroin  were\r\nexcluded,  it would  not  change Young's  base  offense level  or\r\nsentencing  range.   \"[W]hen correction  of  a finding  would not\r\nchange  the applicable  offense  level or  affect the  sentencing\r\nrange, any error therein would  necessarily be harmless.\"  United\r                                                                           \r\nStates v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 603 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                           \r\n\n5  Since we find that the Machias cocaine and the heroin involved\r\nin the  charged offense  form part  of a  common scheme  or plan,\r\naccording  to  U.S.S.G.    1B1.3,  these drug  quantities  may be\r\nincluded together under the rubric of relevant conduct.   Because\r\n  1B1.3 requires a finding of either a \"common scheme or plan\" or\r                                                                           \r\nthe  \"same course of conduct,\" we do not consider Young's further\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n          Additionally,  Young  argues that  the  offense conduct\r\n\ninvolved selling cocaine to Agent O'Donoghue for expected further\r\n\ndistribution  in  Canada,  while  assuming that  if  the  Machias\r\n\ncocaine was to be  resold, it would presumably be  sold in Maine.\r\n\nWithout concluding that different destinations require a  finding\r\n\nthat the incidents cannot be part  of a common scheme or plan, we\r\n\nfind this  argument unconvincing  given that the  offense conduct\r\n\ninvolved selling  drugs in  Portland, Maine, and  that apparently\r\n\nAgent O'Donoghue was to  handle further distribution.  Certainly,\r\n\nwe do not believe that it was clear error for  the district court\r\n\nto find a common scheme on these facts.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  while Young  testified  that the  Machias\r\n\ncocaine  was all  for his  own use,  the district  court  was not\r\n\nrequired to believe him.   See United States v. Brewster, 1  F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n51,  54 (1st Cir. 1993).  In reviewing sentencing proceedings, as\r\n\nelsewhere, we  must be  mindful that  \"credibility determinations\r\n\nlie primarily within the realm of the district court,\" id. at 55,\r                                                                    \r\n\nand where, as here, \"there are two plausible views of the record,\r\n\nthe  sentencing court's  adoption  of  one  such view  cannot  be\r\n\nclearly  erroneous,\"  id.

The district court's conclusion\r\n\nwas particularly plausible here,  where the court heard testimony\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\ncontention  that  because  the  events  surrounding  the  Machias\r\ncocaine  were  separated  in time  from  the  offense  conduct by\r\nYoung's self-admission  into a  detoxification center, these  two\r\nincidents cannot be considered part of the same course of conduct\r\nunder U.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(2), because they cannot  be considered\r\npart of a single  episode, spree, or ongoing series  of offenses.\r\nSee U.S.S.G. 1B1.3, comment.

Young was convicted with co-defendant Dennis Johnson (\"Johnson\") (1) of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 846, and (2) of possession of heroin with intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C).   After the close of evidence in his jury trial, he waived his right to trial by jury and submitted to a verdict by the court.   The district court found him guilty and sentenced him to ninety-two months' imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release.   We affirm both the judgment and the sentence of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1994, Young met Al Hendricks (\"Hendricks\") while the two men were enrolled in a drug detoxification program at a Maine hospital.   At trial, Young testified that Hendricks constantly talked about drugs, disrupting Young's therapy.   Young and Hendricks continued to communicate after Young had left the detoxification program.   Shortly thereafter, starting on December 27, Hendricks, on his own initiative, taped twelve conversations with Young.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first tape, Young told Hendricks he had sent a car to retrieve twenty-one grams of an unspecified substance, and when Hendricks said he wanted some drugs, Young and Hendricks agreed on a meeting place.   On January 5, 1995, Hendricks contacted the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).   On January 9, 1995, Hendricks was formally enrolled as an informer.   Subsequently, Hendricks and DEA Agent Henry J. O'Donoghue (\"Agent O'Donoghue\") arranged a deal whereby Young and Johnson would travel to the Bronx to purchase heroin, which they would then resell to Agent O'Donoghue (the \"controlled buy\").   On January 13, 1995, Young was arrested at the Greyhound Bus terminal in Portland, Maine, after he conveyed heroin to Agent O'Donoghue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not included in the charge before it, at sentencing the district court included two other quantities of drugs under the rubric of relevant conduct pursuant to the United States Sentencing Commission's Sentencing Guidelines.   First, in November 1994, Officer Brian Higgins of the Maine State Police found Young unconscious in Machias, Maine, in an automobile owned by Johnson, and in possession of approximately 11 ounces of cocaine.   The district court took this cocaine into account (the \"Machias cocaine\") in computing Young's sentence in the instant conviction.   Additionally, Johnson testified that Young had sold him heroin for almost two years previous to Young's January 13, 1995, arrest.   The district court also took this heroin into account (the \"Johnson heroin\") in computing Young's sentence in the instant conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, after the district court refused to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment, Young waived his right to a jury trial, submitted to a verdict of the district court, and was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Requested Entrapment Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young challenges the district court's refusal to instruct the jury on his defense of entrapment.  \"[A] defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment if there is record evidence which fairly supports the claims of both government inducement of the crime and defendant's lack of predisposition to engage in it.\"  United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 814 (1st Cir.1988).   The record must show \"hard evidence,\" which if believed by a rational juror, \"would suffice to create a reasonable doubt as to whether government actors induced the defendant to perform a criminal act that he was not predisposed to commit.\"  Id.  The existence or nonexistence of the required quantity of evidence in a given case is a matter of law for the court, see id. at 809, and thus our review is plenary, reading the record evidence in the light most favorable to the defense.   See United States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 217 (1st Cir.1992);  Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814.   Once a defendant carries his or her entry-level burden, the government may prove the absence of entrapment by showing, beyond a reasonable doubt, \"that the defendant was disposed to commit the criminal act prior to being first approached by government agents.\"  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that even assuming all of Hendricks' acts could be considered government conduct,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the district court did not err in finding a lack of \"hard evidence,\" which if believed by a rational juror, would suffice to create a reasonable doubt as to whether Hendricks committed acts that would meet the legal definition of entrapment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  To be entitled to the instruction on entrapment, a defendant must show hard evidence that, if believed, would lead a reasonable person to the requisite conclusion;  it is not enough that there be doubt in the absence of evidence on a given point.   See United States v. Pratt, 913 F.2d 982, 988 (1st Cir.1990);  Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814.   As we have previously stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[i]f an accused suggests that entrapment belongs in the case, it seems not unfair to expect him to point to a modicum of evidence supportive of his suggestion.   The alternative--that the prosecution be forced to disprove entrapment in every case--seems plainly unacceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 813-14 (citations omitted).   In the entrapment context, inducement must be such that it implicates concerns of government \"overreaching,\" see Gendron, 18 F.3d at 962;  solicitation alone does not suffice as inducement, see id. at 961.   This court has previously stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[a]n improper \"inducement,\" however, goes beyond providing an ordinary \"opportunity to commit a crime.\"   An \"inducement\" consists of an \"opportunity\" plus something else--typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government's taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See id.  (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).   Examples of improper \"inducement\" include intimidation, threats, dogged insistence, and \"arm-twisting based on need, sympathy, friendship, or the like.\"  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d at 468;  see also Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Young essentially testified that there was no inducement on the part of Agent O'Donoghue.   Reviewing the record, we agree.   In response to repeated questioning on cross-examination, Young failed to point to any statement or action of Agent O'Donoghue that Young considered inducement.   In fact, by his own testimony, Young pinpointed the time of any inducement to his contact with Hendricks in the hospital.   With respect to Hendricks, Young attempted to depict a pattern of inducement.   Young testified that Hendricks allegedly induced him to sell narcotics by befriending him while both were in treatment, by telling \"war stories,\" by \"com[ing] into [his] hospital room,\" and by saying that he could arrange for Young to obtain drugs.   Young testified that Hendricks allegedly led him into selling drugs by telling Young \"to trust him,\" and that \"[b]y just being there,\" Hendricks \"was the answer to everything.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even viewing the record most favorably to Young, we find that the district court properly found that Young did not produce \"hard evidence\" that Hendricks used coercion, intimidation or any promise of benefits other than the opportunity to commit the crime.   Young's own trial testimony was that Hendricks' actions amounted to talking about drugs, referring to the availability of drugs, and arranging the purchase with O'Donoghue.   There was no testimony or other evidence, let alone \"hard evidence,\" of coercion or intimidation.   Cf., e.g., United States v. Becerra, 992 F.2d 960, 963 (9th Cir.1993) (describing government officials who used threats against a defendant's family);  United States v. Groll, 992 F.2d 755, 759 (7th Cir.1993) (describing government officials who called every day and \"began threatening\" the defendant).   Unlike in Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958), there was no evidence that Hendricks feigned physical suffering due to withdrawal symptoms.  Id. at 373, 78 S.Ct. at 821.   While there was testimony that Hendricks showed Young his track marks, there was no testimony by Young, nor any other evidence, of any attempt to attract sympathy in order to obtain drugs for Hendricks or O'Donoghue.   With respect to coercion or emotional appeals to sympathy, then, we find no hard evidence in the record regarding the instant offense that would satisfy the required showing of inducement, that is, \"opportunity plus something else.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, while there have been cases in which pleas based upon a defendant's friendship with an informant have justified a finding of entrapment, see, e.g., Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 440-41, 53 S.Ct. 210, 212, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932) (using sentiment of \"one former war buddy ... for another\" to get liquor during prohibition), there was no such evidence here.   There was hard evidence, in the form of Young's testimony, from which a rational jury could have inferred a friendship with Hendricks, albeit a recently established one.   There was no testimony from Young, nor was there any other hard evidence, that Hendricks made any plea based upon any degree of friendship that the two men had established during their brief acquaintanceship, which Young testified began on or about December 23, 1994, to encourage Young to do anything that he was not predisposed to do.   We cannot find, and Young does not cite authority for, the proposition that friendship, without a plea predicated upon friendship, suffices legally as inducement;  indeed case law suggests that, as a matter of law, friendship alone does not constitute sufficient inducement.   See, e.g., United States v. Ford, 918 F.2d 1343, 1348 (8th Cir.1990) (concluding that, \"as a matter of law,\" evidence that a defendant thought he or she was doing a favor for a friend by selling that friend illegal drugs does not suffice for showing inducement to obtain entrapment instruction);  United States v. Jones, 487 F.2d 676, 678 (9th Cir.1973) (\"[f]riendship is not, by it sufficient inducement to constitute entrapment as a matter of law\").   The sole evidence pertinent to how Hendricks purportedly managed to \"lead\" Young to selling drugs to Agent O'Donoghue is Young's testimony that Hendricks said \"I have a friend that wants heroin and I will set you up.\"   There is no accompanying allegation of coercion, threat, or plea based upon friendship or sympathy that would constitute more than mere opportunity, which alone cannot suffice legally as inducement.   See Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, while Young contends that Hendricks disrupted his drug treatment program by bringing up the subject of drugs in conversation, we can find no authority for the proposition that merely affording the opportunity for illegal activity can qualify legally as inducement simply because of the context, were Young to make such an argument.   In fact, authority exists for the proposition that context is irrelevant where an informant's action was \"nothing more than a solicitation to act.\"  United States v. Singh, 54 F.3d 1182, 1189 (4th Cir.1995) (finding no inducement where former patient, acting as a government agent, convinced physician to write her prescription for pharmaceuticals, forming the factual basis of his conviction for distributing controlled substances outside the scope of his medical practice for other than legitimate medical purposes, and for falsifying prescription information);  see United States v. Mendoza-Salgado, 964 F.2d 993, 1004 (10th Cir.1992) (finding no inducement and rejecting defendant's self-portrayal as \"gullible alcoholic,\" finding dispositive that the record indicated that \"the government informer did no more than advertise [an Agent's] interest in purchasing cocaine\" and setting up the controlled buy).   By contrast, the informant in Sherman, a case on which Young relies heavily, repeatedly sought drugs from the defendant in a treatment context, supplementing his recurring requests with claims of physical discomfort from withdrawal.  Sherman, 356 U.S. at 371, 78 S.Ct. at 820 (noting that the defendant there tried to avoid the issue of illegal drugs \"from the first,\" and \"[n]ot until after a number of repetitions of the request, predicated on [the informant's] presumed suffering, did petitioner finally acquiesce\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, while Young testified that Hendricks befriended him and brought up the subject of drugs, he never testified that Hendricks used this friendship as leverage constituting the \"opportunity plus something else\" legally required for a finding of inducement, see Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.   The December 27 recording, in fact, shows that Young was in the process of obtaining drugs before offering them to his friend Hendricks.   In fact, at trial, Young provided the following summary of how Hendricks \"led\" him into selling drugs:  \"[b]y just being there, he was the answer to everything.\"   Assuming, without concluding, that Hendricks was a government agent, we might find it distasteful that a government agent was even present talking about drugs in a detoxification center.   But this circuit has never held, and we do not now hold, that the context in which government conduct occurs waives the defendant's burden to show hard evidence of legally sufficient inducement.   Without the requisite evidence, as here, we conclude that the district court properly found that Young was not entitled to have a jury consider his entrapment defense, and therefore we affirm the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found the total drug quantity attributable to Young to be equivalent to 284.41 kilograms of marijuana, resulting in a Base Offense Level of 26.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(7).   In making this finding, the District Court found three distinct quantities of illicit drugs:  (1) 17.96 grams of heroin involved in the controlled buy which formed the predicate for the prosecution (translating to 17.96 kg of marijuana equivalent);  (2) 453 grams of cocaine representing drugs found on the defendant upon his arrest in Machias, Maine in November of 1994 (translating to 90.6 kg of marijuana equivalent);  and (3) 176 grams of heroin representing drugs the district court found that Young had sold to Johnson over a two-year period preceding the subject prosecution (translating to 176 kg of marijuana equivalent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Young contends that the district court erred by including both the Machias cocaine and the Johnson heroin in calculating his sentence.   According to Young, the circumstances surrounding the Machias cocaine and the Johnson heroin should not have been factored into \"relevant conduct\" for the purposes of his sentence, because sufficient nexus with his charged conduct did not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bring uncharged conduct into play, the government must show a sufficient nexus between the conduct and the offense of conviction by a preponderance of the evidence.   See United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir.1990).   Absent a mistake of law, we review only for clear error the district court's conclusions that drugs were part of the same conduct or scheme or plan.   See id. at 110-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \"relevant conduct\" includes all acts \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction[.]\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.   For two or more offenses to be considered part of a common scheme or plan, \"they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment.  (n. 9(A)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the circumstances surrounding the Machias cocaine and the charged offense<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> were part of a common scheme or plan because they evince at least two common factors:  a common source for the drugs in New York and common transport of the drugs to Maine.   In his appellate brief, Young concedes that he obtained both the Machias cocaine and the heroin involved in the charged offense from the same source in New York.   Additionally, as in the charged offense, he apparently brought the drugs from there to Maine.   Furthermore, at trial, agents testified that a subsequent search of his house turned up used and unused syringes, several sets of scales covered with white powder, marijuana, pills and other drug residue.   Thus, there was evidence tending to tie the circumstances surrounding the Machias cocaine and the offense conduct together as part of a common scheme whereby Young conveyed drugs from his supplier in New York to buyers in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Young argues that the offense conduct involved selling cocaine to Agent O'Donoghue for expected further distribution in Canada, while assuming that if the Machias cocaine was to be resold, it would presumably be sold in Maine.   Without concluding that different destinations require a finding that the incidents cannot be part of a common scheme or plan, we find this argument unconvincing given that the offense conduct involved selling drugs in Portland, Maine, and that apparently Agent O'Donoghue was to handle further distribution.   Certainly, we do not believe that it was clear error for the district court to find a common scheme on these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, while Young testified that the Machias cocaine was all for his own use, the district court was not required to believe him.   See United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir.1993).   In reviewing sentencing proceedings, as elsewhere, we must be mindful that \"credibility determinations lie primarily within the realm of the district court,\" id. at 55, and where, as here, \"there are two plausible views of the record, the sentencing court's adoption of one such view cannot be clearly erroneous,\" id.  (citing United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992)).   The district court's conclusion was particularly plausible here, where the court heard testimony from Maine DEA Supervisor Kenneth MacMaster that a typical dosage of cocaine for personal use ranges from one-tenth to one-fourth of a gram, and that a total of 453 grams of cocaine were seized from the car, which, together with scales and other paraphernalia found at Young's home, suggested further distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Young argues that all of Hendricks' acts, dating from their first meeting, should come under the lens of entrapment's examination for improper government action that contaminated the prosecution.   Young asserts that Hendricks intended to become a government agent from the beginning, when he befriended Young, and thus all of Hendricks' actions constitute the actions of a government agent.   Relying on Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958), Young contends that even though there is no \"private entrapment\" defense, see United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955, 962 (1st Cir.1994) (collecting cases), because Hendricks may well have began his association with Young with a view towards turning government informant, the government \"ratified\" Hendricks' acts, including those committed before Hendricks first contacted O'Donoghue</p>\n        <p>Because we find no hard evidence of inducement regarding even those of Hendricks' acts that pre-date his enrollment with the DEA, we assume the validity of Young's novel theory of entrapment by government ratification without ruling on it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We do not consider this definition with respect to O'Donoghue, because the record, including Young's testimony (described infra ), shows that O'Donoghue had minimal contact with Young before the controlled buy that led to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Accordingly, we need not consider the additional required finding of predisposition.   However, we note that Hendricks' first tape, from December 27, 1994, contains strong evidence of Young's interest in providing drugs to Hendricks.   Without any request from Hendricks, Young brings up the subject of a car \"going in five minutes\" that is going to obtain 21 grams of an unidentified substance that would be \"enough for all of you.\"   What hard evidence existed regarding predisposition suggests that not only did Hendricks not offer more than an opportunity, but also, in fact, that Young may already have been predisposed to sell or provide drugs to others, and that Young may have initiated the component of his relationship with Hendricks that involved the buying and selling of illegal drugs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because we find proper the district court's inclusion of the Machias cocaine, we do not consider whether the Johnson heroin was correctly included, since even if the Johnson heroin were excluded, it would not change Young's base offense level or sentencing range.  \"[W]hen correction of a finding would not change the applicable offense level or affect the sentencing range, any error therein would necessarily be harmless.\"  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 603 (1st Cir.1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Since we find that the Machias cocaine and the heroin involved in the charged offense form part of a common scheme or plan, according to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, these drug quantities may be included together under the rubric of relevant conduct.   Because &#167; 1B1.3 requires a finding of either a \"common scheme or plan\" or the \"same course of conduct,\" we do not consider Young's further contention that because the events surrounding the Machias cocaine were separated in time from the offense conduct by Young's self-admission into a detoxification center, these two incidents cannot be considered part of the same course of conduct under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2), because they cannot be considered part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.

Young was convicted with co-defendant Dennis Johnson (\"Johnson\") (1) of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 846, and (2) of possession of heroin with intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C).   After the close of evidence in his jury trial, he waived his right to trial by jury and submitted to a verdict by the court.   The district court found him guilty and sentenced him to ninety-two months' imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release.   We affirm both the judgment and the sentence of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1994, Young met Al Hendricks (\"Hendricks\") while the two men were enrolled in a drug detoxification program at a Maine hospital.   At trial, Young testified that Hendricks constantly talked about drugs, disrupting Young's therapy.   Young and Hendricks continued to communicate after Young had left the detoxification program.   Shortly thereafter, starting on December 27, Hendricks, on his own initiative, taped twelve conversations with Young.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first tape, Young told Hendricks he had sent a car to retrieve twenty-one grams of an unspecified substance, and when Hendricks said he wanted some drugs, Young and Hendricks agreed on a meeting place.   On January 5, 1995, Hendricks contacted the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).   On January 9, 1995, Hendricks was formally enrolled as an informer.   Subsequently, Hendricks and DEA Agent Henry J. O'Donoghue (\"Agent O'Donoghue\") arranged a deal whereby Young and Johnson would travel to the Bronx to purchase heroin, which they would then resell to Agent O'Donoghue (the \"controlled buy\").   On January 13, 1995, Young was arrested at the Greyhound Bus terminal in Portland, Maine, after he conveyed heroin to Agent O'Donoghue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not included in the charge before it, at sentencing the district court included two other quantities of drugs under the rubric of relevant conduct pursuant to the United States Sentencing Commission's Sentencing Guidelines.   First, in November 1994, Officer Brian Higgins of the Maine State Police found Young unconscious in Machias, Maine, in an automobile owned by Johnson, and in possession of approximately 11 ounces of cocaine.   The district court took this cocaine into account (the \"Machias cocaine\") in computing Young's sentence in the instant conviction.   Additionally, Johnson testified that Young had sold him heroin for almost two years previous to Young's January 13, 1995, arrest.   The district court also took this heroin into account (the \"Johnson heroin\") in computing Young's sentence in the instant conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, after the district court refused to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment, Young waived his right to a jury trial, submitted to a verdict of the district court, and was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Requested Entrapment Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young challenges the district court's refusal to instruct the jury on his defense of entrapment.  \"[A] defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment if there is record evidence which fairly supports the claims of both government inducement of the crime and defendant's lack of predisposition to engage in it.\"  United States v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512578\"><a href=\"/opinion/512578/united-states-v-felix-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span>, 814 (1st Cir.1988).   The record must show \"hard evidence,\" which if believed by a rational juror, \"would suffice to create a reasonable doubt as to whether government actors induced the defendant to perform a criminal act that he was not predisposed to commit.\"  Id.  The existence or nonexistence of the required quantity of evidence in a given case is a matter of law for the court, see id. at 809, and thus our review is plenary, reading the record evidence in the light most favorable to the defense.   See United States v.

In the entrapment context, inducement must be such that it implicates concerns of government \"overreaching,\" see Gendron, 18 F.3d at 962;  solicitation alone does not suffice as inducement, see id. at 961.   This court has previously stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[a]n improper \"inducement,\" however, goes beyond providing an ordinary \"opportunity to commit a crime.\"   An \"inducement\" consists of an \"opportunity\" plus something else--typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government's taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See id.

Reviewing the record, we agree.   In response to repeated questioning on cross-examination, Young failed to point to any statement or action of Agent O'Donoghue that Young considered inducement.   In fact, by his own testimony, Young pinpointed the time of any inducement to his contact with Hendricks in the hospital.   With respect to Hendricks, Young attempted to depict a pattern of inducement.   Young testified that Hendricks allegedly induced him to sell narcotics by befriending him while both were in treatment, by telling \"war stories,\" by \"com[ing] into [his] hospital room,\" and by saying that he could arrange for Young to obtain drugs.   Young testified that Hendricks allegedly led him into selling drugs by telling Young \"to trust him,\" and that \"[b]y just being there,\" Hendricks \"was the answer to everything.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even viewing the record most favorably to Young, we find that the district court properly found that Young did not produce \"hard evidence\" that Hendricks used coercion, intimidation or any promise of benefits other than the opportunity to commit the crime.   Young's own trial testimony was that Hendricks' actions amounted to talking about drugs, referring to the availability of drugs, and arranging the purchase with O'Donoghue.   There was no testimony or other evidence, let alone \"hard evidence,\" of coercion or intimidation.   Cf., e.g., United States v. Becerra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606083\"><a href=\"/opinion/606083/united-states-v-jose-becerra-salvatore-larizza-gabriel-becerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>, 963 (9th Cir.1993) (describing government officials who used threats against a defendant's family);  United States v.

Unlike in Sherman v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105681\"><a href=\"/opinion/105681/sherman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105681\"><a href=\"/opinion/105681/sherman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span> (1958), there was no evidence that Hendricks feigned physical suffering due to withdrawal symptoms.  Id. at 373, 78 S.Ct. at 821.   While there was testimony that Hendricks showed Young his track marks, there was no testimony by Young, nor any other evidence, of any attempt to attract sympathy in order to obtain drugs for Hendricks or O'Donoghue.   With respect to coercion or emotional appeals to sympathy, then, we find no hard evidence in the record regarding the instant offense that would satisfy the required showing of inducement, that is, \"opportunity plus something else.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, while there have been cases in which pleas based upon a defendant's friendship with an informant have justified a finding of entrapment, see, e.g., Sorrells v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101997\"><a href=\"/opinion/101997/sorrells-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 440-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101997\"><a href=\"/opinion/101997/sorrells-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span> (1932) (using sentiment of \"one former war buddy ... for another\" to get liquor during prohibition), there was no such evidence here.   There was hard evidence, in the form of Young's testimony, from which a rational jury could have inferred a friendship with Hendricks, albeit a recently established one.   There was no testimony from Young, nor was there any other hard evidence, that Hendricks made any plea based upon any degree of friendship that the two men had established during their brief acquaintanceship, which Young testified began on or about December 23, 1994, to encourage Young to do anything that he was not predisposed to do.   We cannot find, and Young does not cite authority for, the proposition that friendship, without a plea predicated upon friendship, suffices legally as inducement;  indeed case law suggests that, as a matter of law, friendship alone does not constitute sufficient inducement.   See, e.g., United States v. Ford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551514\"><a href=\"/opinion/551514/united-states-v-william-george-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span>, 1348 (8th Cir.1990) (concluding that, \"as a matter of law,\" evidence that a defendant thought he or she was doing a favor for a friend by selling that friend illegal drugs does not suffice for showing inducement to obtain entrapment instruction);  United States v. Jones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"314891\"><a href=\"/opinion/314891/united-states-v-daniel-aloysius-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 678 (9th Cir.1973) (\"[f]riendship is not, by it sufficient inducement to constitute entrapment as a matter of law\").   The sole evidence pertinent to how Hendricks purportedly managed to \"lead\" Young to selling drugs to Agent O'Donoghue is Young's testimony that Hendricks said \"I have a friend that wants heroin and I will set you up.\"   There is no accompanying allegation of coercion, threat, or plea based upon friendship or sympathy that would constitute more than mere opportunity, which alone cannot suffice legally as inducement.   See Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, while Young contends that Hendricks disrupted his drug treatment program by bringing up the subject of drugs in conversation, we can find no authority for the proposition that merely affording the opportunity for illegal activity can qualify legally as inducement simply because of the context, were Young to make such an argument.   In fact, authority exists for the proposition that context is irrelevant where an informant's action was \"nothing more than a solicitation to act.\"  United States v. Singh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696216\"><a href=\"/opinion/696216/united-states-v-ram-singh/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span>, 1189 (4th Cir.1995) (finding no inducement where former patient, acting as a government agent, convinced physician to write her prescription for pharmaceuticals, forming the factual basis of his conviction for distributing controlled substances outside the scope of his medical practice for other than legitimate medical purposes, and for falsifying prescription information);  see United States v. Mendoza-Salgado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583725\"><a href=\"/opinion/583725/united-states-v-hilario-mendoza-salgado-united-states-of-america-v-ramon/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 1004 (10th Cir.1992) (finding no inducement and rejecting defendant's self-portrayal as \"gullible alcoholic,\" finding dispositive that the record indicated that \"the government informer did no more than advertise [an Agent's] interest in purchasing cocaine\" and setting up the controlled buy).   By contrast, the informant in Sherman, a case on which Young relies heavily, repeatedly sought drugs from the defendant in a treatment context, supplementing his recurring requests with claims of physical discomfort from withdrawal.  Sherman, 356 U.S. at 371, 78 S.Ct. at 820 (noting that the defendant there tried to avoid the issue of illegal drugs \"from the first,\" and \"[n]ot until after a number of repetitions of the request, predicated on [the informant's] presumed suffering, did petitioner finally acquiesce\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, while Young testified that Hendricks befriended him and brought up the subject of drugs, he never testified that Hendricks used this friendship as leverage constituting the \"opportunity plus something else\" legally required for a finding of inducement, see Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.   The December 27 recording, in fact, shows that Young was in the process of obtaining drugs before offering them to his friend Hendricks.   In fact, at trial, Young provided the following summary of how Hendricks \"led\" him into selling drugs:  \"[b]y just being there, he was the answer to everything.\"   Assuming, without concluding, that Hendricks was a government agent, we might find it distasteful that a government agent was even present talking about drugs in a detoxification center.   But this circuit has never held, and we do not now hold, that the context in which government conduct occurs waives the defendant's burden to show hard evidence of legally sufficient inducement.   Without the requisite evidence, as here, we conclude that the district court properly found that Young was not entitled to have a jury consider his entrapment defense, and therefore we affirm the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found the total drug quantity attributable to Young to be equivalent to 284.41 kilograms of marijuana, resulting in a Base Offense Level of 26.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(7).   In making this finding, the District Court found three distinct quantities of illicit drugs:  (1) 17.96 grams of heroin involved in the controlled buy which formed the predicate for the prosecution (translating to 17.96 kg of marijuana equivalent);  (2) 453 grams of cocaine representing drugs found on the defendant upon his arrest in Machias, Maine in November of 1994 (translating to 90.6 kg of marijuana equivalent);  and (3) 176 grams of heroin representing drugs the district court found that Young had sold to Johnson over a two-year period preceding the subject prosecution (translating to 176 kg of marijuana equivalent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Young contends that the district court erred by including both the Machias cocaine and the Johnson heroin in calculating his sentence.   According to Young, the circumstances surrounding the Machias cocaine and the Johnson heroin should not have been factored into \"relevant conduct\" for the purposes of his sentence, because sufficient nexus with his charged conduct did not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bring uncharged conduct into play, the government must show a sufficient nexus between the conduct and the offense of conviction by a preponderance of the evidence.   See United States v. Sklar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.1990).   Absent a mistake of law, we review only for clear error the district court's conclusions that drugs were part of the same conduct or scheme or plan.   See id. at 110-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \"relevant conduct\" includes all acts \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction[.]\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.   For two or more offenses to be considered part of a common scheme or plan, \"they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment.  (n. 9(A)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the circumstances surrounding the Machias cocaine and the charged offense<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> were part of a common scheme or plan because they evince at least two common factors:  a common source for the drugs in New York and common transport of the drugs to Maine.   In his appellate brief, Young concedes that he obtained both the Machias cocaine and the heroin involved in the charged offense from the same source in New York.   Additionally, as in the charged offense, he apparently brought the drugs from there to Maine.   Furthermore, at trial, agents testified that a subsequent search of his house turned up used and unused syringes, several sets of scales covered with white powder, marijuana, pills and other drug residue.   Thus, there was evidence tending to tie the circumstances surrounding the Machias cocaine and the offense conduct together as part of a common scheme whereby Young conveyed drugs from his supplier in New York to buyers in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Young argues that the offense conduct involved selling cocaine to Agent O'Donoghue for expected further distribution in Canada, while assuming that if the Machias cocaine was to be resold, it would presumably be sold in Maine.   Without concluding that different destinations require a finding that the incidents cannot be part of a common scheme or plan, we find this argument unconvincing given that the offense conduct involved selling drugs in Portland, Maine, and that apparently Agent O'Donoghue was to handle further distribution.   Certainly, we do not believe that it was clear error for the district court to find a common scheme on these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, while Young testified that the Machias cocaine was all for his own use, the district court was not required to believe him.   See United States v. Brewster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194846\"><a href=\"/opinion/194846/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.1993).   In reviewing sentencing proceedings, as elsewhere, we must be mindful that \"credibility determinations lie primarily within the realm of the district court,\" id. at 55, and where, as here, \"there are two plausible views of the record, the sentencing court's adoption of one such view cannot be clearly erroneous,\" id.  (citing United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1992)).   The district court's conclusion was particularly plausible here, where the court heard testimony from Maine DEA Supervisor Kenneth MacMaster that a typical dosage of cocaine for personal use ranges from one-tenth to one-fourth of a gram, and that a total of 453 grams of cocaine were seized from the car, which, together with scales and other paraphernalia found at Young's home, suggested further distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Young argues that all of Hendricks' acts, dating from their first meeting, should come under the lens of entrapment's examination for improper government action that contaminated the prosecution.   Young asserts that Hendricks intended to become a government agent from the beginning, when he befriended Young, and thus all of Hendricks' actions constitute the actions of a government agent.   Relying on Sherman v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105681\"><a href=\"/opinion/105681/sherman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105681\"><a href=\"/opinion/105681/sherman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span> (1958), Young contends that even though there is no \"private entrapment\" defense, see United States v. Gendron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195225\"><a href=\"/opinion/195225/united-states-v-gendron/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 962 (1st Cir.1994) (collecting cases), because Hendricks may well have began his association with Young with a view towards turning government informant, the government \"ratified\" Hendricks' acts, including those committed before Hendricks first contacted O'Donoghue</p>\n        <p>Because we find no hard evidence of inducement regarding even those of Hendricks' acts that pre-date his enrollment with the DEA, we assume the validity of Young's novel theory of entrapment by government ratification without ruling on it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We do not consider this definition with respect to O'Donoghue, because the record, including Young's testimony (described infra ), shows that O'Donoghue had minimal contact with Young before the controlled buy that led to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Accordingly, we need not consider the additional required finding of predisposition.   However, we note that Hendricks' first tape, from December 27, 1994, contains strong evidence of Young's interest in providing drugs to Hendricks.   Without any request from Hendricks, Young brings up the subject of a car \"going in five minutes\" that is going to obtain 21 grams of an unidentified substance that would be \"enough for all of you.\"   What hard evidence existed regarding predisposition suggests that not only did Hendricks not offer more than an opportunity, but also, in fact, that Young may already have been predisposed to sell or provide drugs to others, and that Young may have initiated the component of his relationship with Hendricks that involved the buying and selling of illegal drugs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because we find proper the district court's inclusion of the Machias cocaine, we do not consider whether the Johnson heroin was correctly included, since even if the Johnson heroin were excluded, it would not change Young's base offense level or sentencing range.  \"[W]hen correction of a finding would not change the applicable offense level or affect the sentencing range, any error therein would necessarily be harmless.\"  United States v. Bradley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 603 (1st Cir.1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Since we find that the Machias cocaine and the heroin involved in the charged offense form part of a common scheme or plan, according to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, these drug quantities may be included together under the rubric of relevant conduct.   Because &#167; 1B1.3 requires a finding of either a \"common scheme or plan\" or the \"same course of conduct,\" we do not consider Young's further contention that because the events surrounding the Machias cocaine were separated in time from the offense conduct by Young's self-admission into a detoxification center, these two incidents cannot be considered part of the same course of conduct under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2), because they cannot be considered part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.
