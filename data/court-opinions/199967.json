Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Stephen Tse on Application for Certificate of Appealability,\npro se.\n\n\n\n                          May 17, 2002\n\f              Per    Curiam.       Stephen      Tse    has    filed       a    pro   se\n\napplication for a certificate of appealability (\"COA\") from the\n\ndenial of his petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.                      The underlying\nfacts are straightforward.                 Following extradition from Hong\n\nKong on one count of a multi-count federal indictment, Tse was\n\ntried and convicted on three counts, namely, two counts of\nattempted     murder     in    aid    of    a     racketeering         enterprise    in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1959(a)(5) (counts 14 and 15), and one\n\ncount    of   conspiracy       to    murder       in   aid   of    a    racketeering\n\nenterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1959(a)(5) (count 16).\nWe affirmed these convictions on direct appeal.                        United States\n\nv. Tse, 135 F.3d 200 (1st Cir. 1998).                    The instant petition\n\nalleges a variety of substantive and ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims concerning his extradition and trial.\n              To    obtain     a     COA,    an     applicant      must       make   \"a\n\nsubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). Upon review of the underlying criminal\nrecord and § 2255 proceedings, as well as the moving papers, we\n\nare persuaded that Tse has failed to meet this standard with\n\nrespect to the majority of his claims.                   However, as discussed\nmore fully below, we conclude that a COA is warranted with\nrespect to one claim, and, indeed, that vacation and summary\nremand    are       appropriate       because       further       proceedings        are\n\nnecessary in respect to that issue.                     We address the latter\nclaim first.\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                                   I.\n\n             In his COA application, Tse renews his claim that\n\n  counsel   rendered   ineffective      assistance      in   advising     him\n  regarding the doctrine of specialty and, relatedly, regarding\n\n  the potential consequences of rejecting the government's plea\n\n  offer.    Tse   claims   that   he    was   offered    a   deal   by    the\n  government:     plead guilty to count 16 in exchange for a 97-\n\n  month sentence and dismissal of the remaining counts.                  In a\n\n  declaration under pains of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n  1756, Tse stated that his attorney advised him that, if he\n\n  proceeded to trial, there was \"no way\" that he would or could\n\n  receive more than a 10-year sentence (the maximum penalty on\n\n  count 16).    Tse elaborated further in a second declaration,\n  stating that counsel advised him that the \"Government was\n\n  prevented by law from taking [him] to trial on Counts Fourteen\n\n  or Fifteen, or any other Count.\"\n             If counsel gave this advice--and at this stage of the\n\n  proceedings we must assume that he did--it turned out to be\n\n  incorrect.    After Tse rejected the plea offer (purportedly in\n\n  reliance on his counsel's advice),1 the government sought and\n\n  obtained consent from Hong Kong to prosecute him on counts 14\n\n  and 15 in addition to count 16.       Tse, 135 F.3d at 204.       Tse was\n\n     1\n      Tse initially pled guilty but withdrew his plea after the\ndistrict court rejected the plea agreement. The parties filed a\njoint motion for reconsideration of that decision, but Tse claims\nthat he withdrew from the joint motion despite having been informed\nby his lawyer that the district court was inclined to grant it and\naccept the plea agreement.     This occurred, Tse intimates, as a\nresult of counsel's incorrect advice.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fconvicted on all three counts and sentenced to a 188-month\n\nincarcerative term.       On appeal, this court upheld the validity\n\nof the consent.       Id. at 205.         We also stated that, in any\nevent, permission was not necessary because the attempted\n\nmurder charges (counts 14 and 15) were interconnected with the\n\nconspiracy to murder charge (count 16).           Id.\n\n             The district court summarily denied Tse's ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim.          The court stated in pertinent\n\npart that:\n\n                  At    the    time     of    plea\n                  negotiations,     this     Court\n                  concludes that it was reasonable\n                  for Attorney O'Dea to believe\n                  that the United States Attorney\n                  could not prosecute Tse on\n                  additional counts.      Attorney\n                  O'Dea could reasonably have\n                  concluded that the Government\n                  Secretariat of Hong Kong would\n                  not waive the doctrine        of\n                  specialty and thus that Tse\n                  could be prosecuted only on\n                  Count 16.\n\nTse v. United States, 112 F. Supp. 2d 189, 193-94 (D. Mass.\n\n2000).   The district court did not address our conclusion that\n\na waiver of the doctrine of specialty was unnecessary to permit\n\nthe government to try Tse on the additional counts.\n\n             We   conclude   that    the    district    court   erred   in\n\ndismissing Tse's claim without holding an evidentiary hearing\n\nto   determine     what   advice    counsel    gave.      We    need    not\n\ndefinitively decide at this juncture what advice would amount\n\nto ineffective assistance of counsel and what would not. Tse's\n\ncomplaint, in part, is that counsel informed him that there was\n\n                                    -4-\n\f\"no way\" that the government could prosecute him on counts\n\nother than count 16.    But the law was well-established that\n\n\"the principle of specialty may be waived by the asylum state,\"\nUnited States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 766 (1st Cir. 1995),\n\nand our decision in Tse that a waiver was unnecessary was\n\nforeshadowed by existing case law.     Under the circumstances, a\nblanket assurance by counsel that Tse could not be prosecuted\n\non counts other than count 16 might fall \"below an objective\n\nstandard of reasonableness.\"       Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 668, 688 (1994).\n\n          We note, too, that the district court made no final\n\ndetermination as to whether Tse demonstrated prejudice.         This\n\nquestion should be further explored by the district court on\nremand.   There is a split among the courts of appeals as to\n\nwhether a defendant's post-conviction testimony that he would\n\nhave accepted a plea offer is sufficient to show prejudice, or,\nconversely,   whether   the    defendant   must    adduce   objective\n\nevidence to that effect.      Compare Paters v. United States, 159\n\nF.3d 1043, 1047 (7th Cir. 1998) (objective evidence required),\n\nand United States v. Gordon, 156 F.3d 376, 381 (2d Cir. 1998)\n\n(same), with Magana v. Hofbauer, 263 F.3d 542, 547 n.1 (6th Cir.\n2001) (objective evidence not required).          This court has not\n\nspoken to the issue.    Although we do not resolve it now, this\n\nis another valid reason for holding an evidentiary hearing and\n\naffording the district court an opportunity to make specific\n\nfindings as to prejudice vel non.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                              II.\n\n          Tse also renews a variety of substantive claims, each\n\nof which is alternatively framed as an ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim.   These claims are:\n\n          C    The district court erred in denying\n               counsel's request for an entrapment\n               instruction, and counsel rendered\n               ineffective assistance in failing to\n               argue the issue on appeal.\n\n          C    Section 1959 of Title 18 is facially\n               unconstitutional as violative of the\n               First Amendment, and counsel rendered\n               ineffective assistance in failing to\n               argue the issue at trial and on\n               appeal.\n\n          C    The   trial  judge   gave   erroneous\n               instructions in defining \"enterprise\"\n               and counsel rendered ineffective\n               assistance in failing to object at\n               trial and in failing to pursue the\n               issue on appeal.\n\n          C    The trial judge erred in failing to\n               instruct the jury that a government\n               agent cannot be a co-conspirator, and\n               counsel erred in failing to object at\n               trial and in failing to pursue the\n               issue on appeal.\n\n          C    Title   18   U.S.C.    §   1959   is\n               unconstitutional as applied in this\n               case for lack of sufficient nexus\n               between the crime and interstate\n               commerce,   and   counsel   rendered\n               ineffective assistance in failing to\n               argue the issue at trial and on\n               appeal.\n\n          C    The district court erred in denying\n               trial counsel's request for a jury\n               instruction on the \"lesser-included\"\n               offense of assault with a dangerous\n               weapon in aid of a racketeering\n               enterprise, and counsel rendered\n               ineffective assistance in failing to\n               argue the issue on appeal.\n\n                              -6-\n\f             Arguably, Tse has procedurally defaulted all of the\nsubstantive claims by failing to raise them at trial and/or on\n\ndirect review. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 621\n\n(1998) (\"Habeas review is an extraordinary remedy and 'will not\nbe allowed to do service for an appeal.'\") (citation omitted).\n\nBut because we are persuaded that each of these claims is\n\nmeritless, we need not decide whether any of them is immune to\n\nprinciples of default, or, alternatively, whether Tse can\n\nestablish \"cause and actual prejudice\" under United States v.\n\nFrady, 456 U.S. 152, 167 (1982), to excuse any such default.\n\nSince Tse's claims fail on the merits, his related claims that\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to press the\n\nclaims at trial or on appeal must also fail. We briefly\n\nexplain.\n             First, the evidence at trial did not come close to\n\ndemonstrating the sort of government overreaching that would\n\nwarrant an entrapment instruction. See United States v. Young,\n\n78 F.3d 758, 761 (1st Cir. 1996) (giving examples of improper\n\ninducement).     Second, Tse has failed to make a substantial\n\nshowing that 18 U.S.C. § 1959 is violative of the First\n\nAmendment.    Third, contrary to Tse's suggestion, that statute\n\ncontains no requirement that the government establish a pattern\n\nof racketeering activity.     See, e.g., United States v. Bracy,\n\n67 F.3d 1421, 1430 (9th Cir. 1995).    Fourth, Tse has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that an instruction that government agents cannot\n\nbe coconspirators was warranted under the circumstances of this\n\n                                -7-\n\fcase, and, in all events, any error was harmless in light of\n\nthe overwhelming evidence of a conspiracy between Tse and non-\n\ngovernment actors. Fifth, Tse's Commerce Clause claim fails in\nlight of this court's recent holding in United States v.\n\nMarino, 277 F.3d 11, 35 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that § 1959's\n\nrequirements are met if the government establishes a connection\nbetween the § 1959 act of violence and a RICO enterprise which\n\nhas a de minimis interstate commerce connection). Finally, Tse\n\nhas failed to demonstrate that the requested lesser-included-\n\noffense instruction passes the \"elements test\" of Schmuck v.\n\nUnited States, 489 U.S. 705 (1989), or that this test does not\n\napply.\n\n             We need go no further. For the foregoing reasons, we\ngrant    a   COA   as   to   Tse's   claim   that   the   district   court\n\nimproperly decided the issue discussed in Part I without\n\nholding an evidentiary hearing, summarily vacate the decision\nof the district court insofar as it resolved this issue, and\n\nremand for an evidentiary hearing limited to this issue.               See\n\n1st Cir. R. 27(c).      We deny a COA as to the issues discussed in\n\nPart II (and as to those issues, the district court's decision\n\nstands).     The appeal is terminated.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

The underlying facts are straightforward. Following extradition from Hong Kong on one count of a multi-count federal indictment, Tse was tried and convicted on three counts, namely, two counts of attempted murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a)(5) (counts 14 and 15), and one count of conspiracy to murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a)(5) (count 16). We affirmed these convictions on direct appeal. <i>United States v. Tse,</i> 135 F.3d 200 (1st Cir.1998).

Upon review of the underlying criminal record and &#167; 2255 proceedings, as well as the moving papers, we are persuaded that Tse has failed to meet this standard with respect to the majority of his claims. However, as discussed more fully below, we conclude that a COA is warranted with respect to one claim, and, indeed, that vacation and summary remand are appropriate because further proceedings are necessary in respect to that issue.

Tse claims that he was offered a deal by the government: plead guilty to count 16 in exchange for a 97-month sentence and dismissal of the remaining counts. In a declaration under pains of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1746, Tse stated that his attorney advised him that, if he proceeded to trial, there was \"no way\" that he would or could receive more than a 10-year sentence (the maximum penalty on count 16).

But because we are persuaded that each of these claims is meritless, we need not decide whether any of them is immune to principles of default, or, alternatively, whether Tse can establish \"cause and actual prejudice\" under <i>United States v.

Second, Tse has failed to make a substantial showing that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959 is violative of the First Amendment. Third, contrary to Tse's suggestion, that statute contains no requirement that the government establish a pattern of racketeering activity. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Fourth, Tse has failed to demonstrate that an instruction that government agents cannot be coconspirators was warranted under the circumstances of this case, and, in all events, any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of a conspiracy between Tse and non-government actors. Fifth, Tse's Commerce Clause claim fails in light of this court's recent holding in <i>United States v.

Finally, Tse has failed to demonstrate that the requested lesser-included-offense instruction passes the \"elements test\" of <i>Schmuck v.

The underlying facts are straightforward. Following extradition from Hong Kong on one count of a multi-count federal indictment, Tse was tried and convicted on three counts, namely, two counts of attempted murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a)(5) (counts 14 and 15), and one count of conspiracy to murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a)(5) (count 16). We affirmed these convictions on direct appeal. <i>United States v. Tse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751343\"><a href=\"/opinion/751343/united-states-v-stephen-tse/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998). The instant petition alleges a variety of substantive and ineffective assistance of counsel claims concerning his extradition and trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain a COA, an applicant must make \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(2). Upon review of the underlying criminal record and &#167; 2255 proceedings, as well as the moving papers, we are persuaded that Tse has failed to meet this standard with respect to the majority of his claims. However, as discussed more fully below, we conclude that a COA is warranted with respect to one claim, and, indeed, that vacation and summary remand are appropriate because further proceedings are necessary in respect to that issue. We address the latter claim first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his COA application, Tse renews his claim that counsel rendered ineffective assistance in advising him regarding the doctrine of specialty and, relatedly, regarding the potential consequences of rejecting the government's plea offer. Tse claims that he was offered a deal by the government: plead guilty to count 16 in exchange for a 97-month sentence and dismissal of the remaining counts. In a declaration under pains of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1746, Tse stated that his attorney advised him that, if he proceeded to trial, there was \"no way\" that he would or could receive more than a 10-year sentence (the maximum penalty on count 16). Tse elaborated further in a second declaration, stating that counsel advised him that the \"Government was prevented by law from taking [him] to trial on Counts Fourteen or Fifteen, or any other Count.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If counsel gave this advice &#8212; and at this stage of the proceedings we must assume that he did &#8212; it turned out to be incorrect. After Tse rejected the plea offer (purportedly in reliance on his counsel's advice),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the government sought and obtained consent from Hong Kong to prosecute him on counts 14 and 15 in addition to count 16. Tse, 135 F.3d at 204. Tse was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to a 188-month incarcerative term. On appeal, this court upheld the validity of the consent. <i>Id.</i> at 205. We also stated that, in any event, permission was not necessary because the attempted murder charges (counts 14 and 15) were interconnected with the conspiracy to murder charge (count 16). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court summarily denied Tse's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court stated in pertinent part that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of plea negotiations, this Court concludes that it was reasonable for Attorney O'Dea to believe that the United States Attorney could not prosecute Tse on additional counts. Attorney O'Dea could reasonably have concluded that the Government Secretariat of Hong Kong would not waive the doctrine of specialty and thus that Tse could be prosecuted only on Count 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tse v.

The district court did not address our conclusion that a waiver of the doctrine of specialty was unnecessary to permit the government to try Tse on the additional counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Tse's claim without holding an evidentiary hearing to determine what advice counsel gave. We need not definitively decide at this juncture what advice would amount to ineffective assistance of counsel and what would not. Tse's complaint, in part, is that counsel informed him that there was \"no way\" that the government could prosecute him on counts other than count 16. But the law was well-established that \"the principle of specialty may be waived by the asylum state,\" <i>United States v.

Under the circumstances, a blanket assurance by counsel that Tse <i>could not</i> be prosecuted on counts other than count 16 might fall \"below an objective standard of reasonableness.\" <i>Strickland v.

This question should be further explored by the district court on remand. There is a split among the courts of appeals as to whether a defendant's post-conviction testimony that he would have accepted a plea offer is sufficient to show prejudice, or, conversely, whether the defendant must adduce objective evidence to that effect. <i>Compare Paters v.
