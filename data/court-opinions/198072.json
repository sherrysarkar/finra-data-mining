Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Luis Rafael Rivera on brief for appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Camille Velez-Rive,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Jose A.

Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we are convinced that the district court understood its\r\nauthority to depart and that it found no grounds to do so in\r\nthis case.  In particular, upon a thorough reading of the\r\nsentencing proceedings as a whole, it appears that the district\r\ncourt raised sua sponte the possibility of a departure for \r\nwhat it termed \"extraordinary acceptance of responsibility,\"\r\nand, after discussion with counsel, decided that no departure\r\nwas warranted under either U.S.S.G.  5K2.0 or U.S.S.G. \r\n5K2.16.  See United States v. Bennett, 60 F.3d 902, 905 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).  Further, we read the district court's concluding\r\ncomments only as again rejecting the mental condition departure\r\nrequested by defendant and as determining generally that\r\ndefendant's case did not present any extraordinary\r\ncircumstances warranting departure.  Such a discretionary\r\ndetermination is not subject to appellate review.  See United\r\nStates v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
