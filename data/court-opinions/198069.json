Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, and Edgardo\r\nRodriguez-Quilichini, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Camille Velez-Rive,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Jose A. Quiles-Espinosa,\r\nSenior Litigation Counsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 27, 1998\r\n\n                                 Per Curiam.  Erickson Alvelo-Ramos appeals from his\r\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. 1029(a), of possessing cloned\r\ncellular telephones and cloning hardware and software. \r\nPresented as a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, in effect\r\nAlvelo-Ramos' appeal challenges the jury instructions\r\nconcerning  1029(a)'s requirement that the offense \"affect[]\r\ninterstate and foreign commerce.\"  Under United States v.\r\nLopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), Alvelo-Ramos argues, the government\r\nwas required to prove that the offenses had a \"substantial\"\r\neffect on interstate commerce.  In the alternative, Alvelo-\r\nRamos argues that if the statute does not require proof of a\r\n\"substantial\" effect on interstate commerce, then it exceeds\r\nCongress' powers under the Commerce Clause, as interpreted in\r\nLopez.\r\n          I. Statutory Construction\r\n          We review questions of statutory construction de\r\nnovo. United States v. Cardoza, 129 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nSection 1029(a) contains a jurisdictional element which\r\nrequires that, to be punishable, an offense must \"affect[]\r\ninterstate or foreign commerce.\"\r\n          Cases interpreting 18 U.S.C.  1029(a), usually in\r\nthe context of credit card fraud offenses, have required only\r\na minimal nexus to interstate commerce. See United States v.\r\nBolton, 68 F.3d 396, 400 (10th Cir. 1995)(possession of stolen\r\ncredit cards bearing out-of-state addresses was sufficient to\r\nestablish requisite effect on interstate commerce); United\r\nStates v. Rushdan, 870 F.2d 1509, 1514 (9th Cir. 1989)(illicit\r\npossession of out-of-state credit card account numbers, even\r\nwithout their use, is sufficient effect on interstate\r\ncommerce); United States v. Lee, 818 F.2d 302, 305 (4th Cir.\r\n1987) (upholding jury instruction that proof of single\r\ninterstate phone call by bank manager in connection with\r\ndefendant's attempted use of a counterfeit credit card to\r\nobtain a cash advance would meet the interstate commerce\r\nrequirement).\r\n          Appellant argues that, under Lopez, the\r\njurisdictional element in  1029(a) now requires the government\r\nto prove that the offenses had a \"substantial\" effect on\r\ninterstate commerce.  This court recently rejected an argument,\r\nsimilar to the one raised here, that \"Lopez impliedly changes\r\nthe meaning of the jurisdictional element present [to require\r\na substantial effect on interstate commerce] before\r\n[defendant's] conviction [under 18 U.S.C.  922(g)] passes\r\nCommerce Clause scrutiny.\" Cardoza, 129 F.3d at 11; see alsoUnited States v. Smith, 101 F.3d 202, 215 (1st Cir. 1996);\r\nUnited States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  The Cardoza court reasoned that\r\n          when the [Lopez] Court stated that \"the\r\n          proper test requires an analysis of\r\n          whether the regulated activity\r\n          'substantially affects' interstate\r\n          commerce,\" Lopez, 514 U.S. at 559, it was\r\n          not revising the government's burden of\r\n          proof on a jurisdictional element in\r\n          criminal proceedings, but instead\r\n          identifying the extent to which purely\r\n          intrastate activities must impact\r\n          interstate activities before Congress may\r\n          legislate under the Commerce Clause. \r\n          Therefore, because the Court had no\r\n          occasion in Lopez to reach the question,\r\n          it remains the law that where a federal\r\n          criminal contains a jurisdictional element\r\n          requiring proof that an object was \"in or\r\n          affecting\" commerce, the government need\r\n          only meet the \"minimal nexus\" test\r\n          enunciated in Scarborough v. United\r\n          States, 431 U.S. 563, 577 (1977).\r\n\nCardoza, 129 F.3d at 11.\r\n          Applying that reasoning here, it follows that Lopezalso did not revise the government's burden of proof with\r\nrespect to the jurisdictional element in 18 U.S.C.  1029(a).\r\nCf. United States v. Clayton, 108 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir.\r\n1997) (rejecting Clayton's argument that under Lopez, 18 U.S.C.\r\n 1029(a) requires the government to prove a \"substantial\"\r\neffect on interstate commerce). Accordingly, the cases\r\ninterpreting  1029(a) to require only a minimal nexus to\r\ninterstate commerce continue to control after Lopez.  The\r\ndistrict court did not err in instructing the jury that it\r\ncould find that the requisite connection to interstate commerce\r\nwas satisfied if it found that the cloned cell phones had the\r\ncapacity to make interstate calls.    \r\n\n          II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\n          \"With respect to Appellant's claim that there was\r\ninsufficient evidence to sustain his convictions, Appellant\r\n'faces an uphill climb,' United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210,\r\n216 (1st Cir. 1995).  'If the evidence presented, taken in the\r\nlight most agreeable to the government is adequate to permit a\r\nrational jury to find each essential element of the offense of\r\nconviction beyond a reasonable doubt, then [Appellant's] claim\r\nfails.' Id.\" United States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1246 (1st\r\nCir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1109 (1997).\r\n          The evidence presented in this case is adequate to\r\npermit a rational jury to find that the cloned phones were\r\nmanufactured outside of Puerto Rico and that they had the\r\ncapacity to make long-distance interstate calls.  Therefore,\r\nthe evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the\r\noffenses affected interstate commerce.  Alvelo-Ramos'\r\nsufficiency of the evidence claim fails.   \r\n          III. Constitutional Challenge\r\n          \"We review de novo constitutional challenges to\r\nfederal statutes.\" United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027,\r\n1030 (1st Cir. 1997).  Appellant argues that if  1029(a) does\r\nnot require proof of a \"substantial\" effect on interstate\r\ncommerce, then the reasoning of Lopez should apply to\r\ninvalidate the statute as beyond Congress' affirmative powers\r\nunder the Commerce Clause.  The statute under which appellant\r\nwas convicted differs from the statute struck down in Lopez,\r\nhowever, in two important respects.  First, \"the statute at\r\nissue in [Lopez], 18 U.S.C.  922(q), 'contain[ed] no\r\njurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case\r\ninquiry, that the [offense] in question affects interstate\r\ncommerce.'\" Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d at 953.  Section 1029(a), by\r\ncontrast, extends only to offenses that \"affect[] interstate or\r\nforeign commerce.\"\r\n          Second,  1029(a) regulates the possession and sale\r\nof cloned cell phones, an activity that uses channels of\r\ninterstate commerce and involves instrumentalities of\r\ninterstate commerce.  Lopez \"identified three general\r\ncategories of activity that lawfully can be regulated under the\r\nCommerce Clause: (1) activities that involve use of the\r\nchannels of interstate commerce, (2) activities that implicate\r\nthe instrumentalities of interstate commerce (including persons\r\nor things in interstate commerce), and (3) activities that have\r\na substantial relation to, or substantially affect, interstate\r\ncommerce.\" Bongiorno, 106 F.3d at 1031.  Because  1029 falls\r\nwithin the first and/or second Lopez categories, there is no\r\nadditional requirement that the regulated activities be shown\r\nto \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. See Clayton, 108\r\nF.3d at 1117.\r\n          Alvelo-Ramos' conviction and sentence are affirmed. \n",
