As we embark upon resolution of\r\nthe thorny questions presented by this appeal, it is appropriate\r\nthat we keep in mind that \"[c]onstitutional adjudication does not\r\nlend itself to the absolutes of the physical sciences or\r\nmathematics.\"  Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 678 (1971).  The\r\ncontroversy before us patently reflects this truth.\r\nThe issues raised require us to consider the sometime\r\ncompeting values found in the Religion Clauses of the First\r\nAmendment of the Constitution -- otherwise described as \"the\r\ninternal tension in the First Amendment between the Establishment\r\nClause and the Free Exercise Clause.\"  Id. at 677.  \"[B]oth are\r\ncast in absolute terms, . . . either of which, if expanded to a\r\nlogical extreme, would tend to clash with the other.\"  Walz v. Tax\r\nCommission, 397 U.S. 664, 668-69 (1970).\r\n                   BACKGROUND\r\nMaine has enacted a statute providing schooling for those\r\nstudents who live in communities that do not have public education\r\nfacilities because of insufficient student density.  For these\r\nstudents, the state will pay grants directly to qualified private\r\neducational institutions to subsidize their schooling, provided the\r\ninstitutions are \"non-sectarian\" in nature.\r\nPlaintiff-Appellants are the parents of students who are\r\notherwise qualified to receive the benefits of this state-created\r\nsubsidy, except that they have chosen to send their children to\r\nprivate sectarian schools.  After Maine refused to fund their\r\nchosen sectarian institution, St. Dominic's Regional High School in\r\nLewiston, Maine, the parents brought an action in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Maine alleging numerous\r\nviolations of their rights under: (1) the Establishment Clause; (2)\r\nthe Equal Protection Clause; (3) the Free Exercise Clause; (4) the\r\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (5) the Speech\r\nClause of the First Amendment.\r\nThe district court framed the issue before it as \"whether\r\nMaine is constitutionally required to extend subsidies to sectarian\r\nschools.\"  It viewed plaintiff-appellants' arguments \"in terms of\r\nfree exercise claims, establishment clause claims, equal protection \r\nclaims and substantive due process claims,\" but found \"it\r\nunnecessary to address [them] separately or to analyze the various\r\ntests that have been enumerated,\" because \"[t]he same answer is\r\nobvious for all.\"  Concluding that although plaintiff-appellants\r\nwere free to send their children to sectarian schools, \"they do not\r\nhave a right to require taxpayers to subsidize that choice,\" the\r\ndistrict court rejected their claims and granted summary judgment\r\nin favor of defendant-appellees.  This appeal followed.\r\nBelow we address seriatim each of the bases on which the\r\nplaintiffs' claim an entitlement to relief.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Establishment Clause\r\nFirst, plaintiff-appellants argue that the statute,\r\n2591(2), violates the Establishment Clause because, rather than\r\ntreating religion neutrally, it demonstrates a hostility toward\r\nreligion by excluding otherwise eligible sectarian schools from the\r\ntuition program based solely on the religious viewpoint presented\r\nby these schools.\r\nAlthough \"this Nation's history has not been one of\r\nentirely sanitized separation between Church and State,\" Committee\r\nfor Pub. Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 760\r\n(1993), and while various forms of aid to religious institutions\r\nare permissible and have been approved by the somewhat inscrutable\r\nguidelines of the Supreme Court, there is no binding authority for \r\n\nthe proposition that the direct payment of tuition by the state to\r\na private sectarian school is constitutionally permissible.  See\r\nid. at 780.\r\nA statement to the effect that \"Congress shall make no\r\nlaw respecting the establishment of religion,\" U.S. Const. amend.\r\nI, is hardly equivocal language.  The fact that it is the first of\r\nthe several constitutional do's and don'ts contained in the Bill of\r\nRights may not have been coincidental.  Separation of church and\r\nstate constituted a paramount principle and goal in the minds of\r\nsome of the most influential of the Framers both by dint of\r\nhistorical experience, and personal conviction.\r\nWe highlight the proposition that in some cases in which\r\nstate infringement on the free exercise of religion takes place,\r\notherwise prohibited conduct may be permitted if the state\r\nestablishes an overriding societal interest. Upholding the\r\nEstablishment Clause, which is aimed at avoiding an entangled\r\nchurch and state, is such a paramount interest.  In the long run,\r\nan entanglement of the two has been shown by history to be\r\noppressive of religious freedom.  See Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 760;\r\nEngel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431 (1962) (such a union may tend\r\n\"to destroy government and to degrade religion.\"); Everson, 330\r\nU.S. at 12 (\"cruel persecutions were the inevitable result of\r\ngovernment established religions.\").  The present case, in which\r\ndirect subsidies would be paid by the state to a sectarian primary\r\nand secondary school, is such an imbroglio.\r\nIn Nyquist, New York created a two-part program to help\r\ndefray the costs of educating low-income children who chose to\r\nattend private religious schools.  See 413 U.S. at 762-67.  The\r\nfirst part of the program provided for direct money grants from the\r\nState to \"qualifying\" nonpublic schools to be used for the\r\n\"maintenance and repair of . . . school facilities and equipment to\r\nensure the health, welfare and safety of enrolled pupils.\"  Id. at\r\n762.  The second part involved tuition reimbursement grants which\r\nthe state gave to low-income parents of private schoolchildren\r\n(including those who attended religious schools) as partial\r\nreimbursement for their children's tuition, and limited state\r\nincome tax relief for parents who did not qualify for the tuition\r\nreimbursement.  See id. at 764.  The Court concluded that all three\r\nprograms were invalid under the Establishment Clause because they\r\nhad the primary effect of advancing religion.  See id. at 774-94. \r\nWith reference to the reimbursement portion of the law, the Court\r\nstated:\r\n             There can be no question that these grants\r\n  could not, consistently with the\r\n  Establishment Clause, be given directly to\r\n  sectarian schools, since they would suffer\r\n  from the same deficiency that renders\r\n  invalid the grants for maintenance and\r\n  repairs. In the absence of an effective\r\n  means of guaranteeing that the state aid\r\n  derived from public funds will be used\r\n  exclusively for secular, neutral, and\r\n  nonideological purposes, it is clear from\r\n  our cases that direct aid in whatever form\r\n  is invalid.\r\n\nId. at 780 (emphasis added).\r\nThis dichotomy between direct and indirect aid is a\r\nrecurring theme throughout Establishment Clause litigation. \r\nAlthough not all cases fit neatly within this formula, and this\r\nsomewhat tenuous distinction has been the subject of considerable\r\ncriticism by academia, it is the closest thing that we have to a\r\nworkable bright line rule, or that perhaps is possible.\r\nNevertheless, one thing is certain: the Supreme Court has\r\nnever permitted broad sponsorship of religious schools.  In those\r\ninstances in which the Court has permitted funding to flow to\r\nreligious schools, it has been in the context of a targeted grant,\r\navailable to a limited population, for a specific purpose.  See, \r\ne.g., Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203 (1997) (upholding a\r\nfederally funded program providing supplemental, remedial\r\ninstruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis, taught on\r\nthe premises of sectarian schools by government employees); Zobrest\r\nv. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.S. 1 (1993) (holding that\r\nproviding a deaf student with a government-paid sign language\r\ninterpreter who accompanies the student to classes in a sectarian \r\nschool does not violate the Establishment Clause). \"The problem,\r\nlike so many problems in constitutional law, is one of degree.\" \r\nMeek, 421 U.S. at 359 (citation and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).  We find no authority in the Court's jurisprudence for\r\nnow extending state support of sectarian schools from beyond the\r\nclass of particular, limited situations described above.  See supra\r\nnote 5.\r\nMoreover, reliance by plaintiff-appellants on the Supreme\r\nCourt's decision in Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of University\r\nof Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995), is misplaced. In Rosenberger, the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorized payment\r\nto outside contractors for the printing costs of a variety of\r\npublications issued by several student organizations.  These\r\npayments, made from an activities fund generated by imposing\r\nmandatory student fees, were  designed to support a broad range of\r\nextracurricular student activities related to the University's\r\neducational purpose.  The University withheld authorization for\r\npayments to a printer with respect to one student organization's\r\npublication because it deemed it to be contrary to University\r\nguidelines prohibiting aid to religious organizations or\r\nactivities.  The student organization in question, as well as the\r\npublications for which printing costs were sought, promoted a\r\n\"Christian\" viewpoint.  The University's denial of printing\r\npayments was successfully challenged by the student organization on\r\nthe basis of viewpoint discrimination.  See id. at 832-35; see also \r\nRegan v. Taxation with Representation, 461 U.S. 540 (1983) (holding\r\nthat the state cannot discriminate based on the viewpoint of\r\nprivate persons whose speech it subsidizes).\r\nIn answering the University's concerns that such payments\r\nmight run afoul of the First Amendment, the Court ruled that the\r\nfunding did not contravene the Establishment Clause because it was\r\n\"neutral towards religion.\"  Id. at 840.  The neutrality of the\r\nprogram, the Court reasoned, distinguished it from a tax levied to\r\ndirectly support a church.  See id.  There is a critical\r\ndifference \"between government speech [or action] endorsing\r\nreligion, which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private\r\nspeech [or action] endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and\r\nFree Exercise Clauses protect.\" Id. at 843 (emphasis in original,\r\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\r\nMost telling, from the perspective of the present case,\r\nis the majority's analysis of the issues presented by that appeal:\r\n             The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are\r\n  correct to extract from our decisions the\r\n  principle that we have recognized special\r\n  Establishment Clause dangers where the\r\n  government makes direct money payments to\r\n  sectarian institutions.  The error is not\r\n  in identifying the principle, but in\r\n  believing that it controls this case . . .\r\n  [T]he Court of Appeals decided a case that\r\n  was, in essence, not before it, and the\r\n  dissent would have us do the same. We do\r\n  not confront a case where, even under a\r\n  neutral program that includes nonsectarian\r\n  recipients, the government is making\r\n  direct money payments to an institution or\r\n  group that is engaged in religious\r\n  activity . . . . [T]he undisputed fact\r\n  [is] that no public funds flow directly to\r\n  [the student organization's] coffers.\"\r\n\nId. at 842 (emphasis added, internal citations omitted).\r\nIn lauding neutrality as the keystone of Establishment\r\nClause jurisprudence, plaintiff-appellants forget that neutrality\r\nis but one \"hallmark of the Establishment Clause.\" Rosenberger, 514\r\nU.S. at 846 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Rosenberger neither\r\ntrumpets the supremacy of the neutrality principle nor signals the\r\ndemise of the funding prohibition in Establishment Clause\r\njurisprudence.  See id. at 852 (O'Connor, J., concurring).\r\nThe historic barrier that has existed between church and\r\nstate throughout the life of the Republic has up to the present\r\nacted as an insurmountable impediment to the direct payments or\r\nsubsidies by the state to sectarian institutions, particularly in\r\nthe context of primary and secondary schools.  See Tilton v.\r\nRichardson, 403 U.S. at 684-87 (relying on the lessened danger of\r\nprohibited entanglement when college level institutions are\r\ninvolved); Hart v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734 (1973) (upholding the\r\ncreation of a public agency designed to assist in the placement of\r\nrevenue bonds for the construction of buildings designed for\r\nsecular use at higher education facilities including parochial\r\ncolleges).  Although the guidance provided by the Supreme Court has\r\nbeen less than crystalline, perhaps often by necessity due to the\r\nsubject matter involved, approving direct payments of tuition by\r\nthe state to sectarian schools represents a quantum leap that we\r\nare unwilling to take.  Creating such a breach in the wall\r\nseparating the State from secular establishments is a task best\r\nleft for the Supreme Court to undertake.\r\nFinally, we are at a loss to understand why plaintiff-\r\nappellants believe that the Establishment Clause gives them a basis\r\nfor recovery.  The Establishment Clause forbids the making of a law\r\nrespecting the establishment of any religion.  There is no relevant\r\nprecedent for using its negative prohibition  as a basis for\r\nextending the right of a religiously affiliated group to secure\r\nstate subsidies.\r\nII.  Equal Protection\r\nPlaintiff-appellants argue that in addition to violating\r\nthe Establishment Clause, Maine's alleged hostility towards\r\nreligion violates their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  They claim that by virtue of the statute\r\nin question they are being discriminated against on the basis of\r\nreligion, religious beliefs, speech content, and association.\r\nPlaintiff-appellants' equal protection claims fail for\r\nmany of the same reasons that their Establishment Clause challenge\r\nfounders.  Writ simple, the state cannot be in the business of\r\ndirectly supporting religious schools.  Plaintiff-appellants' equal\r\nprotection claims fail, because, regardless of the appropriate\r\nlevel of scrutiny we employ, the state's compelling interest in\r\navoiding an Establishment Clause violation requires that the\r\nstatute exclude sectarian schools from the tuition program.\r\nPlaintiff-appellants allege on appeal that they \"have\r\nbeen singled out simply because they desire their children to be\r\neducated in a Christian environment and from a biblical\r\nperspective, and for no other reason.\"  Appellants' Br. at 23-24. \r\nPlaintiff-appellants desire that the state pay grants directly to\r\nsectarian schools, in this case St. Dominic's, to subsidize their\r\nchildren's schooling.  Given the present state of jurisprudence, we\r\ncan see no way in which this can be done without violating the\r\nEstablishment Clause.  See Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 780.  As a result,\r\nwe find no Equal Protection Clause violation.\r\nWe are fortified in our conclusion by the Maine Supreme\r\nCourt's recent opinion in Bagley v. Raymond School Department, --\r\nA.2d --, No. 98-281, 1999 WL 236464 (Me. April 23, 1999),  dealing\r\nwith a similar situation.  In resolving a similar Equal Protection\r\nClause challenge, the court stated:\r\n           That state funds would flow directly into\r\nthe coffers of religious schools in Maine were\r\nit not for the existing exclusion cannot be\r\ndebated.  If the religious school exclusion\r\nwere eliminated, the State would likely pay\r\nmore than $5,000 per student to Cheverus High\r\nSchool, without restriction on the use of\r\nthose funds.  In the entire history of the\r\nSupreme Court's struggle to interpret the\r\nEstablishment Clause it has never concluded\r\nthat such a direct, unrestricted financial\r\nsubsidy to a religious school could escape the\r\nstrictures of the Establishment Clause.  While\r\nit may be possible for the legislature to\r\ncraft a program that would allow parents\r\ngreater flexibility in choosing private\r\nschools for their children, the current\r\nprogram could not be easily tailored to\r\ninclude religious schools without addressing\r\nsignificant problems of entanglement or the\r\nadvancement of religion.\r\n\nBagley, slip. op. at 40-41.\r\nIII.  Free Exercise\r\nPlaintiff-appellants argue that  2951(2) violates the\r\nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because it excludes\r\nfunding of sectarian education solely on the basis of religion. \r\nHowever, we conclude that the Free Exercise Clause is not\r\nimplicated here.  See Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 412 (1963)\r\n(Douglas, J., concurring) (\"[T]he Free Exercise Clause is written\r\nin terms of what the government cannot do to the individual, not in\r\nterms of what the individual can exact from the government.\").\r\nFour points support our conclusion.  First, at least some\r\nof the parents in this litigation eschew any religious motivation\r\nfor wishing to attend St. Dominic's.  For them, academic\r\nsuperiority, rather than the school's Roman Catholic affiliation,\r\ndrives their enrollment decisions.\r\nSecond, no one plausibly reading the statute could come\r\nto any conclusion other than that  2591(2) does not prevent\r\nattendance at a religious school.  Nor does  2591(2) prevent\r\nreligious education of children in Maine.  All it means is that the\r\ncost of religious education must be borne by the parents and not\r\nthe state.\r\nThird, Hernndez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 699\r\n(1988), identifies the free exercise inquiry as asking \"whether\r\ngovernment has placed a substantial burden on the observation of a\r\ncentral belief or practice.\" (emphasis added).  Factually speaking,\r\neducation at a parochial school is not such a belief, for the Roman\r\nCatholic Church does not mandate it.  See Catechism of the Catholic\r\nChurch 537-38 (1994) (stating that parents' responsibilities for\r\nreligious education for religious education takes place primarily\r\nin the home and that choosing a religious school is a right but not\r\nan absolute duty).  To be sure, the Catholic Church requires some\r\nreligious education, see id. at 538, but as stated above,  2591(2)\r\ndoes not prevent such religious education.  Indeed, it says nothing\r\nabout it.  Moreover, no parent makes the claim that attendance at\r\na religious school is a central tenet or practice of their faith.\r\nFourth, the primary case cited by the parents, Church of\r\nthe Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520\r\n(1993), is inapposite.  In that case, the record showed a\r\nsubstantial animus against Santera that motivated the law in\r\nquestion.  See id. at 543 (stating that the \"record in this case\r\ncompels the conclusion that suppression of the central element of\r\nthe Santeria worship service was the object of the ordinances.\"). \r\nNo such showing has been made here.\r\nAs we mentioned earlier, even if this were a limit on\r\nfree exercise, the state has justified the limit by its purpose of\r\navoiding violation of the Establishment Clause.\r\nIV.  Due Process and Speech Clause Claims\r\nPlaintiff-appellants argue that  2951(2) violates the\r\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Speech\r\nClause of the First Amendment by preventing appellants from using\r\ntheir tuition allotments to expose their children to the\r\neducational message which best reflects their morals and values.  \r\nFirst, the parents argue that they have a fundamental\r\nright to direct the upbringing and education of their children\r\nbased on substantive due process rights that arise from Supreme\r\nCourt decisions.  See, e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S.\r\n510 (1925).  On that general proposition, we do not disagree. \r\nHowever, that fundamental right does not require the state to\r\ndirectly pay for a sectarian education. Here, the statute does not\r\nprevent the parents from doing what they wish; it only prevents the\r\nstate from helping pay for their wishes.  We reject this contention\r\nout of hand.  \r\nSecond, on the free speech side, plaintiff-appellants\r\ncontend that  2591(2) violates plaintiff-appellant's their rights\r\nbecause it denies parents the right to communicate and instruct\r\ntheir children in the areas of religion, morals and ethics which\r\nthey cannot accomplish in non-sectarian schools.  With little more\r\nthan academic articles to bolster their view, we find this claim to\r\nbe meritless as well.\r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Costs\r\nare imposed against appellants.\r\n\n                          \"Concurrence to follow\"         CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.  I agree that\r\nplaintiffs have not shown that Maine's statute subsidizing\r\nattendance at non-sectarian private schools, in communities lacking\r\npublic schools, is unconstitutional.  But I see no need for this\r\ncourt to decide that a broader statute (i.e., one also subsidizing\r\nattendance at sectarian private schools) would violate the\r\nestablishment clause of the First Amendment (\"Congress shall make\r\nno law respecting an establishment of religion\").\r\nFor the reasons stated by my colleagues, supra, I agree\r\nthat the Maine statute, as presently written, does not violate the\r\nfree exercise clause of the First Amendment nor principles of\r\nsubstantive due process.\r\nMy colleagues and I part company, however, in our\r\nanalysis of plaintiffs' establishment clause and equal protection\r\nclause claims.  The Maine tuition statute was narrowed in 1981 to\r\nexclude religiously-affiliated schools in response to a decision of\r\nthe Maine Attorney General concluding that the inclusion of\r\nreligiously-affiliated schools in Maine's tuition program violated\r\nthe establishment clause of the federal Constitution.  See Bagley,\r\net al. v. Raymond School Department, -- A.2d --, 1999 WL 236464\r\n(Me. April 23, 1999).  Last month, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\r\nupheld the continued constitutionality of the exclusion of\r\nsectarian schools, holding that to fund them would violate the\r\nestablishment clause.  My colleagues apparently believe, as did the\r\nMaine court, that since the Maine legislature excluded sectarian\r\nschools because of establishment clause concerns, the latter must\r\nbe addressed by us: the Maine court, indeed, suggested that if\r\nallowing tuition benefits to the sectarian schools would not\r\nviolate the establishment clause, then denying such benefits would\r\nviolate the equal protection clause, as denial would not then\r\nwithstand even the minimal, \"rational basis,\" scrutiny under the\r\nConstitution's equal protection clause.  In such event, plaintiffs\r\nwould have succeeded in demonstrating that the current statute is\r\nunconstitutional, being violative of the equal protection clause.\r\nWhile I understand the above rationale, I think it goes\r\nfurther than necessary.  I prefer not to render an opinion based on\r\nspeculation as to the constitutionality of a statute different from\r\nthe one under discussion.  Contrary to what my colleagues seem to\r\nsuggest, supra, ours is not a case that involves the \"imbroglio\" of\r\ndirect subsidies paid to sectarian schools.  Rather, the Maine\r\nlegislature, acting on the basis of an opinion issued by its\r\nAttorney General, has expressly excluded sectarian schools from the\r\npossibility of receiving subsidies.  The question is whether the\r\ncurrent statute is unconstitutional, not whether a more inclusive\r\none would be.\r\nPlaintiffs argue that various constitutional provisions,\r\nincluding, oddly, the establishment clause itself, are offended by\r\ndenying tuition benefits to sectarian schools.  But none of\r\nplaintiffs' theories of unconstitutionality work.  The \r\nestablishment clause certainly provides plaintiffs with no\r\naffirmative basis for requiring the funding of sectarian schools,\r\nfor reasons well explained by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in\r\nits recent  decision, -- A2d at -- , 1999 WL 236464 at 5, and by my\r\ncolleagues.\r\nBecause plaintiffs' attempt to use the establishment\r\nclause as a sword fails, and because the Maine statute does not,\r\nfor the reasons stated by my colleagues, violate the free exercise\r\nclause, no fundamental right is implicated here for equal\r\nprotection purposes.  Thus, the proper level of scrutiny under the\r\nequal protection clause is the most deferential - rational basis\r\nreview.  See Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 375 n.14 (1974)\r\n(where Act did not violate appellee's right of free exercise of\r\nreligion, court has no occasion to apply a standard of scrutiny\r\nstricter than rational basis test); see also Griffin High School v.\r\nIllinois High School Ass'n, 822 F.2d 671, 674 (7th Cir. 1987).\r\nIn my view, plaintiffs' equal protection clause claim\r\nfails not because, as my colleagues conclude, the Maine Attorney\r\nGeneral's opinion relied upon by the legislature was necessarily\r\ncorrect that including sectarian schools would or might violate the\r\nestablishment clause, hence was better left alone.  Rather, the\r\naction of the Maine legislature need only be supported by a\r\nrational basis, not one that turns out to be correct on the merits. \r\nRational basis review is \"a paradigm of judicial restraint\" . . .\r\nand \"[w]here there are 'plausible reasons' for [the action of the\r\nlegislature], 'our inquiry is at an end.'\"  FCC v. Beach\r\nCommunications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 314 (1993)(quoting United\r\nStates R.R. Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 179 (1980)). \r\nSee also Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of\r\nEqualization, 451 U.S. 648, 672 (1981) (\"the Equal Protection\r\nClause is satisfied if we conclude that the California Legislature\r\nrationally could have believed\" that the measure promoted its\r\nobjectives) (emphasis in original).\r\nThe Maine legislature rationally could have believed that\r\nincluding sectarian schools within its funding scheme would or\r\nmight violate the establishment clause, hence was better left\r\nalone.  Several opinions of the United States Supreme Court cited\r\nby my colleagues and by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\r\nundoubtedly lend support to such a viewpoint.  See, e.g., Committee\r\nfor Pub. Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756 (1973). \r\nThese precedents are not conclusive, however, and many commentators\r\ninterpret the more recent cases as indicating  that the Supreme\r\nCourt will uphold state tuition schemes that provide funding to\r\nsectarian as well as non-sectarian schools.  The fact is that\r\nestablishment clause jurisprudence as applied to this particular\r\narea is so unclear today that no court other than the Supreme Court\r\ncan reliably resolve whether a statutory scheme like Maine's would\r\nviolate the establishment clause were it to fund sectarian as well\r\nas non-sectarian schools.  In spite of this uncertainty, however,\r\nthe Maine legislature's fear, based on its Attorney General's\r\nanalysis, that including sectarian schools would violate the\r\nestablishment clause was and remains entirely rational.  While the\r\nodds were perhaps stronger in 1981 than they are today, existing\r\ncase law still provides a reasonable basis for legislative refusal\r\nto extend tuition grants to sectarian schools.  I see the Maine\r\nlegislature, in 1981 and to this moment, as having rationally and\r\nprudently excluded sectarian schools because of a well-founded\r\nconcern - whether or not ultimately correct - that to do otherwise\r\nwill or may violate the establishment clause.  The existence of\r\nthat fear is rational enough, I think, to meet equal protection\r\n(and free exercise) requirements, however defined.\r\nThis is not to say that the Supreme Court may not \r\nsomeday decide that inclusion of sectarian schools in a scheme like\r\nthis is permissible under the establishment clause.  A strong\r\nargument can be made to that effect.  Were the Supreme Court to so\r\nrule, plaintiffs might then be in a position to seek relief on free\r\nexercise or equal protection grounds, for under those circumstances\r\nthe legislative basis for the exclusion of sectarian schools - the\r\nfear that the establishment clause bars their inclusion - will have\r\nbeen negated.  But in today's climate, lacking further Supreme\r\nCourt enlightenment, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the Maine\r\nstatute violates any provision of the Constitution.  Accordingly,\r\nI agree that we should affirm the judgment of the district court,\r\nbut - like that court - I see no need whatever to reach out and\r\ndecide the thorny establishment clause issue -- an issue that, as\r\nmy colleagues also recognize, can be meaningfully resolved only by\r\nthe Supreme Court itself.\n",

For these\r\nstudents, the state will pay grants directly to qualified private\r\neducational institutions to subsidize their schooling, provided the\r\ninstitutions are \"non-sectarian\" in nature.\r\nPlaintiff-Appellants are the parents of students who are\r\notherwise qualified to receive the benefits of this state-created\r\nsubsidy, except that they have chosen to send their children to\r\nprivate sectarian schools.  After Maine refused to fund their\r\nchosen sectarian institution, St. Dominic's Regional High School in\r\nLewiston, Maine, the parents brought an action in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Maine alleging numerous\r\nviolations of their rights under: (1) the Establishment Clause; (2)\r\nthe Equal Protection Clause; (3) the Free Exercise Clause; (4) the\r\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (5) the Speech\r\nClause of the First Amendment.\r\nThe district court framed the issue before it as \"whether\r\nMaine is constitutionally required to extend subsidies to sectarian\r\nschools.\"  It viewed plaintiff-appellants' arguments \"in terms of\r\nfree exercise claims, establishment clause claims, equal protection \r\nclaims and substantive due process claims,\" but found \"it\r\nunnecessary to address [them] separately or to analyze the various\r\ntests that have been enumerated,\" because \"[t]he same answer is\r\nobvious for all.\"  Concluding that although plaintiff-appellants\r\nwere free to send their children to sectarian schools, \"they do not\r\nhave a right to require taxpayers to subsidize that choice,\" the\r\ndistrict court rejected their claims and granted summary judgment\r\nin favor of defendant-appellees.  This appeal followed.\r\nBelow we address seriatim each of the bases on which the\r\nplaintiffs' claim an entitlement to relief.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Establishment Clause\r\nFirst, plaintiff-appellants argue that the statute,\r\n2591(2), violates the Establishment Clause because, rather than\r\ntreating religion neutrally, it demonstrates a hostility toward\r\nreligion by excluding otherwise eligible sectarian schools from the\r\ntuition program based solely on the religious viewpoint presented\r\nby these schools.\r\nAlthough \"this Nation's history has not been one of\r\nentirely sanitized separation between Church and State,\" Committee\r\nfor Pub. Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760\r\n(1993), and while various forms of aid to religious institutions\r\nare permissible and have been approved by the somewhat inscrutable\r\nguidelines of the Supreme Court, there is no binding authority for \r\n\nthe proposition that the direct payment of tuition by the state to\r\na private sectarian school is constitutionally permissible.  See\r\nid. at 780.\r\nA statement to the effect that \"Congress shall make no\r\nlaw respecting the establishment of religion,\" U.S. Const. amend.\r\nI, is hardly equivocal language.  The fact that it is the first of\r\nthe several constitutional do's and don'ts contained in the Bill of\r\nRights may not have been coincidental.  Separation of church and\r\nstate constituted a paramount principle and goal in the minds of\r\nsome of the most influential of the Framers both by dint of\r\nhistorical experience, and personal conviction.\r\nWe highlight the proposition that in some cases in which\r\nstate infringement on the free exercise of religion takes place,\r\notherwise prohibited conduct may be permitted if the state\r\nestablishes an overriding societal interest. Upholding the\r\nEstablishment Clause, which is aimed at avoiding an entangled\r\nchurch and state, is such a paramount interest.  In the long run,\r\nan entanglement of the two has been shown by history to be\r\noppressive of religious freedom.  See Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 760;\r\nEngel v. Vitale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106443\"><a href=\"/opinion/106443/engel-v-vitale/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431 (1962) (such a union may tend\r\n\"to destroy government and to degrade religion.\"); Everson, 330\r\nU.S. at 12 (\"cruel persecutions were the inevitable result of\r\ngovernment established religions.\").  The present case, in which\r\ndirect subsidies would be paid by the state to a sectarian primary\r\nand secondary school, is such an imbroglio.\r\nIn Nyquist, New York created a two-part program to help\r\ndefray the costs of educating low-income children who chose to\r\nattend private religious schools.  See 413 U.S. at 762-67.  The\r\nfirst part of the program provided for direct money grants from the\r\nState to \"qualifying\" nonpublic schools to be used for the\r\n\"maintenance and repair of . . . school facilities and equipment to\r\nensure the health, welfare and safety of enrolled pupils.\"  Id. at\r\n762.  The second part involved tuition reimbursement grants which\r\nthe state gave to low-income parents of private schoolchildren\r\n(including those who attended religious schools) as partial\r\nreimbursement for their children's tuition, and limited state\r\nincome tax relief for parents who did not qualify for the tuition\r\nreimbursement.  See id. at 764.  The Court concluded that all three\r\nprograms were invalid under the Establishment Clause because they\r\nhad the primary effect of advancing religion.  See id. at 774-94. \r\nWith reference to the reimbursement portion of the law, the Court\r\nstated:\r\n             There can be no question that these grants\r\n  could not, consistently with the\r\n  Establishment Clause, be given directly to\r\n  sectarian schools, since they would suffer\r\n  from the same deficiency that renders\r\n  invalid the grants for maintenance and\r\n  repairs. In the absence of an effective\r\n  means of guaranteeing that the state aid\r\n  derived from public funds will be used\r\n  exclusively for secular, neutral, and\r\n  nonideological purposes, it is clear from\r\n  our cases that direct aid in whatever form\r\n  is invalid.\r\n\nId. at 780 (emphasis added).\r\nThis dichotomy between direct and indirect aid is a\r\nrecurring theme throughout Establishment Clause litigation. \r\nAlthough not all cases fit neatly within this formula, and this\r\nsomewhat tenuous distinction has been the subject of considerable\r\ncriticism by academia, it is the closest thing that we have to a\r\nworkable bright line rule, or that perhaps is possible.\r\nNevertheless, one thing is certain: the Supreme Court has\r\nnever permitted broad sponsorship of religious schools.  In those\r\ninstances in which the Court has permitted funding to flow to\r\nreligious schools, it has been in the context of a targeted grant,\r\navailable to a limited population, for a specific purpose.

Felton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118133\"><a href=\"/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997) (upholding a\r\nfederally funded program providing supplemental, remedial\r\ninstruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis, taught on\r\nthe premises of sectarian schools by government employees); Zobrest\r\nv.

We find no authority in the Court's jurisprudence for\r\nnow extending state support of sectarian schools from beyond the\r\nclass of particular, limited situations described above.  See supra\r\nnote 5.\r\nMoreover, reliance by plaintiff-appellants on the Supreme\r\nCourt's decision in Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of University\r\nof Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), is misplaced. In Rosenberger, the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorized payment\r\nto outside contractors for the printing costs of a variety of\r\npublications issued by several student organizations.  These\r\npayments, made from an activities fund generated by imposing\r\nmandatory student fees, were  designed to support a broad range of\r\nextracurricular student activities related to the University's\r\neducational purpose.  The University withheld authorization for\r\npayments to a printer with respect to one student organization's\r\npublication because it deemed it to be contrary to University\r\nguidelines prohibiting aid to religious organizations or\r\nactivities.  The student organization in question, as well as the\r\npublications for which printing costs were sought, promoted a\r\n\"Christian\" viewpoint.  The University's denial of printing\r\npayments was successfully challenged by the student organization on\r\nthe basis of viewpoint discrimination.  See id. at 832-35; see also \r\nRegan v. Taxation with Representation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110935\"><a href=\"/opinion/110935/regan-v-taxation-with-representation-of-wash/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983) (holding\r\nthat the state cannot discriminate based on the viewpoint of\r\nprivate persons whose speech it subsidizes).\r\nIn answering the University's concerns that such payments\r\nmight run afoul of the First Amendment, the Court ruled that the\r\nfunding did not contravene the Establishment Clause because it was\r\n\"neutral towards religion.\"  Id. at 840.  The neutrality of the\r\nprogram, the Court reasoned, distinguished it from a tax levied to\r\ndirectly support a church.  See id.  There is a critical\r\ndifference \"between government speech [or action] endorsing\r\nreligion, which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private\r\nspeech [or action] endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and\r\nFree Exercise Clauses protect.\" Id. at 843 (emphasis in original,\r\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\r\nMost telling, from the perspective of the present case,\r\nis the majority's analysis of the issues presented by that appeal:\r\n             The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are\r\n  correct to extract from our decisions the\r\n  principle that we have recognized special\r\n  Establishment Clause dangers where the\r\n  government makes direct money payments to\r\n  sectarian institutions.  The error is not\r\n  in identifying the principle, but in\r\n  believing that it controls this case . . .\r\n  [T]he Court of Appeals decided a case that\r\n  was, in essence, not before it, and the\r\n  dissent would have us do the same. We do\r\n  not confront a case where, even under a\r\n  neutral program that includes nonsectarian\r\n  recipients, the government is making\r\n  direct money payments to an institution or\r\n  group that is engaged in religious\r\n  activity . . . . [T]he undisputed fact\r\n  [is] that no public funds flow directly to\r\n  [the student organization's] coffers.\"\r\n\nId. at 842 (emphasis added, internal citations omitted).\r\nIn lauding neutrality as the keystone of Establishment\r\nClause jurisprudence, plaintiff-appellants forget that neutrality\r\nis but one \"hallmark of the Establishment Clause.\" Rosenberger, 514\r\nU.S. at 846 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Rosenberger neither\r\ntrumpets the supremacy of the neutrality principle nor signals the\r\ndemise of the funding prohibition in Establishment Clause\r\njurisprudence.  See id. at 852 (O'Connor, J., concurring).\r\nThe historic barrier that has existed between church and\r\nstate throughout the life of the Republic has up to the present\r\nacted as an insurmountable impediment to the direct payments or\r\nsubsidies by the state to sectarian institutions, particularly in\r\nthe context of primary and secondary schools.  See Tilton v.\r\nRichardson, 403 U.S. at 684-87 (relying on the lessened danger of\r\nprohibited entanglement when college level institutions are\r\ninvolved); Hart v. McNair, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108862\"><a href=\"/opinion/108862/hunt-v-mcnair/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973) (upholding the\r\ncreation of a public agency designed to assist in the placement of\r\nrevenue bonds for the construction of buildings designed for\r\nsecular use at higher education facilities including parochial\r\ncolleges).  Although the guidance provided by the Supreme Court has\r\nbeen less than crystalline, perhaps often by necessity due to the\r\nsubject matter involved, approving direct payments of tuition by\r\nthe state to sectarian schools represents a quantum leap that we\r\nare unwilling to take.  Creating such a breach in the wall\r\nseparating the State from secular establishments is a task best\r\nleft for the Supreme Court to undertake.\r\nFinally, we are at a loss to understand why plaintiff-\r\nappellants believe that the Establishment Clause gives them a basis\r\nfor recovery.  The Establishment Clause forbids the making of a law\r\nrespecting the establishment of any religion.  There is no relevant\r\nprecedent for using its negative prohibition  as a basis for\r\nextending the right of a religiously affiliated group to secure\r\nstate subsidies.\r\nII.  Equal Protection\r\nPlaintiff-appellants argue that in addition to violating\r\nthe Establishment Clause, Maine's alleged hostility towards\r\nreligion violates their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  They claim that by virtue of the statute\r\nin question they are being discriminated against on the basis of\r\nreligion, religious beliefs, speech content, and association.\r\nPlaintiff-appellants' equal protection claims fail for\r\nmany of the same reasons that their Establishment Clause challenge\r\nfounders.  Writ simple, the state cannot be in the business of\r\ndirectly supporting religious schools.  Plaintiff-appellants' equal\r\nprotection claims fail, because, regardless of the appropriate\r\nlevel of scrutiny we employ, the state's compelling interest in\r\navoiding an Establishment Clause violation requires that the\r\nstatute exclude sectarian schools from the tuition program.\r\nPlaintiff-appellants allege on appeal that they \"have\r\nbeen singled out simply because they desire their children to be\r\neducated in a Christian environment and from a biblical\r\nperspective, and for no other reason.\"  Appellants' Br. at 23-24. \r\nPlaintiff-appellants desire that the state pay grants directly to\r\nsectarian schools, in this case St. Dominic's, to subsidize their\r\nchildren's schooling.  Given the present state of jurisprudence, we\r\ncan see no way in which this can be done without violating the\r\nEstablishment Clause.  See Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 780.  As a result,\r\nwe find no Equal Protection Clause violation.\r\nWe are fortified in our conclusion by the Maine Supreme\r\nCourt's recent opinion in Bagley v. Raymond School Department, --\r\nA.2d --, No. 98-281, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">236464</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Me. April 23, 1999),  dealing\r\nwith a similar situation.  In resolving a similar Equal Protection\r\nClause challenge, the court stated:\r\n           That state funds would flow directly into\r\nthe coffers of religious schools in Maine were\r\nit not for the existing exclusion cannot be\r\ndebated.  If the religious school exclusion\r\nwere eliminated, the State would likely pay\r\nmore than $5,000 per student to Cheverus High\r\nSchool, without restriction on the use of\r\nthose funds.  In the entire history of the\r\nSupreme Court's struggle to interpret the\r\nEstablishment Clause it has never concluded\r\nthat such a direct, unrestricted financial\r\nsubsidy to a religious school could escape the\r\nstrictures of the Establishment Clause.  While\r\nit may be possible for the legislature to\r\ncraft a program that would allow parents\r\ngreater flexibility in choosing private\r\nschools for their children, the current\r\nprogram could not be easily tailored to\r\ninclude religious schools without addressing\r\nsignificant problems of entanglement or the\r\nadvancement of religion.\r\n\nBagley, slip. op. at 40-41.\r\nIII.  Free Exercise\r\nPlaintiff-appellants argue that  2951(2) violates the\r\nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because it excludes\r\nfunding of sectarian education solely on the basis of religion. \r\nHowever, we conclude that the Free Exercise Clause is not\r\nimplicated here.  See Sherbert v. Verner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106660\"><a href=\"/opinion/106660/sherbert-v-verner/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412 (1963)\r\n(Douglas, J., concurring) (\"[T]he Free Exercise Clause is written\r\nin terms of what the government cannot do to the individual, not in\r\nterms of what the individual can exact from the government.\").\r\nFour points support our conclusion.  First, at least some\r\nof the parents in this litigation eschew any religious motivation\r\nfor wishing to attend St. Dominic's.  For them, academic\r\nsuperiority, rather than the school's Roman Catholic affiliation,\r\ndrives their enrollment decisions.\r\nSecond, no one plausibly reading the statute could come\r\nto any conclusion other than that  2591(2) does not prevent\r\nattendance at a religious school.  Nor does  2591(2) prevent\r\nreligious education of children in Maine.  All it means is that the\r\ncost of religious education must be borne by the parents and not\r\nthe state.\r\nThird, Hernndez v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 699\r\n(1988), identifies the free exercise inquiry as asking \"whether\r\ngovernment has placed a substantial burden on the observation of a\r\ncentral belief or practice.\" (emphasis added).  Factually speaking,\r\neducation at a parochial school is not such a belief, for the Roman\r\nCatholic Church does not mandate it.  See Catechism of the Catholic\r\nChurch 537-38 (1994) (stating that parents' responsibilities for\r\nreligious education for religious education takes place primarily\r\nin the home and that choosing a religious school is a right but not\r\nan absolute duty).  To be sure, the Catholic Church requires some\r\nreligious education, see id. at 538, but as stated above,  2591(2)\r\ndoes not prevent such religious education.  Indeed, it says nothing\r\nabout it.  Moreover, no parent makes the claim that attendance at\r\na religious school is a central tenet or practice of their faith.\r\nFourth, the primary case cited by the parents, Church of\r\nthe Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1993), is inapposite.  In that case, the record showed a\r\nsubstantial animus against Santera that motivated the law in\r\nquestion.  See id. at 543 (stating that the \"record in this case\r\ncompels the conclusion that suppression of the central element of\r\nthe Santeria worship service was the object of the ordinances.\"). \r\nNo such showing has been made here.\r\nAs we mentioned earlier, even if this were a limit on\r\nfree exercise, the state has justified the limit by its purpose of\r\navoiding violation of the Establishment Clause.\r\nIV.  Due Process and Speech Clause Claims\r\nPlaintiff-appellants argue that  2951(2) violates the\r\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Speech\r\nClause of the First Amendment by preventing appellants from using\r\ntheir tuition allotments to expose their children to the\r\neducational message which best reflects their morals and values.  \r\nFirst, the parents argue that they have a fundamental\r\nright to direct the upbringing and education of their children\r\nbased on substantive due process rights that arise from Supreme\r\nCourt decisions.  See, e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100694\"><a href=\"/opinion/100694/pierce-v-society-of-sisters/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1925).  On that general proposition, we do not disagree. \r\nHowever, that fundamental right does not require the state to\r\ndirectly pay for a sectarian education. Here, the statute does not\r\nprevent the parents from doing what they wish; it only prevents the\r\nstate from helping pay for their wishes.  We reject this contention\r\nout of hand.  \r\nSecond, on the free speech side, plaintiff-appellants\r\ncontend that  2591(2) violates plaintiff-appellant's their rights\r\nbecause it denies parents the right to communicate and instruct\r\ntheir children in the areas of religion, morals and ethics which\r\nthey cannot accomplish in non-sectarian schools.  With little more\r\nthan academic articles to bolster their view, we find this claim to\r\nbe meritless as well.\r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Costs\r\nare imposed against appellants.\r\n\n                          \"Concurrence to follow\"         CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.  I agree that\r\nplaintiffs have not shown that Maine's statute subsidizing\r\nattendance at non-sectarian private schools, in communities lacking\r\npublic schools, is unconstitutional.  But I see no need for this\r\ncourt to decide that a broader statute (i.e., one also subsidizing\r\nattendance at sectarian private schools) would violate the\r\nestablishment clause of the First Amendment (\"Congress shall make\r\nno law respecting an establishment of religion\").\r\nFor the reasons stated by my colleagues, supra, I agree\r\nthat the Maine statute, as presently written, does not violate the\r\nfree exercise clause of the First Amendment nor principles of\r\nsubstantive due process.\r\nMy colleagues and I part company, however, in our\r\nanalysis of plaintiffs' establishment clause and equal protection\r\nclause claims.  The Maine tuition statute was narrowed in 1981 to\r\nexclude religiously-affiliated schools in response to a decision of\r\nthe Maine Attorney General concluding that the inclusion of\r\nreligiously-affiliated schools in Maine's tuition program violated\r\nthe establishment clause of the federal Constitution.  See Bagley,\r\net al. v. Raymond School Department, -- A.2d --, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">236464</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(Me. April 23, 1999).  Last month, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\r\nupheld the continued constitutionality of the exclusion of\r\nsectarian schools, holding that to fund them would violate the\r\nestablishment clause.  My colleagues apparently believe, as did the\r\nMaine court, that since the Maine legislature excluded sectarian\r\nschools because of establishment clause concerns, the latter must\r\nbe addressed by us: the Maine court, indeed, suggested that if\r\nallowing tuition benefits to the sectarian schools would not\r\nviolate the establishment clause, then denying such benefits would\r\nviolate the equal protection clause, as denial would not then\r\nwithstand even the minimal, \"rational basis,\" scrutiny under the\r\nConstitution's equal protection clause.  In such event, plaintiffs\r\nwould have succeeded in demonstrating that the current statute is\r\nunconstitutional, being violative of the equal protection clause.\r\nWhile I understand the above rationale, I think it goes\r\nfurther than necessary.  I prefer not to render an opinion based on\r\nspeculation as to the constitutionality of a statute different from\r\nthe one under discussion.  Contrary to what my colleagues seem to\r\nsuggest, supra, ours is not a case that involves the \"imbroglio\" of\r\ndirect subsidies paid to sectarian schools.  Rather, the Maine\r\nlegislature, acting on the basis of an opinion issued by its\r\nAttorney General, has expressly excluded sectarian schools from the\r\npossibility of receiving subsidies.  The question is whether the\r\ncurrent statute is unconstitutional, not whether a more inclusive\r\none would be.\r\nPlaintiffs argue that various constitutional provisions,\r\nincluding, oddly, the establishment clause itself, are offended by\r\ndenying tuition benefits to sectarian schools.  But none of\r\nplaintiffs' theories of unconstitutionality work.  The \r\nestablishment clause certainly provides plaintiffs with no\r\naffirmative basis for requiring the funding of sectarian schools,\r\nfor reasons well explained by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in\r\nits recent  decision, -- A2d at -- , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">236464</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 5, and by my\r\ncolleagues.\r\nBecause plaintiffs' attempt to use the establishment\r\nclause as a sword fails, and because the Maine statute does not,\r\nfor the reasons stated by my colleagues, violate the free exercise\r\nclause, no fundamental right is implicated here for equal\r\nprotection purposes.  Thus, the proper level of scrutiny under the\r\nequal protection clause is the most deferential - rational basis\r\nreview.  See Johnson v. Robison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108980\"><a href=\"/opinion/108980/johnson-v-robison/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375 n.14 (1974)\r\n(where Act did not violate appellee's right of free exercise of\r\nreligion, court has no occasion to apply a standard of scrutiny\r\nstricter than rational basis test); see also Griffin High School v.\r\nIllinois High School Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490585\"><a href=\"/opinion/490585/griffin-high-school-v-illinois-high-school-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (7th Cir. 1987).\r\nIn my view, plaintiffs' equal protection clause claim\r\nfails not because, as my colleagues conclude, the Maine Attorney\r\nGeneral's opinion relied upon by the legislature was necessarily\r\ncorrect that including sectarian schools would or might violate the\r\nestablishment clause, hence was better left alone.  Rather, the\r\naction of the Maine legislature need only be supported by a\r\nrational basis, not one that turns out to be correct on the merits. \r\nRational basis review is \"a paradigm of judicial restraint\" . . .\r\nand \"[w]here there are 'plausible reasons' for [the action of the\r\nlegislature], 'our inquiry is at an end.'\"  FCC v. Beach\r\nCommunications, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112870\"><a href=\"/opinion/112870/fcc-v-beach-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (1993)(quoting United\r\nStates R.R.

Co. v. State Bd. of\r\nEqualization, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110485\"><a href=\"/opinion/110485/western-southern-life-ins-co-v-state-bd-of-equalization-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672 (1981) (\"the Equal Protection\r\nClause is satisfied if we conclude that the California Legislature\r\nrationally could have believed\" that the measure promoted its\r\nobjectives) (emphasis in original).\r\nThe Maine legislature rationally could have believed that\r\nincluding sectarian schools within its funding scheme would or\r\nmight violate the establishment clause, hence was better left\r\nalone.  Several opinions of the United States Supreme Court cited\r\nby my colleagues and by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\r\nundoubtedly lend support to such a viewpoint.  See, e.g., Committee\r\nfor Pub. Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). \r\nThese precedents are not conclusive, however, and many commentators\r\ninterpret the more recent cases as indicating  that the Supreme\r\nCourt will uphold state tuition schemes that provide funding to\r\nsectarian as well as non-sectarian schools.  The fact is that\r\nestablishment clause jurisprudence as applied to this particular\r\narea is so unclear today that no court other than the Supreme Court\r\ncan reliably resolve whether a statutory scheme like Maine's would\r\nviolate the establishment clause were it to fund sectarian as well\r\nas non-sectarian schools.  In spite of this uncertainty, however,\r\nthe Maine legislature's fear, based on its Attorney General's\r\nanalysis, that including sectarian schools would violate the\r\nestablishment clause was and remains entirely rational.  While the\r\nodds were perhaps stronger in 1981 than they are today, existing\r\ncase law still provides a reasonable basis for legislative refusal\r\nto extend tuition grants to sectarian schools.  I see the Maine\r\nlegislature, in 1981 and to this moment, as having rationally and\r\nprudently excluded sectarian schools because of a well-founded\r\nconcern - whether or not ultimately correct - that to do otherwise\r\nwill or may violate the establishment clause.  The existence of\r\nthat fear is rational enough, I think, to meet equal protection\r\n(and free exercise) requirements, however defined.\r\nThis is not to say that the Supreme Court may not \r\nsomeday decide that inclusion of sectarian schools in a scheme like\r\nthis is permissible under the establishment clause.  A strong\r\nargument can be made to that effect.  Were the Supreme Court to so\r\nrule, plaintiffs might then be in a position to seek relief on free\r\nexercise or equal protection grounds, for under those circumstances\r\nthe legislative basis for the exclusion of sectarian schools - the\r\nfear that the establishment clause bars their inclusion - will have\r\nbeen negated.  But in today's climate, lacking further Supreme\r\nCourt enlightenment, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the Maine\r\nstatute violates any provision of the Constitution.  Accordingly,\r\nI agree that we should affirm the judgment of the district court,\r\nbut - like that court - I see no need whatever to reach out and\r\ndecide the thorny establishment clause issue -- an issue that, as\r\nmy colleagues also recognize, can be meaningfully resolved only by\r\nthe Supreme Court itself.\n</pre>",
