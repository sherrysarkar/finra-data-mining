This bankruptcy appeal arises out of a\n\ndispute over property rights.               The case was removed to the\n\nbankruptcy court when the defendants filed for bankruptcy.                  In\n\ndue course, the trustee in bankruptcy, acting for the debtors\n\nqua    defendants,      sought   summary     judgment.      The    plaintiffs\n\n(appellants here) did not timely oppose the motion, and the\n\nbankruptcy court granted it.          Jimenez v. Rodriquez, 233 B.R. 212\n\n(Bankr. D.P.R. 1999).        The plaintiffs appealed.        They also filed\n\na     number     of   post-judgment     motions,   all      of    which   were\n\nunsuccessful.         At that point, they filed a second appeal.           The\n\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) heard the consolidated appeals\n\nand issued an unpublished per curiam opinion affirming the\n\nbankruptcy court's rulings in all respects.              This appeal ensued.\n\n               We need not tarry.     We repeatedly have said that where\n\nthe lower courts astutely take the measure of a case and author\n\nconvincing, well-reasoned opinions, \"an appellate court should\n\nrefrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its\n\nown words resonate.\"         Lawton v.
