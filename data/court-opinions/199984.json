José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Jane A. Becker-Whitaker for appellant.\n     Leticia Casalduc Rabell, Assistant Solicitor General, with whom\nRoberto J. Sanchez Ramos, Solicitor General, and Vanessa Lugo Flores,\nDeputy Solicitor General, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                           June 4, 2002\n\f\f     Per curiam. Appellant Wilfrid Race claims that the district court\n\nimproperly refused to award him attorney's fees in an action under the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. We\n\nfind no error. The court correctly concluded that appellant was not a\n\nprevailing party for purposes of the ADA's fees provision, see id. at\n\n§ 12205, and thus was not entitled to recover legal expenses.\n\n     This action arose from appellant's encounter with Puerto Rico\n\npolice officers who stopped his car because it did not have a valid\n\nregistration sticker. Appellant had not yet renewed his registration\n\nbecause he was in the process of contesting a ticket he had received\n\nfor parking in a handicapped space without a Puerto Rico permit. He\n\ncould not obtain the new registration until that dispute was resolved.\n\nAppellant is, in fact, disabled, and his vehicle displayed a handicap\n\npermit issued in Ontario, Canada.\n\n     Appellant filed suit in federal court claiming a violation of the\n\nADA and related commonwealth law, and asking that the police be\n\nenjoined from stopping and arresting him for driving with an expired\n\nregistration sticker. The district court granted appellant's motion\n\nfor a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order, and a\n\nshort time later the Puerto Rico administrative process ended in his\n\nfavor. Appellant then moved for a voluntary dismissal of his federal\n\ncomplaint. Following the dismissal, appellant filed the request for\n\nfees that is the subject of this appeal.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f     Our review is for manifest abuse of discretion. Gay Officers\n\nAction League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 292 (lst Cir. 2001).\n\nAlthough fee awards for prevailing parties are \"virtually obligatory,\"\n\nsee id. at 293, the invariable prerequisite is that one must, in fact,\n\n\"prevail.\" Contrary to appellant's suggestion, one does not qualify as\n\na \"prevailing party\" simply by obtaining a change in the status quo.\n\nRather, \"a plaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his\n\nclaim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties . .\n\n. .\" Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111\n\n(1992)).\n\n     This case never progressed to the merits of appellant's ADA claim,\n\neven in a prefatory way. Cf., e.g., Coalition for Basic Human Needs v.\n\nKing, 691 F.2d 597, 601 (lst Cir. 1982) (awarding attorney's fees for\n\nplaintiffs who obtained injunction pending appeal where the court \"made\n\nits decision only after careful consideration of the [plaintiff's]\n\nlegal claims\").    Although issuance of a preliminary injunction\n\ntypically involves a review of the merits to determine whether the\n\nrequesting party is likely to succeed on his claim, see EF Cultural\n\nTravel BV v. Explorica, Inc., 274 F.3d 577, 581 (lst Cir. 2001), the\n\ndistrict court confirmed that it intended merely \"to safeguard\n\nPlaintiff's rights under the ADA while he was exhausting his\n\nadministrative remedies under state law.\" The court went on to state\n\nexplicitly that it did not address the merits of plaintiff's claim.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fThe record underscores the absence of substantive review; the case\n\nended at appellant's request before any action was taken on defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss, which asserted that the complaint failed to state a\n\nviable claim of disability discrimination.*\n\n     In sum, an individual may be entitled to attorney's fees \"without\n\nhaving obtained a favorable 'final judgment following a full trial on\n\nthe merits,'\" Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 756-57 (1980) ( per\n\ncuriam) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 7 (1976)), but he must\n\nobtain relief based \"'on the merits of at least some of his claims,'\"\n\nid. at 758 (quoted in Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va.\n\nDep't of Health and Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 603 (2001)). Appellant\n\ndid not reach that threshold, and the district court consequently did\n\nnot err in refusing a fee award.\n\n\n     *Although the complaint does not specify, we presume that\nappellant brought his claim under Title II of the ADA, which\nprohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities by\n\"public entities,\" which includes \"any department, agency,\nspecial purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or\nStates or local government.\"     See Parker v. Universidad de\nPuerto Rico, 225 F.3d 1, 4 & n.1 (lst Cir. 2000) (quoting 42\nU.S.C. § 12131(1)(B)).    To succeed with a Title II claim, a\nplaintiff must establish:\n\n     (1) that he is a qualified individual with a\n     disability; (2) that he was either excluded from\n     participation in or denied the benefits of some public\n     entity's services, programs, or activities or was\n     otherwise discriminated against; and (3) that such\n     exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was\n     by reason of the plaintiff's disability.\n\nId. at 5.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -6-\n\f",
