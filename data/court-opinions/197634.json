Upon careful  review  of the  briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nrecord, we reject defendant's contention that the evidence of\r\n\npossession  and  intent  to  distribute  was insufficient  to\r\n\nsupport his conviction  under 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1).   To the\r\n\ncontrary,  the testimony  of  the  police  officers  and  the\r\n\nspecial  narcotics   officer,  along   with  the   inferences\r\n\nreasonably  to be drawn therefrom, amply supported the jury's\r\n\nverdict.\r\n\n     Affirmed.
