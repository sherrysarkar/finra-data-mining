This case presents the first instance\r\n\nthis court has been asked to address an important question in the\r\n\nallocation \r                    of \r                      sovereign \r                                powers between the Penobscot Nation and the\r\n\nState of Maine: the definition of \"internal tribal matters.\"   If\r\n\nthe dispute here  involves an \"internal  tribal matter\" then  the\r\n\ntribal \r                courts \r                      have \r                           exclusive jurisdiction; if not, then claims have\r\n\nbeen stated within federal court jurisdiction and it was error to\r\n\ndismiss the action.  While defining what constitutes an  internal\r\n\nmatter  controlled by  Indian tribes  is hardly  novel in  Native\r\n\nAmerican law, it is novel in this context.  The relations between\r\n\nMaine \r               and \r                   the \r                      Penobscot \r                                Nation are not governed by all of the usual\r\n\nlaws governing such  relationships, but by  two unique laws,  one\r\n\nMaine and one  federal, approving a settlement.  That  settlement\r\n\nresulted from disputed claims for vast portions of lands in Maine\r\n\nbrought \r                 by \r                    the Penobscots and others who had not historically been\r\n\nformally recognized as sovereign Indians.\r\n\n                               I.\r\n\n     This case involves  the harvesting of timber on those  lands\r\n\nacquired by  the Penobscot Nation as  a result of the  settlement\r\n\nagreement. \r                     \r                    Plaintiff \r                              Andrew X. Akins is the former Chairman of the\r\n\nJoint Tribal  Negotiating Committee; he  now resides in  Alabama.\r\n\nAkins \r               and \r                   his \r                      company, \r                               PENAK, Inc., also a plaintiff (whom we refer\r\n\nto jointly as \"Akins\")  for several years logged portions of  the\r\n\nland under stumpage permits issued by the Nation.  In December of\r\n\n1993, the Nation's  Tribal Council voted  a new policy:  stumpage\r\n\npermits  would be issued  only to people  who were both  enrolled\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nmembers \r                 of \r                    the \r                       Nation \r                              and residents of Maine.  Akins is an enrolled\r\n\nmember of the Nation, but not a Maine resident.  Akins says he is\r\n\nthe \r             only \r                  tribal \r                        member \r                               who will be affected by the new policy.  The\r\n\npolicy \r                became \r                      effective \r                                on May 18, 1994 and the next day the Nation\r\n\ntold Akins he was not eligible for a permit.\r\n\n     Akins  sued the Nation  and its Tribal  Council in the  U.S.\r\n\nDistrict \r                  Court \r                        in \r                          Maine, \r                                 under 42 U.S.C. SS 1983 and 1985, alleging\r\n\nthat \r              singling \r                       him \r                          out \r                              through an ostensibly neutral policy violated\r\n\nhis rights to due process, equal protection, and to be free  from\r\n\nbills of attainder.  He also brought state law claims and alleged\r\n\ndiversity \r                   jurisdiction. \r                                 \r                                 A report of a Magistrate Judge recommended\r\n\ndismissal \r                   of \r                      the \r                         case \r                              for failure to state a claim for which relief\r\n\nmay be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   The\r\n\nU.S. District Court  accepted the  recommendation and  dismissed.\r\n\nAkins appeals, arguing: that the district court erred in  holding\r\n\nthat the stumpage policy is an \"internal tribal matter;\" that  he\r\n\nhas \r             cognizable claims under 42 U.S.C. SS 1983 and 1985, as well as\r\n\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act,  28 U.S.C. S 2201-02; and that  the\r\n\nstumpage policy violates the Maine Administrative Procedures  Act\r\n\nand the Maine Constitution.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n     The  issues   in  this  case   cannot  be  grasped   without\r\n\nunderstanding \r                       the \r                          genesis of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act\r\n\nof \r            1980, \r                  25 \r                     U.S.C. SS 1721-35 (the \"Settlement Act\").  The history\r\n\nof the Settlement Act was brought to life in the decision of  the\r\n\nMaine \r               Law \r                   Court in Penobscot Nation v. Stilphen, 461 A.2d 478, 487\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n(Me. \r              1983), \r                     and \r                        of \r                           this \r                                Circuit in Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Maine, 75\r\n\nF.3d 784, 787 (1st Cir. 1996).  A summary of that history will do\r\n\nhere.\r\n\n     The disputes which led to the settlement involved assertions\r\n\nthat certain persons and groups were members of Indian tribes and\r\n\nas such entitled to ancestral lands and to monetary damages.  The\r\n\nclaimed lands amounted to nearly two-thirds of Maine's landmass. \r\n\nSee\r             \r             Joint \r                   Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton, 388\r\n\nF. Supp. 649, 651-53, 667-69  (D. Me.), aff'd, 528 F.2d 370  (1st\r\n\nCir. 1975).  Under federal auspices, the Penobscot Nation,  other\r\n\nclaimants, \r                    and Maine negotiated a settlement.  That settlement was\r\n\nsubject to approval  by both the Maine Legislature and  Congress.\r\n\nMaine \r               enacted the Implementing Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30 SS\r\n\n6201-14, which provides:\r\n\n          [T]he Passamaquoddy  Tribe and the  Penobscot\r\n          Nation,  within   their   respective   Indian\r\n          territories, shall  have, exercise and  enjoy\r\n          all  the   rights,  privileges,  powers   and\r\n          immunities, \r                               including, but without limitation,\r\n          the power  to  enact ordinances  and  collect\r\n          taxes, \r                          and \r                              shall be subject to all the duties,\r\n          obligations, liabilities and limitations of a\r\n          municipality \r                                of and subject to the laws of the\r\n          State, provided however, that internal tribal\r\n          matters,   including   membership   in    the\r\n          respective tribe  or  nation,  the  right  to\r\n          reside   within    the   respective    Indian\r\n          territories,  tribal   organization,   tribal\r\n          government, tribal elections  and the use  or\r\n          disposition of  settlement fund income  shall\r\n          not be subject to regulation by the State.\r\n\nTitle 30, S 6206(1)  (emphasis added).  The Implementing Act  was\r\n\nincorporated \r                      into the federal Settlement Act of 1980, 25 U.S.C. SS\r\n\n1721-35.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n     Each \r                   party \r                        benefitted \r                                   from the settlement.  The Nation in many\r\n\nrespects gained  the powers of  a municipality  under Maine  law.\r\n\n\"[T]he \r                Settlement Act confirmed [the Nation's] title to designated\r\n\nreservation lands, memorialized federal recognition of its tribal\r\n\nstatus, and  opened the floodgate for  the influx of millions  of\r\n\ndollars in federal  subsidies.\"  Passamaquoddy Tribe, 75 F.3d  at\r\n\n787.  Maine, in turn, put to rest the land claims and  achieved a\r\n\ncertain sharing of authority with the Nation, as described below.\r\n\n                              III.\r\n\n     The structure of analysis differs here from that which would\r\n\nbe \r            used \r                 in \r                    claims against the vast majority of other Indian tribes\r\n\nin \r            the \r                country.2  This is true as to the application of both state\r\n\nand federal law.  As to state law, the Penobscot Nation and Maine\r\n\nexpressly \r                   agreed that, with very limited exceptions, the Nation is\r\n\nsubject \r                 to \r                    the laws of Maine.  See 25 U.S.C. S 1725.  Congress was\r\n\nexplicit \r                  that the purpose of the Settlement Act was \"to ratify the\r\n\nMaine \r               Implementing Act, which defines the relationship between the\r\n\nState \r               of \r                  Maine \r                        . \r                         . \r                           . \r                             and \r                                 the Penobscot Nation\" and \"to confirm that\r\n\nall \r             other \r                   Indians \r                           . \r                            . \r                              . \r                                are and shall be subject to the laws of the\r\n\nState of Maine, as provided herein.\"  25 U.S.C. S 1721(b)(3)&amp;(4).\r\n\nThe federal Settlement Act provides that:\r\n\n          The \r                       . \r                         . \r                           . \r                             Penobscot Nation, and [its] members,\r\n          and the land and natural resources owned  by,\r\n          or \r                      held \r                           in \r                              trust for the benefit of the tribe,\r\n          nation, or [its] members, shall be subject to\r\n\n2.  The Narragansett tribe in Rhode Island is also governed by a\r\nClaims Settlement Act.  See 25 U.S.C. SS 1701-06 (1978);\r\nNarragansett Indian Tribe v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d 908\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          the jurisdiction of the State of Maine to the\r\n          extent \r                          and \r                              in the manner provided in the Maine\r\n          Implementing  Act  and  that  Act  is  hereby\r\n          approved, ratified, and confirmed.\r\n\n25 U.S.C. S 1725(b)(1).  In turn, the Settlement Act made federal\r\n\nlaw \r             which \r                   was then generally applicable to Indians also applicable\r\n\nto the Penobscot Nation but declared special laws and regulations\r\n\ninapplicable.  See 25 U.S.C. S  1725(h).  The State of Maine  may\r\n\namend the Implementing Act to modify the jurisdictional powers of\r\n\nthe Nation only if  the Nation agrees to  the amendment.  See  25\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1725(e)(1).\r\n\n     Although  Indian  tribes are  not  usually  subject  to  the\r\n\ndiversity jurisdiction  of the federal  courts, see Romanella  v.\r\n\nHayward, 114 F.3d 15 (2d Cir. 1997), the Settlement Act  subjects\r\n\nthe Maine tribes to diversity jurisdiction:  \r\n\n          the \r                       Penobscot Nation . . . may sue and be sued\r\n          in the courts of  the . . . United States  to\r\n          the same extent as any other entity or person\r\n          residing in the State of Maine may sue and be\r\n          sued in [that] court.3\r\n\n25 \r            U.S.C. \r                   S \r                     1725(d)(1).  Further, those federal laws enacted after\r\n\nOctober \r                 10, \r                     1980 \r                         (the \r                              effective date of the Settlement Act) for the\r\n\nbenefit of Indians do  not apply within Maine unless the  federal\r\n\nstatute is made expressly  applicable within Maine.  25 U.S.C.  S\r\n\n1735(b).\r\n\n     The Settlement Act provides at 25 U.S.C. S 1725(f):\r\n\n          The  .  .  .  Penobscot  Nation  [is]  hereby\r\n          authorized to exercise jurisdiction, separate\r\n          and distinct  from  the  civil  and  criminal\r\n\n3.  That section also provides certain immunities from suit.  We\r\ndo not reach the issue of immunity.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          jurisdiction of the  State of  Maine, to  the\r\n          extent authorized  by the Maine  Implementing\r\n          Act, and any subsequent amendments thereto.\r\n\nThe Implementing Act in turn makes the Nation subject \"to all the\r\n\nduties, \r                 obligations, liabilities and limitations of a municipality\r\n\n. . . provided, however, that internal tribal matters . . . shall\r\n\nnot be subject to regulation by the State.\"  Me. Rev. Stat.  Ann.\r\n\ntit. 30, S 6206(1) (emphasis  added).  The viability of both  the\r\n\nfederal law claims  under S 1983 and  the state law claims  under\r\n\ndiversity jurisdiction depend on whether the Implementing Act and\r\n\nthe Settlement Act subject the Penobscot Nation's stumpage policy\r\n\nto \r            regulation \r                       by \r                         the \r                             State.  Put differently, the Nation in certain\r\n\ncapacities functions as a municipality of Maine and is  reachable\r\n\nunder \r               state \r                     and \r                        federal \r                                law in that capacity, but when it functions\r\n\nas a tribe as to internal tribal matters, it is not.\r\n\n     This \r                   case \r                        turns \r                             on \r                                whether the issuance of stumpage permits is\r\n\nan \r            \"internal \r                     tribal \r                            matter.\"  Under the Settlement Act, we consider\r\n\nthat to be a question of federal law, and the parties so  agree.4\r\n\nIf this is an internal  tribal matter, then Akins's S 1983  claim\r\n\nfails \r               because \r                       the \r                          Nation \r                                 would not have been acting \"under color of\r\n\nstate \r               law.\" \r                      \r                      See\r                         \r                         R.J. \r                              Williams Co. v. Fort Belknap Hous. Auth., 719\r\n\nF.2d 979, 982  (9th Cir. 1983); Dry  Creek Lodge, Inc. v.  United\r\n\nStates\r               , \r                 515 \r                    F.2d \r                         926, \r                              931 (10th Cir. 1975).  If this is an internal\r\n\ntribal \r                matter, then under both Settlement Act and the Implementing\r\n\nAct, Maine law does not apply and no claims arise under the Maine\r\n\n4.  The Settlement Act at 25 U.S.C. S 1735(a) recites that in the\r\nevent of any conflict between that Act and the Maine Implementing\r\nAct, the federal statute prevails.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nConstitution \r                      or \r                        under \r                              the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.  Thus\r\n\nno  claim arises  under  state  law warranting  the  exercise  of\r\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.\r\n\n                               IV.\r\n\n     In \r                 considering \r                             Akins's \r                                    S \r                                      1983 claim, we note that Congress did\r\n\nnot \r             exempt \r                    the Penobscot Nation from obligations not to trammel on\r\n\ncivil rights.   At  a minimum  it did  so in  a separate  general\r\n\nstatute, the Indian  Civil Rights Act of  1968 (\"ICRA\").  See  25\r\n\nU.S.C. SS 1301-41, made applicable to the Penobscot Nation by  25\r\n\nU.S.C. S  1725(h).  The  ICRA imposes  \"restrictions upon  tribal\r\n\ngovernments similar, but not identical, to those embodied in  the\r\n\nBill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Santa Clara Pueblo\r\n\nv. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 57 (1978).  Under the ICRA, \"No  Indian\r\n\ntribe in exercising powers of self-government shall . . . deny to\r\n\nany \r             person \r                    within \r                          its \r                              jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws\r\n\nor \r            deprive \r                    any \r                       person \r                              of \r                                 liberty or property without due process of\r\n\nlaw.\"  25 U.S.C. S 1302(8).\r\n\n     Two distinctions are pertinent.  As a matter of  substantive\r\n\nlaw,  generally, the ICRA  and not the  U.S. Constitution is  the\r\n\nsource of the rights.  See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 56; J.\r\n\nResnik, \r                 Dependent \r                          Soverei\r                                 gns: Indian Tribes, States and the Federal\r\n\nCourts, 56 U.  Chi. L. Rev. 671,  694 (1989) (\"Members of  Indian\r\n\ntribes cannot make Bill of Rights claims against their tribes.\").\r\n\nSecondly, such claims of violations of civil rights must be heard\r\n\nin the  tribal  courts, not  in  the federal  courts.   With  the\r\n\nexception of petitions for habeas corpus relief, Congress did not\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nintend in the ICRA to create implied causes of action to  redress\r\n\nsubstantive \r                     rights in federal court.5  See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436\r\n\nU.S. at 59-66.  Similarly, if this is an internal tribal  matter,\r\n\nthen the tribal court will have authority over the essence of the\r\n\nstate constitutional  claims.  The  ICRA contains  its own  equal\r\n\nprotection   and  due   process   guarantees.     Akins's   state\r\n\nconstitutional claims rest on similar guarantees.  This is not  a\r\n\npotential instance of a right without a remedy.\r\n\n                               V.\r\n\n     Is the  issuance  of stumpage  permits an  \"internal  tribal\r\n\nmatter\"?  The language of the statute itself is the first resort.\r\n\nThat language refers to:\r\n\n          internal tribal matters, including membership\r\n          in the respective tribe or nation, the  right\r\n          to  reside   within  the  respective   Indian\r\n          territories,  tribal   organization,   tribal\r\n          government, tribal elections  and the use  or\r\n          disposition of settlement fund income . . . .\r\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, S 6206(1).  Because the wording used\r\n\nis \"including,\"  the specific  categories are  exemplars and  not\r\n\nexclusive.  The examples provide limited guidance.  The  stumpage\r\n\npermit policy does not fit neatly within any of these categories.\r\n\n5.  While Akins may view a tribal court as a less desirable forum\r\nthan federal court, the Supreme Court has said that \"even if a\r\njurisdictional holding occasionally results in denying an Indian\r\nplaintiff a forum to which a non-Indian has access, such\r\ndisparate treatment of the Indian is justified because it is\r\nintended to benefit the class of which he is a member by\r\nfurthering the congressional policy of Indian self-government.\" \r\nFisher v. District Ct., 424 U.S. 382, 390-91 (1976).  The Court\r\nhas recognized that subjecting purely intra-tribal disputes to\r\nstate jurisdiction has the potential to undermine the authority\r\nof tribal courts and of the tribal government.  See Santa Clara\r\nPueblo, 436 U.S. at 59-60.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nIt might be argued it fits within \"tribal government\" but such an\r\n\nargument rests on inherently  too broad a reading of the  phrase.\r\n\nThat a tribe attempts  to govern a matter  does not render it  an\r\n\ninternal tribal matter.\r\n\n     A \r                number \r                       of \r                         strong \r                                considerations point to the stumpage policy\r\n\nbeing an internal tribal matter.  First, and foremost, the policy\r\n\npurports to  regulate only members of  the tribe, as only  tribal\r\n\nmembers may even apply for permits.  The interests of non-members\r\n\nare not at issue.   Thus, it appears  to be an \"internal\"  tribal\r\n\nmatter.  Second, the policy has to do with the commercial use  of\r\n\nlands \r               acquired \r                        by \r                          the \r                              Nation with the federal funds it received for\r\n\nthis \r              purpose \r                      as part of the settlement agreement.  These lands are\r\n\n\"Penobscot \r                    Indian Territory\" and are subject to federal restraints\r\n\non \r            alienation.  See 25 U.S.C. S 1724; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30,\r\n\nS 6205.   The  policy regulates the  very land  that defines  the\r\n\nterritory of the Nation, and so appears to be a \"tribal\"  matter.\r\n\nThird, the policy  concerns the harvesting of a natural  resource\r\n\nfrom \r              that \r                   land; and permit fees paid benefit the Penobscot Nation.\r\n\nThe control of the permitting process operates as a control  over\r\n\nthe growth,  health, and reaping of  that resource.  Fourth,  the\r\n\npolicy, at least  on its face, does  not implicate or impair  any\r\n\ninterest \r                  of \r                     the \r                        state \r                              of \r                                 Maine.  Fifth, it is consistent with prior\r\n\nlegal \r               understandings \r                             to \r                                view the issuance of stumpage permits as an\r\n\ninternal tribal matter.\r\n\n     There are also arguments that this is not an internal tribal\r\n\nmatter.  First, logging permits are issued by municipalities as a\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nstandard part of municipal powers.  But it is surely too broad  a\r\n\ntest to ask whether a municipality engages in the same  activity.\r\n\nEvery \r               activity \r                       specifically listed in the statute as an exemplar of\r\n\nan internal tribal matter is also engaged in by a municipality.  \r\n\n     The \r                  second \r                         and more interesting argument advanced by Akins is\r\n\nthat, outside of  the categorical exemplars, the focus should  be\r\n\nhistorical and tribe specific.  The Penobscots, Akins says,  have\r\n\noffered no evidence  that they have historically been loggers  or\r\n\nsupported themselves through  timber harvesting.  Logging,  Akins\r\n\nsays, \r               is \r                  a \r                    major commercial activity in Maine and historically has\r\n\nbeen engaged in by others,  and is not \"uniquely Indian\" nor  \"of\r\n\nparticular cultural importance\" to the Nation.  \r\n\n     Akins  analogizes  the expansion  of  the  Nation  into  the\r\n\neconomics \r                   of \r                      commercial logging to the expansion of the tribe into\r\n\ncommercial gambling,  an activity that  the Maine  Law Court  has\r\n\nspecifically  held is  not  an  \"internal tribal  matter.\"    See\r\n\nStilphen, 461 A.2d 478 (holding that an illegal bingo game run by\r\n\nthe \r             Nation \r                    did not qualify as an internal tribal matter); see also\r\n\nPassamaquoddy Tribe, 75 F.3d at 787-88 (holding that Congress did\r\n\nnot intend to give the  Maine tribes any rights under the  Indian\r\n\nGaming  Regulatory Act).   At the very  least, Akins argues,  the\r\n\ndismissal \r                   of \r                      his \r                         action \r                                should be vacated and the case remanded for\r\n\na hearing on whether logging is a traditional tribal activity and\r\n\nwhether the stumpage policy reinforces traditional tribal values.\r\n\n     The Nation responds to this latter argument vigorously.  The\r\n\nNation retorts  that it  is not  a museum  piece and  may not  be\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\nrelegated to historic roles.  If the Nation is truly to  exercise\r\n\nits \r             residual \r                     sovereignty, it must be free to act within the present\r\n\nmarketplace \r                     and not be stereotypically restricted to ancient forms\r\n\nof \r            economic \r                     support.  Narrow historical analysis, the Nation says,\r\n\nshould play almost no role.  Accordingly, the Nation argues  that\r\n\nthe Maine  Law Court  was wrong in  Stilphen when  it focused  on\r\n\nhistoric \r                  culture or development to define internal tribal matters.\r\n\nSee Stilphen, 461 A.2d at 490.\r\n\n     Such \r                   broad \r                         themes do not help to define the rules of decision\r\n\nin  these cases.   At  the same  time Congress  was enacting  the\r\n\nSettlement \r                    Act \r                       the \r                           Supreme Court noted that, \"'[g]eneralizations in\r\n\nthis \r              subject \r                      [of \r                         tribal \r                                authority] have become . . . treacherous.'\"\r\n\nWhite Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 141  (1980)\r\n\n(quoting Mescalero  Apache  Tribe v.  Jones,  411 U.S.  145,  148\r\n\n(1973)). \r                   \r                  Generalizations are no less treacherous today, almost two\r\n\ndecades later.  We  tread cautiously and write narrowly, for  the\r\n\nproblems \r                  and \r                      conflicting interests presented by this case will not\r\n\nbe the same as the  problems and interests presented by the  next\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n     Context informs our approach.  This is not a dispute between\r\n\nMaine and the  Nation over the  attempted enforcement of  Maine's\r\n\nlaws. \r                \r                This \r                    does \r                         not \r                             involve a direct or indirect regulation of the\r\n\nNation \r                by \r                   Congress. \r                             \r                             This is also not a dispute over application of\r\n\nstatutory rights  Congress may  have wished  to apply  uniformly,\r\n\nregardless of  whether the application  involved Indian lands  or\r\n\nIndian government.  This is not an instance of potential conflict\r\n\n                               12\r\r\n\nor \r            coincidence \r                        of \r                          Maine \r                                law and federal statutory law.  This is not\r\n\neven a situation of substantive rights regarding stumpage permits\r\n\ngranted to persons by statute, state or federal.  This is instead\r\n\na question of allocation of jurisdiction among different fora and\r\n\nallocation of substantive law to a dispute between tribal members\r\n\nwhere \r               neither the Congress nor the Maine Legislature has expressed\r\n\na particular interest.  The federal courts have jurisdiction over\r\n\nthis case  only if the stumpage  permits are not internal  tribal\r\n\nmatters.\r\n\n     The five  considerations outlined  earlier, taken  together,\r\n\nresolve the  question in favor of  this being an internal  tribal\r\n\nmatter  and do so as  a matter of law.   Though future cases  may\r\n\nrequire some exploration of evidence as to whether the underlying\r\n\nsubject is  an  internal tribal  matter  before decision  of  the\r\n\njurisdictional question, this case does not.\r\n\n     Of \r                 great \r                       significance \r                                   is \r                                      that this is an intra-tribal dispute.\r\n\nIt involves  only members of  the tribe, and  not actions by  the\r\n\nNation addressed to  non-members.  The  tribe's treatment of  its\r\n\nmembers, \r                  particularly \r                              as \r                                 to commercial interests, is not of central\r\n\nconcern to  either Maine or federal  law (other than through  the\r\n\nICRA).  There appear to be  no strong policy reasons not to  view\r\n\nthis as an area appropriate for internal tribal regulation.\r\n\n     Secondly, the  subject matter appears  to be  one which  the\r\n\nsettlement  statutes viewed  as  being within  legitimate  tribal\r\n\nconcern; \r                  both \r                      the \r                          Implementing Act, S 6203, and the Settlement Act,\r\n\nS \r           1722, \r                 define \r                       \"land \r                             and \r                                 other natural resources\" as meaning, inter\r\n\n                               13\r\r\n\nalia, \"timber and  timber rights.\"6  The Settlement Act  provides\r\n\nthat the natural resources within the Penobscot Indian  Territory\r\n\nmay, at the request of the Nation, be leased, sold, or subject to\r\n\nright of way, in accord with other sections of Title 25.   See 25\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1724(g).  It has long been understood that the power  to\r\n\nissue \r               permits \r                       is \r                         an \r                            indirect method of managing a natural resource.\r\n\nSee California Coastal Comm'n  v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S.  572\r\n\n(1987).  To a large extent, the subject matter here involves  the\r\n\nregulation and conservation of natural resources belonging to the\r\n\ntribe.\r\n\n     Third, \r                     the \r                         subject matter, involving tribal lands, appears to\r\n\nhave \r              no \r                 impact \r                       on \r                          Maine's environmental or other interests.  By its\r\n\nown  terms,  the  Implementing Act,  S  6204,  makes  state  laws\r\n\nregulating land use or management, conservation and environmental\r\n\nprotection \r                    applicable \r                              to \r                                 tribal lands.  The absence of an assertion\r\n\nthat \r              any \r                  such \r                      laws \r                           are \r                               involved here is telling.  Cf. Narragansett,\r\n\n89 F.3d at 922 (enjoining construction of housing until the tribe\r\n\ncomplied  with  the  requirements  of  state  coastal   resources\r\n\nmanagement program).   Under such circumstances, arguments  about\r\n\nhistory,  which  may  be pertinent  in  other  contexts  and  for\r\n\naddressing other problems,7 offer little here.\r\n\n6.  That language is used in part to define the meaning of Indian\r\nlands and used to extinguish claims that much earlier transfers\r\nof lands had not complied with the Trade and Intercourse Act of\r\n1790, and other claims.  See 25 U.S.C. S 1723.\r\n\n7.  Debates about the role to be played by historical and\r\nanthropological evidence in Indian cases are not new.  In the\r\ntrial court in Santa Clara, such evidence was explored, and\r\ncommentators have questioned whether it is relevant to the issue\r\n\n                               14\r\r\n\n     We test  our conclusions  against a  different history,  the\r\n\nlegislative history, because the language of the Implementing and\r\n\nSettlement \r                    Acts \r                         does \r                             not \r                                 clearly dispose of the question.  See Blum\r\n\nv. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 896 (1984) (\"Where, as here, resolution\r\n\nof a question of federal law turns on a statute and the intention\r\n\nof Congress, we look first to the statutory language and then  to\r\n\nthe legislative history if the statutory language is  unclear.\");\r\n\nPenobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, 112 F.3d 538, 548 (1st  Cir.\r\n\n1997)  (inquiry   into  legislative   history  is   \"particularly\r\n\nappropriate in the context of federal Indian law\"); Massachusetts\r\n\nv. FDIC,  102 F.3d 615,  620 (1st Cir.  1996).  That  legislative\r\n\nhistory  is  only  somewhat  helpful  because  it  embodies   two\r\n\nconflicting approaches to  resolving the question  of what is  an\r\n\ninternal tribal matter.  On the one hand, Congress described  the\r\n\nsettlement \r                    as \"original\" and \"innovative.\"  On the other hand, the\r\n\nCongress  referred  to  respecting  the  inherent  self-governing\r\n\nauthority \r                   of \r                      a tribe.  In so doing, it referred to a Supreme Court\r\n\nopinion, Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. 49 (1978).\r\n\n     We \r                 look \r                      to \r                        the \r                            Committee \r                                      Report of the Senate Select Committee\r\n\non Indian Affairs concerning  the Settlement Act.

That\r\n\nreport \r                explains that the \"treatment of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and\r\n\nPenobscot \r                   Nation in the Maine Implementing Act is original.

Rep.  No. 96-957, at 29  (1980)\r\n\n(citing Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. 49).\r\n\n     In \r                 the \r                     final \r                          Committee \r                                    Reports on the Settlement Act, both the\r\n\nHouse and  the Senate addressed  the Nation's  concern that  \"the\r\n\nsettlement amounts to a 'destruction' of the sovereign rights and\r\n\njurisdiction \r                      of the . . .

Before  the\r\n\nsettlement, \r                     the federal government had not formally recognized the\r\n\nPenobscot \r                   Nation \r                          as \r                            an \r                               Indian tribe and the State of Maine had long\r\n\nassumed that the Maine  tribes had no inherent sovereignty.   See\r\n\nBottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe, 599 F.2d 1061, 1063-65 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1979).  The Reports state that \"While the settlement represents a\r\n\ncompromise in  which  state  authority is  extended  over  Indian\r\n\nterritory to the extent provided in the Maine Implementing Act, .\r\n\n. \r           . \r             the \r                settlement \r                           provides that henceforth the tribes will be free\r\n\nfrom \r              state \r                    interference in the exercise of their internal affairs.\r\n\nThus, rather than  destroying the sovereignty  of the tribes,  by\r\n\nrecognizing \r                     their \r                          power \r                                to control their internal affairs . . . the\r\n\nsettlement strengthens the sovereignty of the Maine Tribes.\"   S.\r\n\nRep. No. 96-957, at 14; H.R. Rep. No. 96-1353, at 14-15.\r\n\n     The Committee Report also referred to the Santa Clara Pueblo\r\n\ncase, \r               which \r                     concerned whether Title I of the ICRA authorized civil\r\n\nactions  in  the  federal  courts  to  enforce  its   substantive\r\n\nprovisions.  At  issue was the  definition of tribal  membership,\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nwhich the tribe extended to children of males who married outside\r\n\nthe tribe but not to children of females who married outside  the\r\n\ntribe. \r                 \r                 The \r                    Supreme \r                            Court held that the ICRA vested jurisdiction in\r\n\nthe \r             tribal \r                    courts \r                          and \r                              not the federal courts.  The Court recognized\r\n\nboth \r              that \r                   Congress \r                           had \r                               the power to limit the powers of local self-\r\n\ngovernment \r                    that tribes possessed and that Congress intended in the\r\n\nICRA to balance  dual objectives.  Under such circumstances,  the\r\n\nCourt \r               would \r                     not infer from Congressional silence a cause of action\r\n\nin the federal courts.\r\n\n     Congress' citation to the Santa Clara Pueblo opinion in  the\r\n\nSenate \r                Report \r                      reinforces \r                                 the tension between the dual objectives of\r\n\nthe Settlement Act: between an original, innovative allocation of\r\n\nauthority \r                   between the State and tribes and the desire to recognize\r\n\nthe \r             tribe's \r                    inherent \r                             self-government authority.  From Congressional\r\n\nsilence we are hesitant to read an intent to expand federal court\r\n\njurisdiction \r                      where \r                           it \r                              appears, as it does here, that inherent self-\r\n\ngoverning authority of a tribe is involved.  We stress that we do\r\n\nnot read the reference by  Congress to Santa Clara Pueblo in  the\r\n\nlegislative \r                     history of the Settlement Act as invoking all of prior\r\n\nIndian law.  That would be inconsistent with the unique nature of\r\n\nthe Maine  settlement  and the  specific  provisions of  the  Act\r\n\nlimiting \r                  the \r                     application \r                                 of federal Indian law.  But we also do not\r\n\nagree \r               that \r                    reference to such law is never helpful in defining what\r\n\nis an internal tribal matter.   Congress was explicitly aware  of\r\n\nsuch law, and explicitly made existing general federal Indian law\r\n\napplicable \r                    to \r                      the \r                          Penobscot Nation in the Settlement Act.  In other\r\n\n                               17\r\r\n\nareas, courts have  long presumed that Congress acts against  the\r\n\nbackground of prior law.  See, e.g., Clarke v. Securities  Indus.\r\n\nAss'n\r              , \r                479 \r                    U.S. \r                        388, \r                             405 \r                                 (1987); Kolster v. INS, 101 F.3d 785, 787-\r\n\n88 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n     General federal Indian caselaw supports our conclusion.  The\r\n\ncases uniformly recognize  the importance of the factors we  have\r\n\nstressed: \r                   that \r                        the \r                           issue \r                                 involves matters between tribe members and\r\n\nmatters of the economic use of natural resources inherent in  the\r\n\ntribal \r                lands.  \"When on-reservation conduct involving only Indians\r\n\nis at issue, state law is generally inapplicable, for the State's\r\n\nregulatory interest  is  likely to  be  minimal and  the  federal\r\n\ninterest  in  encouraging   tribal  self-government  is  at   its\r\n\nstrongest.\"  White  Mountain Apache Tribe, 448  U.S. at 144.   In\r\n\nWhite \r               Mountain Apache, a non-Indian logging company challenged the\r\n\napplicability of state  taxes to  its exclusively  on-reservation\r\n\noperations.    The  Court  said  that  the  tradition  of  Indian\r\n\nsovereignty \r                     over \r                         their \r                               reservations informed the determination that\r\n\nthe \r             exercise \r                      of state authority was preempted by federal law.  The\r\n\nCourt reviewed  the \"basic principles\"  established by its  prior\r\n\ndecisions regarding  the  \"boundaries  between  state  regulatory\r\n\nauthority and  tribal self-government.\"  Id.  at 141.  The  Court\r\n\nemphasized the  \"significant  geographical  component  to  tribal\r\n\nsovereignty\" \r                      and said that \"though the reservation boundary is not\r\n\nabsolute, it remains an important factor to weigh in  determining\r\n\nwhether \r                 state authority has exceeded the permissible limits.\"  Id.\r\n\nat 151.\r\n\n                               18\r\r\n\n     Similarly, \r                         in Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130\r\n\n(1982), \r                 the \r                     Court \r                          held \r                               that the tribe had the inherent authority to\r\n\nimpose \r                a \r                  severance tax on on-reservation mining activities as part\r\n\nof its power to be self-governing.  This power derived from  \"the\r\n\ntribe's  general authority,  as  sovereign, to  control  economic\r\n\nactivity within its  jurisdiction\" and  extended to  transactions\r\n\n\"'occurring on trust lands and significantly involving a tribe or\r\n\nits members  .  .  . .'\"    Id.  at 137  (quoting  Washington  v.\r\n\nConfederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134,\r\n\n152 (1980)).\r\n\n     Where, in  contrast, the issue  involves tribal attempts  to\r\n\nregulate \r                  non-tribal \r                            members, the Supreme Court has often found that\r\n\nthose \r               attempts \r                        are \r                           not \r                               within the inherent self-governing powers of\r\n\na \r           tribe. \r                   \r                   Mon\r                      tana v.

The  Court also noted  that \"tribes retain  considerable\r\n\ncontrol  over nonmember conduct  on tribal land.\"   Id. at  1413.\r\n\nHere, only tribal conduct is at issue.\r\n\n     The legislative history  and precedent  thus reinforces  our\r\n\n                               19\r\r\n\nconclusion that this dispute involves an \"internal tribal matter\"\r\n\nand that, accordingly, no claim  is stated under S 1983 or  under\r\n\nMaine law.8\r\n\n     The judgment  of the district court  is affirmed.

While defining what constitutes an internal matter controlled by Indian tribes is hardly novel in Native American law, it is novel in this context.  The relations between Maine and the Penobscot Nation are not governed by all of the usual laws governing such relationships, but by two unique laws, one Maine and one federal, approving a settlement.  That settlement resulted from disputed claims for vast portions of lands in Maine brought by the Penobscots and others who had not historically been formally recognized as sovereign Indians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves the harvesting of timber on those lands acquired by the Penobscot Nation as a result of the settlement agreement.  Plaintiff Andrew X. Akins is the former Chairman of the Joint Tribal Negotiating Committee;  he now resides in Alabama.  Akins and his company, PENAK, Inc., also a plaintiff (whom we refer to jointly as \"Akins\") for several years logged portions of the land under stumpage permits issued by the Nation.  In December of 1993, the Nation's Tribal Council voted a new policy:  stumpage permits would be issued only to people who were both enrolled members of the Nation and residents of Maine.  Akins is an enrolled member of the Nation, but not a Maine resident.  Akins says he is the only tribal member who will be affected by the new policy.  The policy became effective on May 18, 1994 and the next day the Nation told Akins he was not eligible for a permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Akins sued the Nation and its Tribal Council in the U.S. District Court in Maine, under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985, alleging that singling him out through an ostensibly neutral policy violated his rights to due process, equal protection, and to be free from bills of attainder.  He also brought state law claims and alleged diversity jurisdiction.  A report of a Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the case for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The U.S. District Court accepted the recommendation and dismissed.  Akins appeals, arguing:  that the district court erred in holding that the stumpage policy is an \"internal tribal matter;\" that he has cognizable claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985, as well as the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201-02;  and that the stumpage policy violates the Maine Administrative Procedures Act and the Maine Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues in this case cannot be grasped without understanding the genesis of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980, 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1721-35 (the \"Settlement Act\").  The history of the Settlement Act was brought to life in the decision of the Maine Law Court in Penobscot Nation v. Stilphen, 461 A.2d 478, 487 (Me.1983), and of this Circuit in Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Maine, 75 F.3d 784, 787 (1st Cir.1996).  A summary of that history will do here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disputes which led to the settlement involved assertions that certain persons and groups were members of Indian tribes and as such entitled to ancestral lands and to monetary damages.  The claimed lands amounted to nearly two-thirds of Maine's landmass.  See Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton, 388 F.Supp. 649, 651-53, 667-69 (D.Me.), aff'd, 528 F.2d 370 (1st Cir.1975).  Under federal auspices, the Penobscot Nation, other claimants, and Maine negotiated a settlement.  That settlement was subject to approval by both the Maine Legislature and Congress.  Maine enacted the Implementing Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30 &#167;&#167; 6201-14, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>[T]he Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, within their respective Indian territories, shall have, exercise and enjoy all the rights, privileges, powers and immunities, including, but without limitation, the power to enact ordinances and collect taxes, and shall be subject to all the duties, obligations, liabilities and limitations of a municipality of and subject to the laws of the State, provided however, that internal tribal matters, including membership in the respective tribe or nation, the right to reside within the respective Indian territories, tribal organization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title 30, &#167; 6206(1) (emphasis added).  The Implementing Act was incorporated into the federal Settlement Act of 1980, 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1721-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each party benefitted from the settlement.  The Nation in many respects gained the powers of a municipality under Maine law.  \"[T]he Settlement Act confirmed [the Nation's] title to designated reservation lands, memorialized federal recognition of its tribal status, and opened the floodgate for the influx of millions of dollars in federal subsidies.\"  Passamaquoddy Tribe, 75 F.3d at 787.   Maine, in turn, put to rest the land claims and achieved a certain sharing of authority with the Nation, as described below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The structure of analysis differs here from that which would be used in claims against the vast majority of other Indian tribes in the country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This is true as to the application of both state and federal law.  As to state law, the Penobscot Nation and Maine expressly agreed that, with very limited exceptions, the Nation is subject to the laws of Maine.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725.  Congress was explicit that the purpose of the Settlement Act was \"to ratify the Maine Implementing Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine ... and the Penobscot Nation\" and \"to confirm that all other Indians ... are and shall be subject to the laws of the State of Maine, as provided herein.\"  25 U.S.C. &#167; 1721(b)(3) &amp; (4).  The federal Settlement Act provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The ... Penobscot Nation, and [its] members, and the land and natural resources owned by, or held in trust for the benefit of the tribe, nation, or [its] members, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Maine to the extent and in the manner provided in the Maine Implementing Act and that Act is hereby approved, ratified, and confirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(b)(1).  In turn, the Settlement Act made federal law which was then generally applicable to Indians also applicable to the Penobscot Nation but declared special laws and regulations inapplicable.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(h).  The State of Maine may amend the Implementing Act to modify the jurisdictional powers of the Nation only if the Nation agrees to the amendment.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Indian tribes are not usually subject to the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts, see Romanella v. Hayward, 114 F.3d 15 (2d Cir.1997), the Settlement Act subjects the Maine tribes to diversity jurisdiction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>the Penobscot Nation ... may sue and be sued in the courts of the ... United States to the same extent as any other entity or person residing in the State of Maine may sue and be sued in [that] court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(d)(1).  Further, those federal laws enacted after October 10, 1980 (the effective date of the Settlement Act) for the benefit of Indians do not apply within Maine unless the federal statute is made expressly applicable within Maine.  25 U.S.C. &#167; 1735(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Settlement Act provides at 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(f):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>The ... Penobscot Nation [is] hereby authorized to exercise jurisdiction, separate and distinct from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State of Maine, to the extent authorized by the Maine Implementing Act, and any subsequent amendments thereto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Implementing Act in turn makes the Nation subject \"to all the duties, obligations, liabilities and limitations of a municipality ... provided, however, that internal tribal matters ... shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167; 6206(1) (emphasis added).  The viability of both the federal law claims under &#167; 1983 and the state law claims under diversity jurisdiction depend on whether the Implementing Act and the Settlement Act subject the Penobscot Nation's stumpage policy to regulation by the State.  Put differently, the Nation in certain capacities functions as a municipality of Maine and is reachable under state and federal law in that capacity, but when it functions as a tribe as to internal tribal matters, it is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case turns on whether the issuance of stumpage permits is an \"internal tribal matter.\"   Under the Settlement Act, we consider that to be a question of federal law, and the parties so agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  If this is an internal tribal matter, then Akins's &#167; 1983 claim fails because the Nation would not have been acting \"under color of state law.\"   See R.J. Williams Co. v. Fort Belknap Hous.  Auth., 719 F.2d 979, 982 (9th Cir.1983);  Dry Creek Lodge, Inc. v. United States, 515 F.2d 926, 931 (10th Cir.1975).  If this is an internal tribal matter, then under both Settlement Act and the Implementing Act, Maine law does not apply and no claims arise under the Maine Constitution or under the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.  Thus no claim arises under state law warranting the exercise of diversity jurisdiction.IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering Akins's &#167; 1983 claim, we note that Congress did not exempt the Penobscot Nation from obligations not to trammel on civil rights.  At a minimum it did so in a separate general statute, the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (\"ICRA\").  See 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1301-41, made applicable to the Penobscot Nation by 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(h).  The ICRA imposes \"restrictions upon tribal governments similar, but not identical, to those embodied in the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 57, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 1676, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978).  Under the ICRA, \"No Indian tribe in exercising powers of self-government shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law.\"  25 U.S.C. &#167; 1302(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two distinctions are pertinent.  As a matter of substantive law, generally, the ICRA and not the U.S. Constitution is the source of the rights.  See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 56, 98 S.Ct. at 1675-76;  J. Resnik, Dependent Sovereigns:  Indian Tribes, States and the Federal Courts, 56 U. Chi.  L.Rev. 671, 694 (1989) (\"Members of Indian tribes cannot make Bill of Rights claims against their tribes.\").  Secondly, such claims of violations of civil rights must be heard in the tribal courts, not in the federal courts.  With the exception of petitions for habeas corpus relief, Congress did not intend in the ICRA to create implied causes of action to redress substantive rights in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 59-66, 98 S.Ct. at 1677-81.   Similarly, if this is an internal tribal matter, then the tribal court will have authority over the essence of the state constitutional claims.  The ICRA contains its own equal protection and due process guarantees.  Akins's state constitutional claims rest on similar guarantees.  This is not a potential instance of a right without a remedy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Is the issuance of stumpage permits an \"internal tribal matter\"?   The language of the statute itself is the first resort.  That language refers to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>internal tribal matters, including membership in the respective tribe or nation, the right to reside within the respective Indian territories, tribal organization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167; 6206(1).  Because the wording used is \"including,\" the specific categories are exemplars and not exclusive.  The examples provide limited guidance.  The stumpage permit policy does not fit neatly within any of these categories.  It might be argued it fits within \"tribal government\" but such an argument rests on inherently too broad a reading of the phrase.  That a tribe attempts to govern a matter does not render it an internal tribal matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of strong considerations point to the stumpage policy being an internal tribal matter.  First, and foremost, the policy purports to regulate only members of the tribe, as only tribal members may even apply for permits.  The interests of non-members are not at issue.  Thus, it appears to be an \"internal\" tribal matter.  Second, the policy has to do with the commercial use of lands acquired by the Nation with the federal funds it received for this purpose as part of the settlement agreement.  These lands are \"Penobscot Indian Territory\" and are subject to federal restraints on alienation.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1724;  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167; 6205.  The policy regulates the very land that defines the territory of the Nation, and so appears to be a \"tribal\" matter.  Third, the policy concerns the harvesting of a natural resource from that land;  and permit fees paid benefit the Penobscot Nation.  The control of the permitting process operates as a control over the growth, health, and reaping of that resource.  Fourth, the policy, at least on its face, does not implicate or impair any interest of the state of Maine.  Fifth, it is consistent with prior legal understandings to view the issuance of stumpage permits as an internal tribal matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are also arguments that this is not an internal tribal matter.  First, logging permits are issued by municipalities as a standard part of municipal powers.  But it is surely too broad a test to ask whether a municipality engages in the same activity.  Every activity specifically listed in the statute as an exemplar of an internal tribal matter is also engaged in by a municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and more interesting argument advanced by Akins is that, outside of the categorical exemplars, the focus should be historical and tribe specific.  The Penobscots, Akins says, have offered no evidence that they have historically been loggers or supported themselves through timber harvesting.  Logging, Akins says, is a major commercial activity in Maine and historically has been engaged in by others, and is not \"uniquely Indian\" nor \"of particular cultural importance\" to the Nation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Akins analogizes the expansion of the Nation into the economics of commercial logging to the expansion of the tribe into commercial gambling, an activity that the Maine Law Court has specifically held is not an \"internal tribal matter.\"   See Stilphen, 461 A.2d 478 (holding that an illegal bingo game run by the Nation did not qualify as an internal tribal matter);  see also Passamaquoddy Tribe, 75 F.3d at 787-88 (holding that Congress did not intend to give the Maine tribes any rights under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act).  At the very least, Akins argues, the dismissal of his action should be vacated and the case remanded for a hearing on whether logging is a traditional tribal activity and whether the stumpage policy reinforces traditional tribal values.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nation responds to this latter argument vigorously.  The Nation retorts that it is not a museum piece and may not be relegated to historic roles.  If the Nation is truly to exercise its residual sovereignty, it must be free to act within the present marketplace and not be stereotypically restricted to ancient forms of economic support.  Narrow historical analysis, the Nation says, should play almost no role.  Accordingly, the Nation argues that the Maine Law Court was wrong in Stilphen when it focused on historic culture or development to define internal tribal matters.  See Stilphen, 461 A.2d at 490.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such broad themes do not help to define the rules of decision in these cases.  At the same time Congress was enacting the Settlement Act the Supreme Court noted that, \" '[g]eneralizations in this subject [of tribal authority] have become ... treacherous.' \"  White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 141, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 2582, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980) (quoting Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 148, 93 S.Ct. 1267, 1270, 36 L.Ed.2d 114 (1973)).  Generalizations are no less treacherous today, almost two decades later.  We tread cautiously and write narrowly, for the problems and conflicting interests presented by this case will not be the same as the problems and interests presented by the next case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Context informs our approach.  This is not a dispute between Maine and the Nation over the attempted enforcement of Maine's laws.  This does not involve a direct or indirect regulation of the Nation by Congress.  This is also not a dispute over application of statutory rights Congress may have wished to apply uniformly, regardless of whether the application involved Indian lands or Indian government.  This is not an instance of potential conflict or coincidence of Maine law and federal statutory law.  This is not even a situation of substantive rights regarding stumpage permits granted to persons by statute, state or federal.  This is instead a question of allocation of jurisdiction among different fora and allocation of substantive law to a dispute between tribal members where neither the Congress nor the Maine Legislature has expressed a particular interest.  The federal courts have jurisdiction over this case only if the stumpage permits are not internal tribal matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The five considerations outlined earlier, taken together, resolve the question in favor of this being an internal tribal matter and do so as a matter of law.  Though future cases may require some exploration of evidence as to whether the underlying subject is an internal tribal matter before decision of the jurisdictional question, this case does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of great significance is that this is an intra-tribal dispute.  It involves only members of the tribe, and not actions by the Nation addressed to non-members.  The tribe's treatment of its members, particularly as to commercial interests, is not of central concern to either Maine or federal law (other than through the ICRA).  There appear to be no strong policy reasons not to view this as an area appropriate for internal tribal regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, the subject matter appears to be one which the settlement statutes viewed as being within legitimate tribal concern;  both the Implementing Act, &#167; 6203, and the Settlement Act, &#167; 1722, define \"land and other natural resources\" as meaning, inter alia, \"timber and timber rights.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The Settlement Act provides that the natural resources within the Penobscot Indian Territory may, at the request of the Nation, be leased, sold, or subject to right of way, in accord with other sections of Title 25.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1724(g).  It has long been understood that the power to issue permits is an indirect method of managing a natural resource.  See California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S. 572, 107 S.Ct. 1419, 94 L.Ed.2d 577 (1987).  To a large extent, the subject matter here involves the regulation and conservation of natural resources belonging to the tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the subject matter, involving tribal lands, appears to have no impact on Maine's environmental or other interests.  By its own terms, the Implementing Act, &#167; 6204, makes state laws regulating land use or management, conservation and environmental protection applicable to tribal lands.  The absence of an assertion that any such laws are involved here is telling.  Cf. Narragansett, 89 F.3d at 922 (enjoining construction of housing until the tribe complied with the requirements of state coastal resources management program).  Under such circumstances, arguments about history, which may be pertinent in other contexts and for addressing other problems,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> offer little here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We test our conclusions against a different history, the legislative history, because the language of the Implementing and Settlement Acts does not clearly dispose of the question.  See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 896, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1548, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984) (\"Where, as here, resolution of a question of federal law turns on a statute and the intention of Congress, we look first to the statutory language and then to the legislative history if the statutory language is unclear.\");  Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, 112 F.3d 538, 548 (1st Cir.1997) (inquiry into legislative history is \"particularly appropriate in the context of federal Indian law\");  Massachusetts v. FDIC, 102 F.3d 615, 620 (1st Cir.1996).  That legislative history is only somewhat helpful because it embodies two conflicting approaches to resolving the question of what is an internal tribal matter.  On the one hand, Congress described the settlement as \"original\" and \"innovative.\"   On the other hand, the Congress referred to respecting the inherent self-governing authority of a tribe.  In so doing, it referred to a Supreme Court opinion, Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look to the Committee Report of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs concerning the Settlement Act.  See Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70, 76, 105 S.Ct. 479, 483, 83 L.Ed.2d 472 (1984) (Committee Reports on a bill are authoritative source for determining legislative intent).  That report explains that the \"treatment of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation in the Maine Implementing Act is original.  It is an innovative blend of customary state law respecting units of local government coupled with a recognition of the independent source of tribal authority, that is, the inherent authority of a tribe to be self-governing.\"   S.Rep. No. 96-957, at 29 (1980) (citing Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final Committee Reports on the Settlement Act, both the House and the Senate addressed the Nation's concern that \"the settlement amounts to a 'destruction' of the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the ... Penobscot Nation.\"   S.Rep. No. 96-957, at 14;  H.R.Rep. No. 96-1353, at 14-15 (1980), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1980, 3786, at 3790.  Before the settlement, the federal government had not formally recognized the Penobscot Nation as an Indian tribe and the State of Maine had long assumed that the Maine tribes had no inherent sovereignty.  See Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe, 599 F.2d 1061, 1063-65 (1st Cir.1979).  The Reports state that \"While the settlement represents a compromise in which state authority is extended over Indian territory to the extent provided in the Maine Implementing Act, ... the settlement provides that henceforth the tribes will be free from state interference in the exercise of their internal affairs.  Thus, rather than destroying the sovereignty of the tribes, by recognizing their power to control their internal affairs ... the settlement strengthens the sovereignty of the Maine Tribes.\"   S.Rep. No. 96-957, at 14;  H.R.Rep. No. 96-1353, at 14-15, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1980, at 3790.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Committee Report also referred to the Santa Clara Pueblo case, which concerned whether Title I of the ICRA authorized civil actions in the federal courts to enforce its substantive provisions.  At issue was the definition of tribal membership, which the tribe extended to children of males who married outside the tribe but not to children of females who married outside the tribe.  The Supreme Court held that the ICRA vested jurisdiction in the tribal courts and not the federal courts.  The Court recognized both that Congress had the power to limit the powers of local self-government that tribes possessed and that Congress intended in the ICRA to balance dual objectives.  Under such circumstances, the Court would not infer from Congressional silence a cause of action in the federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress' citation to the Santa Clara Pueblo opinion in the Senate Report reinforces the tension between the dual objectives of the Settlement Act:  between an original, innovative allocation of authority between the State and tribes and the desire to recognize the tribe's inherent self-government authority.  From Congressional silence we are hesitant to read an intent to expand federal court jurisdiction where it appears, as it does here, that inherent self-governing authority of a tribe is involved.  We stress that we do not read the reference by Congress to Santa Clara Pueblo in the legislative history of the Settlement Act as invoking all of prior Indian law.  That would be inconsistent with the unique nature of the Maine settlement and the specific provisions of the Act limiting the application of federal Indian law.  But we also do not agree that reference to such law is never helpful in defining what is an internal tribal matter.  Congress was explicitly aware of such law, and explicitly made existing general federal Indian law applicable to the Penobscot Nation in the Settlement Act.  In other areas, courts have long presumed that Congress acts against the background of prior law.  See, e.g., Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass'n, 479 U.S. 388, 405, 107 S.Ct. 750, 760, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987);  Kolster v.

The cases uniformly recognize the importance of the factors we have stressed:  that the issue involves matters between tribe members and matters of the economic use of natural resources inherent in the tribal lands.  \"When on-reservation conduct involving only Indians is at issue, state law is generally inapplicable, for the State's regulatory interest is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal self-government is at its strongest.\"  White Mountain Apache Tribe, 448 U.S. at 144, 100 S.Ct. at 2584.   In White Mountain Apache, a non-Indian logging company challenged the applicability of state taxes to its exclusively on-reservation operations.  The Court said that the tradition of Indian sovereignty over their reservations informed the determination that the exercise of state authority was preempted by federal law.  The Court reviewed the \"basic principles\" established by its prior decisions regarding the \"boundaries between state regulatory authority and tribal self-government.\"  Id. at 141, 100 S.Ct. at 2582.   The Court emphasized the \"significant geographical component to tribal sovereignty\" and said that \"though the reservation boundary is not absolute, it remains an important factor to weigh in determining whether state authority has exceeded the permissible limits.\"  Id. at 151, 100 S.Ct. at 2587.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, 102 S.Ct. 894, 71 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982), the Court held that the tribe had the inherent authority to impose a severance tax on on-reservation mining activities as part of its power to be self-governing.  This power derived from \"the tribe's general authority, as sovereign, to control economic activity within its jurisdiction\" and extended to transactions \" 'occurring on trust lands and significantly involving a tribe or its members....' \"  Id. at 137, 102 S.Ct. at 901 (quoting Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 152, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 2080-81, 65 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, in contrast, the issue involves tribal attempts to regulate non-tribal members, the Supreme Court has often found that those attempts are not within the inherent self-governing powers of a tribe.  Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 101 S.Ct. 1245, 67 L.Ed.2d 493 (1981), held that the Crow Indians did not have the power to regulate hunting and fishing by non-Indians on reservation lands owned by non-Indians.  The Court said that the tribal \"powers of self-government .... involve only the relations among members of a tribe.\"  Id. at 564, 101 S.Ct. at 1257.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in Strate v.

The Court also noted that \"tribes retain considerable control over nonmember conduct on tribal land.\"  Id. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1413.

While defining what constitutes an internal matter controlled by Indian tribes is hardly novel in Native American law, it is novel in this context.  The relations between Maine and the Penobscot Nation are not governed by all of the usual laws governing such relationships, but by two unique laws, one Maine and one federal, approving a settlement.  That settlement resulted from disputed claims for vast portions of lands in Maine brought by the Penobscots and others who had not historically been formally recognized as sovereign Indians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves the harvesting of timber on those lands acquired by the Penobscot Nation as a result of the settlement agreement.  Plaintiff Andrew X. Akins is the former Chairman of the Joint Tribal Negotiating Committee;  he now resides in Alabama.  Akins and his company, PENAK, Inc., also a plaintiff (whom we refer to jointly as \"Akins\") for several years logged portions of the land under stumpage permits issued by the Nation.  In December of 1993, the Nation's Tribal Council voted a new policy:  stumpage permits would be issued only to people who were both enrolled members of the Nation and residents of Maine.  Akins is an enrolled member of the Nation, but not a Maine resident.  Akins says he is the only tribal member who will be affected by the new policy.  The policy became effective on May 18, 1994 and the next day the Nation told Akins he was not eligible for a permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Akins sued the Nation and its Tribal Council in the U.S. District Court in Maine, under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985, alleging that singling him out through an ostensibly neutral policy violated his rights to due process, equal protection, and to be free from bills of attainder.  He also brought state law claims and alleged diversity jurisdiction.  A report of a Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the case for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The U.S. District Court accepted the recommendation and dismissed.  Akins appeals, arguing:  that the district court erred in holding that the stumpage policy is an \"internal tribal matter;\" that he has cognizable claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985, as well as the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201-02;  and that the stumpage policy violates the Maine Administrative Procedures Act and the Maine Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues in this case cannot be grasped without understanding the genesis of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980, 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1721-35 (the \"Settlement Act\").

Under federal auspices, the Penobscot Nation, other claimants, and Maine negotiated a settlement.  That settlement was subject to approval by both the Maine Legislature and Congress.  Maine enacted the Implementing Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30 &#167;&#167; 6201-14, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>[T]he Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, within their respective Indian territories, shall have, exercise and enjoy all the rights, privileges, powers and immunities, including, but without limitation, the power to enact ordinances and collect taxes, and shall be subject to all the duties, obligations, liabilities and limitations of a municipality of and subject to the laws of the State, provided however, that internal tribal matters, including membership in the respective tribe or nation, the right to reside within the respective Indian territories, tribal organization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title 30, &#167; 6206(1) (emphasis added).

As to state law, the Penobscot Nation and Maine expressly agreed that, with very limited exceptions, the Nation is subject to the laws of Maine.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725.  Congress was explicit that the purpose of the Settlement Act was \"to ratify the Maine Implementing Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine ... and the Penobscot Nation\" and \"to confirm that all other Indians ... are and shall be subject to the laws of the State of Maine, as provided herein.\"  25 U.S.C. &#167; 1721(b)(3) &amp; (4).

The viability of both the federal law claims under &#167; 1983 and the state law claims under diversity jurisdiction depend on whether the Implementing Act and the Settlement Act subject the Penobscot Nation's stumpage policy to regulation by the State.

Under the ICRA, \"No Indian tribe in exercising powers of self-government shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law.\"  25 U.S.C. &#167; 1302(8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two distinctions are pertinent.  As a matter of substantive law, generally, the ICRA and not the U.S. Constitution is the source of the rights.  See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 56, 98 S.Ct. at 1675-76;  J. Resnik, Dependent Sovereigns:  Indian Tribes, States and the Federal Courts, 56 U. Chi.  L.Rev. 671, 694 (1989) (\"Members of Indian tribes cannot make Bill of Rights claims against their tribes.\").  Secondly, such claims of violations of civil rights must be heard in the tribal courts, not in the federal courts.  With the exception of petitions for habeas corpus relief, Congress did not intend in the ICRA to create implied causes of action to redress substantive rights in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 59-66, 98 S.Ct. at 1677-81.   Similarly, if this is an internal tribal matter, then the tribal court will have authority over the essence of the state constitutional claims.  The ICRA contains its own equal protection and due process guarantees.  Akins's state constitutional claims rest on similar guarantees.  This is not a potential instance of a right without a remedy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Is the issuance of stumpage permits an \"internal tribal matter\"?   The language of the statute itself is the first resort.  That language refers to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>internal tribal matters, including membership in the respective tribe or nation, the right to reside within the respective Indian territories, tribal organization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167; 6206(1).  Because the wording used is \"including,\" the specific categories are exemplars and not exclusive.  The examples provide limited guidance.  The stumpage permit policy does not fit neatly within any of these categories.  It might be argued it fits within \"tribal government\" but such an argument rests on inherently too broad a reading of the phrase.  That a tribe attempts to govern a matter does not render it an internal tribal matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of strong considerations point to the stumpage policy being an internal tribal matter.  First, and foremost, the policy purports to regulate only members of the tribe, as only tribal members may even apply for permits.  The interests of non-members are not at issue.  Thus, it appears to be an \"internal\" tribal matter.  Second, the policy has to do with the commercial use of lands acquired by the Nation with the federal funds it received for this purpose as part of the settlement agreement.  These lands are \"Penobscot Indian Territory\" and are subject to federal restraints on alienation.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1724;  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167; 6205.  The policy regulates the very land that defines the territory of the Nation, and so appears to be a \"tribal\" matter.  Third, the policy concerns the harvesting of a natural resource from that land;  and permit fees paid benefit the Penobscot Nation.  The control of the permitting process operates as a control over the growth, health, and reaping of that resource.  Fourth, the policy, at least on its face, does not implicate or impair any interest of the state of Maine.  Fifth, it is consistent with prior legal understandings to view the issuance of stumpage permits as an internal tribal matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are also arguments that this is not an internal tribal matter.  First, logging permits are issued by municipalities as a standard part of municipal powers.  But it is surely too broad a test to ask whether a municipality engages in the same activity.  Every activity specifically listed in the statute as an exemplar of an internal tribal matter is also engaged in by a municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and more interesting argument advanced by Akins is that, outside of the categorical exemplars, the focus should be historical and tribe specific.  The Penobscots, Akins says, have offered no evidence that they have historically been loggers or supported themselves through timber harvesting.  Logging, Akins says, is a major commercial activity in Maine and historically has been engaged in by others, and is not \"uniquely Indian\" nor \"of particular cultural importance\" to the Nation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Akins analogizes the expansion of the Nation into the economics of commercial logging to the expansion of the tribe into commercial gambling, an activity that the Maine Law Court has specifically held is not an \"internal tribal matter.\"   See Stilphen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2404705\"><a href=\"/opinion/2404705/penobscot-nation-v-stilphen/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span> (holding that an illegal bingo game run by the Nation did not qualify as an internal tribal matter);  see also Passamaquoddy Tribe, 75 F.3d at 787-88 (holding that Congress did not intend to give the Maine tribes any rights under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act).  At the very least, Akins argues, the dismissal of his action should be vacated and the case remanded for a hearing on whether logging is a traditional tribal activity and whether the stumpage policy reinforces traditional tribal values.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nation responds to this latter argument vigorously.  The Nation retorts that it is not a museum piece and may not be relegated to historic roles.  If the Nation is truly to exercise its residual sovereignty, it must be free to act within the present marketplace and not be stereotypically restricted to ancient forms of economic support.  Narrow historical analysis, the Nation says, should play almost no role.  Accordingly, the Nation argues that the Maine Law Court was wrong in Stilphen when it focused on historic culture or development to define internal tribal matters.  See Stilphen, 461 A.2d at 490.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such broad themes do not help to define the rules of decision in these cases.  At the same time Congress was enacting the Settlement Act the Supreme Court noted that, \" '[g]eneralizations in this subject [of tribal authority] have become ... treacherous.' \"  White Mountain Apache Tribe v.

We tread cautiously and write narrowly, for the problems and conflicting interests presented by this case will not be the same as the problems and interests presented by the next case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Context informs our approach.  This is not a dispute between Maine and the Nation over the attempted enforcement of Maine's laws.  This does not involve a direct or indirect regulation of the Nation by Congress.  This is also not a dispute over application of statutory rights Congress may have wished to apply uniformly, regardless of whether the application involved Indian lands or Indian government.  This is not an instance of potential conflict or coincidence of Maine law and federal statutory law.  This is not even a situation of substantive rights regarding stumpage permits granted to persons by statute, state or federal.  This is instead a question of allocation of jurisdiction among different fora and allocation of substantive law to a dispute between tribal members where neither the Congress nor the Maine Legislature has expressed a particular interest.  The federal courts have jurisdiction over this case only if the stumpage permits are not internal tribal matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The five considerations outlined earlier, taken together, resolve the question in favor of this being an internal tribal matter and do so as a matter of law.  Though future cases may require some exploration of evidence as to whether the underlying subject is an internal tribal matter before decision of the jurisdictional question, this case does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of great significance is that this is an intra-tribal dispute.  It involves only members of the tribe, and not actions by the Nation addressed to non-members.  The tribe's treatment of its members, particularly as to commercial interests, is not of central concern to either Maine or federal law (other than through the ICRA).  There appear to be no strong policy reasons not to view this as an area appropriate for internal tribal regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, the subject matter appears to be one which the settlement statutes viewed as being within legitimate tribal concern;  both the Implementing Act, &#167; 6203, and the Settlement Act, &#167; 1722, define \"land and other natural resources\" as meaning, inter alia, \"timber and timber rights.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The Settlement Act provides that the natural resources within the Penobscot Indian Territory may, at the request of the Nation, be leased, sold, or subject to right of way, in accord with other sections of Title 25.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1724(g).  It has long been understood that the power to issue permits is an indirect method of managing a natural resource.  See California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111844\"><a href=\"/opinion/111844/california-coastal-commn-v-granite-rock-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111844\"><a href=\"/opinion/111844/california-coastal-commn-v-granite-rock-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span> (1987).  To a large extent, the subject matter here involves the regulation and conservation of natural resources belonging to the tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the subject matter, involving tribal lands, appears to have no impact on Maine's environmental or other interests.  By its own terms, the Implementing Act, &#167; 6204, makes state laws regulating land use or management, conservation and environmental protection applicable to tribal lands.  The absence of an assertion that any such laws are involved here is telling.  Cf. Narragansett, 89 F.3d at 922 (enjoining construction of housing until the tribe complied with the requirements of state coastal resources management program).  Under such circumstances, arguments about history, which may be pertinent in other contexts and for addressing other problems,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> offer little here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We test our conclusions against a different history, the legislative history, because the language of the Implementing and Settlement Acts does not clearly dispose of the question.

That legislative history is only somewhat helpful because it embodies two conflicting approaches to resolving the question of what is an internal tribal matter.  On the one hand, Congress described the settlement as \"original\" and \"innovative.\"   On the other hand, the Congress referred to respecting the inherent self-governing authority of a tribe.  In so doing, it referred to a Supreme Court opinion, Santa Clara Pueblo v.

Before the settlement, the federal government had not formally recognized the Penobscot Nation as an Indian tribe and the State of Maine had long assumed that the Maine tribes had no inherent sovereignty.  See Bottomly v.

The Reports state that \"While the settlement represents a compromise in which state authority is extended over Indian territory to the extent provided in the Maine Implementing Act, ... the settlement provides that henceforth the tribes will be free from state interference in the exercise of their internal affairs.  Thus, rather than destroying the sovereignty of the tribes, by recognizing their power to control their internal affairs ... the settlement strengthens the sovereignty of the Maine Tribes.\"   S.Rep.

At issue was the definition of tribal membership, which the tribe extended to children of males who married outside the tribe but not to children of females who married outside the tribe.  The Supreme Court held that the ICRA vested jurisdiction in the tribal courts and not the federal courts.  The Court recognized both that Congress had the power to limit the powers of local self-government that tribes possessed and that Congress intended in the ICRA to balance dual objectives.  Under such circumstances, the Court would not infer from Congressional silence a cause of action in the federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress' citation to the Santa Clara Pueblo opinion in the Senate Report reinforces the tension between the dual objectives of the Settlement Act:  between an original, innovative allocation of authority between the State and tribes and the desire to recognize the tribe's inherent self-government authority.  From Congressional silence we are hesitant to read an intent to expand federal court jurisdiction where it appears, as it does here, that inherent self-governing authority of a tribe is involved.  We stress that we do not read the reference by Congress to Santa Clara Pueblo in the legislative history of the Settlement Act as invoking all of prior Indian law.  That would be inconsistent with the unique nature of the Maine settlement and the specific provisions of the Act limiting the application of federal Indian law.  But we also do not agree that reference to such law is never helpful in defining what is an internal tribal matter.  Congress was explicitly aware of such law, and explicitly made existing general federal Indian law applicable to the Penobscot Nation in the Settlement Act.  In other areas, courts have long presumed that Congress acts against the background of prior law.  See, e.g., Clarke v. Securities Indus.
