Collazo-Aponte appealed our\n\ndecision to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court\n\ngranted appellant's petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated this\n\nCourt's judgment, and remanded the case to this Court for further\n\nconsideration in light of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).\n\nUpon reconsideration, we affirm appellant's convictions but vacate his\n\nsentence in part and remand for re-sentencing consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\nA.   Facts Elicited at Trial\n\n           In the mid-1980s, a drug-dealing conspiracy was formed in the\n\nVirgilio Dávila public housing project in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. The\n\nconspirators processed and packaged cocaine and heroin for delivery to\n\nvarious drug distribution points throughout Puerto Rico. In February\n\n1993, the drug organization splintered into rival factions when the\n\nRosario-Rodríguez brothers murdered a fellow conspirator, Richard\n\nMuñoz-Candelaria. A series of retaliatory murders ensued as members of\n\nthe organization engaged in hunting expeditions to kill the Rosario-\n\nRodríguez brothers.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           Collazo-Aponte joined the conspiracy shortly after the \"war\"\n\ncommenced, when the organization began storing drugs at a co-\n\nconspirator's bar where appellant worked. At trial, two cooperating\n\nwitnesses testified that on numerous occasions they delivered money to\n\nCollazo-Aponte in exchange for drugs. When appellant was finally\n\narrested, he was carrying more than 1,000 \"decks\" of heroin, worth\n\n$10,000.\n\n           On June 26, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted Collazo-\n\nAponte on charges of using and carrying a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a drug conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)\n\n(A), and of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine\n\nbase, cocaine, and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846. On\n\nFebruary 16, 1998, the jury found appellant guilty of both charges.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the judge found by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that Collazo-Aponte was responsible for \"more than 30\n\nkilos of heroin, 150 kilos of cocaine, and/or 1.5 kilos of crack\n\ncocaine.\" After assessing appellant's criminal history and the extent\n\nof his participation in the offense, the district court sentenced\n\nappellant to 151 months' imprisonment for the drug conspiracy count.\n\n           During sentencing for the gun count, the government argued\n\nthat appellant should not be sentenced under the base offense of §\n\n924(c)(1)(A), but rather under the more severe punishment offered by §\n\n924(c)(1)(B). Whereas § 924(c)(1)(A) offers a statutory minimum of\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\ffive years' imprisonment, § 924(c)(1) (B) mandates an enhanced sentence\n\nof no less than ten years' imprisonment for the use or carrying of a\n\nsemiautomatic weapon during a crime of violence. To prove appellant's\n\nviolation of § 924(c)(1)(B), the government cited two instances in\n\nwhich co-conspirators used semiautomatic weapons during the period of\n\nCollazo-Aponte's participation in the conspiracy - namely, a double\n\nmurder in April 1994 and the shooting of a police officer in September\n\n1994.    The government argued that since the use of semiautomatic\n\nfirearms by co-conspirators was foreseeable, Collazo-Aponte should be\n\nheld accountable for it.\n\n           The district court agreed, finding by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that appellant violated § 924(c)(1)(B). The court then\n\nimposed an enhanced sentence of ten years' imprisonment for the gun\n\ncount.\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n           Collazo-Aponte appealed his conviction and sentence to this\n\nCourt. United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nHe claimed, inter alia, that he should have received a five-year,\n\nrather than the enhanced ten-year, sentence for the gun count. More\n\nspecifically, appellant argued that (1) the use or carrying of the\n\nsemiautomatic weapons occurred prior to his joining the conspiracy, and\n\n(2) he could not have foreseen the use of semiautomatic weapons. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fat 202. This Court rejected appellant's arguments, citing sufficient\n\nevidence in the record to refute both claims.\n\n           One day before we decided Collazo-Aponte's appeal, however,\n\nthe Supreme Court rendered its opinion in Apprendi. Then, after this\n\nCourt affirmed Collazo-Aponte's conviction and sentence, appellant\n\nsought a rehearing of his appeal raising new arguments in light of\n\nApprendi. On September 18, 2000, this Court denied Collazo-Aponte's\n\npetition for rehearing.\n\n           Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with\n\nthe Supreme Court.     On May 21, 2001, the Supreme Court granted\n\nappellant's petition, vacated this Court's judgment, and remanded the\n\ncase to this Court for further consideration in light of Apprendi.\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n           On June 26, 2000, the Supreme Court decided Apprendi, which\n\nhas been described as \"a watershed change in constitutional law . . .\n\n.\" 530 U.S. at 524 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The Apprendi Court\n\nheld that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"   Id. at 490 (internal quotations omitted).       Because this\n\nholding was in contrast to then-existing practice, numerous appellants,\n\nincluding Collazo-Aponte, were given constitutionally-engineered\n\nammunition to attack their convictions and sentences.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          Relying on Apprendi, Collazo-Aponte argues (1) that his ten-\n\nyear enhanced sentence for the gun count must be vacated since the\n\njury never determined beyond a reasonable doubt that he carried a\n\nsemiautomatic weapon; (2) that his drug sentence must be vacated\n\nbecause the drug quantity at issue was neither decided by the jury nor\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) that his conviction should be\n\nvacated because § 841(b) is unconstitutional on its face.        Since\n\nappellant's arguments are raised for the first time on appeal, we\n\nreview them for plain error. See United States v. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31,\n\n36 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          First, appellant argues that his ten-year enhanced sentence\n\nfor the gun count must be vacated because, under Apprendi, the jury\n\nshould have determined beyond reasonable doubt that he was accountable\n\nfor the semiautomatic weapons used or carried by his co-conspirators.\n\nThe government concedes that it was plain error for the district court\n\nto impose the enhanced sentence.1 Given the government's concession,\n\nwe vacate Collazo-Aponte's ten-year sentence.\n\n          The government proposes that we remand the case to substitute\n\na five-year consecutive sentence for the ten-year enhanced sentence.\n\nThe five-year sentence does not suffer from any of the constitutional\n\n\n\n1 The government concedes this argument, in part, because the evidence\nused to establish appellant's guilt for the use of semiautomatic\nweapons pre-dates the amendment which authorizes an enhanced sentence\nfor such conduct.\n\n                                 -7-\n\finfirmities that plague the ten-year sentence because (1) the original\n\nindictment included a count charging appellant with violating §\n\n924(c)(1)(A); and (2) the jury found appellant guilty of this charge\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.     Therefore, we remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court to impose a sentence under § 924(c)(1)(A).\n\n           Second, Collazo-Aponte argues that his drug sentence must be\n\nvacated because the drug quantity at issue was not proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt at trial, as required by Apprendi.         Appellant's\n\nargument, however, rests on an expansive reading of Apprendi that has\n\nbeen explicitly and repeatedly rejected by this Court.         We have\n\nconsistently held that the Apprendi doctrine does not apply to\n\ndefendants who are sentenced to terms less than the otherwise\n\napplicable statutory maximum. See, e.g., Eirby, 262 F.3d at 37; United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nBaltas, 236 F.3d 27, 41 (1st Cir. 2001). Most succinctly, Apprendi\n\ndoes not require that all sentencing factors be submitted to a jury and\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt, rather only those that \"increase[]\n\nthe penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum . . .\n\n.\"   530   U.S. at 490.\n\n           In the instant case, Collazo-Aponte's sentence for the drug\n\nconspiracy was at least seven years less than the applicable statutory\n\nmaximum.    See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (authorizing a term of\n\nimprisonment of not more than 20 years for a defendant who has been\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\ffound guilty of a drug offense involving any quantity of cocaine, crack\n\ncocaine, or heroin). Because Apprendi's constitutional requirements do\n\nnot even apply to appellant's drug conspiracy sentence, we affirm the\n\n151-month sentence.    See Baltas, 236 F.3d at 41 (holding that \"no\n\nconstitutional error occurs when the district court sentences the\n\ndefendant within the statutory maximum, regardless that drug quantity\n\nwas never determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt\").\n\n          Lastly, Collazo-Aponte argues that his conviction should be\n\nvacated because, post-Apprendi, § 841(b) is unconstitutional on its\n\nface. Section 841(a)(1) makes it unlawful to \"manufacture, distribute,\n\nor dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or\n\ndispense, a controlled substance.\" Section 841(b), in turn, provides\n\nthe penalties for violations of § 841(a)(1), which vary depending upon\n\ndrug type and quantity. Before Apprendi was decided, only the elements\n\nspecified in § 841(a)(1) needed to be proved to a jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt; the penalty provisions set forth in § 841(b) were\n\nadministered by the sentencing judge under a preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard. After Apprendi, however, all facts (other than\n\nprior convictions) that set the maximum possible punishment under §\n\n841(b) must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the same body\n\nthat determines culpability under § 841(a). See Eirby, 262 F.3d at 37\n\n(finding that Apprendi applies to drug quantity determinations).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fBecause of this shift, appellant concludes that § 841(b) can no longer\n\nwithstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\n          We find Collazo-Aponte's argument unpersuasive because none\n\nof the provisions of § 841(b) contradicts Apprendi's mandate. Section\n\n841(b) does not require that sentencing judges determine the facts that\n\nincrease the penalty for the crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum. Nor does § 841(b) require that such facts be determined by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. The statute is silent as to who makes\n\nthese findings and under what burden of persuasion. Hence, there is\n\nnothing in the statutory language that explicitly defies Apprendi.\n\n          Moreover, the Constitution, as interpreted by Apprendi,\n\nsimply makes the jury the decisionmaker and the reasonable-doubt\n\nstandard the proper burden for facts that increase the penalty beyond\n\nthe applicable statutory maximum. \"How statutes are . . . implemented\n\n[] to fulfil that requirement is a subject to which the Constitution\n\ndoes not speak.\" United States v. Brough, 243 F.3d 1078, 1079 (7th\n\nCir. 2001); see also United States v. Candelario, 240 F.3d 1300, 1311\n\nn.16 (11th Cir. 2001) (characterizing as \"without merit\" a facial\n\nchallenge to §§ 841 and 846 under Apprendi), cert. denied, --- U.S. ---\n\n, 121 S. Ct. 2535 (2001); United States v. Slaughter, 238 F.3d 580, 582\n\n(5th Cir. 2000) (stating that \"[w]e see nothing in the Supreme Court\n\ndecision in Apprendi which would permit us to conclude that 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a) and (b), 846, and 860(a) are unconstitutional on their\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fface\"), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1045, 121 S. Ct. 2015 (2001); United\n\nStates v. Cernobyl, 255 F.3d 1215, 1218-19 (10th Cir. 2001) (rejecting\n\nan Apprendi-based facial challenge to § 841); United States v.\n\nMcCallister, 272 F.3d 228 (4th Cir. 2001); United States v. Kelly, 272\n\nF.3d 622 (3d Cir. 2001) (same); United States v. Martínez, 253 F.3d\n\n251, 256 n.6 (6th Cir. 2001) (same); United States v. Woods, 270 F.3d\n\n728, 729-30 (8th Cir. 2001) (same).\n\n           Thus, a shift in how judges implement § 841(b) simply does\n\nnot raise the constitutional doubts of which Collazo-Aponte complains.\n\n Because there is no constitutional defect inherent in the language or\n\ndesign of § 841, we find no impediment to appellant's conviction under\n\nthe statute.2\n\n           Collazo-Aponte's second challenge to § 841(b) argues that\n\nthe statute is unconstitutional because it does not require proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew of the specific\n\nquantity of cocaine involved in the offense. Since the plain language\n\nof § 841(a) requires that the proscribed acts be committed \"knowingly\n\nand intentionally,\" appellant claims that this mens rea requirement\n\nshould extend to all the elements of the offense. See United States v.\n\n\n\n2 Appellant also challenges the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. § 846,\nwhich (among other things) makes the penalty provisions of § 841(b)\napplicable to anyone who conspires to violate § 841(a). Because § 846\nis inextricably intertwined with § 841(b) and simply offers another\noccasion to apply the penalties set forth in § 841 (b), our ruling as\nto § 841(b) applies with equal force to § 846.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fAhmad, 101 F.3d 386, 390 (5th Cir. 1996) (applying mens rea requirement\n\nin statute to all elements of offense). He concludes by noting that\n\nsince, post-Apprendi, § 841 (b) must be determined by a jury beyond\n\nreasonable doubt, the drug quantity at issue is now an element of the\n\noffense to which the mens rea requirement should apply.3\n\n          To determine whether Congress intended to impose the specific\n\nscienter requirement that appellant proposes, we must first examine the\n\nstatutory language of § 841(b). See Staples v. United States, 511 U.S.\n\n600, 605 (1994) (noting that statutory language is the starting point\n\nin analyzing whether Congress intended to impose a mens rea\n\nrequirement). The plain language of § 841(b) requires the government\n\nto prove only that the offense \"involved\" a particular type and\n\nquantity of drug, not that the defendant knew that he was distributing\n\nthat particular drug type and quantity. See United States v. Sheppard,\n\n219 F.3d 766, 768 n.2, 770 (8th Cir. 2000) (ruling that the statutory\n\nlanguage of § 841(b) does not require the government to prove that\n\ndefendant knew of the specific drug type and quantity at issue). Thus,\n\nnothing in the statutory language of § 841(b) supports a mens rea\n\nrequirement.      Furthermore, a specific criminal intent requirement\n\n\n3 We disagree with appellant's characterization of the drug quantity\nas an element of the offense. Apprendi did not convert all sentencing\nfactors into elements of the offense, only those that \"increase[] the\npenalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum . . . .\"\n530 U.S. at 490. Because the drug conspiracy sentence in this case\nwas within the applicable statutory maximum, the drug quantity at issue\nnever became an element of the offense.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f\"serves only to separate those who understand the wrongful nature of\n\ntheir act from those who do not.\" United States v. X-Citement Video,\n\nInc., 513 U.S. 64, 72 n.3 (1994). Thus, the presumption in favor of a\n\nscienter requirement should only apply \"to each of the statutory\n\nelements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.\" Id. at 72. In\n\nthe instant case, the drug quantity involved in appellant's offense is\n\nnot a factor that is necessary to the determination of whether his\n\nconduct is \"criminal\" or \"innocent.\" Appellant is guilty whether he\n\nconspired to sell 30 kilos of heroin or 30,000. Because the amount of\n\ndrugs at issue would not make appellant's behavior unpunishable, his\n\nargument necessarily fails.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          Given the government's concession, we vacate appellant's ten-\n\nyear enhanced sentence imposed under § 924(c)(1)(B), and we remand the\n\ncase to the district court to impose an Apprendi-compliant sentence\n\nunder § 924(c)(1)(A). We uphold the constitutionality of § 841(b), and\n\nthereby affirm appellant's conviction under it. Lastly, we affirm\n\nappellant's sentence under the drug count, as it was within the\n\napplicable statutory maximum.\n\n          Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for action\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f",

A series of retaliatory murders ensued as members of\n\nthe organization engaged in hunting expeditions to kill the Rosario-\n\nRodríguez brothers.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           Collazo-Aponte joined the conspiracy shortly after the \"war\"\n\ncommenced, when the organization began storing drugs at a co-\n\nconspirator's bar where appellant worked. At trial, two cooperating\n\nwitnesses testified that on numerous occasions they delivered money to\n\nCollazo-Aponte in exchange for drugs. When appellant was finally\n\narrested, he was carrying more than 1,000 \"decks\" of heroin, worth\n\n$10,000.\n\n           On June 26, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted Collazo-\n\nAponte on charges of using and carrying a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a drug conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)\n\n(A), and of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine\n\nbase, cocaine, and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846. On\n\nFebruary 16, 1998, the jury found appellant guilty of both charges.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the judge found by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that Collazo-Aponte was responsible for \"more than 30\n\nkilos of heroin, 150 kilos of cocaine, and/or 1.5 kilos of crack\n\ncocaine.\" After assessing appellant's criminal history and the extent\n\nof his participation in the offense, the district court sentenced\n\nappellant to 151 months' imprisonment for the drug conspiracy count.\n\n           During sentencing for the gun count, the government argued\n\nthat appellant should not be sentenced under the base offense of §\n\n924(c)(1)(A), but rather under the more severe punishment offered by §\n\n924(c)(1)(B). Whereas § 924(c)(1)(A) offers a statutory minimum of\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\ffive years' imprisonment, § 924(c)(1) (B) mandates an enhanced sentence\n\nof no less than ten years' imprisonment for the use or carrying of a\n\nsemiautomatic weapon during a crime of violence. To prove appellant's\n\nviolation of § 924(c)(1)(B), the government cited two instances in\n\nwhich co-conspirators used semiautomatic weapons during the period of\n\nCollazo-Aponte's participation in the conspiracy - namely, a double\n\nmurder in April 1994 and the shooting of a police officer in September\n\n1994.    The government argued that since the use of semiautomatic\n\nfirearms by co-conspirators was foreseeable, Collazo-Aponte should be\n\nheld accountable for it.\n\n           The district court agreed, finding by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that appellant violated § 924(c)(1)(B). The court then\n\nimposed an enhanced sentence of ten years' imprisonment for the gun\n\ncount.\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n           Collazo-Aponte appealed his conviction and sentence to this\n\nCourt. United States v. Collazo-Aponte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198984\"><a href=\"/opinion/198984/united-states-v-rivera-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nHe claimed, inter alia, that he should have received a five-year,\n\nrather than the enhanced ten-year, sentence for the gun count. More\n\nspecifically, appellant argued that (1) the use or carrying of the\n\nsemiautomatic weapons occurred prior to his joining the conspiracy, and\n\n(2) he could not have foreseen the use of semiautomatic weapons. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fat 202. This Court rejected appellant's arguments, citing sufficient\n\nevidence in the record to refute both claims.\n\n           One day before we decided Collazo-Aponte's appeal, however,\n\nthe Supreme Court rendered its opinion in Apprendi. Then, after this\n\nCourt affirmed Collazo-Aponte's conviction and sentence, appellant\n\nsought a rehearing of his appeal raising new arguments in light of\n\nApprendi. On September 18, 2000, this Court denied Collazo-Aponte's\n\npetition for rehearing.\n\n           Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with\n\nthe Supreme Court.     On May 21, 2001, the Supreme Court granted\n\nappellant's petition, vacated this Court's judgment, and remanded the\n\ncase to this Court for further consideration in light of Apprendi.\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n           On June 26, 2000, the Supreme Court decided Apprendi, which\n\nhas been described as \"a watershed change in constitutional law . . .\n\n.\" 530 U.S. at 524 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The Apprendi Court\n\nheld that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"   Id. at 490 (internal quotations omitted).       Because this\n\nholding was in contrast to then-existing practice, numerous appellants,\n\nincluding Collazo-Aponte, were given constitutionally-engineered\n\nammunition to attack their convictions and sentences.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          Relying on Apprendi, Collazo-Aponte argues (1) that his ten-\n\nyear enhanced sentence for the gun count must be vacated since the\n\njury never determined beyond a reasonable doubt that he carried a\n\nsemiautomatic weapon; (2) that his drug sentence must be vacated\n\nbecause the drug quantity at issue was neither decided by the jury nor\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) that his conviction should be\n\nvacated because § 841(b) is unconstitutional on its face.        Since\n\nappellant's arguments are raised for the first time on appeal, we\n\nreview them for plain error. See United States v. Eirby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199580\"><a href=\"/opinion/199580/united-states-v-eirby/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n36 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          First, appellant argues that his ten-year enhanced sentence\n\nfor the gun count must be vacated because, under Apprendi, the jury\n\nshould have determined beyond reasonable doubt that he was accountable\n\nfor the semiautomatic weapons used or carried by his co-conspirators.\n\nThe government concedes that it was plain error for the district court\n\nto impose the enhanced sentence.1 Given the government's concession,\n\nwe vacate Collazo-Aponte's ten-year sentence.\n\n          The government proposes that we remand the case to substitute\n\na five-year consecutive sentence for the ten-year enhanced sentence.\n\nThe five-year sentence does not suffer from any of the constitutional\n\n\n\n1 The government concedes this argument, in part, because the evidence\nused to establish appellant's guilt for the use of semiautomatic\nweapons pre-dates the amendment which authorizes an enhanced sentence\nfor such conduct.\n\n                                 -7-\n\finfirmities that plague the ten-year sentence because (1) the original\n\nindictment included a count charging appellant with violating §\n\n924(c)(1)(A); and (2) the jury found appellant guilty of this charge\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.     Therefore, we remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court to impose a sentence under § 924(c)(1)(A).\n\n           Second, Collazo-Aponte argues that his drug sentence must be\n\nvacated because the drug quantity at issue was not proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt at trial, as required by Apprendi.         Appellant's\n\nargument, however, rests on an expansive reading of Apprendi that has\n\nbeen explicitly and repeatedly rejected by this Court.         We have\n\nconsistently held that the Apprendi doctrine does not apply to\n\ndefendants who are sentenced to terms less than the otherwise\n\napplicable statutory maximum. See, e.g., Eirby, 262 F.3d at 37; United\n\nStates v. Duarte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nBaltas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199221\"><a href=\"/opinion/199221/united-states-v-baltas/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 2001). Most succinctly, Apprendi\n\ndoes not require that all sentencing factors be submitted to a jury and\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt, rather only those that \"increase[]\n\nthe penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum . . .\n\n.\"   530   U.S. at 490.\n\n           In the instant case, Collazo-Aponte's sentence for the drug\n\nconspiracy was at least seven years less than the applicable statutory\n\nmaximum.    See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (authorizing a term of\n\nimprisonment of not more than 20 years for a defendant who has been\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\ffound guilty of a drug offense involving any quantity of cocaine, crack\n\ncocaine, or heroin). Because Apprendi's constitutional requirements do\n\nnot even apply to appellant's drug conspiracy sentence, we affirm the\n\n151-month sentence.    See Baltas, 236 F.3d at 41 (holding that \"no\n\nconstitutional error occurs when the district court sentences the\n\ndefendant within the statutory maximum, regardless that drug quantity\n\nwas never determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt\").\n\n          Lastly, Collazo-Aponte argues that his conviction should be\n\nvacated because, post-Apprendi, § 841(b) is unconstitutional on its\n\nface. Section 841(a)(1) makes it unlawful to \"manufacture, distribute,\n\nor dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or\n\ndispense, a controlled substance.\" Section 841(b), in turn, provides\n\nthe penalties for violations of § 841(a)(1), which vary depending upon\n\ndrug type and quantity. Before Apprendi was decided, only the elements\n\nspecified in § 841(a)(1) needed to be proved to a jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt; the penalty provisions set forth in § 841(b) were\n\nadministered by the sentencing judge under a preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard. After Apprendi, however, all facts (other than\n\nprior convictions) that set the maximum possible punishment under §\n\n841(b) must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the same body\n\nthat determines culpability under § 841(a). See Eirby, 262 F.3d at 37\n\n(finding that Apprendi applies to drug quantity determinations).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fBecause of this shift, appellant concludes that § 841(b) can no longer\n\nwithstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\n          We find Collazo-Aponte's argument unpersuasive because none\n\nof the provisions of § 841(b) contradicts Apprendi's mandate. Section\n\n841(b) does not require that sentencing judges determine the facts that\n\nincrease the penalty for the crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum. Nor does § 841(b) require that such facts be determined by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. The statute is silent as to who makes\n\nthese findings and under what burden of persuasion. Hence, there is\n\nnothing in the statutory language that explicitly defies Apprendi.\n\n          Moreover, the Constitution, as interpreted by Apprendi,\n\nsimply makes the jury the decisionmaker and the reasonable-doubt\n\nstandard the proper burden for facts that increase the penalty beyond\n\nthe applicable statutory maximum. \"How statutes are . . . implemented\n\n[] to fulfil that requirement is a subject to which the Constitution\n\ndoes not speak.\" United States v.

Since the plain language\n\nof § 841(a) requires that the proscribed acts be committed \"knowingly\n\nand intentionally,\" appellant claims that this mens rea requirement\n\nshould extend to all the elements of the offense. See United States v.\n\n\n\n2 Appellant also challenges the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. § 846,\nwhich (among other things) makes the penalty provisions of § 841(b)\napplicable to anyone who conspires to violate § 841(a). Because § 846\nis inextricably intertwined with § 841(b) and simply offers another\noccasion to apply the penalties set forth in § 841 (b), our ruling as\nto § 841(b) applies with equal force to § 846.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fAhmad, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (5th Cir. 1996) (applying mens rea requirement\n\nin statute to all elements of offense).

The plain language of § 841(b) requires the government\n\nto prove only that the offense \"involved\" a particular type and\n\nquantity of drug, not that the defendant knew that he was distributing\n\nthat particular drug type and quantity. See United States v.

Thus,\n\nnothing in the statutory language of § 841(b) supports a mens rea\n\nrequirement.      Furthermore, a specific criminal intent requirement\n\n\n3 We disagree with appellant's characterization of the drug quantity\nas an element of the offense. Apprendi did not convert all sentencing\nfactors into elements of the offense, only those that \"increase[] the\npenalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum . . . .\"\n530 U.S. at 490. Because the drug conspiracy sentence in this case\nwas within the applicable statutory maximum, the drug quantity at issue\nnever became an element of the offense.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f\"serves only to separate those who understand the wrongful nature of\n\ntheir act from those who do not.\" United States v.

In\n\nthe instant case, the drug quantity involved in appellant's offense is\n\nnot a factor that is necessary to the determination of whether his\n\nconduct is \"criminal\" or \"innocent.\" Appellant is guilty whether he\n\nconspired to sell 30 kilos of heroin or 30,000. Because the amount of\n\ndrugs at issue would not make appellant's behavior unpunishable, his\n\nargument necessarily fails.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          Given the government's concession, we vacate appellant's ten-\n\nyear enhanced sentence imposed under § 924(c)(1)(B), and we remand the\n\ncase to the district court to impose an Apprendi-compliant sentence\n\nunder § 924(c)(1)(A).
