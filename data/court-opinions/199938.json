White for appellant.\n     Kevin P. McGrath, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nJames B. Farmer, United States Attorney, and Michael D. Ricciuti,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 6, 2002\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether the district court acted within its legal authority in\n\nrelying upon a police report relating to a defendant's prior state\n\nconviction to conclude that he was a career offender and thus\n\nsubject to an enhanced sentence under the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines.   Concluding that the court exercised its sentencing\n\nauthority properly, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          On July 30, 1999, defendant-appellant José Delgado and a\n\nco-defendant sold crack cocaine (cocaine base) to an undercover\nagent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).   On August 24,\n1999, Delgado, with two other co-defendants, again sold cocaine\nbase to that DEA agent.    On December 8, 1999, Delgado and nine\n\nothers were charged in a multi-count drug trafficking indictment.\nDelgado was indicted on one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine\nbase with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and\n\ntwo counts of cocaine base distribution and aiding and abetting\nthat distribution, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18\nU.S.C. § 2.\n          Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Delgado pled guilty\n\nto these charges on September 6, 2000.    At sentencing, the court\n\nconcluded, over Delgado's objection, that he was a career offender\n\nand that, under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1,\n\nhis base offense level was 32, and his criminal history category\n\nwas VI. Awarding Delgado a three-level reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, the district court calculated his final adjusted\n\n                                 -2-\n\foffense level at 29.     The applicable sentencing range for a level\n\n29 category VI offender was 151 to 188 months.             The district court\n\naccordingly    sentenced      Delgado,     inter   alia,    to    151   months'\nimprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.1\n            In determining Delgado's career offender status under\n\n§ 4B1.1, the district court concluded that Delgado's criminal\nhistory included two prior convictions for crimes of violence, thus\n\nwarranting    an   increase   in   the   offense   level    for   the   instant\n\noffense.2     On February 10, 1999, Delgado was convicted in state\n\ncourt of assault with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery on a\n\npolice officer, and disorderly conduct, and sentenced to ninety\n\ndays in prison. On April 1, 1999, Delgado pled guilty to the charge\n\nof breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony.                    The\neffect of this latter conviction on Delgado's federal sentence was\n\nhotly disputed by the parties at sentencing and now constitutes the\n\ncore issue on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Absent Delgado's career offender status, his sentence would\nlikely have been seven years shorter than the 151 months he\nreceived.\n     2\n       Delgado's criminal history also includes a 1996 conviction\nfor cocaine possession under Puerto Rico law.         A controlled\nsubstance offense may qualify as a predicate act triggering\napplication of the career offender guidelines where the defendant\npossessed the drugs with the intent to manufacture, import, export,\ndistribute or dispense them.     See U.S.S.G. §§ 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.\nHere, however, as the government acknowledges, there is no\nindication in the Pre-Sentence Report that Delgado possessed the\ncocaine with any such intent; therefore, it does not appear that\nthis conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for purposes of\nthe career offender guidelines.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f                                     II.\n\n            The career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, provides\n\nfor an enhanced sentence if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen\n\nyears old at the time he committed the offense for which he is\n\nbeing    sentenced;     (2)   that   offense   is    a    felony     that   either\n\nconstitutes a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense;\n\nand (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for\n\neither    crimes   of     violence    or    crimes       involving    controlled\n\nsubstances. For application of the career offender provisions, the\n\nsentencing guidelines define \"crime of violence\" to encompass\ncertain federal and state offenses punishable by more than a year\n\nin prison, including \"burglary of a dwelling.\"3              U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2.\n            Here, Delgado -- who was 23 years old at the time of the\ninstant controlled substance offense -- clearly satisfies the first\n\ntwo criteria under § 4B1.1. Furthermore, Delgado concedes that his\nFebruary 1999 conviction constitutes a crime of violence and thus\n\nqualifies as a predicate offense under § 4B1.1.                Delgado argues,\n\nhowever, that the breaking-and-entering offense to which he pled\nguilty in April 1999 does not constitute a crime of violence under\n\n\n\n     3\n         Section 4B1.2 defines \"crime of violence\" as:\n\n     (a) . . . any offense under federal or state law,\n     punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\n     that (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n     threatened use of physical force against the person of\n     another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or\n     extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise\n     involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk\n     of physical injury to another.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f§ 4B1.1, and hence he is not a career offender within the meaning\n\nof the guidelines.4\n\nA.   The Taylor Categorical Approach\n\n          In determining whether Delgado's April 1999 conviction\n\nconstitutes a crime of violence, we follow the categorical approach\n\noutlined in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), and\n\nsubsequent   First   Circuit   precedent.   While   questions   of   law\n\nconcerning interpretation of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed\n\nde novo, the factual conclusions of the sentencing court, which\n\nmust be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, are reviewed\nfor clear error. See United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); United States v. Grant, 114 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.\n1997).\n\n\n\n     4\n       Delgado also argues that the April 1999 conviction is not\nfit for inclusion in the career offender calculus because it was\nobtained in violation of Massachusetts state criminal procedure.\nThis collateral attack on the validity of the April 1999 conviction\nis improper. \"[W]ith the sole exception of convictions obtained in\nviolation of right to counsel,\" a defendant in a federal sentencing\nproceeding has no right to attack collaterally the validity of a\nprior state conviction used to enhance his federal sentence.\nCustis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 487 (1994). See also United\nStates v. Cordero, 42 F.3d 697, 701 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Custis\nin context of § 4B1.1 career offender guideline). This limitation\non collateral challenges is intended to preserve the integrity of\n\"the finality doctrine that serves to conserve scarce judicial\nresources and promote efficiency\" and to prevent sentencing courts\nfrom having to \"'rummage through frequently nonexistent or\ndifficult to obtain state court transcripts or records that may\ndate from another era, and may come from any one of the 50\nStates.'\" United States v. Burke, 67 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995)\n(quoting Custis, 511 U.S. at 496).        Delgado conceded at the\nsentencing hearing that he was represented by counsel in the state\ncriminal proceedings relating to the April 1999 conviction. Thus,\nwe refuse to consider Delgado's collateral challenge to that prior\nconviction.\n\n                                  -5-\n\f             Under the Taylor approach, a sentencing court should\n\n\"look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition\n\nof the prior offense\" to determine whether a prior conviction\nqualifies     as   a   predicate   offense    for    sentencing      enhancement\n\npurposes.5    Id. at 602.    See also United States v. Meader, 118 F.3d\n\n876, 882 (1st Cir. 1997) (deciding whether a crime is a \"crime of\nviolence\" is an inquiry \"restricted to the statutory definitions of\n\nthe   prior    offenses    without   regard    to     the     particular   facts\n\nunderlying them\"); United States v. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234, 1235\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             Sometimes, however, \"looking to the statutory definition\n\nalone\" will not establish whether the crime underlying the prior\n\nconviction was one of violence because some statutes contain\nlanguage that covers both violent and non-violent crimes.               Harris,\n\n964 F.2d at 1235 (internal quotation marks omitted).                  Where the\n\nstatutory     definition    encompasses    both     violent    and   non-violent\noffenses, a sentencing court may look to the charging document --\n\nsuch as the indictment or information -- and jury instructions to\n\n      5\n         In Taylor, the Supreme Court considered whether the\ndefendant's prior burglary conviction constituted a \"violent\nfelony\" under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), a sentence enhancement\nprovision of the Armed Career Criminal Act. 495 U.S. at 577-78.\nAlthough the § 924(e)(1) definition of \"violent felony\" is not\nidentical to the § 4B1.1 definition of \"crime of violence,\" we look\ngenerally to cases pertaining to either provision \"to elucidate the\nnature of the categorical inquiry.\" United States v. Shepard, 231\nF.3d 56, 63 n.7 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that \"[d]espite the\ndifferences between § 4B1.1 and § 924(e)(2), the categorical\napproach applies to both provisions\"). See, e.g., United States v.\nFernandez, 121 F.3d 777, 778-79 (1st Cir. 1997) (applying\ncategorical approach to § 4B1.1 \"crime of violence\" determination);\nUnited States v. Meader, 118 F.3d 876, 882-85 (1st Cir. 1997)\n(same).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fascertain whether the conviction was for a violent or non-violent\n\ncrime.   See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602; United States v. Shepard, 231\n\nF.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Sacko, 178 F.3d 1, 3\n(1st Cir. 1999); Harris, 964 F.2d at 1235.\n\n              If     the        charging   document          only   incorporates      the\n\nunhelpfully broad statutory language and if there is no jury charge\nbecause the conviction is based on a guilty plea, a sentencing\n\ncourt may appropriately\n\n              look to the conduct in respect to which the\n              defendant was charged and pled guilty, not\n              because the court may properly be interested\n              (in this context) in the violent or non-violent\n              nature of that particular conduct, but because\n              that conduct may indicate that the defendant\n              and the government both believed that the\n              generically violent crime . . . rather than the\n              generically non-violent crime . . . was at\n              issue.\n\nHarris, 964 F.2d at 1236.               Thus, the issue before the sentencing\ncourt is not what the defendant \"did to provoke the criminal\n\ncharges to which he pled guilty.\"                        Shepard, 231 F.3d at 69.\n\nRather, what is critical is \"the meaning of the defendant's guilty\n\nplea\"    --        that        is,   whether     the     defendant's     guilty    plea\n\n\"constitute[s] an admission\" to a crime of violence under \"the\n\npreponderance of the evidence\" standard.                      Id. at 66, 68.\n\n              In discerning the plea's meaning, the court may rely on\n\n\"sufficiently reliable evidence independent of a fact-specific\n\nadmission.\"         Id. at 66.       Such evidence -- so long as it is deemed\n\nsufficiently reliable by the district court -- may include police\n\nreports.       Id.        at    67   (\"Based    on     our   precedents,   we   see    no\n\njustification for an absolute bar to the consideration of [police\n\n                                               -7-\n\freports] when the sentencing court must determine whether the\n\ndefendant and the government both believed that the defendant was\n\nentering a guilty plea to a generically violent crime.\").\n\nB.   The Trial Court's Ruling on the Predicate Offense\n\n           Here, with respect to the April 1999 conviction, Delgado\n\nwas initially charged in December 1998 with Home Invasion in\n\nviolation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, § 18C.   However, the Fitchburg\n\nDistrict Court amended the charge of Home Invasion to Breaking and\n\nEntering in the Night Time with Intent to Commit a Felony.   Delgado\n\npled guilty to that amended charge in April 1999.6\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       It does not appear that an amended complaint was ever filed;\ninstead, a notation was placed on a document entitled \"Criminal\nDocket\" to reflect the April 1999 amended charge. Although the\n\"Criminal Docket\" document contains no explicit citation to a\nstatute, both parties agree that Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, § 16 is the\nstatute which most closely tracks the language of the amended\ncharge in that document. Furthermore, the sentence imposed, two\nyears in a house of correction, is consistent with the penalty\nprovisions of that offense. Accordingly, we conclude (and Delgado\ndoes not dispute) that this statute sets forth the offense to which\nhe pled guilty. Section 16 states in relevant part:\n\n          Whoever, in the night time, breaks and enters\n          a building, ship, vessel or vehicle, with\n          intent to commit a felony, or who attempts to\n          or does break, burn, blow up or otherwise\n          injures or destroys a safe, vault or other\n          depository of money, bonds or other valuables\n          in any building, vehicle or place, with intent\n          to commit a larceny or felony, whether he\n          succeeds or fails in the perpetration of such\n          larceny or felony, shall be punished by\n          imprisonment in the state prison for not more\n          than twenty years or in a jail or house of\n          correction for not more than two and one-half\n          years.\n\n                                -8-\n\f            It is well established in our precedent -- and the\n\nparties do not disagree -- that Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, § 16\n\nincludes conduct that constitutes a crime of violence as well as\nconduct that does not.          See United States v. Dueno, 171 F.3d 3, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (holding that § 16 \"encompasses conduct that\n\nconstitutes a crime of violence (i.e., breaking into and entering\na   person's    home,    see U.S.S.G.      §   4B1.2(a)(2)     ('burglary    of   a\n\ndwelling'      is   a   crime   of   violence)),    and    conduct   that   almost\n\ncertainly      does     not     (i.e.,   breaking    into     and    entering     a\n\nvehicle . . .)\"); Harris, 964 F.2d at 1235 (reading § 16 in similar\n\nfashion in context of \"violent felony\").                  Because the statutory\n\ndefinition does not resolve the question of whether the conviction\n\nwas for a crime of violence, the sentencing court had to look\nelsewhere, beyond the statute, in accordance with the approach set\n\nforth in Taylor and our subsequent precedent.                   Based upon the\n\noriginal complaint containing the charge of Home Invasion in\nviolation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, § 18C, and the police report\n\nunderlying the April 1999 conviction, the district court concluded\nat the sentencing hearing, pursuant to the preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard,7 that Delgado pled guilty to breaking into and\n\nentering a dwelling, and therefore that the April 1999 conviction\n\n\n\n\n      7\n         The \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard generally\napplies when a court must make factual determinations which control\nwhether a defendant qualifies for an enhancement under the career\noffender guidelines.     See Shepard, 231 F.3d at 68; U.S.S.G.\n§ 4B1.1.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fwas for a crime of violence under § 4B1.1.   The court specifically\n\nstated:\n\n          And it is my determination that the amendment\n          to a breaking and entering in the nighttime\n          with intent to commit a felony must be\n          interpreted in the - by looking at the entire\n          picture, including the original criminal\n          complaint in which this defendant was charged\n          with knowingly entering and remaining in the\n          dwelling place of another.         And I have\n          considered the police report. It may not be\n          entirely reliable in all of its aspects. But\n          with respect to where the crime was committed,\n          I think it is entirely reliable, and I believe\n          that the statements that are made in that\n          report lead me to believe that the conviction\n          of which Mr. Delgado - or to which Mr. Delgado\n          pled guilty was a crime of violence, therefore,\n          a second predicate, and he will be determined\n          to be a career offender under the guideline\n          provisions.\n\nDelgado argues that it was error for the district court to rely on\nthese documents -- namely, the original complaint and the police\n\nreport -- in determining whether the April 1999 conviction was a\n\ncrime of violence.\n          The original complaint alleging Home Invasion states that\n\n          on 12/05/98, [Delgado] did knowingly enter, or\n          enter and remain in, the dwelling place of\n          another, knowing or having reason to know that\n          one or more persons were present within and:\n          (1) did so while armed with a dangerous weapon,\n          or (2) did use force or threaten the imminent\n          use of force upon a person within such dwelling\n          . . . .\n\nBecause the amended charge to which Delgado pled guilty supercedes\n\nthe   original   complaint,   we   have   reservations   about   the\n\nappropriateness of the trial court giving the original complaint\n\nany further consideration in determining the meaning of Delgado's\n\nplea on the crime of violence issue.   We do not have to decide that\n\n                               -10-\n\fissue, however.     Even assuming that the district court's reliance\n\non the original complaint was improper, such error was harmless\n\nbecause the police report alone was sufficient to justify the\ndistrict court's ruling that the defendant had pled guilty to a\n\ncrime of violence.\n\n            The   \"crime    of   violence\"   determination    required   the\ndistrict court to focus on a simple question framed by the breaking\n\nand entering charge to which Delgado pled guilty under Mass. Gen.\n\nL. ch. 266, § 16.      Section 16 criminalizes, inter alia, breaking\n\nand entering \"a building, ship, vessel or vehicle, with intent to\n\ncommit a felony.\"          Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, § 16.            Given the\n\ninclusion of \"burglary of a dwelling\" as a crime of violence under\n\n§ 4B1.2, the court only had to decide if the government had\npresented sufficiently reliable evidence to permit it to conclude,\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence, that Delgado's plea to the § 16\n\ncharge   constituted    an    admission     to   breaking   and   entering   a\ndwelling, instead of a \"ship, vessel or vehicle.\"           Id.

Cartagena [said] that she was\n            babysitting for her sister a[n] Esmeralda\n            Cartagena at the address of 16 Temple Street.\n            Cartagena stated that . . . while she was in\n            the apartment babysitting she received a phone\n            call and once she picked up the phone who ever\n            was on the other end hung up the phone. . . .\n            Cartagena then went into one of the bedrooms\n\n                                     -11-\n\f           and while in the bedroom she heard the front\n           door open she proceeded to the front door and\n           once she entered the living room all of a\n           sudden a cloth was put over her face and\n           someone grabbed Cartagena and told her not to\n           yell or they [would] hurt her. . . .\n           Car[t]agena then observed the suspect #2\n           proceed to where the kitchen was and suspect #3\n           go into the bedroom where the children were,\n           su[s]pect #1 stayed with Cartagena holding her\n           and after approximately a minute or two suspect\n           #1 placed Cartagena into the bathroom and shut\n           the door on her while still holding the\n           bathroom door shut. Cartagena then heard the\n           suspects leave the [apartment] and she ran out\n           of the bathroom and proceeded to the window.\n           Cartagena then observed a grey [motor vehicle]\n           leaving the front of the house of 16 Temple St.\n\nFocusing   on   the   narrow   issue   before   it,   the   district   court\n\nsensibly observed that the police report \"may not be entirely\nreliable in all of its aspects,\" but \"is entirely reliable\" as to\n\n\"where the crime was committed.\" The court thus concluded that the\n\ncrime \"to which Mr. Delgado pled guilty was a crime of violence.\"\n           Other than a general objection to reliance on the police\n\nreport, Delgado offered nothing about the circumstances of the\n\nplea hearing or the creation of the police report to challenge the\n\nsentencing court's conclusion that Delgado and the government both\n\nbelieved that he was entering a guilty plea to the \"generically\n\nviolent crime\" of breaking and entering a dwelling.8           Harris, 964\n\n     8\n       To dispel any inference that the building that is the object\nof the breaking and entering must be a dwelling to qualify as a\n\"crime of violence\" under the career offender guidelines, we note\nthat, while § 4B1.2(a)(2) explicitly enumerates \"burglary of a\ndwelling\" as a sample offense in defining the term \"crime of\nviolence,\" we have held that breaking and entering a commercial\nbuilding also constitutes a crime of violence under the \"otherwise\"\nclause of § 4B1.2(a)(2). See United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1,\n4 (1st Cir. 1992) (because \"burglary of a commercial building poses\na potential for episodic violence so substantial as to bring such\n\n                                   -12-\n\fF.2d at 1236.             In the absence of such a proffer, we conclude that\n\nthere was no clear error in the district court's finding that, by\n\na preponderance of the evidence, Delgado pled guilty to the\namended charge of breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to\n\ncommit a felony.               See Damon, 127 F.3d at 141 (holding that\n\n\"factual conclusions of sentencing court, which must be supported\nby    a    preponderance        of   the   evidence,    are   reviewed    for    clear\n\nerror\").\n\n                 Delgado gains nothing by arguing that the district court\n\ncould not rely on an uncertified copy of the police report.\n\nWithout minimizing the value of providing certified copies of\n\npolice reports at a sentencing hearing, we note first that Delgado\n\ndid       not    object     specifically    to    the   court's   reliance      on   an\nuncertified document.                Moreover, certifying a copy of a police\n\nreport simply attests that the report is a true and accurate copy\n\nof the original.              Delgado never challenged the accuracy of the\ncopy included in the Pre-Sentence Report, either in the district\n\ncourt or on appeal.\n\n                 Finally, to the extent that Delgado challenges the\n\npolice report on hearsay grounds, we reject that argument out of\n\nhand.           It   is    well-established      that   a   sentencing   court   \"may\n\nconsider relevant information without regard to its admissibility\n\nunder the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the\n\n\n\nburglaries within the violent felony/crime of violence ambit,\"\nstate court conviction for conspiracy to commit breaking and\nentering of commercial building comprises \"crime of violence\"); see\nalso United States v. Sawyer, 144 F.3d 191, 195-96 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                           -13-\n\finformation has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its\n\nprobable accuracy.\"         U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3.

However, Delgado explicitly conceded in his plea\nagreement that there were no grounds for a departure: \"Defendant\n\nagree[s]    that    there    is   no   basis   for    a    departure    from   the\nsentencing range established by the United States Sentencing\nGuidelines.        Accordingly, . . . Defendant will [not] seek a\n\ndeparture on any ground from the Sentencing Guidelines here.\"\nThus, Delgado has waived his claim for a departure.\n            Even in the absence of waiver, Delgado's failure to\n\npresent     this   claim     below     constitutes    a    procedural     default\ncurtailing appellate review.           See United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d\n\n611, 620 n.6 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"It is settled that, in respect to\n\ncriminal sentencing, as in other contexts, arguments not squarely\npresented to the sentencing court cannot debut as of right in an\nappellate    venue.\").        Thus,    we   decline   to   consider     Delgado's\n\ndeparture claim.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n                     - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n                                        -14-\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge (concurring).

On August 24, 1999, Delgado, with two other co-defendants, again sold cocaine base to that DEA agent. On December 8, 1999, Delgado and nine others were charged in a multi-count drug trafficking indictment. Delgado was indicted on one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and two counts of cocaine base distribution and aiding and abetting that distribution, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Delgado pled guilty to these charges on September 6, 2000. At sentencing, the court concluded, over Delgado's objection, that he was a career offender and that, under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, his base offense level was 32, and his criminal history category was VI. Awarding Delgado a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the district court calculated his final adjusted offense level at 29. The applicable sentencing range for a level 29 category VI offender was 151 to 188 months. The district court accordingly sentenced Delgado, <i>inter alia,</i> to 151 months' imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining Delgado's career offender status under &#167; 4B1.1, the district court concluded that Delgado's criminal history included two prior convictions for crimes of violence, thus warranting an increase in the offense level for the instant offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On February 10, 1999, Delgado was convicted in state court of assault with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery on a police officer, and disorderly conduct, and sentenced to ninety days in prison. On April 1, 1999, Delgado pled guilty to the charge of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. The effect of this latter conviction on Delgado's federal sentence was hotly disputed by the parties at sentencing and now constitutes the core issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, provides for an enhanced sentence if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the offense for which he is being sentenced; (2) that offense is a felony that either constitutes a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or crimes involving controlled substances. For application of the career offender provisions, the sentencing guidelines define \"crime of violence\" to encompass certain federal and state offenses punishable by more than a year in prison, including \"burglary of a dwelling.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Delgado &#8212; who was 23 years old at the time of the instant controlled substance offense &#8212; clearly satisfies the first two criteria under &#167; 4B1.1. Furthermore, Delgado concedes that his February 1999 conviction constitutes a crime of violence and thus qualifies as a predicate offense under &#167; 4B1.1. Delgado argues, however, that the breaking-and-entering offense to which he pled guilty in April 1999 does not constitute a crime of violence under &#167; 4B1.1, and hence he is not a career offender within the meaning of the guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The <i>Taylor</i> Categorical Approach</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether Delgado's April 1999 conviction constitutes a crime of violence, we follow the categorical approach outlined in <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and subsequent First Circuit precedent. While questions of law concerning interpretation of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo, the factual conclusions of the sentencing court, which must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, are reviewed for clear error. <i>See United States v. Damon,</i> 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Grant,</i> 114 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the <i>Taylor</i> approach, a sentencing court should \"look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense\" to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i> at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <i>see also</i> <i>United States v. Meader,</i> 118 F.3d 876, 882 (1st Cir.1997) (deciding whether a crime is a \"crime of violence\" is an inquiry \"restricted to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses without regard to the particular facts underlying them\"); <i>United States v.

Where the statutory definition encompasses both violent and non-violent offenses, a sentencing court may look to the charging document &#8212; such as the indictment or information &#8212; and jury instructions to ascertain whether the conviction was for a violent or non-violent crime. <i>See Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <i>United States v. Shepard,</i> 231 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v.

Thus, the issue before the sentencing court is not what the defendant \"did to provoke the criminal charges to which he pled guilty.\" <i>Shepard,</i> 231 F.3d at 69. Rather, what is critical is \"the meaning of the defendant's guilty plea\" &#8212; that is, whether the defendant's guilty plea \"constitute[s] an admission\" to a crime of violence under \"the preponderance of the evidence\" standard. <i>Id.</i> at 66, 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discerning the plea's meaning, the court may rely on \"sufficiently reliable evidence independent of a fact-specific admission.\" <i>Id.</i> at 66.

Gen. L. ch. 265, &#167; 18C. However, the Fitchburg District Court amended the charge of Home Invasion to Breaking and Entering in the Night Time with Intent to Commit a Felony. Delgado pled guilty to that amended charge in April 1999.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established in our precedent &#8212; and the parties do not disagree &#8212; that Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, &#167; 16 includes conduct that constitutes a crime of violence as well as conduct that does not. <i>See United States v. Dueno,</i> 171 F.3d 3, 5 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that &#167; 16 \"encompasses conduct that constitutes a crime of violence (i.e., breaking into and entering a person's home, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)(2) (`burglary of a dwelling' is a crime of violence)), and conduct that almost certainly does not (i.e., breaking into and entering a vehicle...)\"); <i>Harris,</i> 964 F.2d at 1235 (reading &#167; 16 in similar fashion in context of \"violent felony\"). Because the statutory definition does not resolve the question of whether the conviction was for a crime of violence, the sentencing court had to look elsewhere, beyond the statute, in accordance with the approach set forth in <i>Taylor</i> and our subsequent precedent. Based upon the original complaint containing the charge of Home Invasion in violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, &#167; 18C, and the police report underlying the April 1999 conviction, the district court concluded at the sentencing hearing, pursuant to the preponderance of the evidence standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> that Delgado pled guilty to breaking into and entering a dwelling, and therefore that the April 1999 conviction was for a crime of violence under &#167; 4B1.1. The court specifically stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And it is my determination that the amendment to a breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony must be interpreted in the &#8212; by looking at the entire picture, including the original criminal complaint in which this defendant was charged with knowingly entering and remaining in the dwelling place of another. And I have considered the police report. It may not be entirely reliable in all of its aspects. But with respect to where the crime was committed, I think it is entirely reliable, and I believe that the statements that are made in that report lead me to believe that the conviction of which Mr. Delgado &#8212; or to which Mr. Delgado pled guilty was a crime of violence, therefore, a second predicate, and he will be determined to be a career offender under the guideline provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado argues that it was error for the district court to rely on these documents &#8212; namely, the original complaint and the police report &#8212; in determining whether the April 1999 conviction was a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original complaint alleging Home Invasion states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">on 12/05/98, [Delgado] did knowingly enter, or enter and remain in, the dwelling place of another, knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons were present within and: (1) did so while armed with a dangerous weapon, or (2) did use force or threaten the imminent use of force upon a person within such dwelling....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the amended charge to which Delgado pled guilty supercedes the original complaint, we have reservations about the appropriateness of the trial court giving the original complaint any further consideration in determining the meaning of Delgado's plea on the crime of violence issue. We do not have to decide that issue, however. Even assuming that the district court's reliance on the original complaint was improper, such error was harmless because the police report alone was sufficient to justify the district court's ruling that the defendant had pled guilty to a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"crime of violence\" determination required the district court to focus on a simple question framed by the breaking and entering charge to which Delgado pled guilty under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, &#167; 16. Section 16 criminalizes, <i>inter alia,</i> breaking and entering \"a building, ship, vessel or vehicle, with intent to commit a felony.\" Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, &#167; 16. Given the inclusion of \"burglary of a dwelling\" as a crime of violence under &#167; 4B1.2, the court only had to decide if the government had presented sufficiently reliable evidence to permit it to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Delgado's plea to the &#167; 16 charge constituted an admission to breaking and entering a dwelling, instead of a \"ship, vessel or vehicle.\" <i>Id.</i> The police report, appended to the Pre-Sentence Report, includes numerous references to a dwelling and the details characteristic of a dwelling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 12/05/98, ...

In the absence of such a proffer, we conclude that there was no clear error in the district court's finding that, by a preponderance of the evidence, Delgado pled guilty to the amended charge of breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a felony. <i>See Damon,</i> 127 F.3d at 141 (holding that \"factual conclusions of sentencing court, which must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, are reviewed for clear error\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado gains nothing by arguing that the district court could not rely on an uncertified copy of the police report.

Furthermore, the sentence imposed, two years in a house of correction, is consistent with the penalty provisions of that offense.

Were we writing on a pristine page, I would hold particularized inquiry of the type and kind approved in the majority opinion (inquiry which ranges well past the charging papers, jury instructions, and other formal accouterments of the predicate offense to a copy of a police report compiled by an investigating officer) to be beyond the limits contemplated by the <i>Taylor</i> Court.

On August 24, 1999, Delgado, with two other co-defendants, again sold cocaine base to that DEA agent. On December 8, 1999, Delgado and nine others were charged in a multi-count drug trafficking indictment. Delgado was indicted on one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and two counts of cocaine base distribution and aiding and abetting that distribution, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Delgado pled guilty to these charges on September 6, 2000. At sentencing, the court concluded, over Delgado's objection, that he was a career offender and that, under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, his base offense level was 32, and his criminal history category was VI. Awarding Delgado a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the district court calculated his final adjusted offense level at 29. The applicable sentencing range for a level 29 category VI offender was 151 to 188 months. The district court accordingly sentenced Delgado, <i>inter alia,</i> to 151 months' imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining Delgado's career offender status under &#167; 4B1.1, the district court concluded that Delgado's criminal history included two prior convictions for crimes of violence, thus warranting an increase in the offense level for the instant offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On February 10, 1999, Delgado was convicted in state court of assault with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery on a police officer, and disorderly conduct, and sentenced to ninety days in prison. On April 1, 1999, Delgado pled guilty to the charge of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. The effect of this latter conviction on Delgado's federal sentence was hotly disputed by the parties at sentencing and now constitutes the core issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, provides for an enhanced sentence if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the offense for which he is being sentenced; (2) that offense is a felony that either constitutes a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or crimes involving controlled substances. For application of the career offender provisions, the sentencing guidelines define \"crime of violence\" to encompass certain federal and state offenses punishable by more than a year in prison, including \"burglary of a dwelling.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Delgado &#8212; who was 23 years old at the time of the instant controlled substance offense &#8212; clearly satisfies the first two criteria under &#167; 4B1.1. Furthermore, Delgado concedes that his February 1999 conviction constitutes a crime of violence and thus qualifies as a predicate offense under &#167; 4B1.1. Delgado argues, however, that the breaking-and-entering offense to which he pled guilty in April 1999 does not constitute a crime of violence under &#167; 4B1.1, and hence he is not a career offender within the meaning of the guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Gen. L. ch. 265, &#167; 18C. However, the Fitchburg District Court amended the charge of Home Invasion to Breaking and Entering in the Night Time with Intent to Commit a Felony. Delgado pled guilty to that amended charge in April 1999.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established in our precedent &#8212; and the parties do not disagree &#8212; that Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, &#167; 16 includes conduct that constitutes a crime of violence as well as conduct that does not. <i>See United States v.

Because the statutory definition does not resolve the question of whether the conviction was for a crime of violence, the sentencing court had to look elsewhere, beyond the statute, in accordance with the approach set forth in <i>Taylor</i> and our subsequent precedent. Based upon the original complaint containing the charge of Home Invasion in violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, &#167; 18C, and the police report underlying the April 1999 conviction, the district court concluded at the sentencing hearing, pursuant to the preponderance of the evidence standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> that Delgado pled guilty to breaking into and entering a dwelling, and therefore that the April 1999 conviction was for a crime of violence under &#167; 4B1.1.

And I have considered the police report. It may not be entirely reliable in all of its aspects. But with respect to where the crime was committed, I think it is entirely reliable, and I believe that the statements that are made in that report lead me to believe that the conviction of which Mr. Delgado &#8212; or to which Mr. Delgado pled guilty was a crime of violence, therefore, a second predicate, and he will be determined to be a career offender under the guideline provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado argues that it was error for the district court to rely on these documents &#8212; namely, the original complaint and the police report &#8212; in determining whether the April 1999 conviction was a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original complaint alleging Home Invasion states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">on 12/05/98, [Delgado] did knowingly enter, or enter and remain in, the dwelling place of another, knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons were present within and: (1) did so while armed with a dangerous weapon, or (2) did use force or threaten the imminent use of force upon a person within such dwelling....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the amended charge to which Delgado pled guilty supercedes the original complaint, we have reservations about the appropriateness of the trial court giving the original complaint any further consideration in determining the meaning of Delgado's plea on the crime of violence issue. We do not have to decide that issue, however. Even assuming that the district court's reliance on the original complaint was improper, such error was harmless because the police report alone was sufficient to justify the district court's ruling that the defendant had pled guilty to a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"crime of violence\" determination required the district court to focus on a simple question framed by the breaking and entering charge to which Delgado pled guilty under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, &#167; 16. Section 16 criminalizes, <i>inter alia,</i> breaking and entering \"a building, ship, vessel or vehicle, with intent to commit a felony.\" Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, &#167; 16. Given the inclusion of \"burglary of a dwelling\" as a crime of violence under &#167; 4B1.2, the court only had to decide if the government had presented sufficiently reliable evidence to permit it to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Delgado's plea to the &#167; 16 charge constituted an admission to breaking and entering a dwelling, instead of a \"ship, vessel or vehicle.\" <i>Id.</i> The police report, appended to the Pre-Sentence Report, includes numerous references to a dwelling and the details characteristic of a dwelling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 12/05/98, ...

Cartagena [said] that she was babysitting for her sister a[n] Esmeralda Cartagena at the address of 16 Temple Street. Cartagena stated that ... while she was in the apartment babysitting she received a phone call and once she picked up the phone who ever was on the other end hung up the phone.... Cartagena then went into one of the bedrooms and while in the bedroom she heard the front door open she proceeded to the front door and once she entered the living room all of a sudden a cloth was put over her face and someone grabbed Cartagena and told her not to yell or they [would] hurt her.... Car[t]agena then observed the suspect # 2 proceed to where the kitchen was and suspect # 3 go into the bedroom where the children were, su[s]pect # 1 stayed with Cartagena holding her and after approximately a minute or two suspect # 1 placed Cartagena into the bathroom and shut the door on her while still holding the bathroom door shut. Cartagena then heard the suspects leave the [apartment] and she ran out of the bathroom and proceeded to the window. Cartagena then observed a grey [motor vehicle] leaving the front of the house of 16 Temple St.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Focusing on the narrow issue before it, the district court sensibly observed that the police report \"may not be entirely reliable in all of its aspects,\" but \"is entirely reliable\" as to \"where the crime was committed.\" The court thus concluded that the crime \"to which Mr. Delgado pled guilty was a crime of violence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other than a general objection to reliance on the police report, Delgado offered nothing about the circumstances of the plea hearing or the creation of the police report to challenge the sentencing court's conclusion that Delgado and the government both believed that he was entering a guilty plea to the \"generically violent crime\" of breaking and entering a dwelling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Harris,</i> 964 F.2d at 1236. In the absence of such a proffer, we conclude that there was no clear error in the district court's finding that, by a preponderance of the evidence, Delgado pled guilty to the amended charge of breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a felony. <i>See Damon,</i> 127 F.3d at 141 (holding that \"factual conclusions of sentencing court, which must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, are reviewed for clear error\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Delgado gains nothing by arguing that the district court could not rely on an uncertified copy of the police report. Without minimizing the value of providing certified copies of police reports at a sentencing hearing, we note first that Delgado did not object specifically to the court's reliance on an uncertified document. Moreover, certifying a copy of a police report simply attests that the report is a true and accurate copy of the original. Delgado never challenged the accuracy of the copy included in the Pre-Sentence Report, either in the district court or on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent that Delgado challenges the police report on hearsay grounds, we reject that argument out of hand.
