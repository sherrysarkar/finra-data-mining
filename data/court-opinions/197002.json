Petitioner Walter Johnson filed the instant\r                           \r\n\npetition for  a writ  of habeas corpus  in 1993,  complaining\r\n\nprimarily  of  delay attending  the  progress  of his  direct\r\n\ncriminal appeal in  state court.   In response, the  district\r\n\ncourt issued a conditional writ directing respondent (a state\r\n\nofficial)  to undertake  efforts  to get  the appeal  back on\r\n\ntrack.   These  measures proved  successful: new  counsel was\r\n\nappointed  and  the  Massachusetts  Appeals Court  agreed  to\r\n\nreinstate the appeal.   Once oral argument in the  appeal was\r\n\nheld,  the district  court  dismissed the  petition as  moot.\r\n\nSubsequently,   the   Appeals   Court  vacated   petitioner's\r\n\nconviction, and the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) accepted the\r\n\ncase for further review. \r\n\n     To the extent we  can decipher petitioner's arguments on\r\n\nappeal,  he  apparently  contends  that the  delay  here  was\r\n\nsufficiently  protracted  so as  to  compel  reversal of  his\r\n\nconviction and to necessitate his unconditional release  from\r\n\ncustody.  We disagree.   \"Whether an appellate delay  results\r\n\nin  prejudice sufficient  to warrant  reversing  a conviction\r\n\nrests,  most importantly, on  a showing that  it has impaired\r\n\nthe appeal or the  defense in the event of  retrial.\"  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.
