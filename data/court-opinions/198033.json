Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Darryl Whiting on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, Thomas C. Frongilloand Kevin J. Cloherty, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nJune 26, 1998\r\n\n  Per Curiam.  Petitioner Darryl Whiting, having been\r\nconvicted of numerous drug-related offenses, see United Statesv. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296 (1st Cir. 1994), appeals from the\r\ndismissal of his 28 U.S.C.  2255 petition for habeas relief. \r\nHe there advanced ten claims of ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel, all of which the district court dismissed in a\r\ncomprehensive pair of decisions.  Petitioner pursues these same\r\nclaims on appeal, along with a trio of other allegations. \r\nExcept as to one minor matter, we affirm the judgment in all\r\nrespects. \r\n                              I.\r\n    With regard to the ineffective-assistance claims, we\r\nagree, substantially for the reasons recited by the district\r\ncourt, that petitioner has failed to establish that counsel's\r\nconduct was deficient.  We likewise think he has failed to\r\nestablish that any such deficiency prejudiced his defense. \r\nLittle need exists to augment the district court's discussion. \r\nWe add the following comments primarily for emphasis.\r\n    1.  Petitioner's first three complaints--that counsel\r\nfailed to interview potential witnesses, failed to seek a\r\nseverance in order to secure testimony from the codefendants at\r\ntrial, and otherwise failed to reasonably present petitioner's\r\ndefense--rely on a series of affidavits submitted by eight of\r\nhis codefendants.  Yet as the district court properly found,\r\nthose submissions are devoid of admissible evidence and are\r\ndeserving of little if any weight.  Apart from such affidavits,\r\npetitioner never elaborated on what the prospective testimony\r\nfrom these individuals would have been.  Moreover, because of\r\nthe involvement of such persons in the drug operation, counsel\r\nreasonably could have thought that the risk of impeachment was\r\ninordinate.  He reasonably could have concluded that a motion\r\nfor severance would have been futile.  And a line of defense\r\nthat counsel allegedly ignored was in fact introduced, albeit\r\nnot in the manner apparently preferred by petitioner.  The\r\nstrategic decisions made by counsel in these various respects\r\ncannot be deemed deficient performance.\r\n    2.  Petitioner's second trio of claims all involve the\r\nadmission of coconspirator statements.  Each proves unavailing. \r\nHis allegation of governmental misconduct in this regard is\r\nunsupported.  Contrary to his initial suggestion, the court did\r\nmake a Petrozziello ruling.  And no Bruton problem arose,\r\ninasmuch as the statements fell within the coconspirator\r\nexception to the hearsay rule.  See, e.g., Bourjaily v. United\r\nStates, 483 U.S. 171, 182 (1987); United States v. Saccoccia,\r\n58 F.3d 754, 779 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105\r\n(1996).  \r\n    3.  Petitioner next advances a pair of claims involving\r\nthe calculation of drug quantity for purposes of sentencing--a\r\nmatter addressed by this court at some length on direct appeal. \r\nSee Whiting, 28 F.3d at 1304-06.  He first asserts that counsel\r\nwas derelict in failing to request an evidentiary hearing on\r\nthe matter.  Yet substantial evidence had already been adduced,\r\nthe matter was vigorously contested at sentencing, and counsel\r\nmight reasonably have thought that any evidentiary shortfall\r\nwould work in his client's favor.  Nor has petitioner explained\r\nhow a hearing might have altered the sentencing determination. \r\nHis effort on appeal to identify new evidence that could have\r\nbeen adduced is spirited but unpersuasive; moreover, the\r\ngovernment was prepared to (and twice proposed to) put on\r\nadditional evidence of its own.  Petitioner's second claim--\r\nthat counsel failed to argue on appeal that the calculation of\r\ndrug quantity was based on a \"misconception\" of the evidence--\r\nalso fails.  No appreciable difference appears between such an\r\nargument and the sentencing challenges that were actually\r\nraised on appeal.\r\n    4.  Petitioner also complains of counsel's failure to\r\npursue a second argument on appeal: that the jury selection\r\nprocess resulted in the deliberate exclusion of blacks.  The\r\nidentical claim was rejected in the recent habeas appeals\r\nbrought by petitioner's codefendants.  See Pledger v. United\r\nStates, 1998 WL 88515, at *5 (1st Cir. 1998) (per curiam).  No\r\nreason exists to reach a different result here; petitioner has\r\nfailed to identify a colorable claim in this regard, and\r\ncounsel thus cannot be faulted for eschewing it.\r\n    5.  Petitioner's remaining ineffective-assistance claim,\r\nwhich accuses counsel of a conflict of interest because of his\r\nsubsequent professional association with the lead prosecutor,\r\nhas been effectively abandoned on appeal.  \r\n                             II.\r\n   One other matter remains.  While the habeas action was\r\npending, petitioner submitted a motion for return of property\r\nthat he alleged had been unlawfully seized and forfeited.  The\r\nclerk's office, it appears, filed the motion in the habeas\r\ncase; the district court understandably dismissed the motion\r\nwithout prejudice on the ground that it was not cognizable in\r\na habeas proceeding.  Petitioner replied that he had intended\r\nthe motion as an independent action--an argument he has\r\nreiterated on appeal.  The record so reflects: the motion bore\r\na different caption than his earlier habeas pleadings; unlike\r\nthose earlier pleadings, it contained no docket number; and it\r\nspecifically cited Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(e).\r\n   We have held that \"district courts have jurisdiction to\r\nentertain collateral due process attacks on administrative\r\nforfeitures,\" and that \"such challenges may be pursued in a\r\ncivil action under 28 U.S.C.  1331.\"  United States v.\r\nGiraldo, 45 F.3d 509, 511 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam). \r\nMoreover, \"[w]here criminal proceedings against the movant have\r\nalready been completed, a district court should treat a rule\r\n41(e) motion as a civil complaint.\"  Onwubiko v. United States,\r\n969 F.2d 1392, 1397 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoted in Giraldo, 45 F.3d\r\nat 511).  This is especially so where the movant appears pro\r\nse.  See, e.g., United States v. Mosquera, 845 F.2d 1122, 1126\r\n(1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam).  Accordingly, we think it\r\nappropriate to remand this single issue to the district court\r\nfor further proceedings.  We of course express no views as to\r\nwhether the claim has any potential merit, or whether it might\r\nbe subject to dismissal on some other ground.  \r\n    The dismissal of the motion for return of property is\r\nvacated and that claim remanded to the district court for\r\nfurther proceedings.  The judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n",
