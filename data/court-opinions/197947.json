PAPATONES,\r\n\n                      Debtor,\r\n\n              EDWARD ELLIOTT, ET AL.,\r\n\n                    Appellees,\r\n\n                        v.\r\n\n                JAMES N. PAPATONES,\r\n\n                    Appellant.\r\n\nAPPEAL FROM JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL\r\n\n               FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\r\n\n                      Before\r\n\n              Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n      Bownes and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJames F. Molleur, with whom Woodman &amp; Edmands, P.A. was on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\nRobert M. Raftice, Jr., with whom Ainsworth &amp; Thelin, P.A., was on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\n                  May 13, 1998\r\n                                             CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.  The question before us is\r\nwhether the \"liquidated\" unsecured indebtedness owed by appellant\r\nJames N. Papatones on the date he filed his chapter 13 petition\r\ntotaled less than $250,000, a prerequisite to eligibility for\r\nchapter 13 relief.  See Bankruptcy Code  109(e), 11 U.S.C. \r\n109(e).  The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of\r\nMaine and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the First Circuit\r\nresponded in the negative.\r\nWe conclude that Papatones was ineligible for chapter 13\r\nrelief because the amount in which he was indebted to appellee\r\nEdward Elliott on the date of the filing of the chapter 13 petition\r\nhad been adjudicated  at $276,606.87  by a court of competent\r\njurisdiction prior to the chapter 13 petition and neither the\r\nprepetition adjudication itself nor the postpetition docketing of\r\nthe judgment against Papatones violated the automatic stay which\r\ntook effect immediately upon the filing of the chapter 13 petition. \r\nSee Bankruptcy Code  362(a)(1), 11 U.S.C.  362(a)(1).\r\n\n                      I\r\n                  BACKGROUND\r\n\nFollowing an evidentiary hearing on December 9, 1996, a\r\nMaine superior court justice found Papatones liable to Elliott for\r\nbreach of trust.  Prior to the conclusion of the hearing, the\r\npresiding justice announced that a money judgment would enter\r\nagainst Papatones in the amount of $276,606.87.  Later in the day,\r\nPapatones filed a chapter 13 petition with the United States\r\nBankruptcy Court for the District of Maine, whereupon the superior\r\ncourt proceedings were stayed pursuant to Bankruptcy Code \r\n362(a)(1).\r\n                      II\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\n\nPapatones insists that he is eligible for chapter 13\r\nrelief notwithstanding the $249,999.99 ceiling on liquidated,\r\nunsecured indebtedness because the Elliott debt remained unliqui\r\ndated at the time the chapter 13 petition was filed.  Elliott\r\ndemurs on the ground that he was awarded $276,606.87 in damages\r\nprior to the chapter 13 petition.  Papatones responds that the\r\nElliott indebtedness did not become \"liquidated\" before the chapter\r\n13 petition was filed at 2:55 p.m. on December 9 because the\r\npresiding justice remained free to reconsider his ore tenus ruling\r\nat least until the judgment was docketed by the superior court\r\nclerk on December 10, one day after the automatic stay took\r\neffect.\r\n\nSince the amount owed Elliott had been adjudicated \"to\r\nthe penny\" prior to the chapter 13 petition, yet the $276,606.87\r\njudgment was docketed after the chapter 13 petition, we will\r\nassume, without deciding, that the Papatones debt did not become\r\n\"liquidated\" until the superior court judgment was docketed.  The\r\nremaining inquiry, then, is whether the postpetition docketing of\r\nthe judgment violated the automatic stay.\r\nAs recently explained, section 362(a)(1) does not stay\r\nacts that are \"essentially clerical in nature,\" as for example \"when\r\nan official's duty is delineated by, say, a law or a judicial\r\ndecree with such crystalline clarity that nothing is left to the\r\nexercise of the official's discretion or judgment. . . .\"  Soaresv. Brockton Credit Union (In re Soares), 107 F.3d 969, 974 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  See also Rexnord Holdings, Inc. v. Bidermann, 21 F.3d\r\n522, 527 (2d Cir. 1994); Savers Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. McCarthy\r\nConstr. Co. (In re Knightsbridge Dev. Co.), 884 F.2d 145, 148 (4th\r\nCir. 1989).  As Me. R. Civ. P. 58 makes crystal clear, the\r\nsuperior court justice's prepetition adjudication and direction for\r\nentry of a money judgment left nothing to the discretion or\r\njudgment of the superior court clerk.  See, e.g., York Mut. Ins.\r\nCo. of Maine v. Mooers, 415 A.2d 564, 566 (Me. 1980) (per curiam). \r\nTherefore, even though the oral direction for entry of judgment was\r\nnot reduced to writing until the next day, neither that clerical\r\nact nor the mere ministerial notation of the judgment on the docket\r\ncontravened the automatic stay.\r\n\n                     III\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\n\nAs the mere docketing of the Elliott judgment did not\r\nviolate the automatic stay, see In re Soares, 107 F.3d at 973-74,\r\nand it is conceded that an unsecured debt becomes \"liquidated\" in\r\namount once reduced to judgment, see supra note 3, the $276,606.87\r\nunsecured, liquidated debt owed Elliott on the date of the filing\r\nof the chapter 13 petition rendered Papatones ineligible for\r\nchapter 13 relief as provided in Bankruptcy Code  109(e).\r\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Bankruptcy Appellate\r\nPanel for the First Circuit is affirmed.  Appellant shall bear all\r\ncosts.  SO ORDERED.\n",
