Objecting to his portrayal in\n\nJonathan Harr's best-selling book A Civil Action, an account of\n\ntoxic tort litigation over contaminated well water in Woburn,\n\nMassachusetts, that allegedly caused the death of several children,\n\nJohn J. Riley, Jr., sued Harr and his publisher for defamation and\n\nrelated torts.      He was joined in that lawsuit by his wife, Diane W.\n\nRiley.      The    district     court   granted    summary    judgment    for   the\n\ndefendants    on    most   of    the    Rileys'   claims   on   First    Amendment\n\ngrounds.     The Rileys appeal the district court's disposition of\n\ntheir claims.       We affirm.\n\nI. Background\n\n             We begin with a brief overview of the events described in\nA Civil Action (the Book) that pertain to this case; the specific\n\nstatements to which Riley objects are discussed in turn infra, and\nare also set forth in an appendix to this opinion.1                      The Book,\nfirst published in 1995, was on the New York Times Bestseller List\n\nfor over two years and has been made into a motion picture.                     The\nBook received much critical acclaim and has been required reading\nin law school courses.          It purports to be a nonfictional account of\na toxic tort lawsuit (the \"Anderson litigation\") brought by some\n\nresidents    of    Woburn,      Massachusetts,     alleging     that    defendants\n\nBeatrice Foods Company (Beatrice), W.R. Grace & Company (Grace),\n\nand others were responsible for the contamination of two municipal\n\nwater wells (Wells G and H) in the Aberjona River Valley with toxic\n\n     1\n        For simplicity's sake, we generally denote the plaintiffs\ncollectively as \"Riley,\" and the defendants collectively as \"Harr.\"\n\n                                         -2-\n\fsolvents,   including   trichloroethylene   (TCE).2    The   Anderson\n\nplaintiffs claimed that contaminated well water had caused them and\n\ntheir children to contract various ailments, including several\nfatal cases of leukemia, and that some of the TCE found in Wells G\n\nand H had come from a tannery operated by Riley (the \"tannery\").\n\nBeatrice had assumed the tannery's environmental liabilities when\nit purchased the tannery in 1978.3    The plaintiffs' theory was that\n\nRiley or his subordinates had dumped TCE on a fifteen acre parcel\n\nof undeveloped land between the tannery and the contaminated wells\n\n(the \"fifteen acres\"), and that the TCE had migrated into Wells G\n\nand H.\n\n            The Book tells the story of the Anderson litigation\n\nprimarily from the perspective of the plaintiffs' attorney, Jan\nSchlichtmann, recounting his struggle to prove that Riley's tannery\n\nand defendant Grace were responsible for the contamination of Wells\n\nG and H.4    The Book describes evidence which, in Schlichtmann's\nview, tended to show that the tannery had dumped waste laced with\n\nTCE on the fifteen acres, and repeatedly suggests that Riley's\n\ndenials that such dumping had occurred were false.           Although\n\n\n     2\n       The case was originally captioned Anderson v.   Cryovac, C.A.\nNo. 82-1672-S (D. Mass).    For a fuller account of     the Anderson\nlitigation, see Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d    910 (1st Cir.\n1988); and Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d    388 (1st Cir.\n1990).\n     3\n       Until 1978, the Riley family had owned the tannery. Riley\ncontinued to operate the tannery after Beatrice purchased it, and\nresumed ownership of it in 1983.\n     4\n       Grace had operated a manufacturing facility in the vicinity\nof Wells G and H.\n\n                                -3-\n\fSchlichtmann is the Book's protagonist, and granted Harr extensive\n\naccess to his law firm during the litigation, Harr's account of his\n\nefforts is by no means uncritical.             As Schlichtmann builds his\ncase, Harr points out both its strengths and its weaknesses.                 Harr\n\nalso conducted extensive interviews with attorneys for the Anderson\n\ndefendants, and the Book recounts the grounds for their rejection\nof Schlichtmann's theories.        The Book also notes Schlichtmann's\n\nfailure to find direct proof of dumping by the tannery, Riley's\n\nsteadfast denials of Schlichtmann's allegations, the conflicting\n\nviews of experts on each side of the case, and the 1986 jury\n\nverdict in federal district court which rejected the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims against the tannery.5\n\n           After the trial was over, Schlichtmann discovered a\nreport    which    Yankee    Environmental     Engineering      and   Research\n\nServices, Inc. (Yankee) had completed for Riley in 1983.                      The\n\nreport stated that tannery waste had been dumped on a hillside\nleading to the fifteen acres, and that groundwater under the\n\ntannery flowed toward Wells G and H.               Schlichtmann moved to set\n\naside the verdict on the basis of this newly discovered evidence,\n\nwhich he argued should have been produced during discovery, and\n\ntracked down new witnesses who described the removal from the\n\nfifteen acres of what Schlichtmann believed to have been tannery\n\nwaste. The district court conducted a hearing and found that Riley\n\nhad   engaged     in   \"concealment\"    of   the    Yankee   report   that    was\n\n\n      5\n        The plaintiffs subsequently settled their claims against\ndefendant Grace.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f\"deliberate,\" a determination which the Book reports as follows:\n\n\"The judge found that Riley had committed perjury and that [his\n\nattorney] was guilty of 'deliberate misconduct' in failing to give\nSchlichtmann the Yankee report.\"        The court concluded, however,\n\nthat a new trial was not warranted because \"there was no available\n\ncompetent evidence tending to establish the disposal of complaint\nchemicals by the defendant . . . either at the tannery site or on\n\nthe 15 acres.\"    Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 129 F.R.D. 394, 400\n\n(D. Mass. 1989).6\n          Riley took exception to a number of statements about him\n\nin the Book.    In 1998 he commenced this action against Harr and his\n\npublishers, Random House, Inc. and Vintage Books (a division of\n\nRandom House), in New Hampshire Superior Court. Defendants removed\nthe case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of\n\ncitizenship.7       Riley's   amended   complaint   challenged   twelve\n\nstatements in the Book in seven counts: (I) intentional infliction\nof emotional distress; (II) slander (against Harr only); (III)\n\ndefamation; (IV) invasion of privacy -- public disclosure of\n\nprivate facts; (V) invasion of privacy -- placing the plaintiff in\n\na false light; (VI) loss of consortium; and (VII) a demand for\n\nenhanced compensatory damages.      Reduced to its essence, Riley's\n\n     6\n          Subsequent Environmental Protection Agency studies\nconcluded that Beatrice's land had contaminated Wells G and H, and\nBeatrice agreed to pay its share of cleanup costs. A Civil Action\nat 491.\n     7\n         Riley is a New Hampshire citizen while Harr is a\nMassachusetts citizen, and the three corporate entities all have\ntheir principal place of business in New York.     The amount in\ncontroversy exceeds $75,000 excluding costs and interest.\n\n                                  -5-\n\faction seeks to hold Harr liable for wrongly describing him as a\n\nliar (see Statements C, D, E, F, H, I, J, and K infra), a perjurer\n\n(see Statement A infra), a \"kille[r]\" (see Statement G infra), a\n\ndepressive (see Statement L infra) (or, in the alternative, for\n\ndisclosing the private fact of his depression), and a bully (see\n\nStatement B infra).\n\n          The defendants moved to dismiss Riley's complaint, or in\n\nthe alternative for summary judgment.           The district court treated\n\ntheir motion as one for summary judgment, and in a lengthy,\n\nthoughtful order dated March 31, 2000, granted the motion with\nrespect to most of Riley's claims.        The order denied Harr's motion\n\nfor summary judgment as to two of the twelve statements, and denied\nhis motion to dismiss Riley's slander claim.8            Following limited\ndiscovery,   the   parties   stipulated    on    March   26,   2001,   to   the\n\ndismissal of those claims that had survived the district court's\norder of March 31, 2000.     On April 25, 2001, Riley filed a notice\nof appeal of the district court's order.\n\n\n\n     8\n       Riley's slander claim relates to a speech Harr delivered in\nNewburyport, Massachusetts.    The district court indicated that\nHarr's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was\npremised on the assumption that the other counts against Harr would\nalso be dismissed.      The district court wrote that \"[n]either\nparty . . . has addressed the issue of jurisdiction under the\ncircumstances now prevailing: that is, where the court has not\ndismissed all of the causes of action regarding which Harr has not\ncontested personal jurisdiction\" (emphasis added).       The court\nexplained that \"[u]nder these circumstances, Harr's challenge to\npersonal jurisdiction with respect to [the slander count]\nimplicates the complex and unsettled doctrine of pendent personal\njurisdiction.\" The district court concluded that \"[b]ecause the\nparties have not briefed the issue it would be premature to\nconsider and resolve it at this juncture.\"\n\n                                   -6-\n\fII. Defamation\n\n            We first set out the general principles which guide our\n\ninquiry, and then turn to the challenged statements.\n\nA. General Principles\n\n            \"[T]he First Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nplace[s]     limits    on   the   application    of     the   state   law   of\n\ndefamation.\"9     Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 14\n(1990).     In the wake of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.\n\n254 (1964), the Supreme Court has developed an elaborate body of\n\nlaw that defines those limits.          In the case of a public-figure\nplaintiff the First Amendment requires clear and convincing proof\nof actual malice on the part of the defendant.10              Gertz v. Robert\n\nWelch, Inc.,     418   U.S.   323,   342-43   (1974).     A   private-figure\n\nplaintiff such as Riley need not demonstrate actual malice, but\n\"must bear the burden of showing that the speech at issue is false\n\n\n\n\n     9\n        In the district court, Riley argued that New Hampshire law\ngoverned his claims.     Harr's position was that New York law\ncontrolled, but he indicated that the court did not have to decide\nthis issue because \"New York and New Hampshire law are functionally\nequivalent\" on the relevant issues. The district court therefore\napplied New Hampshire law. See Independent Mechanical Contractors,\nInc. v. Gordon T. Burke & Sons, Inc., 138 N.H. 110, 118 (1993)\n(describing New Hampshire defamation law).\n     10\n           Harr does not argue that Riley is a public figure.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbefore recovering damages for defamation from a media defendant.\"11\nPhiladelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 777 (1986).\n\n          The Supreme Court has also recognized \"constitutional\nlimits on the type of speech which may be the subject of state\n\ndefamation actions.\"       Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 16 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).    In Milkovich, a case involving a media defendant, the\nCourt held that \"a statement on matters of public concern must be\n\nprovable as    false    before   there    can   be   liability   under   state\n\ndefamation law.\"       497 U.S. at 19.      Milkovich also rejected the\n\nproposition that the First Amendment creates a blanket exception to\n\nstate defamation law for \"statements which are categorized as\n\n'opinion' as opposed to 'fact.'\"12         Id. at 17.     The Court pointed\n\nout that \"expressions of 'opinion' may often imply an assertion of\nobjective fact,\" id. at 18, and \"[it] would be destructive of the\n\nlaw of libel if a writer could escape liability for accusations of\n\n[defamatory conduct] simply by using, explicitly or implicitly, the\nwords, 'I think.'\"       Id. at 19 (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).    As we observed in a subsequent decision, \"[a]\n\n\n     11\n         In place of the common-law presumption that defamatory\nspeech is    false,   the  Supreme   Court  has  established  \"a\nconstitutional requirement that the plaintiff bear the burden of\nshowing falsity, as well as fault, before recovering damages\"\nagainst a media defendant.    Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 16 (quoting\nHepps, 475 U.S. at 776).\n     12\n         Some had read Gertz, 418 U.S. at 339-40, to \"create a\nwholesale defamation exception for anything that might be labeled\n'opinion.'\" Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 18. The Gertz court observed\nthat \"[u]nder the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false\nidea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its\ncorrection not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the\ncompetition of other ideas.\" Gertz, 418 U.S. at 339-40.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fstatement couched as an opinion that presents or implies the\n\nexistence of facts which are capable of being proven true or false\n\ncan be actionable.\"        Levinsky's, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\n127 F.3d 122, 127 (1st Cir. 1997).\n             However, and of central importance in this case, even a\n\nprovably false statement is not actionable if \"'it is plain that\nthe speaker is expressing a subjective view, an interpretation, a\n\ntheory, conjecture, or surmise, rather than claiming to be in\n\npossession of objectively verifiable facts . . . .'\"                 Gray v. St.\n\nMartin's Press, Inc., 221 F.3d 243, 248 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting\n\nHaynes v. Alfred A. Knopf. Inc., 8 F.3d 1222, 1227 (7th Cir. 1993)).\n\nAs the Ninth Circuit has explained, \"when an author outlines the\n\nfacts available to him, thus making it clear that the challenged\nstatements represent his own interpretation of those facts and\n\nleaving   the    reader   free    to    draw   his   own    conclusions,      those\n\nstatements      are   generally    protected    by   the    First    Amendment.\"\nPartington v. Bugliosi, 56 F.3d 1147, 1156-57 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\n             We applied these principles in Phantom Touring, Inc. v.\n\nAffiliated    Publications,       953   F.2d   724   (1st   Cir.    1992).      The\n\nplaintiff, producer of a version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" that\n\nwas not the successful and acclaimed Broadway show created by\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber, sued the Boston Globe for defamation, claiming\n\nthat certain Globe articles had falsely accused it of endeavoring\n\nto pass off its own production as the Broadway version.                      Id. at\n\n725.   We held that although the allegation of deliberate deception\n\nmight be provable as true or false, \"[t]he sum effect of the\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fformat, tone and entire content of the articles is to make it\n\nunmistakably clear that [the author] was expressing a point of view\n\nonly,\" rather than \"stating 'actual facts' about [the plaintiff's]\nhonesty.\"     Id. at 729 (citation omitted).   We explained:\n\n            Of greatest importance . . . is the breadth of\n            [the] articles, which not only discussed all\n            the facts underlying [the author's] views but\n            also gave information from which readers might\n            draw contrary conclusions.     In effect, the\n            articles offered a self-contained give-and-\n            take, a kind of verbal debate . . . . Because\n            all sides of the issue, as well as the\n            rationale for [the author's] view, were\n            exposed, the assertion of deceit reasonably\n            could be understood only as [the author's]\n            personal conclusion about the information\n            presented . . . .\n\nId. at 730.\n\n            We then distinguished the facts in Milkovich, where the\nauthor of a newspaper column charging that a high school wrestling\n\ncoach had lied about his behavior at a meet informed his readers\n\nthat he was in \"a unique position\" to know that the coach had lied\nbecause he had personally observed the relevant events.        497 U.S.\n\nat 5, n.2.     We wrote:\n\n            the article in Milkovich, unlike [the]\n            \"Phantom\" columns, was not based on facts\n            accessible to everyone.     Indeed, a reader\n            reasonably could have understood the reporter\n            in Milkovich to be suggesting that he was\n            singularly    capable   of   evaluating   the\n            plaintiffs' conduct. In contrast, neither of\n            [the Globe] columns indicated that [the\n            author], or anyone else, had more information\n            about Phantom Touring's marketing practices\n            than was reported in the articles. While [the\n            Globe's] readers implicitly were invited to\n            draw their own conclusions from the mixed\n            information provided, the Milkovich readers\n            implicitly were told that only one conclusion\n            was possible.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fId. at 730-31.     See Moldea v. New York Times Co., 22 F.3d 310, 317\n\n(D.C.   Cir.    1994)    (\"Because     the       reader    understands       that   [the\n\nchallenged statement] represent[s] the writer's interpretation of\nthe facts presented, and because the reader is free to draw his or\n\nher own conclusions based upon those facts, this type of statement\n\nis not actionable in defamation.\") (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n           In    sum,    the   basic       issue    before    us    is    whether    the\n\nchallenged statements in A Civil Action implicitly signal to\n\nreaders \"that only one conclusion [about Riley] was possible,\" and\n\ntherefore do not qualify as protected opinion under Milkovich and\n\nPhantom Touring, or whether \"readers implicitly were invited to\n\ndraw their own conclusions from the mixed information provided,\" in\nwhich case the First Amendment bars Riley's defamation action.\n\nPhantom Touring, 953 F.2d at 731. In making this determination, we\n\nlook not just at the specific statements complained of, but also at\n\"the general tenor of the [Book]\" and the context in which the\n\nchallenged statements are set.             Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 21.           We are\n\nmindful that the subject of A Civil Action -- a controversial\n\nlawsuit and the disputed events underlying it -- \"is one about\n\nwhich   there    could    easily      be     a    number     of    varying    rational\n\ninterpretations,\"       and    that   in    writing       about    such   \"inherently\n\nambiguous\" subjects, an author who \"fairly describes the general\n\nevents involved and offers his personal perspective about some of\n\n[the] ambiguities and disputed facts\" should not be subject to a\n\ndefamation action.         Partington, 56 F.3d at 1154.                    Otherwise,\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fauthors   would   hesitate   to   venture   beyond   \"dry,   colorless\n\ndescriptions of facts, bereft of analysis or insight,\" and the\n\nthreat of defamation lawsuits would discourage \"expressions of\nopinion by commentators, experts in a field, figures closely\n\ninvolved in a public controversy, or others whose perspectives\n\nmight be of interest to the public\"      Id.\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\n          We have observed that \"when defamation issues implicate\n\nfree speech concerns. . . . appellate judges must conduct a whole-\n\nrecord review and 'examine for themselves the statements in issue\nand the circumstances under which they were made to see . . .\n\nwhether they are of a character which the principles of the First\nAmendment' protect.\" Levinsky's, 127 F.3d at 127 (quoting New York\n\nTimes Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 285 (1964)).     Therefore, \"the\n\ncourts treat the issue of labeling a statement as verifiable fact\nor as [protected] opinion as one ordinarily decided by judges as a\nmatter of law.\"     Gray, 221 F.3d at 248, citing Bose Corp. v.\n\nConsumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 510-11\n(1984).\n\nC. The Challenged Statements\n\n          To put the challenged statements in context, we follow\n\nthe district court's helpful practice of quoting some of the text\n\nsurrounding the specific language cited in Riley's complaint.      The\n\nspecific language Riley complains of is indicated in bold.          We\n\nadopt the letters used by Riley to designate the statements at\n\nissue.    We depart somewhat from the usual letter sequencing,\n\n                                  -12-\n\fhowever, to discuss the statements in a more logical order.      We\n\naddress in turn statements suggesting that Riley is a liar (in the\n\norder of our discussion, statements C, E, F, H, J, I, K and D); a\nperjurer (Statement A); and a killer (Statement G).\n\n                           Statement C\n\n          Statement C describes Schlichtmann's reaction to the\ndiscovery of a document indicating that tannery waste had been\n\ndeposited on the fifteen acres in 1956:\n\n          This document was thirty years old and it\n          dealt only with tannery waste, which might or\n          might not have contained TCE.    But even so,\n          Schlichtmann thought it had great value.\n          Riley had sworn at his deposition that he had\n          never dumped anything on the fifteen acres.\n          Riley had lied then, and Schlichtmann -- who\n          didn't need much convincing -- believed that\n          Riley was also lying about using TCE.\n\nThe assertion in Statement C that Riley had lied in the course of\n\nthe Anderson litigation is, in principle, \"provable as false.\"\n\nMilkovich, 497 U.S. at 19. A statement is not actionable, however,\n\nif \"it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective view,\n\nan interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise.\"     Gray, 221\nF.3d at 248 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          The district court found that Statement C \"is clearly\n\nwritten in Schlichtmann's voice,\" reporting his \"inner musings\nabout the evidence he was gathering,\" and therefore \"could not be\nconstrued by a reasonable reader as [an] assertion[] of fact.\"\n\nRiley concedes that the assertion about Riley that follows the\nwords \"Schlichtmann . . . believed\" represents Schlichtmann's view\n\n\n                              -13-\n\fof Riley's testimony, but asserts that the phrase \"Riley had lied\n\nthen\" constitutes Harr's own factual claim.                 We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that the phrase \"Riley had lied then\" -- coming\nalmost immediately after and elaborating upon the sentence \"But\n\neven so, Schlichtmann thought it had great value,\" and situated in\n\na section of the Book that recounts Schlichtmann's efforts to build\na case against the tannery -- is Schlichtmann's conclusion, not\n\nHarr's.      As Harr points out, \"[t]he law does not force writers to\n\nclumsily begin each and every sentence with 'Schlichtmann felt'\" in\n\norder   to    indicate   that    a   statement   is   being    attributed    to\n\nSchlichtmann.     As Statement C is cast as Schlichtmann's assessment\n\nof Riley's testimony, and follows a summary of the evidence upon\n\nwhich it is based (the document reporting the discovery of tannery\nwaste on the fifteen acres), it amounts to \"a subjective view, an\n\ninterpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise,\" not an assertion\n\nof objective fact based on undisclosed evidence. Gray, 221 F.3d at\n\n248 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             Moreover, even if we accepted Riley's premise that the\nstatement \"Riley had lied then\" constitutes Harr's own declaration\n\nthat Riley had uttered a falsehood, the statement would still be\n\nprotected under the First Amendment. Like the allegedly defamatory\n\nnewspaper     articles   in     Phantom   Touring,    the    Book   \"not   only\n\ndiscussed . . . the facts underlying [Harr's] views but also gave\n\ninformation from which readers might draw contrary conclusions.\"\n\nPhantom Touring, 953 F.2d at 730.            For example, one page before\n\nStatement C, Harr writes that \"One after another, interviews with\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fa dozen former tannery employees led Schlichtmann nowhere.                     None\n\ncould recall using TCE, or dumping tannery waste . . . on the\n\nfifteen   acres.\"     A    Civil   Action   at    186.     Immediately     after\nStatement C, the Book reports Schlichtmann's discovery of a witness\n\nwho seemed at first to offer compelling testimony that tannery\n\nwaste had been dumped on the fifteen acres, but who (the Book\nacknowledges) turned out to lack credibility.                    Id. at 187-91.\n\nLater in the Book, Harr again states that \"Schlichtmann did not\n\nhave   eyewitnesses   who    could   implicate      John    J.    Riley   in    the\n\ncontamination of the fifteen acres.\"             Id. at 298.     As we noted at\n\nthe outset, the Book makes plain both the strengths and the\n\nweaknesses of the case against Riley. \"Because [both] sides of the\n\nissue, as well as the rationale for [Harr's] view, were exposed,\nthe assertion of deceit reasonably could be understood only as\n\n[Harr's] personal conclusion about the information presented,\" not\n\nas a statement of objective fact based on undisclosed evidence.\nPhantom Touring, 953 F.2d at 730.\n\n           We reject Riley's claim that Harr's explanatory \"To the\n\nReader\" and \"Note on Sources\" sections, detailing his extensive\n\naccess to Schlichtmann during the Anderson trial and the voluminous\n\nresearch he conducted in writing the Book, signal to the reader\n\nthat every conclusion the book attributes to Schlichtmann amounts\n\nto an assertion by Harr of verifiable, objective fact.                    Harr's\n\npurpose   in   notifying    the    reader   of    his    extensive    access     to\n\nSchlichtmann is plainly not to establish that Schlichtmann is an\n\nomniscient figure whose inferences are all correct.                  Rather, his\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fpoint is simply that he was well positioned to tell the story of\n\nthe Anderson litigation from Schlichtmann's vantage point, and to\n\ndescribe the attorney's subjective experience of the chronicled\nevents.\n\n                                Statement E\n\n            Like Statement C, Statement E appears in the section of\nthe Book which describes Schlichtmann's efforts to build a case\n\nagainst Riley's tannery:\n\n            It seemed that everyone but Riley recognized\n            the fifteen acres as a toxic waste dump.\n            Riley must have known about the condition of\n            the property. Perhaps, thought Schlichtmann,\n            the tanner really had been running an\n            unauthorized waste dump.     Perhaps he had\n            charged his neighbor, Whitney Barrel, a fee\n            for the use of the land.\n\nAs with Statement C, Riley argues that the district court erred in\nfinding that the first two sentences of Statement E were written in\nSchlichtmann's voice, rather than in Harr's.                 But the context in\n\nwhich     Statement   E   is    set   makes        clear    that   it    describes\nSchlichtmann's thinking as he worked to assemble a case against the\ntannery.    Moreover, as with Statement C, Statement E would be non-\nactionable even if it were deemed to recount Harr's own evaluation\n\nof Riley's state of mind, as it is based on evidence -- some\n\npointing in one direction, some in the other -- which the Book\n\ndescribes in substantial detail. Phantom Touring, 953 F.2d at 730.\n\n            Riley asserts that Phantom Touring is inapposite because\n\nHarr failed to report that some of Schlichtmann's own investigators\n\nhad   concluded   that    the   tannery      was    not    responsible    for   the\n\n                                      -16-\n\fcontamination of the fifteen acres.           Although the Book does not\n\nmention this specific fact, it does report evidence (some of which\n\nwe describe in connection with Statement C supra) tending to negate\nSchlichtmann's theory of the case. Harr was not required to report\n\nevery single fact about the Anderson litigation, but was free to\n\nmake his own editorial choices, so long as he \"fairly describe[d]\nthe general events involved.\"        Partington, 56 F.3d at 1154.\n\n                               Statement F\n\n          Statement F refers to a substance which Schlichtmann's\n\ninvestigators     discovered    on    the   fifteen   acres   having   the\n\ncharacteristics of tannery waste and containing TCE:\n\n          If this material was indeed tannery waste,\n          then how had it become contaminated with TCE,\n          which Riley claimed he had never used?     It\n          was, of course, possible that someone else --\n          Whitney, perhaps -- had dumped TCE on top of\n          it.   That was possible, but to Schlichtmann\n          the most logical explanation was that it had\n          all come from the same place. And if that was\n          true, it meant that Riley had lied about TCE.\n\n          Riley     acknowledges       that     Statement     F   recounts\n\nSchlichtmann's thinking, but asserts that the passage is defamatory\nbecause Harr \"failed to disclose to the reader that TCE simply\nwasn't used by the Riley Tannery.\"          We reject Riley's contention\n\nthat Harr was required to include in the Book a declaration that\n\nthe tannery had not used TCE.         The Book reports Riley's repeated\n\ndenials of TCE use, and notes Schlichtmann's failure to discover\n\nconclusive evidence to the contrary.          Having set out the evidence\n\nfor the reader to weigh, Harr cannot be subject to defamation\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fliability   for   failing    to   endorse     Riley's   version   of   events.\n\nPartington, 56 F.3d at 1154.\n\n            Riley is simply wrong to assert that the Book fails to\ndisclose the facts upon which Statement F is based, and that\n\nStatement F implies the existence of undisclosed facts.                 On the\n\ncontrary, Harr reports in great detail the factual basis for\nSchlichtmann's conclusion, including facts that create problems for\n\nSchlichtmann's theory of the case.\n\n                            Statements H and J\n\n            Statement   H   reports    a     comment   Schlichtmann    made   in\n\nreaction to Riley's performance on the witness stand:\n\n                   \"Riley     surprised     me     today,\"\n            [Schlichtmann's partner Conway] said.      \"He\n            came off looking better than he should have.\n            He was so arrogant and combative in his\n            deposition.\"\n                   \"He's a liar but he's not stupid,\" said\n            Schlichtmann.\n\nStatement J recounts Schlichtmann's reaction to Riley's testimony:\n\n            When Riley had sat on the witness stand,\n            [Schlichtmann had] wanted to turn to the\n            jurors and say, \"See? This man is lying now.\"\n\nAs we have explained, Harr was entitled to report Schlichtmann's\n\nopinion that Riley had given false testimony, having disclosed the\nfacts upon which the opinion was based, including some facts that\n\nare in tension with Schlichtmann's conclusion.              Phantom Touring,\n\n953 F.2d at 730.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f                           Statement I\n\n          Statement I is Schlichtmann's account of what he believed\n\nwas a successful moment in his examination of Riley:\n          \"It was great, wasn't it, Charlie! Why would\n          Riley immediately make the connection between\n          TCE and destroying records?   Because he was\n          covering up! The jury understood that, didn't\n          they?\"\n\nRiley had testified earlier about the destruction of records\n\nindicating what chemicals the tannery had used.   Returning to the\n\nsubject at the end of his examination, Schlichtmann inquired: \"Mr.\n\nRiley, when did you destroy those records?\"   Harr writes:\n                 The tanner was instantly enraged. The\n          question worked just as Schlichtmann had\n          hoped. In a loud, angry voice, Riley said, \"I\n          don't know when those records were destroyed,\n          but I will repeat to you, sir, again and\n          again, we never used trichloroethylene--\"\n                 \"No, no, no,\" interrupted the judge.\n          \"You're not being asked that.    You're being\n          asked when the records were destroyed.    You\n          say you don't know.      Next question, Mr.\n          Schlichtmann.\"\n                 \"That's   all,\"    said   Schlichtmann\n          smiling.\n\nStatement I is Schlichtmann's reaction to Riley's outburst.   As we\nhave explained, the factual basis for the opinion that Riley was\n\"covering up\" is laid out in the Book, as are certain facts tending\n\nto discredit it.     We agree with the district court that \"a\nreasonable reader would fully understand that the statement does\nnot convey that Schlichtmann knew as a fact that Riley was covering\n\nup, but merely that [in Schlichtmann's opinion] that 'had to be'\nthe reason for his non-responsive answer.\"\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f                              Statement K\n\n          Statement K reports Schlichtmann's excited reaction, in\n\nthe post-trial phase of the Book, to his discovery of a witness who\nhad seen soil, which Schlichtmann surmised contained contaminated\n\ntannery waste, being removed from the fifteen acres:\n\n          Back in the car, Schlichtmann told [his law\n          partner], \"We've opened the box and the worms\n          are starting to crawl out.    This isn't just\n          hiding evidence, this is destroying evidence.\"\n\nRiley contends that Statement K \"is actionable as verifiable fact\nknown to be false to the publisher,\" because \"Judge Skinner clearly\n\nruled that any removal activities were . . . legitimately connected\nto . . . EPA well monitoring operations and were performed in full\n\nview of EPA personnel.\"\n\n             We reject Riley's untenable premise that Judge Skinner's\n\nruling precludes commentators outside of the judicial system from\n\nexpressing a contrary view.    Moreover, Harr does report that Judge\n\nSkinner \"found that the 'removal activity' on the fifteen acres\n\n'was legitimately connected to the drilling of test wells and other\n\ninvestigative procedures.'\"     A Civil Action at 484.\n\n          Perhaps sensing the force of Harr's argument that the\n\nBook does report views contrary to those Riley deems defamatory,\nRiley asserts that Harr failed to \"fully and concomitantly\" reveal\nto the reader that Judge Skinner later ruled that Schlichtmann's\n\nsurmise that tannery workers had been \"destroying evidence\" was\nincorrect.     Harr is right to observe that the implication of this\nargument would be that \"an author cannot write a book describing in\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fchronological order an attorney's efforts to try a case,\" but\n\ninstead   \"must   reveal   the   end   result   of   every   legal   hunch\n\nimmediately.\"     A Civil Action is meant to be read as a whole; we\ndecline to impose on authors the nonsensical requirement that all\n\npoints of view be set forth at the same time.\n\n                              Statement D\n\n          In his quest for evidence that Riley's tannery had\n\ncontaminated the fifteen acres with TCE, Schlichtmann's private\n\ninvestigator interviewed Ruth Turner (a pseudonym), an elderly\n\nwoman who lived near the tannery:\n\n           Her husband, Paul [who had died in 1981],\n           would often walk down behind the house, in the\n           forest by the Aberjona River, on the land\n           owned by Riley.    He would return from his\n           walks and tell her about the barrels and piles\n           of debris he'd seen there, and how sludge\n           waste from the tannery would flow down the\n           hill and onto the land. In the years before\n           Paul's death in 1981, recalled Ruth, he often\n           awoke in the middle of the night. On several\n           occasions, he'd told Ruth about hearing the\n           sounds of trucks at two or three o'clock in\n           the morning. He had said that he could see\n           the headlights of flatbed trucks full of\n           barrels driving up the access dirt road onto\n           the fifteen acres. \"They're dumping stuff in\n           the middle of the night,\" Ruth recalled his\n           saying.\n\nRiley contends that a reader \"could understand the passage as\n\nstating that Riley did, in fact, dump illegal material on the 15\n\nacres.\" However, the Book makes clear that despite his suspicions,\n\nSchlichtmann never succeeded in proving that Riley was responsible\n\nfor illegal dumping.       Read in context, Statement D describes a\n\npiece of evidence which suggested to Schlichtmann that the tannery\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fhad contaminated the 15 acres with TCE, but did not prove that it\n\nhad done so.          It is this unmistakable theme of the Book --\n\nSchlichtmann's inability to move from theory, conjecture, and\nsurmise   to   actual       proof   --    which       Riley's      complaint      somehow\n\noverlooks.      See Gray, 221 F.3d at 248 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n                                    Statement A\n\n           After      the     Anderson      trial       was       over,   Schlichtmann\n\ndiscovered     that    Riley,   during      the       pendency      of    the    Anderson\n\nlitigation, had commissioned Yankee to conduct a hydrogeologic\n\ninvestigation of the tannery property. Yankee had written a report\n\ndescribing     its    findings,     which       was    never       produced      for   the\n\nplaintiffs     during    discovery.         Nor       was     a    subsequent      report\nreevaluating Yankee's data.              Judge Skinner ruled that Riley had\n\nengaged in deliberate concealment of the reports.                               The judge\n\nexplained:\n             In his testimony on deposition and at trial\n             Riley denied the existence of these reports.\n             With   respect   to    each   question,   taken\n             separately, the answer might be justified\n             because of hypertechnical interpretations of\n             the questions posed by the interrogator. (For\n             instance, \"Did you test the sludge?\" Answer[:]\n             \"No.\" Fact: He caused a test to be made by\n             someone else.) Similarly one could quibble\n             over the definition of the documents. There\n             were enough such questions, however, so that\n             any fair response should at one time or\n             another have revealed the existence of these\n             reports. In addition, Mr. Riley denied the\n             existence of laboratory reports and chemical\n             formulas which were clearly called for. Even\n             allowing    for     Mr.     Riley's    apparent\n             unsophistication    and   inarticulateness,   I\n             conclude that the pattern of evasive answers\n             concerning these reports and the other\n\n                                         -22-\n\f           documents by Mr. Riley requires a finding that\n           the concealment was deliberate.\nAnderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 127 F.R.D. 1, 5 (D. Mass. 1989).\n\n           Statement A is Harr's description of Judge Skinner's\n\nfinding:\n\n           The judge found that Riley had committed\n           perjury and that Mary Ryan was guilty of\n           'deliberate misconduct' in failing to give\n           Schlichtmann the Yankee report.\n\nRiley contends that \"deliberate concealment\" does not amount to the\n\ncrime of perjury, and that Statement A is therefore a false account\n\nof the judge's ruling.\n\n           The Supreme Court has observed that \"[t]he common law of\nlibel . . .    overlooks minor inaccuracies and concentrates upon\n\nsubstantial truth. . . .

Providence Journal Co., 508 F.2d 656, 659 (1st Cir.\n\n1975)   (noting      courts'   \"reluctance    to    entertain    libel   suits\n\ndependent upon a precise construction of a newspaper's use of\ntechnical legal terminology\"); Ricci v. Venture Magazine, Inc., 574\n\nF. Supp. 1563, 1567 (D. Mass. 1983) (\"a journalist's report need\n\nnot describe legal proceedings in technically precise language\" if\n\nit meets \"a common sense standard of expected lay interpretation\").\n\n             Judge Skinner found that Riley's denial of the existence\n\nof the Yankee report under oath amounted to deliberate concealment.\n\nWe agree with the district court that the word \"perjury\" -- defined\nin the Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (2d ed. 1997)\n\nas \"the willful giving of false testimony under oath\" -- is a fair\n\nrendition of Judge Skinner's characterization of Riley's conduct,\nand is therefore non-actionable under New Hampshire law.             Although\n\nJudge Skinner did not say that Riley's actions met the legal\ndefinition    of    perjury,   Harr's   account     is   \"a   rough-and-ready\n\nsummary\" of the judge's ruling that is \"substantially correct.\"\n\nHayes, 141 N.H. at 466.\n\n           Riley argues that because the Book was published six\n\nyears   after      Judge   Skinner   made   his    \"deliberate    misconduct\"\n\npronouncement, Harr \"had ample time to review the official record\n\nand accurately report the Court's findings.\"             Riley declares that\n\nthe non-contemporaneous nature of Harr's report somehow \"result[s]\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fin the attenuation of the need for and purpose of the fair report\n\nprivilege and 'rough and ready' protection analysis.\" In a closer\n\ncase we might deem a six year gap between the event reported and\nthe publication of the report a factor to be weighed in evaluating\n\nthe report's fairness.        This is not a close case, however, and\n\nRiley offers no reason why we should reject the usual rule that \"a\njournalist's [substantially accurate] report need not describe\n\nlegal proceedings in technically precise language\" simply because\n\nHarr had enough time, in principle, to master the precise legal\n\nmeaning of the term \"perjury.\" Ricci, 574 F. Supp. at 1567.\n\n                               Statement G\n\n          After     Riley's    first   day   on   the   witness   stand,\n\nSchlichtmann's colleagues critiqued his examination of Riley.        The\nBook reports that Tom Neville suggested to Schlichtmann that\n\n\"'[t]he jury wants you to kick the shit out of [Riley].\"           After\n\nThomas Kiley had exhorted Schlichtmann to \"crack\" Riley, the\nfollowing ensued:\n\n                 Neville jumped up, too, and hovered\n          over Schlichtmann from the other side.\n          \"You've got to manhandle him!\" said Neville.\n                 \"Yeah, great,\" said Schlichtmann, his\n          head bowed, his voice soft.      \"That's good\n          showmanship, but I've got to get evidence in.\"\n                 \"My God, this is the guy who killed\n          your kids!\" yelled Neville.    \"You should be\n          attacking him with a fucking baseball bat!\n          You shouldn't be asking him\" -- Neville\n          adopted a mincing tone -- \"And then what did\n          you do next, Mr. Riley?\" . . . .\n                 [Schlichtmann's colleagues continue to\n          coach him.   The scene concludes with Kiley\n          saying to Schlichtmann:] \"In my eleven years\n          of trial experience, you've got more shit to\n          use on this guy than I've ever seen before.\n\n                                   -25-\n\f           You can fucking destroy him.           What does it\n           take to get you mad?\"\n\nRiley argues that Statement G would be understood by a reasonable\n\nreader as a statement of provable fact.              Harr responds that\n\nStatement G is a hyperbolic expression that cannot be understood as\nan assertion of objective fact.\n\n           Reading Statement G in context, it is unmistakable that\n\nNeville's purpose in describing Riley as \"the guy who killed your\n\nkids\" is   to   inspire    Schlichtmann    to   conduct   a   more   forceful\n\nexamination of Riley, and that Harr's purpose in reporting this\n\nepisode is to capture the reaction of Schlichtmann's colleagues to\n\nhis poor performance that day.             In a sense, Statement G is\n\n\"rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet\" used by Neville to\n\narouse Schlichtmann's fighting spirit.          Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 17\n\n(quoting Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Assn., Inc. v. Bresler,\n\n398 U.S. 6, 13-14 (1970)).       \"[T]he First Amendment protects the\n\n'rhetorical hyperbole' and 'imaginative expression' that enlivens\n\nwriters' prose.\"    Partington, 56 F.3d at 1157 (quoting Milkovich,\n\n497 U.S. at 20).\n           However,   in   contrast   to   Greenbelt,     where   the   court\n\nconcluded that the defendant's use of the word \"blackmail\" was not\n\nmeant as a literal accusation that the plaintiff had committed the\ncrime of blackmail, the Anderson plaintiffs did contend that\n\nRiley's tannery, by causing TCE to enter the Woburn water supply,\n\nhad \"killed\" their children.      Greenbelt, 398 U.S. at 14; see also\n\nLetter Carriers v. Austin, 418 U.S. 264, 285 (1974) (description of\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fplaintiff    as   a   \"traitor\"    was    not   a   literal   accusation     that\n\nplaintiff had committed the crime of treason).            Even so, Statement\n\nG is non-actionable for the same reasons that the statements\ndiscussed supra, charging Riley with giving false testimony, are\n\nnon-actionable.       Having disclosed the facts upon which Statement G\n\nis based, Harr is entitled to report Neville's view that Riley's\nactions had caused the death of the plaintiffs' children.               Phantom\n\nTouring, 953 F.2d at 730.\n\nIII. False Light\n\n            In opposition to the district court's entry of summary\njudgment for Harr on his false light invasion of privacy claims in\n\nconnection with Statements A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and K, Riley\nsimply refers us to his arguments against the dismissal of his\ndefamation claims.        We agree with the district court that it is\n\nunnecessary to decide whether the New Hampshire Supreme Court would\nrecognize the false light tort because Riley's false light claim is\n\"a   mere   restatement    of    [his]    defamation    claim,   but    under   a\n\ndifferent    name.\"       Harr    is   therefore     entitled    to    the   same\nconstitutional protections that compelled the district court to\ndismiss his defamation claims.           See Brown v. Hearst Corp., 54 F.3d\n\n21, 27 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that where a false light claim is\n\"simply a restatement of [a] defamation claim under a different\nheading[,] . . .        it is not imaginable that it could escape the\n\nsame constitutional constraint as [the] defamation claim\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\fIV. Public Disclosure of Private Fact\n\n           Statement L describes Riley's appearance at the post-\n\ntrial hearing on the failure of the defendants to produce certain\n\ndocuments:\n\n           Riley returned to the courtroom in early\n           March, three years after first taking the\n           witness stand during trial. Back then, he'd\n           been aggressive and antagonistic, but now he\n           looked sickly, moody, and listless. He paced\n           in the corridor, eyes narrowed and suspicious,\n           mouth tightly compressed. He was in his mid-\n           sixties,    suffering    from   episodes    of\n           depression.\n\nAlthough the district court denied Harr's motion for summary\n\njudgment on Riley's defamation claim as to Statement L, deeming it\n\nto be a non-protected assertion of the verifiable fact that Riley\n\nhad experienced episodes of depression, it granted summary judgment\n\non Riley's public disclosure of private fact claim on the ground\n\nthat his depression was substantially relevant to the Anderson\n\nlitigation, a matter of legitimate public concern.13            In assessing\n\nRiley's public disclosure of private fact claim, we must assume\n\nthat Statement L is true (otherwise it would not amount to the\n\ndisclosure of a private \"fact.\")\n\n           The district court concluded that the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court would recognize, if it had not already done so by\nimplication, a cause of action for public disclosure of private\nfact.     See   Hamberger   v.   Eastman,   106   N.H.   107,    111   (1964)\n\n\n\n     13\n         Riley has since abandoned his defamation claim as to\nStatement L in order to get a final judgment.\n\n                                   -28-\n\f(declaring     that   \"'a   person    who   unreasonably   and   seriously\n\ninterferes with another's interest in not having his affairs known\n\nto others . . . is liable to the other'\") (quoting Restatement of\n\nTorts § 867).    However, the district court declared that the First\n\nAmendment \"protects the publication of private facts that are\n\nnewsworthy, that is, of legitimate concern to the public.          Even if\nthe private fact is not itself newsworthy, its publication is still\n\nprotected if it has substantial relevance to, or any substantial\n\nnexus with a newsworthy topic\" (citations and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n             Riley does not challenge the district court's premise\n\nthat Statement L is non-actionable if it is substantially relevant\n\nto the story told in the Book.         He argues instead that the court\nerred in finding the fact of his depression to be relevant to the\n\nAnderson litigation.        Assuming with the district court that New\n\nHampshire would recognize a cause of action for public disclosure\nof private fact, and that this cause of action contemplates an\n\nexception for statements that are substantially relevant to a\nmatter of legitimate public concern, we evaluate the relevance of\n\nRiley's depression to the story recounted in the Book.\n\n          The relevance of Statement L to the subject matter of the\n\nBook is unmistakable.       The Book reports that Beatrice's attorney,\n\nconcerned about Riley's performance on the witness stand during the\n\npost-trial hearing, \"would have liked to bring out the fact of\n\nRiley's depression in defense of the tanner's mental confusion and\n\nfailures of memory, but Riley had told him, 'I don't want to talk\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fabout that.'\"      A Civil Action at 482.          We also agree with Harr that\n\none of the purposes of the Book was to chronicle \"the devastating\n\nemotional toll of the litigation on many of the participants,\"\nincluding Riley and Schlichtmann, the Book's protagonist.                     Under\n\nthese circumstances, Riley's mental condition was relevant to the\n\nAnderson litigation.\n\nV. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n\n            The    district       court      dismissed      Riley's    intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress claim on the ground that \"New\n\nHampshire law does not recognize a cause of action for wrongful\ninfliction of emotional distress where the factual predicate sounds\n\nin defamation\" (quoting DeMeo v. Goodall, 640 F. Supp. 1115, 1116\n\n(D.N.H. 1986).     We do not reach this question of New Hampshire law,\nhowever, because we are convinced that Riley's allegations, as a\n\nmatter of law, do not rise to the level of \"'extreme and outrageous\nconduct'\"      required      to   support     an   intentional     infliction    of\nemotional distress action. Morancy v. Morancy, 593 A.2d 1158, 1159\n\n(N.H. 1991) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46).                   Conduct\nis deemed to be extreme and outrageous \"only where [it] has been so\noutrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond\n\nall possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious,\nand utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"                    Miller v. CBC\n\nCos.,   Inc.,     908   F.    Supp.   1054,    1067   (D.N.H.      1995)   (quoting\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 46, comment d).                    Such cannot be\nsaid of Statements A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, which express\n\nin   various    ways    the   view    that    Riley   had    not   given   truthful\n\n                                       -30-\n\ftestimony during the Anderson litigation (see supra).            Although we\n\nrealize that Riley would have preferred that Harr not publish a\n\ncritical evaluation of his testimony in the Anderson case, we are\nalso persuaded that Harr's portrayal of Riley cannot be said to\n\nhave    exceeded    \"all   possible    bounds   of   decency,\"   or   to   be\n\n\"atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"\n             We take the same view of Statement L (see supra), which\n\nreports     that   Riley   had   experienced    \"episodes   of   depression\"\n                                                                           14\n(relevant to the Anderson litigation), and also of Statement B.\nStatement B reads:\n\n             He had once confronted a neighbor who had\n             written an article about the tannery stench\n             for the Civic Association Newsletter. Banging\n             on the neighbor's door one evening, he had\n             stomped uninvited into the living room, put\n             his thick finger to his neighbor's chest and\n             yelled that he, Riley, was a big taxpayer in\n             the city, and by what right did the neighbor\n             slander his business in such a manner?    The\n             neighbor, at first taken aback by the verbal\n             tirade, finally told Riley to get out of his\n             house.\n\nAlthough perhaps unflattering, Harr's publication of this account\n\nof Riley's conduct simply does not rise to the level of \"atrocious\"\n\nor \"utterly intolerable\" conduct.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n        The district court denied Harr's motion to dismiss Riley's\ndefamation claim with respect to Statement B, declining to rule as\na matter of law that the statement was not defamatory. The parties\nsubsequently stipulated to the dismissal of Riley's defamation\nclaim with respect to Statement B.\n\n                                      -31-\n\fVI. Loss of Consortium and Enhanced Compensatory Damages\n\n          At the end of their brief, the Rileys assert that their\n\nclaims for loss of consortium and enhanced compensatory damages\n\nshould go forward \"[f]or all of the reasons set forth above in\n\nsections I-IV of this Brief [dealing with the Rileys' defamation\n\nand other tort claims].\"15    This is the extent of their argument on\n\nthe loss of consortium and enhanced compensatory damages claims.\n\nIn Sections II-V of this opinion, we rejected the Rileys' arguments\n\nas to their defamation and other tort claims on which the district\n\ncourt properly   granted     summary   judgment   for   Harr.   The   same\narguments advanced in support of their loss of consortium and\n\nenhanced compensatory damages claims necessarily must fail for the\nsame reasons.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n        Punitive damages are not available in New Hampshire, but\n\"when the act involved is wanton, malicious, or oppressive, the\ncompensatory   damages  awarded  may  reflect   the  aggravating\ncircumstances.\" Panas v. Harakis, 529 A.2d 976, 986 (N.H. 1987)\n(citation omitted).\n\n                                  -32-\n\f                            Appendix\n\nThe specific language Riley complains of is indicated in bold. We\nhave included some of the surrounding text to help put the\nchallenged statements in context.      Citations are to the 1996\nVintage Books edition.    The letters assigned to the statements\nreflect the lettering used by Riley during the litigation.\n\n\n         A . The judge found that Riley had committed\n         perjury and that Mary Ryan was guilty of\n         'deliberate misconduct' in failing to give\n         Schlichtmann the Yankee report.     A Civil\n         Action at 483.\n\n          B. He had once confronted a neighbor who had\n          written an article about the tannery stench\n          for the Civic Association Newsletter. Banging\n          on the neighbor's door one evening, he had\n          stomped uninvited into the living room, put\n          his thick finger to his neighbor's chest and\n          yelled that he, Riley, was a big taxpayer in\n          the city, and by what right did the neighbor\n          slander his business in such a manner?    The\n          neighbor, at first taken aback by the verbal\n          tirade, finally told Riley to get out of his\n          house. A Civil Action at 91-92.\n\n         C. This document was thirty years old and it\n         dealt only with tannery waste, which might or\n         might not have contained TCE.    But even so,\n         Schlichtmann thought it had great value.\n         Riley had sworn at his deposition that he had\n         never dumped anything on the fifteen acres.\n         Riley had lied then, and Schlichtmann -- who\n         didn't need much convincing -- believed that\n         Riley was also lying about using TCE. A Civil\n         Action at 187.\n\n          D. Her husband, Paul [who had died in 1981],\n          would often walk down behind the house, in the\n          forest by the Aberjona River, on the land\n          owned by Riley.     He would return from his\n          walks and tell her about the barrels and piles\n          of debris he'd seen there, and how sludge\n          waste from the tannery would flow down the\n          hill and onto the land. In the years before\n\n                              -33-\n\fPaul's death in 1981, recalled Ruth, he often\nawoke in the middle of the night. On several\noccasions, he'd told Ruth about hearing the\nsounds of trucks at two or three o'clock in\nthe morning. He had said that he could see\nthe headlights of flatbed trucks full of\nbarrels driving up the access dirt road onto\nthe fifteen acres. \"They're dumping stuff in\nthe middle of the night,\" Ruth recalled his\nsaying. A Civil Action at 188.\n\nE.    It seemed that everyone but Riley\nrecognized the fifteen acres as a toxic waste\ndump.    Riley must have known about the\ncondition of the property. Perhaps, thought\nSchlichtmann, the tanner really had been\nrunning an unauthorized waste dump. Perhaps\nhe had charged his neighbor, Whitney Barrel, a\nfee for the use of the land. A Civil Action at\n191-92.\n\nF. If this material was indeed tannery waste,\nthen how had it become contaminated with TCE,\nwhich Riley claimed he had never used?     It\nwas, of course, possible that someone else --\nWhitney, perhaps -- had dumped TCE on top of\nit.   That was possible, but to Schlichtmann\nthe most logical explanation was that it had\nall come from the same place. And if that was\ntrue, it meant that Riley had lied about TCE.\nA Civil Action at 193.\n\nG. \"Yeah, great,\" said Schlichtmann, his head\nbowed,  his   voice   soft.     \"That's   good\nshowmanship, but I've got to get evidence in.\"\n       \"My God, this is the guy who killed\nyour kids!\" yelled Neville.    \"You should be\nattacking him with a fucking baseball bat!\nYou shouldn't be asking him\" -- Neville\nadopted a mincing tone -- \"And then what did\nyou do next, Mr. Riley?\" . . . .\n       [Schlichtmann's colleagues continue to\ncoach him.   The scene concludes with Kiley\nsaying to Schlichtmann:] \"In my eleven years\nof trial experience, you've got more shit to\nuse on this guy than I've ever seen before.\n\n                    -34-\n\fYou can fucking destroy him.   What does it\ntake to get you mad?\" A Civil Action at 311.\nH. \"Riley surprised me today,\" [Schlichtmann's\npartner Conway] said.    \"He came off looking\nbetter than he should have.        He was so\narrogant and combative in his deposition.\"\n       \"He's a liar but he's not stupid,\" said\nSchlichtmann. A Civil Action at 312.\n\nI. \"It was great, wasn't it, Charlie! Why\nwould Riley immediately make the connection\nbetween TCE and destroying records? Because\nhe was covering up! The jury understood that,\ndidn't they?\" A Civil Action, p. 315.\n\nJ. When Riley had sat on the witness stand,\n[Schlichtmann had] wanted to turn to the\njurors and say, \"See? This man is lying now.\"\n A Civil Action at 371.\n\nK.   Back in the car, Schlichtmann told [his\nlaw partner], \"We've opened the box and the\nworms are starting to crawl out. This isn't\njust hiding evidence, this is destroying\nevidence.\" A Civil Action at 470.\n\nL. Riley returned to the courtroom in early\nMarch, three years after first taking the\nwitness stand during trial. Back then, he'd\nbeen aggressive and antagonistic, but now he\nlooked sickly, moody, and listless. He paced\nin the corridor, eyes narrowed and suspicious,\nmouth tightly compressed.

Riley, Jr., sued Harr and his publisher for defamation and related torts. He was joined in that lawsuit by his wife, Diane W. Riley. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on most of the Rileys' claims on First Amendment grounds. The Rileys appeal the district court's disposition of their claims. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a brief overview of the events described in <i>A Civil Action</i> (the Book) that pertain to this case; the specific statements to which Riley objects are discussed in turn <i>infra,</i> and are also set forth in an appendix to this opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The Book, first published in 1995, was on the <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller List for over two years and has been made into a motion picture. The Book received much critical acclaim and has been required reading in law school courses. It purports to be a nonfictional account of a toxic tort lawsuit (the \"<i>Anderson</i> litigation\") brought by some residents of Woburn, Massachusetts, alleging that defendants Beatrice Foods Company (Beatrice), W.R. Grace &amp; Company (Grace), and others were responsible for the contamination of two municipal water wells (Wells G and H) in the Aberjona River Valley with toxic solvents, including trichloroethylene (TCE).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The <i>Anderson</i> plaintiffs claimed that contaminated well water had caused them and their children to contract various ailments, including several fatal cases of leukemia, and that some of the TCE found in Wells G and H had come from a tannery operated by Riley (the \"tannery\"). Beatrice had assumed the tannery's environmental liabilities when it purchased the tannery in 1978.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The plaintiffs' theory was that Riley or his subordinates had dumped TCE on a fifteen acre parcel of undeveloped land between the tannery and the contaminated wells (the \"fifteen acres\"), and that the TCE had migrated into Wells G and H.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Book tells the story of the <i>Anderson</i> litigation primarily from the perspective of the plaintiffs' attorney, Jan Schlichtmann, recounting his struggle to prove that Riley's tannery and defendant Grace were responsible for the contamination of Wells G and H.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Book describes evidence which, in Schlichtmann's view, tended to show that the tannery had dumped waste laced with TCE on the fifteen acres, and repeatedly suggests that Riley's denials that such dumping had occurred were false. Although Schlichtmann is the Book's protagonist, and granted Harr extensive access to his law firm during the litigation, Harr's account of his efforts is by no means uncritical. As Schlichtmann builds his case, Harr points out both its strengths and its weaknesses. Harr also conducted extensive interviews with attorneys for the <i>Anderson</i> defendants, and the Book recounts the grounds for their rejection of Schlichtmann's theories. The Book also notes Schlichtmann's failure to find direct proof of dumping by the tannery, Riley's steadfast denials of Schlichtmann's allegations, the conflicting views of experts on each side of the case, and the 1986 jury verdict in federal district court which rejected the plaintiffs' claims against the tannery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trial was over, Schlichtmann discovered a report which Yankee Environmental Engineering and Research Services, Inc. (Yankee) had completed for Riley in 1983. The report stated that tannery waste had been dumped on a hillside leading to the fifteen acres, and that groundwater under the tannery flowed toward Wells G and H. Schlichtmann moved to set aside the verdict on the basis of this newly discovered evidence, which he argued should have been produced during discovery, and tracked down new witnesses who described the removal from the fifteen acres of what Schlichtmann believed to have been tannery waste. The district court conducted a hearing and found that Riley had engaged in \"concealment\" of the Yankee report that was \"deliberate,\" a determination which the Book reports as follows: \"The judge found that Riley had committed perjury and that [his attorney] was guilty of `deliberate misconduct' in failing to give Schlichtmann the Yankee report.\" The court concluded, however, that a new trial was not warranted because \"there was no available competent evidence tending to establish the disposal of complaint chemicals by the defendant ... either at the tannery site or on the 15 acres.\" <i>Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co.,</i> 129 F.R.D. 394, 400 (D.Mass.1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley took exception to a number of statements about him in the Book. In 1998 he commenced this action against Harr and his publishers, Random House, Inc. and Vintage Books (a division of Random House), in New Hampshire Superior Court. Defendants removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Riley's amended complaint challenged twelve statements in the Book in seven counts: (I) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (II) slander (against Harr only); (III) defamation; (IV) invasion of privacy &#8212; public disclosure of private facts; (V) invasion of privacy &#8212; placing the plaintiff in a false light; (VI) loss of consortium; and (VII) a demand for enhanced compensatory damages. Reduced to its essence, Riley's action seeks to hold Harr liable for wrongly describing him as a liar (<i>see</i> Statements C, D, E, F, H, I, J, and K <i>infra</i>), a perjurer (<i>see</i> Statement A <i>infra</i>), a \"kille[r]\" (<i>see</i> Statement G <i>infra</i>), a depressive (<i>see</i> Statement L <i>infra</i>) (or, in the alternative, for disclosing the private fact of his depression), and a bully (<i>see</i> Statement B <i>infra</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss Riley's complaint, or in the alternative for summary judgment. The district court treated their motion as one for summary judgment, and in a lengthy, thoughtful order dated March 31, 2000, granted the motion with respect to most of Riley's claims. The order denied Harr's motion for summary judgment as to two of the twelve statements, and denied his motion to dismiss Riley's slander claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Following limited discovery, the parties stipulated on March 26, 2001, to the dismissal of those claims that had survived the district court's order of March 31, 2000. On April 25, 2001, Riley filed a notice of appeal of the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

General Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he First Amendment to the United States Constitution place[s] limits on the application of the state law of defamation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.,</i> 497 U.S. 1, 14, 110 S.Ct. 2695, 111 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990). In the wake of <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), the Supreme Court has developed an elaborate body of law that defines those limits. In the case of a public-figure plaintiff the First Amendment requires clear and convincing proof of actual malice on the part of the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</i> 418 U.S. 323, 342-43, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974). A private-figure plaintiff such as Riley need not demonstrate actual malice, but \"must bear the burden of showing that the speech at issue is false before recovering damages for defamation from a media defendant.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps,</i> 475 U.S. 767, 777, 106 S.Ct. 1558, 89 L.Ed.2d 783 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has also recognized \"constitutional limits on the <i>type</i> of speech which may be the subject of state defamation actions.\" <i>Milkovich,</i> 497 U.S. at 16, 110 S.Ct. 2695 (emphasis in original). In <i>Milkovich,</i> a case involving a media defendant, the Court held that \"a statement on matters of public concern must be provable as false before there can be liability under state defamation law.\" 497 U.S. at 19, 110 S.Ct. 2695. <i>Milkovich</i> also rejected the proposition that the First Amendment creates a blanket exception to state defamation law for \"statements which are categorized as `opinion' as opposed to `fact.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> <i>Id.</i> at 17, 110 S.Ct. 2695. The Court pointed out that \"expressions of `opinion' may often imply an assertion of objective fact,\" <i>id.</i> at 18, 110 S.Ct. 2695, and \"[it] would be destructive of the law of libel if a writer could escape liability for accusations of [defamatory conduct] simply by using, explicitly or implicitly, the words, `I think.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 19, 110 S.Ct. 2695 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As we observed in a subsequent decision, \"[a] statement couched as an opinion that presents or implies the existence of facts which are capable of being proven true or false can be actionable.\" <i>Levinsky's, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 127 F.3d 122, 127 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, and of central importance in this case, even a provably false statement is not actionable if \"`it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective view, an interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise, rather than claiming to be in possession of objectively verifiable facts....'\" <i>Gray v. St. Martin's Press, Inc.,</i> 221 F.3d 243, 248 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>Haynes v. Alfred A. Knopf. Inc.,</i> 8 F.3d 1222, 1227 (7th Cir.1993)). As the Ninth Circuit has explained, \"when an author outlines the facts available to him, thus making it clear that the challenged statements represent his own interpretation of those facts and leaving the reader free to draw his own conclusions, those statements are generally protected by the First Amendment.\" <i>Partington v. Bugliosi,</i> 56 F.3d 1147, 1156-57 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We applied these principles in <i>Phantom Touring, Inc. v. Affiliated Publications,</i> 953 F.2d 724 (1st Cir.1992). The plaintiff, producer of a version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" that was <i>not</i> the successful and acclaimed Broadway show created by Andrew Lloyd Webber, sued the Boston Globe for defamation, claiming that certain Globe articles had falsely accused it of endeavoring to pass off its own production as the Broadway version. <i>Id.</i> at 725. We held that although the allegation of deliberate deception might be provable as true or false, \"[t]he sum effect of the format, tone and entire content of the articles is to make it unmistakably clear that [the author] was expressing a point of view only,\" rather than \"stating `actual facts' about [the plaintiff's] honesty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 729 (citation omitted). We explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of greatest importance ... is the breadth of [the] articles, which not only discussed all the facts underlying [the author's] views but also gave information from which readers might draw contrary conclusions. In effect, the articles offered a self-contained give-and-take, a kind of verbal debate.... Because all sides of the issue, as well as the rationale for [the author's] view, were exposed, the assertion of deceit reasonably could be understood only as [the author's] personal conclusion about the information presented....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 730.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then distinguished the facts in <i>Milkovich,</i> where the author of a newspaper column charging that a high school wrestling coach had lied about his behavior at a meet informed his readers that he was in \"a unique position\" to know that the coach had lied because he had personally observed the relevant events. 497 U.S. at 5, n. 2, 110 S.Ct. 2695. We wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the article in <i>Milkovich,</i> unlike [the] \"Phantom\" columns, was not based on facts accessible to everyone. Indeed, a reader reasonably could have understood the reporter in <i>Milkovich</i> to be suggesting that he was singularly capable of evaluating the plaintiffs' conduct. In contrast, neither of [the Globe] columns indicated that [the author], or anyone else, had more information about Phantom Touring's marketing practices than was reported in the articles. While [the Globe's] readers implicitly were invited to draw their own conclusions from the mixed information provided, the <i>Milkovich</i> readers implicitly were told that only one conclusion was possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 730-31. <i>See Moldea v.

In making this determination, we look not just at the specific statements complained of, but also at \"the general tenor of the [Book]\" and the context in which the challenged statements are set. <i>Milkovich,</i> 497 U.S. at 21, 110 S.Ct. 2695. We are mindful that the subject of <i>A Civil Action</i> &#8212; a controversial lawsuit and the disputed events underlying it &#8212; \"is one about which there could easily be a number of varying rational interpretations,\" and that in writing about such \"inherently ambiguous\" subjects, an author who \"fairly describes the general events involved and offers his personal perspective about some of [the] ambiguities and disputed facts\" should not be subject to a defamation action. <i>Partington,</i> 56 F.3d at 1154. Otherwise, authors would hesitate to venture beyond \"dry, colorless descriptions of facts, bereft of analysis or insight,\" and the threat of defamation lawsuits would discourage \"expressions of opinion by commentators, experts in a field, figures closely involved in a public controversy, or others whose perspectives might be of interest to the public\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have observed that \"when defamation issues implicate free speech concerns.... appellate judges must conduct a whole-record review and `examine for themselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see ... whether they are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment' protect.\" <i>Levinsky's,</i> 127 F.3d at 127 (quoting <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)). Therefore, \"the courts treat the issue of labeling a statement as verifiable fact or as [protected] opinion as one ordinarily decided by judges as a matter of law.\" <i>Gray,</i> 221 F.3d at 248, citing <i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,</i> 466 U.S. 485, 510-11, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Challenged Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To put the challenged statements in context, we follow the district court's helpful practice of quoting some of the text surrounding the specific language cited in Riley's complaint. The specific language Riley complains of is indicated in bold. We adopt the letters used by Riley to designate the statements at issue. We depart somewhat from the usual letter sequencing, however, to discuss the statements in a more logical order. We address in turn statements suggesting that Riley is a liar (in the order of our discussion, statements C, E, F, H, J, I, K and D); a perjurer (Statement A); and a killer (Statement G).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement C</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statement C describes Schlichtmann's reaction to the discovery of a document indicating that tannery waste had been deposited on the fifteen acres in 1956:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This document was thirty years old and it dealt only with tannery waste, which might or might not have contained TCE. But even so, Schlichtmann thought it had great value. Riley had sworn at his deposition that he had never dumped anything on the fifteen acres. Riley had lied then, and Schlichtmann &#8212; who didn't need much convincing &#8212; believed that Riley was also lying about using TCE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assertion in Statement C that Riley had lied in the course of the <i>Anderson</i> litigation is, in principle, \"provable as false.\" <i>Milkovich,</i> 497 U.S. at 19, 110 S.Ct. 2695. A statement is not actionable, however, if \"it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective view, an interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise.\" <i>Gray,</i> 221 F.3d at 248 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Statement C \"is clearly written in Schlichtmann's voice,\" reporting his \"inner musings about the evidence he was gathering,\" and therefore \"could not be construed by a reasonable reader as [an] assertion[] of fact.\" Riley concedes that the assertion about Riley that follows the words \"Schlichtmann... believed\" represents Schlichtmann's view of Riley's testimony, but asserts that the phrase \"Riley had lied then\" constitutes Harr's own factual claim. We agree with the district court that the phrase \"Riley had lied then\" &#8212; coming almost immediately after and elaborating upon the sentence \"But even so, Schlichtmann thought it had great value,\" and situated in a section of the Book that recounts Schlichtmann's efforts to build a case against the tannery &#8212; is Schlichtmann's conclusion, not Harr's. As Harr points out, \"[t]he law does not force writers to clumsily begin each and every sentence with `Schlichtmann felt'\" in order to indicate that a statement is being attributed to Schlichtmann. As Statement C is cast as Schlichtmann's assessment of Riley's testimony, and follows a summary of the evidence upon which it is based (the document reporting the discovery of tannery waste on the fifteen acres), it amounts to \"a subjective view, an interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise,\" not an assertion of objective fact based on undisclosed evidence. <i>Gray,</i> 221 F.3d at 248 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if we accepted Riley's premise that the statement \"Riley had lied then\" constitutes Harr's own declaration that Riley had uttered a falsehood, the statement would still be protected under the First Amendment. Like the allegedly defamatory newspaper articles in <i>Phantom Touring,</i> the Book \"not only discussed... the facts underlying [Harr's] views but also gave information from which readers might draw contrary conclusions.\" <i>Phantom Touring,</i> 953 F.2d at 730. For example, one page before Statement C, Harr writes that \"One after another, interviews with a dozen former tannery employees led Schlichtmann nowhere. None could recall using TCE, or dumping tannery waste ... on the fifteen acres.\" <i>A Civil Action</i> at 186. Immediately after Statement C, the Book reports Schlichtmann's discovery of a witness who seemed at first to offer compelling testimony that tannery waste had been dumped on the fifteen acres, but who (the Book acknowledges) turned out to lack credibility. <i>Id.</i> at 187-91. Later in the Book, Harr again states that \"Schlichtmann did not have eyewitnesses who could implicate John J. Riley in the contamination of the fifteen acres.\" <i>Id.</i> at 298. As we noted at the outset, the Book makes plain both the strengths and the weaknesses of the case against Riley. \"Because [both] sides of the issue, as well as the rationale for [Harr's] view, were exposed, the assertion of deceit reasonably could be understood only as [Harr's] personal conclusion about the information presented,\" not as a statement of objective fact based on undisclosed evidence. <i>Phantom Touring,</i> 953 F.2d at 730.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Riley's claim that Harr's explanatory \"To the Reader\" and \"Note on Sources\" sections, detailing his extensive access to Schlichtmann during the <i>Anderson</i> trial and the voluminous research he conducted in writing the Book, signal to the reader that every conclusion the book attributes to Schlichtmann amounts to an assertion by Harr of verifiable, objective fact. Harr's purpose in notifying the reader of his extensive access to Schlichtmann is plainly not to establish that Schlichtmann is an omniscient figure whose inferences are all correct. Rather, his point is simply that he was well positioned to tell the story of the <i>Anderson</i> litigation from Schlichtmann's vantage point, and to describe the attorney's subjective experience of the chronicled events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement E</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like Statement C, Statement E appears in the section of the Book which describes Schlichtmann's efforts to build a case against Riley's tannery:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seemed that everyone but Riley recognized the fifteen acres as a toxic waste dump. Riley <i>must</i> have known about the condition of the property. Perhaps, thought Schlichtmann, the tanner really had been running an unauthorized waste dump. Perhaps he had charged his neighbor, Whitney Barrel, a fee for the use of the land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with Statement C, Riley argues that the district court erred in finding that the first two sentences of Statement E were written in Schlichtmann's voice, rather than in Harr's. But the context in which Statement E is set makes clear that it describes Schlichtmann's thinking as he worked to assemble a case against the tannery. Moreover, as with Statement C, Statement E would be non-actionable even if it were deemed to recount Harr's own evaluation of Riley's state of mind, as it is based on evidence &#8212; some pointing in one direction, some in the other &#8212; which the Book describes in substantial detail. <i>Phantom Touring,</i> 953 F.2d at 730.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley asserts that <i>Phantom Touring</i> is inapposite because Harr failed to report that some of Schlichtmann's own investigators had concluded that the tannery was not responsible for the contamination of the fifteen acres. Although the Book does not mention this specific fact, it does report evidence (some of which we describe in connection with Statement C <i>supra</i>) tending to negate Schlichtmann's theory of the case. Harr was not required to report every single fact about the <i>Anderson</i> litigation, but was free to make his own editorial choices, so long as he \"fairly describe[d] the general events involved.\" <i>Partington,</i> 56 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement F</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statement F refers to a substance which Schlichtmann's investigators discovered on the fifteen acres having the characteristics of tannery waste and containing TCE:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this material was indeed tannery waste, then how had it become contaminated with TCE, which Riley claimed he had never used? It was, of course, possible that someone else &#8212; Whitney, perhaps &#8212; had dumped TCE on top of it. That was possible, but to Schlichtmann the most logical explanation was that it had all come from the same place.

The Book reports Riley's repeated denials of TCE use, and notes Schlichtmann's failure to discover conclusive evidence to the contrary. Having set out the evidence for the reader to weigh, Harr cannot be subject to defamation liability for failing to endorse Riley's version of events. <i>Partington,</i> 56 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley is simply wrong to assert that the Book fails to disclose the facts upon which Statement F is based, and that Statement F implies the existence of undisclosed facts.

Harr is right to observe that the implication of this argument would be that \"an author cannot write a book describing in chronological order an attorney's efforts to try a case,\" but instead \"must reveal the end result of every legal hunch immediately.\" <i>A Civil Action</i> is meant to be read as a whole; we decline to impose on authors the nonsensical requirement that all points of view be set forth at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement D</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his quest for evidence that Riley's tannery had contaminated the fifteen acres with TCE, Schlichtmann's private investigator interviewed Ruth Turner (a pseudonym), an elderly woman who lived near the tannery:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her husband, Paul [who had died in 1981], would often walk down behind the house, in the forest by the Aberjona River, on the land owned by Riley. He would return from his walks and tell her about the barrels and piles of debris he'd seen there, and how sludge waste from the tannery would flow down the hill and onto the land. In the years before Paul's death in 1981, recalled Ruth, he often awoke in the middle of the night. On several occasions, he'd told Ruth about hearing the sounds of trucks at two or three o'clock in the morning. He had said that he could see the headlights of flatbed trucks full of barrels driving up the access dirt road onto the fifteen acres. \"They're dumping stuff in the middle of the night,\" Ruth recalled his saying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley contends that a reader \"could understand the passage as stating that Riley did, in fact, dump illegal material on the 15 acres.\" However, the Book makes clear that despite his suspicions, Schlichtmann never succeeded in proving that Riley was responsible for illegal dumping. Read in context, Statement D describes a piece of evidence which suggested to Schlichtmann that the tannery had contaminated the 15 acres with TCE, but did not prove that it had done so. It is this unmistakable theme of the Book &#8212; Schlichtmann's inability to move from theory, conjecture, and surmise to actual proof &#8212; which Riley's complaint somehow overlooks. <i>See Gray,</i> 221 F.3d at 248 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement A</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the <i>Anderson</i> trial was over, Schlichtmann discovered that Riley, during the pendency of the <i>Anderson</i> litigation, had commissioned Yankee to conduct a hydrogeologic investigation of the tannery property. Yankee had written a report describing its findings, which was never produced for the plaintiffs during discovery. Nor was a subsequent report reevaluating Yankee's data. Judge Skinner ruled that Riley had engaged in deliberate concealment of the reports. The judge explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his testimony on deposition and at trial Riley denied the existence of these reports. With respect to each question, taken separately, the answer might be justified because of hypertechnical interpretations of the questions posed by the interrogator. (For instance, \"Did you test the sludge?\" Answer[:] \"No.\" Fact: He caused a test to be made by someone else.) Similarly one could quibble over the definition of the documents. There were enough such questions, however, so that any fair response should at one time or another have revealed the existence of these reports. In addition, Mr. Riley denied the existence of laboratory reports and chemical formulas which were clearly called for. Even allowing for Mr. Riley's apparent unsophistication and inarticulateness, I conclude that the pattern of evasive answers concerning these reports and the other documents by Mr. Riley requires a finding that the concealment was deliberate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Anderson v.

Although Judge Skinner did not say that Riley's actions met the legal definition of perjury, Harr's account is \"a rough-and-ready summary\" of the judge's ruling that is \"substantially correct.\" <i>Hayes,</i> 141 N.H. at 466, 685 A.2d 1237.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley argues that because the Book was published six years after Judge Skinner made his \"deliberate misconduct\" pronouncement, Harr \"had ample time to review the official record and accurately report the Court's findings.\" Riley declares that the non-contemporaneous nature of Harr's report somehow \"result[s] in the attenuation of the need for and purpose of the fair report privilege and `rough and ready' protection analysis.\" In a closer case we might deem a six year gap between the event reported and the publication of the report a factor to be weighed in evaluating the report's fairness. This is not a close case, however, and Riley offers no reason why we should reject the usual rule that \"a journalist's [substantially accurate] report need not describe legal proceedings in technically precise language\" simply because Harr had enough time, in principle, to master the precise legal meaning of the term \"perjury.\" <i>Ricci,</i> 574 F.Supp. at 1567.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement G</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Riley's first day on the witness stand, Schlichtmann's colleagues critiqued his examination of Riley.

In a sense, Statement G is \"rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet\" used by Neville to arouse Schlichtmann's fighting spirit. <i>Milkovich,</i> 497 U.S. at 17, 110 S.Ct. 2695 (quoting <i>Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Assn., Inc. v.

Even so, Statement G is non-actionable for the same reasons that the statements discussed <i>supra,</i> charging Riley with giving false testimony, are non-actionable.

We agree with the district court that it is unnecessary to decide whether the New Hampshire Supreme Court would recognize the false light tort because Riley's false light claim is \"a mere restatement of [his] defamation claim, but under a different name.\" Harr is therefore entitled to the same constitutional protections that compelled the district court to dismiss his defamation claims. <i>See Brown v. Hearst Corp.,</i> 54 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that where a false light claim is \"simply a restatement of [a] defamation claim under a different heading[,]... it is not imaginable that it could escape the same constitutional constraint as [the] defamation claim\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Back then, he'd been aggressive and antagonistic, but now he looked sickly, moody, and listless. He paced in the corridor, eyes narrowed and suspicious, mouth tightly compressed.

Eastman,</i> 106 N.H. 107, 111, 206 A.2d 239 (1964) (declaring that \"`a person who unreasonably and seriously interferes with another's interest in not having his affairs known to others ... is liable to the other'\") (quoting <i>Restatement of Torts</i> &#167; 867). However, the district court declared that the First Amendment \"protects the publication of private facts that are newsworthy, that is, of legitimate concern to the public. Even if the private fact is not itself newsworthy, its publication is still protected if it has substantial relevance to, or any substantial nexus with a newsworthy topic\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley does not challenge the district court's premise that Statement L is non-actionable if it is substantially relevant to the story told in the Book. He argues instead that the court erred in finding the fact of his depression to be relevant to the <i>Anderson</i> litigation. Assuming with the district court that New Hampshire would recognize a cause of action for public disclosure of private fact, and that this cause of action contemplates an exception for statements that are substantially relevant to a matter of legitimate public concern, we evaluate the relevance of Riley's depression to the story recounted in the Book.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevance of Statement L to the subject matter of the Book is unmistakable. The Book reports that Beatrice's attorney, concerned about Riley's performance on the witness stand during the post-trial hearing, \"would have liked to bring out the fact of Riley's depression in defense of the tanner's mental confusion and failures of memory, but Riley had told him, `I don't want to talk about that.'\" <i>A Civil Action</i> at 482. We also agree with Harr that one of the purposes of the Book was to chronicle \"the devastating emotional toll of the litigation on many of the participants,\" including Riley and Schlichtmann, the Book's protagonist. Under these circumstances, Riley's mental condition was relevant to the <i>Anderson</i> litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

Goodall,</i> 640 F.Supp. 1115, 1116 (D.N.H.1986)). We do not reach this question of New Hampshire law, however, because we are convinced that Riley's allegations, as a matter of law, do not rise to the level of \"`extreme and outrageous conduct'\" required to support an intentional infliction of emotional distress action. <i>Morancy v. Morancy,</i> 134 N.H. 493, 593 A.2d 1158, 1159 (1991) (quoting <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 46).

This document was thirty years old and it dealt only with tannery waste, which might or might not have contained TCE. But even so, Schlichtmann thought it had great value. Riley had sworn at his deposition that he had never dumped anything on the fifteen acres. Riley had lied then, and Schlichtmann &#8212; who didn't need much convincing &#8212; believed that Riley was also lying about using TCE. <i>A Civil Action</i> at 187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Her husband, Paul [who had died in 1981], would often walk down behind the house, in the forest by the Aberjona River, on the land owned by Riley. He would return from his walks and tell her about the barrels and piles of debris he'd seen there, and how sludge waste from the tannery would flow down the hill and onto the land. In the years before Paul's death in 1981, recalled Ruth, he often awoke in the middle of the night. On several occasions, he'd told Ruth about hearing the sounds of trucks at two or three o'clock in the morning. He had said that he could see the headlights of flatbed trucks: full of barrels driving up the access dirt road onto the fifteen acres. \"They're dumping stuff in the middle of the night,\" Ruth recalled his saying. <i>A Civil Action</i> at 188.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. It seemed that everyone but Riley recognized the fifteen acres as a toxic waste dump. Riley <i>must</i> have known about the condition of the property.

It was, of course, possible that someone else &#8212; Whitney, perhaps &#8212; had dumped TCE on top of it. That was possible, but to Schlichtmann the most logical explanation was that it had all come from the same place.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a brief overview of the events described in <i>A Civil Action</i> (the Book) that pertain to this case; the specific statements to which Riley objects are discussed in turn <i>infra,</i> and are also set forth in an appendix to this opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The Book, first published in 1995, was on the <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller List for over two years and has been made into a motion picture. The Book received much critical acclaim and has been required reading in law school courses. It purports to be a nonfictional account of a toxic tort lawsuit (the \"<i>Anderson</i> litigation\") brought by some residents of Woburn, Massachusetts, alleging that defendants Beatrice Foods Company (Beatrice), W.R. Grace &amp; Company (Grace), and others were responsible for the contamination of two municipal water wells (Wells G and H) in the Aberjona River Valley with toxic solvents, including trichloroethylene (TCE).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The <i>Anderson</i> plaintiffs claimed that contaminated well water had caused them and their children to contract various ailments, including several fatal cases of leukemia, and that some of the TCE found in Wells G and H had come from a tannery operated by Riley (the \"tannery\"). Beatrice had assumed the tannery's environmental liabilities when it purchased the tannery in 1978.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The plaintiffs' theory was that Riley or his subordinates had dumped TCE on a fifteen acre parcel of undeveloped land between the tannery and the contaminated wells (the \"fifteen acres\"), and that the TCE had migrated into Wells G and H.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Book tells the story of the <i>Anderson</i> litigation primarily from the perspective of the plaintiffs' attorney, Jan Schlichtmann, recounting his struggle to prove that Riley's tannery and defendant Grace were responsible for the contamination of Wells G and H.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Book describes evidence which, in Schlichtmann's view, tended to show that the tannery had dumped waste laced with TCE on the fifteen acres, and repeatedly suggests that Riley's denials that such dumping had occurred were false. Although Schlichtmann is the Book's protagonist, and granted Harr extensive access to his law firm during the litigation, Harr's account of his efforts is by no means uncritical. As Schlichtmann builds his case, Harr points out both its strengths and its weaknesses. Harr also conducted extensive interviews with attorneys for the <i>Anderson</i> defendants, and the Book recounts the grounds for their rejection of Schlichtmann's theories. The Book also notes Schlichtmann's failure to find direct proof of dumping by the tannery, Riley's steadfast denials of Schlichtmann's allegations, the conflicting views of experts on each side of the case, and the 1986 jury verdict in federal district court which rejected the plaintiffs' claims against the tannery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trial was over, Schlichtmann discovered a report which Yankee Environmental Engineering and Research Services, Inc. (Yankee) had completed for Riley in 1983. The report stated that tannery waste had been dumped on a hillside leading to the fifteen acres, and that groundwater under the tannery flowed toward Wells G and H. Schlichtmann moved to set aside the verdict on the basis of this newly discovered evidence, which he argued should have been produced during discovery, and tracked down new witnesses who described the removal from the fifteen acres of what Schlichtmann believed to have been tannery waste. The district court conducted a hearing and found that Riley had engaged in \"concealment\" of the Yankee report that was \"deliberate,\" a determination which the Book reports as follows: \"The judge found that Riley had committed perjury and that [his attorney] was guilty of `deliberate misconduct' in failing to give Schlichtmann the Yankee report.\" The court concluded, however, that a new trial was not warranted because \"there was no available competent evidence tending to establish the disposal of complaint chemicals by the defendant ... either at the tannery site or on the 15 acres.\" <i>Anderson v.

In 1998 he commenced this action against Harr and his publishers, Random House, Inc. and Vintage Books (a division of Random House), in New Hampshire Superior Court. Defendants removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Riley's amended complaint challenged twelve statements in the Book in seven counts: (I) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (II) slander (against Harr only); (III) defamation; (IV) invasion of privacy &#8212; public disclosure of private facts; (V) invasion of privacy &#8212; placing the plaintiff in a false light; (VI) loss of consortium; and (VII) a demand for enhanced compensatory damages. Reduced to its essence, Riley's action seeks to hold Harr liable for wrongly describing him as a liar (<i>see</i> Statements C, D, E, F, H, I, J, and K <i>infra</i>), a perjurer (<i>see</i> Statement A <i>infra</i>), a \"kille[r]\" (<i>see</i> Statement G <i>infra</i>), a depressive (<i>see</i> Statement L <i>infra</i>) (or, in the alternative, for disclosing the private fact of his depression), and a bully (<i>see</i> Statement B <i>infra</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss Riley's complaint, or in the alternative for summary judgment. The district court treated their motion as one for summary judgment, and in a lengthy, thoughtful order dated March 31, 2000, granted the motion with respect to most of Riley's claims. The order denied Harr's motion for summary judgment as to two of the twelve statements, and denied his motion to dismiss Riley's slander claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Following limited discovery, the parties stipulated on March 26, 2001, to the dismissal of those claims that had survived the district court's order of March 31, 2000.

The specific language Riley complains of is indicated in bold. We adopt the letters used by Riley to designate the statements at issue. We depart somewhat from the usual letter sequencing, however, to discuss the statements in a more logical order. We address in turn statements suggesting that Riley is a liar (in the order of our discussion, statements C, E, F, H, J, I, K and D); a perjurer (Statement A); and a killer (Statement G).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement C</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statement C describes Schlichtmann's reaction to the discovery of a document indicating that tannery waste had been deposited on the fifteen acres in 1956:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This document was thirty years old and it dealt only with tannery waste, which might or might not have contained TCE. But even so, Schlichtmann thought it had great value. Riley had sworn at his deposition that he had never dumped anything on the fifteen acres. Riley had lied then, and Schlichtmann &#8212; who didn't need much convincing &#8212; believed that Riley was also lying about using TCE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assertion in Statement C that Riley had lied in the course of the <i>Anderson</i> litigation is, in principle, \"provable as false.\" <i>Milkovich,</i> 497 U.S. at 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112470\"><a href=\"/opinion/112470/milkovich-v-lorain-journal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2695</span></a></span>. A statement is not actionable, however, if \"it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective view, an interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise.\" <i>Gray,</i> 221 F.3d at 248 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Statement C \"is clearly written in Schlichtmann's voice,\" reporting his \"inner musings about the evidence he was gathering,\" and therefore \"could not be construed by a reasonable reader as [an] assertion[] of fact.\" Riley concedes that the assertion about Riley that follows the words \"Schlichtmann... believed\" represents Schlichtmann's view of Riley's testimony, but asserts that the phrase \"Riley had lied then\" constitutes Harr's own factual claim. We agree with the district court that the phrase \"Riley had lied then\" &#8212; coming almost immediately after and elaborating upon the sentence \"But even so, Schlichtmann thought it had great value,\" and situated in a section of the Book that recounts Schlichtmann's efforts to build a case against the tannery &#8212; is Schlichtmann's conclusion, not Harr's. As Harr points out, \"[t]he law does not force writers to clumsily begin each and every sentence with `Schlichtmann felt'\" in order to indicate that a statement is being attributed to Schlichtmann. As Statement C is cast as Schlichtmann's assessment of Riley's testimony, and follows a summary of the evidence upon which it is based (the document reporting the discovery of tannery waste on the fifteen acres), it amounts to \"a subjective view, an interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise,\" not an assertion of objective fact based on undisclosed evidence. <i>Gray,</i> 221 F.3d at 248 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if we accepted Riley's premise that the statement \"Riley had lied then\" constitutes Harr's own declaration that Riley had uttered a falsehood, the statement would still be protected under the First Amendment. Like the allegedly defamatory newspaper articles in <i>Phantom Touring,</i> the Book \"not only discussed... the facts underlying [Harr's] views but also gave information from which readers might draw contrary conclusions.\" <i>Phantom Touring,</i> 953 F.2d at 730. For example, one page before Statement C, Harr writes that \"One after another, interviews with a dozen former tannery employees led Schlichtmann nowhere. None could recall using TCE, or dumping tannery waste ... on the fifteen acres.\" <i>A Civil Action</i> at 186. Immediately after Statement C, the Book reports Schlichtmann's discovery of a witness who seemed at first to offer compelling testimony that tannery waste had been dumped on the fifteen acres, but who (the Book acknowledges) turned out to lack credibility. <i>Id.</i> at 187-91. Later in the Book, Harr again states that \"Schlichtmann did not have eyewitnesses who could implicate John J. Riley in the contamination of the fifteen acres.\" <i>Id.</i> at 298. As we noted at the outset, the Book makes plain both the strengths and the weaknesses of the case against Riley. \"Because [both] sides of the issue, as well as the rationale for [Harr's] view, were exposed, the assertion of deceit reasonably could be understood only as [Harr's] personal conclusion about the information presented,\" not as a statement of objective fact based on undisclosed evidence. <i>Phantom Touring,</i> 953 F.2d at 730.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Riley's claim that Harr's explanatory \"To the Reader\" and \"Note on Sources\" sections, detailing his extensive access to Schlichtmann during the <i>Anderson</i> trial and the voluminous research he conducted in writing the Book, signal to the reader that every conclusion the book attributes to Schlichtmann amounts to an assertion by Harr of verifiable, objective fact. Harr's purpose in notifying the reader of his extensive access to Schlichtmann is plainly not to establish that Schlichtmann is an omniscient figure whose inferences are all correct. Rather, his point is simply that he was well positioned to tell the story of the <i>Anderson</i> litigation from Schlichtmann's vantage point, and to describe the attorney's subjective experience of the chronicled events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement E</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like Statement C, Statement E appears in the section of the Book which describes Schlichtmann's efforts to build a case against Riley's tannery:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seemed that everyone but Riley recognized the fifteen acres as a toxic waste dump. Riley <i>must</i> have known about the condition of the property. Perhaps, thought Schlichtmann, the tanner really had been running an unauthorized waste dump. Perhaps he had charged his neighbor, Whitney Barrel, a fee for the use of the land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with Statement C, Riley argues that the district court erred in finding that the first two sentences of Statement E were written in Schlichtmann's voice, rather than in Harr's. But the context in which Statement E is set makes clear that it describes Schlichtmann's thinking as he worked to assemble a case against the tannery. Moreover, as with Statement C, Statement E would be non-actionable even if it were deemed to recount Harr's own evaluation of Riley's state of mind, as it is based on evidence &#8212; some pointing in one direction, some in the other &#8212; which the Book describes in substantial detail. <i>Phantom Touring,</i> 953 F.2d at 730.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley asserts that <i>Phantom Touring</i> is inapposite because Harr failed to report that some of Schlichtmann's own investigators had concluded that the tannery was not responsible for the contamination of the fifteen acres. Although the Book does not mention this specific fact, it does report evidence (some of which we describe in connection with Statement C <i>supra</i>) tending to negate Schlichtmann's theory of the case.

The Book reports Riley's repeated denials of TCE use, and notes Schlichtmann's failure to discover conclusive evidence to the contrary. Having set out the evidence for the reader to weigh, Harr cannot be subject to defamation liability for failing to endorse Riley's version of events. <i>Partington,</i> 56 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley is simply wrong to assert that the Book fails to disclose the facts upon which Statement F is based, and that Statement F implies the existence of undisclosed facts.

Harr is right to observe that the implication of this argument would be that \"an author cannot write a book describing in chronological order an attorney's efforts to try a case,\" but instead \"must reveal the end result of every legal hunch immediately.\" <i>A Civil Action</i> is meant to be read as a whole; we decline to impose on authors the nonsensical requirement that all points of view be set forth at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement D</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his quest for evidence that Riley's tannery had contaminated the fifteen acres with TCE, Schlichtmann's private investigator interviewed Ruth Turner (a pseudonym), an elderly woman who lived near the tannery:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her husband, Paul [who had died in 1981], would often walk down behind the house, in the forest by the Aberjona River, on the land owned by Riley. He would return from his walks and tell her about the barrels and piles of debris he'd seen there, and how sludge waste from the tannery would flow down the hill and onto the land. In the years before Paul's death in 1981, recalled Ruth, he often awoke in the middle of the night. On several occasions, he'd told Ruth about hearing the sounds of trucks at two or three o'clock in the morning. He had said that he could see the headlights of flatbed trucks full of barrels driving up the access dirt road onto the fifteen acres. \"They're dumping stuff in the middle of the night,\" Ruth recalled his saying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley contends that a reader \"could understand the passage as stating that Riley did, in fact, dump illegal material on the 15 acres.\" However, the Book makes clear that despite his suspicions, Schlichtmann never succeeded in proving that Riley was responsible for illegal dumping. Read in context, Statement D describes a piece of evidence which suggested to Schlichtmann that the tannery had contaminated the 15 acres with TCE, but did not prove that it had done so. It is this unmistakable theme of the Book &#8212; Schlichtmann's inability to move from theory, conjecture, and surmise to actual proof &#8212; which Riley's complaint somehow overlooks. <i>See Gray,</i> 221 F.3d at 248 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement A</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the <i>Anderson</i> trial was over, Schlichtmann discovered that Riley, during the pendency of the <i>Anderson</i> litigation, had commissioned Yankee to conduct a hydrogeologic investigation of the tannery property. Yankee had written a report describing its findings, which was never produced for the plaintiffs during discovery. Nor was a subsequent report reevaluating Yankee's data. Judge Skinner ruled that Riley had engaged in deliberate concealment of the reports. The judge explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his testimony on deposition and at trial Riley denied the existence of these reports. With respect to each question, taken separately, the answer might be justified because of hypertechnical interpretations of the questions posed by the interrogator. (For instance, \"Did you test the sludge?\" Answer[:] \"No.\" Fact: He caused a test to be made by someone else.) Similarly one could quibble over the definition of the documents. There were enough such questions, however, so that any fair response should at one time or another have revealed the existence of these reports. In addition, Mr. Riley denied the existence of laboratory reports and chemical formulas which were clearly called for. Even allowing for Mr. Riley's apparent unsophistication and inarticulateness, I conclude that the pattern of evasive answers concerning these reports and the other documents by Mr. Riley requires a finding that the concealment was deliberate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Anderson v.

This is not a close case, however, and Riley offers no reason why we should reject the usual rule that \"a journalist's [substantially accurate] report need not describe legal proceedings in technically precise language\" simply because Harr had enough time, in principle, to master the precise legal meaning of the term \"perjury.\" <i>Ricci,</i> 574 F.Supp. at 1567.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Statement G</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Riley's first day on the witness stand, Schlichtmann's colleagues critiqued his examination of Riley.

Hearst Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196062\"><a href=\"/opinion/196062/brown-v-hearst-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that where a false light claim is \"simply a restatement of [a] defamation claim under a different heading[,]... it is not imaginable that it could escape the same constitutional constraint as [the] defamation claim\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Public Disclosure of Private Fact</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statement L describes Riley's appearance at the post-trial hearing on the failure of the defendants to produce certain documents:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley returned to the courtroom in early March, three years after first taking the witness stand during trial. Back then, he'd been aggressive and antagonistic, but now he looked sickly, moody, and listless. He paced in the corridor, eyes narrowed and suspicious, mouth tightly compressed. He was in his mid-sixties, suffering from episodes of depression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court denied Harr's motion for summary judgment on Riley's <i>defamation</i> claim as to Statement L, deeming it to be a non-protected assertion of the verifiable fact that Riley had experienced episodes of depression, it granted summary judgment on Riley's public disclosure of private fact claim on the ground that his depression was substantially relevant to the <i>Anderson</i> litigation, a matter of legitimate public concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> In assessing Riley's public disclosure of private fact claim, we must assume that Statement L is <i>true</i> (otherwise it would not amount to the disclosure of a private \"fact.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the New Hampshire Supreme Court would recognize, if it had not already done so by implication, a cause of action for public disclosure of private fact. <i>See Hamberger v. Eastman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1512831\"><a href=\"/opinion/1512831/hamberger-v-eastman/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 111, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></span> (1964) (declaring that \"`a person who unreasonably and seriously interferes with another's interest in not having his affairs known to others ... is liable to the other'\") (quoting <i>Restatement of Torts</i> &#167; 867). However, the district court declared that the First Amendment \"protects the publication of private facts that are newsworthy, that is, of legitimate concern to the public. Even if the private fact is not itself newsworthy, its publication is still protected if it has substantial relevance to, or any substantial nexus with a newsworthy topic\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley does not challenge the district court's premise that Statement L is non-actionable if it is substantially relevant to the story told in the Book. He argues instead that the court erred in finding the fact of his depression to be relevant to the <i>Anderson</i> litigation. Assuming with the district court that New Hampshire would recognize a cause of action for public disclosure of private fact, and that this cause of action contemplates an exception for statements that are substantially relevant to a matter of legitimate public concern, we evaluate the relevance of Riley's depression to the story recounted in the Book.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevance of Statement L to the subject matter of the Book is unmistakable. The Book reports that Beatrice's attorney, concerned about Riley's performance on the witness stand during the post-trial hearing, \"would have liked to bring out the fact of Riley's depression in defense of the tanner's mental confusion and failures of memory, but Riley had told him, `I don't want to talk about that.'\" <i>A Civil Action</i> at 482. We also agree with Harr that one of the purposes of the Book was to chronicle \"the devastating emotional toll of the litigation on many of the participants,\" including Riley and Schlichtmann, the Book's protagonist. Under these circumstances, Riley's mental condition was relevant to the <i>Anderson</i> litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Riley's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim on the ground that \"New Hampshire law does not recognize a cause of action for wrongful infliction of emotional distress where the factual predicate sounds in defamation\" (quoting <i>DeMeo v. Goodall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1452443\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452443/demeo-v-goodall/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1116 (D.N.H.1986)). We do not reach this question of New Hampshire law, however, because we are convinced that Riley's allegations, as a matter of law, do not rise to the level of \"`extreme and outrageous conduct'\" required to support an intentional infliction of emotional distress action. <i>Morancy v. Morancy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></span>, 1159 (1991) (quoting <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 46). Conduct is deemed to be extreme and outrageous \"only where [it] has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\" <i>Miller v. CBC Cos., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457531\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457531/miller-v-cbc-companies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Such cannot be said of Statements A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, which express in various ways the view that Riley had not given truthful testimony during the <i>Anderson</i> litigation (<i>see supra</i>). Although we realize that Riley would have preferred that Harr not publish a critical evaluation of his testimony in the <i>Anderson</i> case, we are also persuaded that Harr's portrayal of Riley cannot be said to have exceeded \"all possible bounds of decency,\" or to be \"atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the same view of Statement L (<i>see supra</i>), which reports that Riley had experienced \"episodes of depression\" (relevant to the <i>Anderson</i> litigation), and also of Statement B.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Statement B reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He had once confronted a neighbor who had written an article about the tannery stench for the Civic Association Newsletter.

This document was thirty years old and it dealt only with tannery waste, which might or might not have contained TCE. But even so, Schlichtmann thought it had great value. Riley had sworn at his deposition that he had never dumped anything on the fifteen acres. Riley had lied then, and Schlichtmann &#8212; who didn't need much convincing &#8212; believed that Riley was also lying about using TCE. <i>A Civil Action</i> at 187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Her husband, Paul [who had died in 1981], would often walk down behind the house, in the forest by the Aberjona River, on the land owned by Riley. He would return from his walks and tell her about the barrels and piles of debris he'd seen there, and how sludge waste from the tannery would flow down the hill and onto the land. In the years before Paul's death in 1981, recalled Ruth, he often awoke in the middle of the night. On several occasions, he'd told Ruth about hearing the sounds of trucks at two or three o'clock in the morning. He had said that he could see the headlights of flatbed trucks: full of barrels driving up the access dirt road onto the fifteen acres. \"They're dumping stuff in the middle of the night,\" Ruth recalled his saying. <i>A Civil Action</i> at 188.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. It seemed that everyone but Riley recognized the fifteen acres as a toxic waste dump. Riley <i>must</i> have known about the condition of the property.

If this material was indeed tannery waste, then how had it become contaminated with TCE, which Riley claimed he had never used? It was, of course, possible that someone else &#8212; Whitney, perhaps &#8212; had dumped TCE on top of it. That was possible, but to Schlichtmann the most logical explanation was that it had all come from the same place.
