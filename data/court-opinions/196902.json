Pursuant to a plea agreement\r                                          \r\n\nwith the government, defendant-appellant Jeffrey Phaneuf pled\r\n\nguilty to three counts of  making a false statement on credit\r\n\ncard applications in  violation of 18 U.S.C.    1014, and two\r\n\ncounts of mail fraud in violation  of 18 U.S.C.   1341.   The\r\n\nUnited   States  District   Court   for   the   District   of\r\n\nMassachusetts sentenced Phaneuf to 24 months in prison on the\r\n\nfirst  three counts  to  run  concurrently  with  a  30-month\r\n\nsentence on  the last  two counts, followed  by 36  months of\r\n\nsupervised release.   In addition, the court  ordered Phaneuf\r\n\nto  pay  $20,400  to  the  Bank of  New  England  (\"BNE\")  as\r\n\nrestitution for losses.  Phaneuf appeals from his sentence.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          In  April  1989, police  officers  in Massachusetts\r\n\ndiscovered  numerous  stolen credit  cards  in  Phaneuf's car\r\n\nduring a routine traffic stop.   Police obtained a warrant to\r\n\nsearch  his  residence  in  Hampton,  New  Hampshire.    They\r\n\ndiscovered  numerous credit  cards in  his  name, along  with\r\n\nreceipts  and  credit   card  charge  slips.     A  follow-up\r\n\ninvestigation  revealed that 31  of the cards  recovered were\r\n\nones that Phaneuf had reported as stolen the previous year.\r\n\n          In June 1989, evidence from the state investigation\r\n\n-- including credit card applications, receipts, stop payment\r\n\norder  receipts,  and   correspondence  between  Phaneuf  and\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nvarious banks -- was turned  over to the United States Secret\r\n\nService  in Boston.    In July,  Phaneuf  complied with  that\r\n\noffice's  request for handwriting  exemplars to  compare with\r\n\nthe documents obtained from his home.\r\n\n          In  August 1990, Phaneuf called Agent Hoelen of the\r\n\nSecret Service to  ask about the status of the investigation.\r\n\nPhaneuf  offered to cooperate  with the  Secret Service.   In\r\n\nSeptember 1990, Phaneuf and Agent Hoelen met, without counsel\r\n\nor  a representative from the United States Attorney's Office\r\n\npresent.   After Agent  Hoelen advised Phaneuf  of his  Fifth\r\n\nAmendment right against self-incrimination, Phaneuf explained\r\n\nhis  scheme:    from  January  1988  through  March  1989, he\r\n\nobtained numerous  credit cards  from banks  and credit  card\r\n\ncompanies by  submitting false  applications, used  the cards\r\n\n(or authorized  others to  use them),  and then reported  the\r\n\ncards   as  stolen  or   failed  to  pay   back  the  issuing\r\n\ninstitutions.   He  also wrote  checks  against his  personal\r\n\nchecking account at  BNE to pay off credit  card balances and\r\n\nthen issued  stop  payment orders  on  the checks  after  the\r\n\ncredit card  balances had been  reduced by the amount  of the\r\n\nchecks.  In this way, he was able to resume use of the credit\r\n\ncards and incur more debt.  \r\n\n          At  the end  of  his  meeting  with  Agent  Hoelen,\r\n\nPhaneuf signed a two-page typed statement outlining the above\r\n\nscheme  and initialled an  additional ten or  eleven pages of\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n\"certified  inventory of evidence\" forms.  Phaneuf told Agent\r\n\nHoelen  that   he  believed   the  total   amount  of   fraud\r\n\nattributable  to  his  scheme was  about  $176,000.   Phaneuf\r\n\napparently made  this comment  in response  to a  higher loss\r\n\nestimate offered by Agent Hoelen.\r\n\n          In November 1994, the government filed a five-count\r\n\nindictment  in the  United  States  District  Court  for  the\r\n\nDistrict of  Massachusetts charging  Phaneuf with  mail fraud\r\n\nand making false statements  on credit card applications.   A\r\n\nplea  hearing was  held on  December  12, at  which time  the\r\n\ngovernment stated that the total loss attributable to Phaneuf\r\n\nfor  sentencing purposes was approximately $175,000.  Phaneuf\r\n\nrefused to agree to the $175,000 loss amount contained in the\r\n\nplea  agreement.     Defense   counsel  questioned   how  the\r\n\ngovernment would  prove this  total amount,  given the  lower\r\n\namounts alleged in the various  counts ($64,000 in counts  I-\r\n\nIII and $57,182 in counts IV-V, for a sum of $121,182).  As a\r\n\nresult of this  dispute, the  district court  did not  accept\r\n\nPhaneuf's  guilty plea  and ended  the  plea proceedings.   A\r\n\nsecond plea  hearing was  held on December  20, at  which the\r\n\ncourt  accepted Phaneuf's guilty plea but declared the amount\r\n\nof the loss to be \"in dispute.\"\r\n\n          On  January   9,  1995,  Assistant   United  States\r\n\nAttorney Sheila Sawyer filed a notice of appearance replacing\r\n\nDuane Deskins  who had been  handling Phaneuf's  prosecution.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nShortly   thereafter,  the   probation  department   filed  a\r\n\nPresentence   Investigation   Report  (\"PSR\")   that   relied\r\n\nprimarily  upon  Phaneuf's   two-page  signed  statement   of\r\n\nSeptember   1990  to   characterize   the  offense   conduct.\r\n\nPhaneuf's base  offense level was  calculated to be  six, and\r\n\nwas  increased by  six  levels  because he  was  found to  be\r\n\nresponsible for a loss amount between $100,001 and $200,000.1\r\n\nTwo more  levels were added because the offense involved more\r\n\nthan minimal planning.  The probation  officer then took into\r\n\naccount  Phaneuf's acceptance  of  responsibility, and  found\r\n\nthat his total adjusted offense level was twelve.  Given that\r\n\noffense level and a criminal history category of V, Phaneuf's\r\n\nguideline sentencing range was put at 27 to 33 months.\r\n\n          The government did not object to the PSR.  Phaneuf\r\n\nmade several objections.  He asserted that neither he nor his\r\n\nattorney had seen \"any information  in the possession of  the\r\n\ngovernment\"  other than his two-page statement given to Agent\r\n\nHoelen.    Phaneuf  petitioned  the  probation  department to\r\n\nconfine the  loss calculation  to the figures  listed in  the\r\n\nmail fraud counts  of the indictment.   The probation officer\r\n\nconsidered Phaneuf's objections but refused to alter the loss\r\n\ncalculations.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  applicable offense level  for fraud claims increases\r\nin proportion to the value of the fraud.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          Sentencing  was scheduled for  March 27, 1995.   On\r\n\nMarch 7,  the government  filed with  the court  a sentencing\r\n\nmemorandum in  support  of the  probation  department's  loss\r\n\ncalculations.   The  government  attached to  its  sentencing\r\n\nmemorandum  an  affidavit from  Agent  Hoelen describing  the\r\n\ninvestigation,  the confession signed by Phaneuf in 1990, and\r\n\na certified inventory  of evidence prepared by  Agent Hoelen.\r\n\nOn  Thursday,  March  23, Assistant  United  States  Attorney\r\n\nSawyer  called  defense  counsel  to  see  whether  he  still\r\n\nintended to contest  the loss amount and whether  he \"had any\r\n\ninterest  in looking  at  the  materials  referenced  in  the\r\n\ngovernment's sentencing  memorandum prior  to the  sentencing\r\n\nhearing.\"  Defense counsel rejected the government's offer to\r\n\nlook at the evidence, stating his intention to  challenge the\r\n\ngovernment for alleged discovery violations. \r\n\n          At  sentencing, the  district court  concluded that\r\n\nthe loss amount  was \"somewhere in the range  of\" $100,001 to\r\n\n$200,000, and not less than $166,229.38.   The district court\r\n\nalso found  that  the  government  had  not  failed  to  make\r\n\navailable  to the  defense the  documentation  supporting its\r\n\nloss calculation.   Phaneuf  was  sentenced to  30 months  in\r\n\nprison,  to be  followed  by a  36-month  term of  supervised\r\n\nrelease.   The court  imposed several  special conditions  of\r\n\nsupervised  release:  it  required  Phaneuf  to obtain  prior\r\n\napproval of  the probation department  before \"incurring  any\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nextension  of credit, including charge cards, credit cards or\r\n\nloans\" and  before making \"any  purchase . . .  exceeding the\r\n\ncost of  $100.\"   The court further  ordered Phaneuf  to make\r\n\nrestitution to the BNE in the amount of $20,400 for losses it\r\n\nsustained in connection with the mail fraud scheme.  \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Phaneuf assigns four errors on appeal: (1) that the\r\n\ngovernment's violation of a local discovery rule deprived him\r\n\nof a  fair sentencing; (2)  that the district court  erred in\r\n\ncalculating the loss amount for sentencing purposes; (3) that\r\n\nthe  supervised  release condition  requiring  him to  obtain\r\n\nprior approval  for purchases  over $100  was not  reasonably\r\n\nrelated   to  his  offenses  as  required   by  18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n3583(d)(1);  and (4) that  the court's restitution  order was\r\n\nimproper.\r\n\n1. Discovery Violation\r            1. Discovery Violation\r\n\n          Phaneuf  contends that  the government's  purported\r\n\nfailure to  provide the defense with documentation supporting\r\n\nits  loss  estimate   deprived  him  of  a   fair  sentencing\r\n\nprocedure.  He relies on  Local Rule, D.Mass. 116.1(a), which\r\n\nrequires   that,   in   criminal   cases,   the    government\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nautomatically  disclose  certain   written  evidence  in  its\r\n\npossession to the defense.2\r\n\n          Phaneuf argues that  the government violated  Local\r\n\nRule 116.1 by  not spontaneously handing over  to the defense\r\n\nvarious pieces of evidence including the handwriting analyses\r\n\nproduced  by the  Forensic Services  Division  of the  Secret\r\n\nService  and evidence  of \"numerous  legitimate payments\"  on\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The Rule provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          In  all  criminal  cases,  the  following\r\n          material and information  . . . shall  be\r\n          disclosed  to  the opposing  party.  Such\r\n          disclosure . . . shall occur . . . in all\r\n          events  within fourteen  (14) days  after\r\n          arraignment.\r\n\n          (a)  The government  shall disclose,  and\r\n          allow the defendant  to inspect, copy and\r\n          photograph,  all   written  material   as\r\n          follows:\r\n\n          . . .\r\n\n          (3)  All relevant  reports of  results of\r\n          physical or  mental examinations,  and of\r\n          all  scientific  tests,  experiments  and\r\n          comparisons, or  copies thereof,  made in\r\n          connection with a particular case.\r\n\n          (4) All .  . . documents . .  . which the\r\n          Government intends to use at the trial of\r\n          the case. . . .\r\n\n          (5) All  exculpatory evidence  within the\r\n          meaning of  Giles v.  Maryland, 386  U.S.\r                                                    \r\n          66, 87 S.Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737  (1967),\r\n          Brady v.

As a result, Phaneuf argues,\r\n\nhe  could  not effectively  challenge  the  government's loss\r\n\nestimate and  the  corresponding six-level  increase in  base\r\n\noffense level.  The government replies that Local Rule 116.1,\r\n\non  its  face,  applies  only  to  pre-trial  discovery.   At\r\n\nsentencing, the government  says, a defendant is  entitled to\r\n\nno  more than  fair notice  of  the evidence  upon which  the\r\n\ngovernment intends  to rely.3   In any event,  the government\r\n\ninsists  that  Phaneuf was  fully advised  in advance  of the\r\n\nsentencing  hearing of the government's evidence and that his\r\n\ncounsel had made no request at all for evidence.\r\n\n          We need not  linger over what  role, if any,  Local\r\n\nRule 116.1  should play at  sentencing.  Under  any analysis,\r\n\nPhaneuf is not entitled to relief here.   He has only himself\r\n\nto blame for  any gaps in his  knowledge of the basis  of the\r\n\ngovernment's sentencing proposals.   Counsel for the  defense\r\n\nconceded at the sentencing  hearing that, during the two  and\r\n\none-half month period  leading up to  sentencing, he did  not\r\n\nrequest any data from the prosecution, nor did he request the\r\n\ncourt to compel the disclosure of any evidence.4  The absence\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Neither party  contends that  Phaneuf did  not have  fair\r\nnotice of  the evidence upon which the government intended to\r\nrely at sentencing.\r\n\n4.  Although  defense counsel  requested certain  information\r\nfrom the government  in the period before the  institution of\r\nformal judicial proceedings, he  conceded at sentencing  that\r\nhe  did not  request the  documents  at any  point after  the\r\nhearing at which Phaneuf's plea was taken.  \r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nof any such  requests is especially telling given  that three\r\n\nweeks before sentencing the government had filed a sentencing\r\n\nmemorandum setting  forth  the government's  position on  the\r\n\nloss amount.   Moreover,  some four  days before  sentencing,\r\n\nAssistant  United  States  Attorney  Sawyer  called   defense\r\n\ncounsel and offered  him an opportunity  to inspect and  copy\r\n\nthe  materials  referenced  in  the  government's  sentencing\r\n\nmemorandum  -- an offer which defense counsel refused, citing\r\n\na  strategic  choice to  pursue  a  prosecutorial misfeasance\r\n\nargument.   Even after  this argument  failed at  sentencing,\r\n\ndefense counsel did  not request a continuance  of sentencing\r\n\nto  permit  him  an opportunity  to  investigate  further the\r\n\ngovernment's evidence.  \r\n\n          The district  court, after hearing  argument, found\r\n\nthat the  government did  not fail to  make available  to the\r\n\ndefense the  documentation supporting its  loss calculations.\r\n\nThis finding was amply  supported by the facts and  arguments\r\n\npresented.

First Step Designs, Ltd.,  83 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n526, 532  (1st Cir.  1996) (holding that  district court  has\r\n\nbroad discretion  over matters concerning  discovery); United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

In reaching  its  loss\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\ndetermination,  the  court  considered:  (1)  Agent  Hoelen's\r\n\naffidavit  describing  his  investigation  and  the  evidence\r\n\nrecovered from Phaneuf's home; (2) Phaneuf's signed statement\r\n\nmade to  Agent Hoelen in  September of 1990 stating  that the\r\n\namount  of loss  was  approximately  $176,000;  and  (3)  the\r\n\nbankruptcy petition filed by Phaneuf in 1994 which discharged\r\n\nmany of his debts.5\r\n\n          Phaneuf challenges  the court's  loss determination\r\n\nas  not being  based on  \"available  information\" within  the\r\n\nmeaning of  U.S.S.G.    2F1.1 comment (n.8),  because it  was\r\n\nderived in part  from Agent Hoelen's affidavit  and Phaneuf's\r\n\nstatement rather  than from  the underlying  evidence --  the\r\n\ncredit  cards,  receipts,  sales slips,  and  other documents\r\n\ncollected  during  the  investigation.6    This  argument  is\r\n\nwithout merit. A  district court may  rely upon any  relevant\r\n\nevidence,  including  hearsay, to  prove facts  at sentencing\r\n\nprovided the evidence  is sufficiently reliable.   U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n6A1.3(a)   (A   sentencing  court   \"may   consider  relevant\r\n\ninformation without  regard to  its  admissibility under  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  According  to  the  PSR,  Phaneuf  filed  for  Chapter  7\r\nbankruptcy protection on February 8, 1994, and was discharged\r\nfrom debts totalling $210,702 on May 31, 1994.\r\n\n6.  In  his  challenge  to  the  loss  determination, Phaneuf\r\nreiterates  his argument that  the government, by  failing to\r\ndisclose relevant  documents, prevented  him from  presenting\r\nany evidence  regarding  the specific  loss  amount.   As  we\r\ndetermined  in Part II.1  supra, this argument  fails because\r                                           \r\nPhaneuf was offered  an opportunity to inspect  the documents\r\nin the government's possession.  \r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nrules  of evidence  applicable at  trial,  provided that  the\r\n\ninformation has sufficient indicia of  reliability to support\r\n\nits probable  accuracy.\"); see also Rostoff, 53  F.3d at 407;\r                                                       \r\n\nTardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287;  United States v.

Here, the district court relied on the\r\n\nsworn  affidavit  of  an officer  who,  having  conducted the\r\n\ninvestigation,  had  personal  knowledge  of  the  events  in\r\n\nquestion.   This is the  type and  kind of evidence  on which\r\n\nsentencing courts often  rely.   See e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nAymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r                   \r\n\n          Phaneuf  next   argues  that   he  made   \"numerous\r\n\nlegitimate  payments\" on his  credit card accounts  which may\r\n\nhave been included  in the court's total loss  amount.7  This\r\n\nargument is equally unavailing.  Phaneuf has not provided any\r\n\nevidence that  the legitimate payments were  improperly taken\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  In making  this claim, Phaneuf relies on  an excerpt from\r\nhis  1990 statement  to  Agent  Hoelen  which  discusses  his\r\nfraudulent practices:\r\n\n          During  the  course  of  my  credit  card\r\n          activity,  I  made   numerous  legitimate\r                                                               \r\n          payments   on   my   accounts,   however,\r                              \r\n          subsequent payments made on the following\r\n          accounts  with  checks from  my  personal\r\n          checking  account . .  . were made solely\r\n          for the  purpose of making  full payments\r\n          on the  accounts to create  either a zero\r\n          balance  or  a  credit   balance  and  to\r\n          increase credit  available to me.   After\r\n          submitting  these checks  for payment,  I\r\n          would place a stop payment on them.\r\n\n(emphasis added).\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\ninto account  in determining  the loss amount.   Absent  such\r\n\nevidence, we logically  conclude that  the loss  calculations\r\n\nupon which the court relied were based on the amount owing to\r\n\nvarious  institutions, rather  than  the  amount  paid.    In\r\n\naddition, we note that both Agent Hoelen and  Phaneuf himself\r\n\n(in his  1990 statement) attributed approximately $176,000 of\r\n\nloss to Phaneuf's fraudulent activities. \r                                        \r\n\n          We see  no error,  let alone  clear  error, in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's   loss  determination.     The   government\r\n\nintroduced ample evidence upon which the court could conclude\r\n\nthat  Phaneuf was responsible for not less than $166,299.38.8\r\n\nMoreover, Phaneuf himself admitted to the court at sentencing\r\n\nthat the loss  attributable to him was  within the sentencing\r\n\nguideline category of  $100,001 to $200,000 requiring  a six-\r\n\nlevel increase in his base offense level.9\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  We also dismiss  Phaneuf's perfunctory argument  that the\r\ndistrict court erred in not holding a hearing on the issue of\r\nloss  amount.   The  denial  of  an  evidentiary  hearing  at\r\nsentencing is reviewable only for an abuse of discretion.  We\r\ncannot find that the district court  abused its discretion in\r\nnot  granting   an  evidentiary  hearing   when  neither  the\r\nprosecution  nor  the  defense   requested  such  a  hearing.\r\nTardiff, 969 F.2d at 1286 (\"[T]he failure to ask the district\r                   \r\ncourt  to  convene an  evidentiary hearing  ordinarily spells\r\ndefeat  for a contention  that one should  have been held.\");\r\nsee also United  States v. Mala, 7 F.3d  1058, 1062 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 1839 (1994). \r                               \r\n\n9.  Phaneuf stated at sentencing:\r\n\n          The amounts of money, at this point, I am\r\n          very confused as  to what it is.  I'm not\r\n          even going to  argue it.  I  guess it has\r\n          to be  somewhere in  the range  of my  --\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n3. Special Condition of Release\r            3. Special Condition of Release\r\n\n          Phaneuf  argues  that the  district court  erred in\r\n\nimposing a special condition of supervised  release requiring\r\n\nprior approval  from the probation  department for  purchases\r\n\nover  $100.     We  ordinarily  review  a   district  court's\r\n\nimposition of  a special  release condition  for an abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion. See United States v. Thurlow, 44 F.3d 46, 47 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir.), cert.  denied, 115  S.Ct. 1987  (1995).   However,  as\r                                \r\n\nPhaneuf   did  not  object   to  the  special   condition  at\r\n\nsentencing,  our review is for plain error. See United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

The nature of the imposed  conditions\r\n\nstrongly suggests that  the district  court viewed  Phaneuf's\r\n\ncredit card crimes as stemming from a total lack of financial\r\n\ndiscipline and  a compulsion to  make excessive expenditures.\r\n\nThe court could  rationally have concluded that  oversight of\r\n\nexpenditures  over  $100   would  help  deter  the   kind  of\r\n\noverspending and  debt that might  once more lead  Phaneuf to\r\n\nundertake fraudulent schemes.12\r\n\n          To  overturn  the condition  under the  plain error\r\n\nstandard, Phaneuf  must show an obvious and clear error under\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  Phaneuf was  hospitalized as an adolescent  for \"conduct\r\ndisorder\" and \"unsocialized aggressive\" behavior and has been\r\ntreated for  behavioral problems  on and  off throughout  his\r\nlife.\r\n\n12.  Another   justification  of   the  limit   on  Phaneuf's\r\npurchasing  power  stems  from  his  outstanding  restitution\r\nobligation  to  pay  $20,400 to  BNE.    The  court's special\r\ncondition will help  to ensure that Phaneuf  satisfies to the\r\nbest  of his ability  his restitution obligation  rather than\r\nspending  his   money  on   other  things.     Because   this\r\njustification  is not attributable  to a factor  set forth in\r\nU.S.S.G.    5D1.3(b) or the corresponding statutes, 18 U.S.C.\r\n   3553,  3583, it  does not  deserve conclusive  weight, but\r\nstill is a part of the total picture.\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\ncurrent   law   that   affected   his   substantial   rights.\r\n\nFed.R.Crim.P.  52(b); United States  v.

Even  if plain error exists, Olano suggests\r                                                                \r\n\nthat courts should  not exercise their discretion  to correct\r\n\nthe  error  unless  it  \"seriously  affect[s]  the  fairness,\r\n\nintegrity  or  public  reputation of  judicial  proceedings.\"\r\n\nOlano, 507  U.S. at 736  (quoting United States  v. Atkinson,\r                                                                        \r\n\n297 U.S. 157, 160 (1936)).  In this case, even if we  were to\r\n\nassume, arguendo, that  the district court went too  far, the\r                            \r\n\nerror was not  \"obvious and clear\" nor does  it implicate the\r\n\nfairness or integrity of judicial proceedings.  The condition\r\n\nlimiting Phaneuf's  purchasing power is effective only during\r\n\nhis  period   of  supervised   release,  does   not  prohibit\r\n\nexpenditures of over $100 but merely requires pre-approval of\r\n\nthe  probation department,  and bears  at  least an  arguable\r\n\nrelationship to  checking  the  irresponsible  behavior  that\r\n\nunderlay Phaneuf's crimes.\r\n\n4. Restitution\r            4. Restitution\r\n\n          Phaneuf argues  that the sentencing court  erred in\r\n\nordering restitution in  the amount of $20,400 to  be paid to\r\n\nBNE,  pursuant to  the  Victim  and  Witness  Protection  Act\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\n(VWPA), 18 U.S.C.     3663-3664 (1995).13  Our  review is for\r\n\nplain  error as  Phaneuf did  not object  to the  restitution\r\n\norder at sentencing.  See  United States v. Springer, 28 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n236, 237, 239 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          A  sentencing   court   is   permitted   to   order\r\n\nrestitution  \"to any victim.\"   18 U.S.C.   3663(a) (1995).14\r\n\nIn ordering restitution the court is required to consider:\r\n\n          the  amount  of  loss  sustained  by  any\r\n          victim  as a  result of the  offense, the\r\n          financial resources of the defendant, the\r\n          financial  needs and  earning ability  of\r\n          the   defendant   and   the   defendant's\r\n          dependents, and such other factors as the\r\n          court deems appropriate.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3664(a) (1995).15\r\n\n          Phaneuf  claims  that   the  restitution  order  is\r\n\ncontrary to law for two  reasons.  First, he asserts that  he\r\n\nis incapable  of making  restitution, citing  his history  of\r\n\nmental  disorders,  his lack  of  professional  training, his\r\n\nvirtually non-existent  employment  record, and  his lack  of\r\n\nassets.  Phaneuf predicts that he will likely be incarcerated\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The VWPA,  18 U.S.C.     3663-3664, was  amended by  the\r\nAntiterrorism and Effective  Death Penalty Act of  1996, Pub.\r\nL. No. 104-132,     205, 206, 110 Stat. 1230, 1232  (Apr. 24,\r\n1996).   However,  the  1996  amendments  are  effective  for\r\nsentencing  proceedings  in  cases  in  which   defendant  is\r\nconvicted on or after April 24,  1996.  See Pub. L. No.  104-\r                                                       \r\n132,   211, 110 Stat. 1232.  Therefore, the pre-1996 version,\r\ncited  throughout this section of the opinion, is controlling\r\nin Phaneuf's case.\r\n\n14.  See supra, note 13.\r                          \r\n\n15.  See supra, note 13.\r                          \r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\nagain as a result of  being unable to satisfy the restitution\r\n\norder.    We  find  Phaneuf's  argument  unpersuasive.    The\r\n\ndistrict court  was not  required to  make explicit  findings\r\n\nregarding   Phaneuf's   ability   to  pay   before   ordering\r\n\nrestitution,  so long as it considered  the factors set forth\r\n\nin   3664(a).   See United  States v. Newman,  49 F.3d 1,  10\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); Springer, 28 F.3d at 239.  Moreover, Phaneuf\r                                     \r\n\nneed not  be able to  pay the restitution  award immediately.\r\n\nSee  United States  v. Lombardi,  5 F.3d  568, 573  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1993).   Restitution awards may  be imposed in order  to make\r\n\nvictims whole should the defendant  become able to pay in the\r\n\nfuture.  See Newman,  49 F.3d  at  10-11.   Here, given  that\r                               \r\n\nPhaneuf  is a  26-year-old high  school graduate,  it is  not\r\n\nunforeseeable that he may earn some income when released from\r\n\nprison.   Moreover, Phaneuf can  later seek a modification of\r\n\nthe restitution order in the  sentencing court if he can show\r\n\nthat it is too onerous.  See Springer, 28 F.3d at 239 n.2.\r                                                 \r\n\n          Second,  Phaneuf  argues  that  the district  court\r\n\nerred in ordering  restitution to be paid to  BNE because, at\r\n\nthe  time  of sentencing,  BNE  had  failed and  the  Federal\r\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") had been appointed its\r\n\nreceiver.   Phaneuf  further  argues  that  the  FDIC,  which\r\n\nsucceeded to the assets and liabilities of the failed bank by\r\n\noperation of  law, see  12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(2)(A), is  not a\r                                  \r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\nproper  \"victim\" entitled  to restitution  under the  VWPA.16\r\n\nPhaneuf argues that the letter he received from the probation\r\n\ndepartment  instructing him to  make his restitution payments\r\n\nto  the  FDIC  was  improper.   He  contends  that  an  order\r\n\ninstructing him to  pay an entity other than BNE  had to come\r\n\nfrom  the  court  rather   than  the  probation   department.\r\n\nAccording to Phaneuf, restitution can only be paid to someone\r\n\nother  than the  victim, in  this case  BNE, pursuant  to the\r\n\nfollowing provision of the VWPA:\r\n\n          the  court   may,  in  the   interest  of\r\n          justice, order restitution  to any person\r\n          who has  compensated the victim  for such\r\n          loss to the extent  that such person paid\r\n          the compensation.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.    3663(e)(1)  (1995).17  Since  the court  did not\r\n\naward restitution  to the  FDIC pursuant  to this  provision,\r\n\nPhaneuf argues that the restitution order was improper.\r\n\n          We  find no  plain  error  either  in  the  court's\r\n\nrestitution  order   or   in   the   probation   department's\r\n\ninstructions to make restitution  payments to the FDIC.   BNE\r\n\nwas in fact a victim of  Phaneuf's fraud when committed.  The\r\n\nfailure  of  BNE and  the  appointment  of  the FDIC  as  its\r\n\nreceiver had  not been brought to the  court's attention when\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  Defendant  also contends  that his  Mastercard debts  of\r\n$20,400 have subsequently been sold to Citibank by  the FDIC.\r\nHowever, there  is no evidence  of this in the  record before\r\nus.\r\n\n17.  See supra, note 13.\r                          \r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\nit  entered its order,  hence the court  order understandably\r\n\nnamed BNE.  Given that the  FDIC \"steps into the shoes\" of  a\r\n\nfailed bank, O'Melveny &amp; Myers  v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct. 2048, 2054\r                                                   \r\n\n(1994), we see no reason  why the probation department should\r\n\nnot substitute the  FDIC for the failed bank  as the \"victim\"\r\n\nof  Phaneuf's fraud.

Haddock, 50 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n835, 841 (10th Cir. 1995) (holding that restitution was due a\r\n\nbank that  purchased one  of the banks  involved in  the loan\r\n\ntransactions  for  which  defendant  was  convicted);  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts sentenced Phaneuf to 24 months in prison on the first three counts to run concurrently with a 30-month sentence on the last two counts, followed by 36 months of supervised release.  In addition, the court ordered Phaneuf to pay $20,400 to the Bank of New England (\"BNE\") as restitution for losses.  Phaneuf appeals from his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1989, police officers in Massachusetts discovered numerous stolen credit cards in Phaneuf's car during a routine traffic stop.  Police obtained a warrant to search his residence in Hampton, New Hampshire.  They discovered numerous credit cards in his name, along with receipts and credit card charge slips.  A follow-up investigation revealed that 31 of the cards recovered were ones that Phaneuf had reported as stolen the previous year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1989, evidence from the state investigation--including credit card applications, receipts, stop payment order receipts, and correspondence between Phaneuf and various banks--was turned over to the United States Secret Service in Boston.  In July, Phaneuf complied with that office's request for handwriting exemplars to compare with the documents obtained from his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, Phaneuf called Agent Hoelen of the Secret Service to ask about the status of the investigation.  Phaneuf offered to cooperate with the Secret Service.  In September 1990, Phaneuf and Agent Hoelen met, without counsel or a representative from the United States Attorney's Office present.  After Agent Hoelen advised Phaneuf of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Phaneuf explained his scheme:  from January 1988 through March 1989, he obtained numerous credit cards from banks and credit card companies by submitting false applications, used the cards (or authorized others to use them), and then reported the cards as stolen or failed to pay back the issuing institutions.  He also wrote checks against his personal checking account at BNE to pay off credit card balances and then issued stop payment orders on the checks after the credit card balances had been reduced by the amount of the checks.  In this way, he was able to resume use of the credit cards and incur more debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of his meeting with Agent Hoelen, Phaneuf signed a two-page typed statement outlining the above scheme and initialled an additional ten or eleven pages of \"certified inventory of evidence\" forms.  Phaneuf told Agent Hoelen that he believed the total amount of fraud attributable to his scheme was about $176,000.  Phaneuf apparently made this comment in response to a higher loss estimate offered by Agent Hoelen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, the government filed a five-count indictment in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging Phaneuf with mail fraud and making false statements on credit card applications.  A plea hearing was held on December 12, at which time the government stated that the total loss attributable to Phaneuf for sentencing purposes was approximately $175,000.  Phaneuf refused to agree to the $175,000 loss amount contained in the plea agreement.  Defense counsel questioned how the government would prove this total amount, given the lower amounts alleged in the various counts ($64,000 in counts I-III and $57,182 in counts IV-V, for a sum of $121,182).  As a result of this dispute, the district court did not accept Phaneuf's guilty plea and ended the plea proceedings.  A second plea hearing was held on December 20, at which the court accepted Phaneuf's guilty plea but declared the amount of the loss to be \"in dispute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 9, 1995, Assistant United States Attorney Sheila Sawyer filed a notice of appearance replacing Duane Deskins who had been handling Phaneuf's prosecution.  Shortly thereafter, the probation department filed a Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") that relied primarily upon Phaneuf's two-page signed statement of September 1990 to characterize the offense conduct.  Phaneuf's base offense level was calculated to be six, and was increased by six levels because he was found to be responsible for a loss amount between $100,001 and $200,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Two more levels were added because the offense involved more than minimal planning.  The probation officer then took into account Phaneuf's acceptance of responsibility, and found that his total adjusted offense level was twelve.  Given that offense level and a criminal history category of V, Phaneuf's guideline sentencing range was put at 27 to 33 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government did not object to the PSR. Phaneuf made several objections.  He asserted that neither he nor his attorney had seen \"any information in the possession of the government\" other than his two-page statement given to Agent Hoelen.  Phaneuf petitioned the probation department to confine the loss calculation to the figures listed in the mail fraud counts of the indictment.  The probation officer considered Phaneuf's objections but refused to alter the loss calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sentencing was scheduled for March 27, 1995.  On March 7, the government filed with the court a sentencing memorandum in support of the probation department's loss calculations.  The government attached to its sentencing memorandum an affidavit from Agent Hoelen describing the investigation, the confession signed by Phaneuf in 1990, and a certified inventory of evidence prepared by Agent Hoelen.  On Thursday, March 23, Assistant United States Attorney Sawyer called defense counsel to see whether he still intended to contest the loss amount and whether he \"had any interest in looking at the materials referenced in the government's sentencing memorandum prior to the sentencing hearing.\"   Defense counsel rejected the government's offer to look at the evidence, stating his intention to challenge the government for alleged discovery violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court concluded that the loss amount was \"somewhere in the range of\" $100,001 to $200,000, and not less than $166,229.38.  The district court also found that the government had not failed to make available to the defense the documentation supporting its loss calculation.  Phaneuf was sentenced to 30 months in prison, to be followed by a 36-month term of supervised release.  The court imposed several special conditions of supervised release:  it required Phaneuf to obtain prior approval of the probation department before \"incurring any extension of credit, including charge cards, credit cards or loans\" and before making \"any purchase ... exceeding the cost of $100.\"   The court further ordered Phaneuf to make restitution to the BNE in the amount of $20,400 for losses it sustained in connection with the mail fraud scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf assigns four errors on appeal:  (1) that the government's violation of a local discovery rule deprived him of a fair sentencing;  (2) that the district court erred in calculating the loss amount for sentencing purposes;  (3) that the supervised release condition requiring him to obtain prior approval for purchases over $100 was not reasonably related to his offenses as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)(1);  and (4) that the court's restitution order was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Discovery Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf contends that the government's purported failure to provide the defense with documentation supporting its loss estimate deprived him of a fair sentencing procedure.  He relies on Local Rule, D.Mass. 116.1(a), which requires that, in criminal cases, the government automatically disclose certain written evidence in its possession to the defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf argues that the government violated Local Rule 116.1 by not spontaneously handing over to the defense various pieces of evidence including the handwriting analyses produced by the Forensic Services Division of the Secret Service and evidence of \"numerous legitimate payments\" on Phaneuf's credit card accounts.  As a result, Phaneuf argues, he could not effectively challenge the government's loss estimate and the corresponding six-level increase in base offense level.  The government replies that Local Rule 116.1, on its face, applies only to pre-trial discovery.  At sentencing, the government says, a defendant is entitled to no more than fair notice of the evidence upon which the government intends to rely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In any event, the government insists that Phaneuf was fully advised in advance of the sentencing hearing of the government's evidence and that his counsel had made no request at all for evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger over what role, if any, Local Rule 116.1 should play at sentencing.  Under any analysis, Phaneuf is not entitled to relief here.  He has only himself to blame for any gaps in his knowledge of the basis of the government's sentencing proposals.  Counsel for the defense conceded at the sentencing hearing that, during the two and one-half month period leading up to sentencing, he did not request any data from the prosecution, nor did he request the court to compel the disclosure of any evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The absence of any such requests is especially telling given that three weeks before sentencing the government had filed a sentencing memorandum setting forth the government's position on the loss amount.  Moreover, some four days before sentencing, Assistant United States Attorney Sawyer called defense counsel and offered him an opportunity to inspect and copy the materials referenced in the government's sentencing memorandum--an offer which defense counsel refused, citing a strategic choice to pursue a prosecutorial misfeasance argument.  Even after this argument failed at sentencing, defense counsel did not request a continuance of sentencing to permit him an opportunity to investigate further the government's evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after hearing argument, found that the government did not fail to make available to the defense the documentation supporting its loss calculations.  This finding was amply supported by the facts and arguments presented.  See Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 532 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that district court has broad discretion over matters concerning discovery);   United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1287 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that rulings on discovery matters are reviewed for an abuse of discretion).  Moreover, by not, even then, requesting a continuance during which the evidence allegedly withheld could be disclosed and reviewed, Phaneuf further weakened any claim he might conceivably have had of an alleged discovery violation.  See United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1286 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[E]ven if a defendant is faced at sentencing with information that he has not had a chance to rebut ... we think it incumbent upon the defendant to ask for a continuance then and there.\");   United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir.)  (\"We find it of decretory significance that defense counsel, although seeking unsuccessfully to block the testimony entirely, never moved for a continuance[;] [i]t is, we think, incumbent upon a party faced with such a situation to ask explicitly that the court grant the time needed to regroup, or waive the point.\"), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf's argument that he was denied discovery documents is also weakened by the fact that much, although not all, of the government's information that was directly related to the loss estimate was information that Phaneuf himself knew about or could have obtained.  Phaneuf was aware of the financial institutions which he had defrauded, and could have contacted them himself to obtain information.  This is not a situation in which most of the information relevant to sentencing was known only to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no merit in Phaneuf's argument that the government's purported failure to disclose evidence denied him his \"constitutional right not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid information.\"   Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 47 (quoting  United States v. Fogel, 829 F.2d 77, 90 (D.C.Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Amount of Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf claims that the district court made an unreasonable determination of the amount of loss attributable to him for sentencing purposes.  A district court's loss estimate is a factual determination, and \"a party dissatisfied with the sentencing court's quantification of the amount of loss in a particular case must go a long way to demonstrate that the finding is clearly erroneous.\"   United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 407 (1st Cir.1995);  see also United States v. Pavao, 948 F.2d 74, 77 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When determining the amount of loss for sentencing purposes, the district court \"need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, comment.  (n.8);  see also Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 407 (stating that \"[c]ourts can, and frequently do, deal with rough estimates\" when calculating the amount of loss).  The district court found that the loss attributable to Phaneuf was \"not less than $166,299.38\" which placed him in the $100,001 to $200,000 category necessitating a six-level increase in base offense level.  In reaching its loss determination, the court considered:  (1) Agent Hoelen's affidavit describing his investigation and the evidence recovered from Phaneuf's home;  (2) Phaneuf's signed statement made to Agent Hoelen in September of 1990 stating that the amount of loss was approximately $176,000;  and (3) the bankruptcy petition filed by Phaneuf in 1994 which discharged many of his debts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf challenges the court's loss determination as not being based on \"available information\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 comment (n.8), because it was derived in part from Agent Hoelen's affidavit and Phaneuf's statement rather than from the underlying evidence--the credit cards, receipts, sales slips, and other documents collected during the investigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  This argument is without merit.  A district court may rely upon any relevant evidence, including hearsay, to prove facts at sentencing provided the evidence is sufficiently reliable.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a) (A sentencing court \"may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\");   see also Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 407;   Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287;   United States v. Figaro, 935 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1991).  Here, the district court relied on the sworn affidavit of an officer who, having conducted the investigation, had personal knowledge of the events in question.  This is the type and kind of evidence on which sentencing courts often rely.  See e.g., United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 68 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf next argues that he made \"numerous legitimate payments\" on his credit card accounts which may have been included in the court's total loss amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  This argument is equally unavailing.  Phaneuf has not provided any evidence that the legitimate payments were improperly taken into account in determining the loss amount.  Absent such evidence, we logically conclude that the loss calculations upon which the court relied were based on the amount owing to various institutions, rather than the amount paid.  In addition, we note that both Agent Hoelen and Phaneuf himself (in his 1990 statement) attributed approximately $176,000 of loss to Phaneuf's fraudulent activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no error, let alone clear error, in the district court's loss determination.  The government introduced ample evidence upon which the court could conclude that Phaneuf was responsible for not less than $166,299.38.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Moreover, Phaneuf himself admitted to the court at sentencing that the loss attributable to him was within the sentencing guideline category of $100,001 to $200,000 requiring a six-level increase in his base offense level.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Special Condition of Release</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf argues that the district court erred in imposing a special condition of supervised release requiring prior approval from the probation department for purchases over $100.  We ordinarily review a district court's imposition of a special release condition for an abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Thurlow, 44 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1987, 131 L.Ed.2d 874 (1995).  However, as Phaneuf did not object to the special condition at sentencing, our review is for plain error.  See United States v. Peppe, 80 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, adopting the recommendation in the PSR, imposed the following special conditions on Phaneuf to be observed during his three-year period of supervised release:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>The defendant shall participate in a mental health counselling program at the direction of the probation department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>The defendant shall not open any new lines of credit without prior approval of the probation department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>The defendant shall not make any purchases over $100 without prior approval of the probation department.The defendant shall provide the probation department with any requested financial information and records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing judge has broad discretion to impose special conditions of release that are \"reasonably related\" to (1) the defendant's offense, history and characteristics;  (2) the need for adequate deterrence;  and (3) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b) and the corresponding statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3553(a)(2), 3583(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf challenges the special condition limiting his purchasing power, arguing that \"[t]he record is silent on a relationship between spending $100.01, accepting pre-approved credit cards, and perpetrating a fraud on a bank.\"   While it would have been helpful had the court stated its rationale, we can perceive a sufficient connection between the restriction and Phaneuf's criminal conduct for the former to pass muster under the plain error standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Phaneuf concedes, he has a long history of mental health problems<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and, at times, has been unable to control his spending.  The nature of the imposed conditions strongly suggests that the district court viewed Phaneuf's credit card crimes as stemming from a total lack of financial discipline and a compulsion to make excessive expenditures.  The court could rationally have concluded that oversight of expenditures over $100 would help deter the kind of overspending and debt that might once more lead Phaneuf to undertake fraudulent schemes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To overturn the condition under the plain error standard, Phaneuf must show an obvious and clear error under current law that affected his substantial rights.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);   United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993);   United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 31 (1st Cir.1996).  Even if plain error exists,  Olano suggests that courts should not exercise their discretion to correct the error unless it \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"   Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (quoting  United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 392, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)).  In this case, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the district court went too far, the error was not \"obvious and clear\" nor does it implicate the fairness or integrity of judicial proceedings.  The condition limiting Phaneuf's purchasing power is effective only during his period of supervised release, does not prohibit expenditures of over $100 but merely requires pre-approval of the probation department, and bears at least an arguable relationship to checking the irresponsible behavior that underlay Phaneuf's crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Restitution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf argues that the sentencing court erred in ordering restitution in the amount of $20,400 to be paid to BNE, pursuant to the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663-3664 (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Our review is for plain error as Phaneuf did not object to the restitution order at sentencing.  See United States v. Springer, 28 F.3d 236, 237, 239 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sentencing court is permitted to order restitution \"to any victim.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a) (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  In ordering restitution the court is required to consider:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>the amount of loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(a) (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf claims that the restitution order is contrary to law for two reasons.  First, he asserts that he is incapable of making restitution, citing his history of mental disorders, his lack of professional training, his virtually non-existent employment record, and his lack of assets.  Phaneuf predicts that he will likely be incarcerated again as a result of being unable to satisfy the restitution order.  We find Phaneuf's argument unpersuasive.  The district court was not required to make explicit findings regarding Phaneuf's ability to pay before ordering restitution, so long as it considered the factors set forth in &#167; 3664(a).  See United States v. Newman, 49 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1995);   Springer, 28 F.3d at 239.   Moreover, Phaneuf need not be able to pay the restitution award immediately.  See United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 573 (1st Cir.1993).  Restitution awards may be imposed in order to make victims whole should the defendant become able to pay in the future.  See Newman, 49 F.3d at 10-11.   Here, given that Phaneuf is a 26-year-old high school graduate, it is not unforeseeable that he may earn some income when released from prison.  Moreover, Phaneuf can later seek a modification of the restitution order in the sentencing court if he can show that it is too onerous.  See Springer, 28 F.3d at 239 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Phaneuf argues that the district court erred in ordering restitution to be paid to BNE because, at the time of sentencing, BNE had failed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") had been appointed its receiver.  Phaneuf further argues that the FDIC, which succeeded to the assets and liabilities of the failed bank by operation of law, see 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(d)(2)(A), is not a proper \"victim\" entitled to restitution under the VWPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Phaneuf argues that the letter he received from the probation department instructing him to make his restitution payments to the FDIC was improper.  He contends that an order instructing him to pay an entity other than BNE had to come from the court rather than the probation department.  According to Phaneuf, restitution can only be paid to someone other than the victim, in this case BNE, pursuant to the following provision of the VWPA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>the court may, in the interest of justice, order restitution to any person who has compensated the victim for such loss to the extent that such person paid the compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(e)(1) (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Since the court did not award restitution to the FDIC pursuant to this provision, Phaneuf argues that the restitution order was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no plain error either in the court's restitution order or in the probation department's instructions to make restitution payments to the FDIC.  BNE was in fact a victim of Phaneuf's fraud when committed.  The failure of BNE and the appointment of the FDIC as its receiver had not been brought to the court's attention when it entered its order, hence the court order understandably named BNE.  Given that the FDIC \"steps into the shoes\" of a failed bank,  O'Melveny &amp; Myers v. FDIC, 512 U.S. 79, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2048, 2054, 129 L.Ed.2d 67 (1994), we see no reason why the probation department should not substitute the FDIC for the failed bank as the \"victim\" of Phaneuf's fraud.  See United States v. Haddock, 50 F.3d 835, 841 (10th Cir.1995) (holding that restitution was due a bank that purchased one of the banks involved in the loan transactions for which defendant was convicted);   United States v. Smith, 944 F.2d 618, 621-22 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that the VWPA \"is intended to encompass both direct and indirect victims of criminal acts\" and therefore allowing the FSLIC to receive restitution), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 951, 112 S.Ct. 1515, 117 L.Ed.2d 651 (1992);   United States v. Rochester, 898 F.2d 971, 980 n. 7 (5th Cir.1990) (holding that the district court may award the FSLIC restitution under the VWPA when the FSLIC has acquired the claims of an insolvent savings and loan that was the victim of defendant's crime).  Needless to say, such matters remain subject to the district court's continuing oversight and control, but we see no error subject to appellate correction at this juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment and sentence of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The applicable offense level for fraud claims increases in proportion to the value of the fraud</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Rule provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>In all criminal cases, the following material and information ... shall be disclosed to the opposing party.

The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts sentenced Phaneuf to 24 months in prison on the first three counts to run concurrently with a 30-month sentence on the last two counts, followed by 36 months of supervised release.  In addition, the court ordered Phaneuf to pay $20,400 to the Bank of New England (\"BNE\") as restitution for losses.  Phaneuf appeals from his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1989, police officers in Massachusetts discovered numerous stolen credit cards in Phaneuf's car during a routine traffic stop.  Police obtained a warrant to search his residence in Hampton, New Hampshire.  They discovered numerous credit cards in his name, along with receipts and credit card charge slips.  A follow-up investigation revealed that 31 of the cards recovered were ones that Phaneuf had reported as stolen the previous year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1989, evidence from the state investigation--including credit card applications, receipts, stop payment order receipts, and correspondence between Phaneuf and various banks--was turned over to the United States Secret Service in Boston.  In July, Phaneuf complied with that office's request for handwriting exemplars to compare with the documents obtained from his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, Phaneuf called Agent Hoelen of the Secret Service to ask about the status of the investigation.  Phaneuf offered to cooperate with the Secret Service.  In September 1990, Phaneuf and Agent Hoelen met, without counsel or a representative from the United States Attorney's Office present.  After Agent Hoelen advised Phaneuf of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Phaneuf explained his scheme:  from January 1988 through March 1989, he obtained numerous credit cards from banks and credit card companies by submitting false applications, used the cards (or authorized others to use them), and then reported the cards as stolen or failed to pay back the issuing institutions.  He also wrote checks against his personal checking account at BNE to pay off credit card balances and then issued stop payment orders on the checks after the credit card balances had been reduced by the amount of the checks.  In this way, he was able to resume use of the credit cards and incur more debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of his meeting with Agent Hoelen, Phaneuf signed a two-page typed statement outlining the above scheme and initialled an additional ten or eleven pages of \"certified inventory of evidence\" forms.  Phaneuf told Agent Hoelen that he believed the total amount of fraud attributable to his scheme was about $176,000.  Phaneuf apparently made this comment in response to a higher loss estimate offered by Agent Hoelen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, the government filed a five-count indictment in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging Phaneuf with mail fraud and making false statements on credit card applications.  A plea hearing was held on December 12, at which time the government stated that the total loss attributable to Phaneuf for sentencing purposes was approximately $175,000.  Phaneuf refused to agree to the $175,000 loss amount contained in the plea agreement.  Defense counsel questioned how the government would prove this total amount, given the lower amounts alleged in the various counts ($64,000 in counts I-III and $57,182 in counts IV-V, for a sum of $121,182).  As a result of this dispute, the district court did not accept Phaneuf's guilty plea and ended the plea proceedings.  A second plea hearing was held on December 20, at which the court accepted Phaneuf's guilty plea but declared the amount of the loss to be \"in dispute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 9, 1995, Assistant United States Attorney Sheila Sawyer filed a notice of appearance replacing Duane Deskins who had been handling Phaneuf's prosecution.  Shortly thereafter, the probation department filed a Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") that relied primarily upon Phaneuf's two-page signed statement of September 1990 to characterize the offense conduct.  Phaneuf's base offense level was calculated to be six, and was increased by six levels because he was found to be responsible for a loss amount between $100,001 and $200,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Two more levels were added because the offense involved more than minimal planning.  The probation officer then took into account Phaneuf's acceptance of responsibility, and found that his total adjusted offense level was twelve.  Given that offense level and a criminal history category of V, Phaneuf's guideline sentencing range was put at 27 to 33 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government did not object to the PSR. Phaneuf made several objections.  He asserted that neither he nor his attorney had seen \"any information in the possession of the government\" other than his two-page statement given to Agent Hoelen.  Phaneuf petitioned the probation department to confine the loss calculation to the figures listed in the mail fraud counts of the indictment.  The probation officer considered Phaneuf's objections but refused to alter the loss calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sentencing was scheduled for March 27, 1995.  On March 7, the government filed with the court a sentencing memorandum in support of the probation department's loss calculations.  The government attached to its sentencing memorandum an affidavit from Agent Hoelen describing the investigation, the confession signed by Phaneuf in 1990, and a certified inventory of evidence prepared by Agent Hoelen.  On Thursday, March 23, Assistant United States Attorney Sawyer called defense counsel to see whether he still intended to contest the loss amount and whether he \"had any interest in looking at the materials referenced in the government's sentencing memorandum prior to the sentencing hearing.\"   Defense counsel rejected the government's offer to look at the evidence, stating his intention to challenge the government for alleged discovery violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court concluded that the loss amount was \"somewhere in the range of\" $100,001 to $200,000, and not less than $166,229.38.  The district court also found that the government had not failed to make available to the defense the documentation supporting its loss calculation.  Phaneuf was sentenced to 30 months in prison, to be followed by a 36-month term of supervised release.  The court imposed several special conditions of supervised release:  it required Phaneuf to obtain prior approval of the probation department before \"incurring any extension of credit, including charge cards, credit cards or loans\" and before making \"any purchase ... exceeding the cost of $100.\"   The court further ordered Phaneuf to make restitution to the BNE in the amount of $20,400 for losses it sustained in connection with the mail fraud scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf assigns four errors on appeal:  (1) that the government's violation of a local discovery rule deprived him of a fair sentencing;  (2) that the district court erred in calculating the loss amount for sentencing purposes;  (3) that the supervised release condition requiring him to obtain prior approval for purchases over $100 was not reasonably related to his offenses as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)(1);  and (4) that the court's restitution order was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Discovery Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf contends that the government's purported failure to provide the defense with documentation supporting its loss estimate deprived him of a fair sentencing procedure.  He relies on Local Rule, D.Mass. 116.1(a), which requires that, in criminal cases, the government automatically disclose certain written evidence in its possession to the defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf argues that the government violated Local Rule 116.1 by not spontaneously handing over to the defense various pieces of evidence including the handwriting analyses produced by the Forensic Services Division of the Secret Service and evidence of \"numerous legitimate payments\" on Phaneuf's credit card accounts.  As a result, Phaneuf argues, he could not effectively challenge the government's loss estimate and the corresponding six-level increase in base offense level.  The government replies that Local Rule 116.1, on its face, applies only to pre-trial discovery.  At sentencing, the government says, a defendant is entitled to no more than fair notice of the evidence upon which the government intends to rely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In any event, the government insists that Phaneuf was fully advised in advance of the sentencing hearing of the government's evidence and that his counsel had made no request at all for evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger over what role, if any, Local Rule 116.1 should play at sentencing.  Under any analysis, Phaneuf is not entitled to relief here.  He has only himself to blame for any gaps in his knowledge of the basis of the government's sentencing proposals.  Counsel for the defense conceded at the sentencing hearing that, during the two and one-half month period leading up to sentencing, he did not request any data from the prosecution, nor did he request the court to compel the disclosure of any evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The absence of any such requests is especially telling given that three weeks before sentencing the government had filed a sentencing memorandum setting forth the government's position on the loss amount.  Moreover, some four days before sentencing, Assistant United States Attorney Sawyer called defense counsel and offered him an opportunity to inspect and copy the materials referenced in the government's sentencing memorandum--an offer which defense counsel refused, citing a strategic choice to pursue a prosecutorial misfeasance argument.  Even after this argument failed at sentencing, defense counsel did not request a continuance of sentencing to permit him an opportunity to investigate further the government's evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after hearing argument, found that the government did not fail to make available to the defense the documentation supporting its loss calculations.  This finding was amply supported by the facts and arguments presented.  See Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718191\"><a href=\"/opinion/718191/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1305-34-fedrserv3d-1566-rachel-l-fennell/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 532 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that district court has broad discretion over matters concerning discovery);   United States v.

Moreover, by not, even then, requesting a continuance during which the evidence allegedly withheld could be disclosed and reviewed, Phaneuf further weakened any claim he might conceivably have had of an alleged discovery violation.

(n.8);  see also Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 407 (stating that \"[c]ourts can, and frequently do, deal with rough estimates\" when calculating the amount of loss).  The district court found that the loss attributable to Phaneuf was \"not less than $166,299.38\" which placed him in the $100,001 to $200,000 category necessitating a six-level increase in base offense level.  In reaching its loss determination, the court considered:  (1) Agent Hoelen's affidavit describing his investigation and the evidence recovered from Phaneuf's home;  (2) Phaneuf's signed statement made to Agent Hoelen in September of 1990 stating that the amount of loss was approximately $176,000;  and (3) the bankruptcy petition filed by Phaneuf in 1994 which discharged many of his debts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf challenges the court's loss determination as not being based on \"available information\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 comment (n.8), because it was derived in part from Agent Hoelen's affidavit and Phaneuf's statement rather than from the underlying evidence--the credit cards, receipts, sales slips, and other documents collected during the investigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  This argument is without merit.  A district court may rely upon any relevant evidence, including hearsay, to prove facts at sentencing provided the evidence is sufficiently reliable.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a) (A sentencing court \"may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\");   see also Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 407;   Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287;   United States v.

Here, the district court relied on the sworn affidavit of an officer who, having conducted the investigation, had personal knowledge of the events in question.  This is the type and kind of evidence on which sentencing courts often rely.  See e.g., United States v. Aymelek, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556393\"><a href=\"/opinion/556393/united-states-v-kaya-aymelek/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf next argues that he made \"numerous legitimate payments\" on his credit card accounts which may have been included in the court's total loss amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  This argument is equally unavailing.  Phaneuf has not provided any evidence that the legitimate payments were improperly taken into account in determining the loss amount.  Absent such evidence, we logically conclude that the loss calculations upon which the court relied were based on the amount owing to various institutions, rather than the amount paid.

In this case, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the district court went too far, the error was not \"obvious and clear\" nor does it implicate the fairness or integrity of judicial proceedings.  The condition limiting Phaneuf's purchasing power is effective only during his period of supervised release, does not prohibit expenditures of over $100 but merely requires pre-approval of the probation department, and bears at least an arguable relationship to checking the irresponsible behavior that underlay Phaneuf's crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Restitution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phaneuf argues that the sentencing court erred in ordering restitution in the amount of $20,400 to be paid to BNE, pursuant to the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663-3664 (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Our review is for plain error as Phaneuf did not object to the restitution order at sentencing.

First, he asserts that he is incapable of making restitution, citing his history of mental disorders, his lack of professional training, his virtually non-existent employment record, and his lack of assets.  Phaneuf predicts that he will likely be incarcerated again as a result of being unable to satisfy the restitution order.  We find Phaneuf's argument unpersuasive.  The district court was not required to make explicit findings regarding Phaneuf's ability to pay before ordering restitution, so long as it considered the factors set forth in &#167; 3664(a).  See United States v. Newman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195935\"><a href=\"/opinion/195935/united-states-v-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1995);   Springer, 28 F.3d at 239.   Moreover, Phaneuf need not be able to pay the restitution award immediately.  See United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 573 (1st Cir.1993).  Restitution awards may be imposed in order to make victims whole should the defendant become able to pay in the future.  See Newman, 49 F.3d at 10-11.   Here, given that Phaneuf is a 26-year-old high school graduate, it is not unforeseeable that he may earn some income when released from prison.  Moreover, Phaneuf can later seek a modification of the restitution order in the sentencing court if he can show that it is too onerous.  See Springer, 28 F.3d at 239 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Phaneuf argues that the district court erred in ordering restitution to be paid to BNE because, at the time of sentencing, BNE had failed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") had been appointed its receiver.  Phaneuf further argues that the FDIC, which succeeded to the assets and liabilities of the failed bank by operation of law, see 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(d)(2)(A), is not a proper \"victim\" entitled to restitution under the VWPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Phaneuf argues that the letter he received from the probation department instructing him to make his restitution payments to the FDIC was improper.  He contends that an order instructing him to pay an entity other than BNE had to come from the court rather than the probation department.  According to Phaneuf, restitution can only be paid to someone other than the victim, in this case BNE, pursuant to the following provision of the VWPA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>the court may, in the interest of justice, order restitution to any person who has compensated the victim for such loss to the extent that such person paid the compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(e)(1) (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Since the court did not award restitution to the FDIC pursuant to this provision, Phaneuf argues that the restitution order was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no plain error either in the court's restitution order or in the probation department's instructions to make restitution payments to the FDIC.  BNE was in fact a victim of Phaneuf's fraud when committed.  The failure of BNE and the appointment of the FDIC as its receiver had not been brought to the court's attention when it entered its order, hence the court order understandably named BNE.  Given that the FDIC \"steps into the shoes\" of a failed bank,  O'Melveny &amp; Myers v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117849\"><a href=\"/opinion/117849/omelveny-myers-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117849\"><a href=\"/opinion/117849/omelveny-myers-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
