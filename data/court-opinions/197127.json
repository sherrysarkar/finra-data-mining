Facts\r                              \r\n\n          The White  Mountain National Forest  (\"WMNF\") is  a\r\n\npublic resource  managed by the United  States Forest Service\r\n\nfor  a wide  range  of competing  public  uses and  purposes,\r\n\nincluding \"outdoor recreation, range,  timber, watershed, . .\r\n\n.  wildlife and fish purposes,\"  16 U.S.C.    528 (1994), and\r\n\nskiing,  16 U.S.C.   497(b) (1994).  Pursuant to the National\r\n\nForest Management Act of 1976, the Forest Service makes long-\r\n\nterm  plans to  coordinate  these competing  uses, 16  U.S.C.\r\n\n  1604(e)(1)   (1994),  and  issues   \"special  use\"  permits\r\n\nauthorizing private recreational  services on national forest\r\n\nland, 36  C.F.R.    251.50-.65 (1995).   The Forest Service's\r\n\nexercise of  its permitting authority is  legally constrained\r\n\nby environmental  considerations emanating, inter  alia, from\r                                                                   \r\n\nNEPA, the CWA, and Executive Order 11,990.\r\n\n          Loon Pond is located in the WMNF at an elevation of\r\n\n2,400 feet.  It has a  surface area of 19 acres, with shallow\r\n\nareas around the perimeter  and a central bowl 65  feet deep.\r\n\nIt is unusual for  its relatively pristine nature.   There is\r\n\nvirtually no human activity within  the land it drains except\r\n\nskiing  at the privately owned  Loon Mountain Ski  Area.  New\r\n\nHampshire  Department  of  Environmental  Services  (\"NHDES\")\r\n\nregulations  classify  Loon  Pond  as a  Class  A  waterbody,\r\n\nprotected  by  demanding  water  quality  standards  under  a\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nvariety of criteria, see  N.H. Code Admin. R.  Env-Ws 432.03,\r                                    \r\n\nand  as  an  Outstanding  Resource  Water (\"ORW\"),  protected\r\n\nagainst any  measurable long-term degradation  by the State's\r\n\nanti-degradation   rules,  see   id.  437.06;  40   C.F.R.   \r                                                \r\n\n131.12(a)(3) (1995).   It ranks in the  upper 95th percentile\r\n\nof all lakes and ponds in northern New England for low levels\r\n\nof  phosphorus, which  results  in limited  plant growth  and\r\n\ntherefore  high  water clarity  and  higher  total biological\r\n\nproduction.  The pond supports a rich variety  of life in its\r\n\necosystem.    Loon Pond  also constitutes  a major  source of\r\n\ndrinking water for the  town of Lincoln 1,600 feet  below it.\r\n\nA dam  across the outlet  of the Pond  regulates the  flow of\r\n\nwater from the Pond to Lincoln's municipal reservoir.\r\n\n          Loon Corp., defendant-intervenor  herein, owns  the\r\n\nLoon Mountain  Ski Area, which  has operated since  the 1960s\r\n\nnot far from  Loon Pond.  Prior  to the permit  revision that\r\n\ngave rise to this  litigation, Loon Corp. held a  special use\r\n\npermit  to operate on  785 acres of  WMNF land.   That permit\r\n\nallowed Loon Corp. to  draw water (\"drawdown\") for snowmaking\r\n\nfrom Loon  Pond,  as well  as  from the  East Branch  of  the\r\n\nPemigewasset  River (\"East  Branch\")  and  from nearby  Boyle\r\n\nBrook.  In order to use water from Loon Pond, Loon Corp. also\r\n\nneeded authorization from  the Town of Lincoln  and the State\r\n\nof  New  Hampshire.    Beginning  in  1974,  Loon  Corp.  was\r\n\nauthorized to pump snowmaking water from Loon Pond down to 18\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ninches below full level.2  A 1988 amendment to this agreement\r\n\npermitted drawdown below the  18-inch level on a case-by-case\r\n\nbasis.   Combined uses by  Lincoln and Loon  Corp. during the\r\n\nperiod governed by these agreements typically caused four- to\r\n\nsix-foot fluctuations in the level of Loon Pond.\r\n\n          In  addition to being used as a source of water for\r\n\nsnowmaking, Loon Pond has been the repository for disposal of\r\n\nwater  after it  is  pumped through  the snowmaking  system.3\r\n\nThis includes water that  originally came from Loon Pond,  as\r\n\nwell  as water that originated in the East Branch or in Boyle\r\n\nBrook.   Approximately 250,000  gallons of East  Branch water\r\n\nhave  been  transferred into  Loon  Pond  each year  in  this\r\n\nmanner.    Obviously  the  water discharged  into  Loon  Pond\r\n\ncontains at  least the same  pollutants that were  present in\r\n\nthe  intake water.    Evidence in  the record  indicates that\r\n\nintake water  taken from  the East Branch  contains bacteria,\r\n\nother aquatic  organisms such as  Giardia lambia, phosphorus,\r\n\nturbidity and heat.   Evidence was also introduced in  court,\r\n\nbut not available prior to the  issuance of the Environmental\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The level of Loon Pond drops when Pond water  is used for\r\nsnowmaking, because  the Pond  does not receive  much natural\r\nwater through precipitation during the winter.\r\n\n3.  In  order for  Loon  Corp. to  make  snow, it  must  pump\r\nsignificantly more water through  the system than is actually\r\nmade into snow.   Passing this extra water through  the pipes\r\nkeeps them from freezing.  It also provides the pressure that\r\nforces the artificial snow out through snowmaking jets.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nImpact Statement (\"EIS\"), that oil and grease were present in\r\n\nthe discharge water, although their source was disputed.  \r\n\n          In 1986,  Loon Corp. applied to  the Forest Service\r\n\nfor an amendment to its special use permit to allow expansion\r\n\nof  its facilities  within the  WMNF.   Pursuant to  NEPA, 42\r\n\nU.S.C.     4332, the  Service developed  a  draft EIS,  and a\r\n\nsupplement  to the  draft.   Responding to  criticism  of the\r\n\nadequacy  of those  documents,  the Forest  Service issued  a\r\n\nrevised draft  EIS (\"RDEIS\"), which was  published for public\r\n\ncomment.  The RDEIS  set forth five alternatives to  meet the\r\n\nperceived demand for additional alpine skiing.  All five were\r\n\nlocated at the Loon Mountain site.4  \r\n\n          Many   individuals   and  groups,   including  both\r\n\nplaintiffs, filed comments pointing out various environmental\r\n\nproblems with each  alternative that  involved expanding  the\r\n\nski area.   One lengthy comment  from the U.S.  Environmental\r\n\nProtection Agency (\"EPA\") expressed  its concern that the use\r\n\nof  Loon Pond  for snowmaking  purposes would \"use  Loon Pond\r\n\nlike a cistern\" instead of treating it \"with care\" because it\r\n\nis \"acknowledged to be one of the rare high altitude ponds of\r\n\nits size  in the  White Mountains.\"   Joint  Appendix (\"JA\"),\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The Forest  Service's ten-year plan for  the WMNF, issued\r\nin 1986, included  plans for  accommodating increased  demand\r\nfor downhill skiing.   It determined that it would  meet this\r\ndemand through  expansion of  existing ski areas  rather than\r\nthrough the creation  of new ones.   It did  not discuss  the\r\npossibility of  meeting the demand  through alternative sites\r\noutside the national forest.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nvol. II, Response to Public Comment on RDEIS at  A-78.  Other\r\n\ncommenters  suggested that  Loon Corp.  be required  to build\r\n\nartificial  water storage  ponds, in  order to  eliminate the\r\n\nproblem  of depleting  Loon Pond  when withdrawing  water for\r\n\nsnowmaking as  well as  the problem  of adding  pollutants to\r\n\nLoon Pond when discharging water into the Pond after use.\r\n\n          During the EIS process, Ron Buso, a hydrologist for\r\n\nthe  WMNF,  expressed  concern  to   another  Forest  Service\r\n\nhydrologist that the proposed drawdown of Loon Pond by twenty\r\n\nfeet  was likely  to have a  severe impact  on the  Pond.  He\r\n\nexplained that natural snowmelt in New Hampshire is extremely\r\n\nacidic  and  that, as  a result  of  the planned  drawdown, a\r\n\nsubstantial amount  of acidic  snowmelt would remain  in Loon\r\n\nPond, increasing the  Pond's acidity  by a factor  of two  to\r\n\nthree times  what it would  be without the  planned drawdown.\r\n\nWithout  the drawdown, Loon Pond  would be relatively full in\r\n\nthe spring, and much of the snowmelt  from surrounding higher\r\n\nelevations  would glide over the surface of the Pond and down\r\n\nthe  mountain without  significantly mixing  with  other Loon\r\n\nPond water.   According to  Buso and a  number of  scientists\r\n\nwhose affidavits  were submitted  to the district  court, the\r\n\nincrease in the  Pond's acidity due  to the planned  drawdown\r\n\nwould change the chemistry of the Pond, cause toxic metals to\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nbe released  from the sediment, and  kill naturally occurring\r\n\norganisms.\r\n\n          Without addressing  the issues raised  in the  Buso\r\n\nmemorandum or in  the comments suggesting  artificial storage\r\n\nponds, the Forest Service prepared a Final EIS (\"FEIS\").  The\r\n\nFEIS added  a sixth alternative,  also on  the Loon  Mountain\r\n\nsite.   The new  alternative provided  for expansion of  Loon\r\n\nCorp.'s  permit area by 581 acres and for the construction of\r\n\none  new lift and approximately  70 acres of  new ski trails,\r\n\nchanges designed  to accommodate 3,200  additional skiers per\r\n\nday (from  the current 5,800 per  day).   The  Forest Service\r\n\ndeemed Alternative 6 as the preferred alternative.  Under it,\r\n\nLoon  Corp. would more than  double the amount  of water used\r\n\nfor  snowmaking, from  67  million gallons  per  year to  138\r\n\nmillion gallons.   Seventeen million gallons  of the increase\r\n\nwould be drawn from  the East Branch, and 54  million gallons\r\n\nfrom  Loon Pond.  In  addition, Loon Corp.  was authorized to\r\n\ndraw the Pond down  for snowmaking by fifteen feet,  compared\r\n\nto the current eighteen  inches.  The Forest  Service assumed\r\n\nthat the Town of Lincoln would need up  to an additional five\r\n\nfeet  of Pond water, making  a total of  twenty feet that the\r\n\nPond was  expected to be  drawn down  each year.   This would\r\n\nconstitute approximately 63%  of the Pond's water.   In March\r\n\n1993, the Forest Service published a Record of Decision (ROD)\r\n\nadopting Alternative 6.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\n          As  a  mitigation  measure  to  blunt  the  adverse\r\n\nenvironmental  impact  on  Loon  Pond,  the   Forest  Service\r\n\nrequired Loon Corp.  to pump  water from the  East Branch  to\r\n\nLoon Pond  in December and May  of each year if  the Pond was\r\n\nnot otherwise full at those times.   In its FEIS, the  Forest\r\n\nService  recognized  that the  East  Branch  is a  relatively\r\n\nunprotected  Class B  waterway under  New Hampshire  law, and\r\n\nthat  transfer of East Branch water to Loon Pond, a protected\r\n\nClass A waterbody and  Outstanding Resource Water under state\r\n\nand federal  law, would  introduce pollutants into  the Pond.\r\n\nAccordingly, it  specified that this transfer  of East Branch\r\n\nwater  could  not occur  if  it  exceeded certain  levels  of\r\n\nturbidity, bacteria, or oil and grease.  Neither the FEIS nor\r\n\nthe  ROD  set  any limits,  however,  on  the  level of  non-\r\n\nbacterial organisms  such as Giardia lambia  or on pollutants\r\n\nsuch as  phosphorus that  may be  present in the  transferred\r\n\nwater.  Nor  did the  FEIS indicate an  alternative means  of\r\n\nrefilling Loon Pond -- with clean water -- if conditions were\r\n\nsuch  that the transfer of East Branch water would exceed the\r\n\nspecified  levels.5   It did,  however,  provide a  series of\r\n\nrestrictions and monitoring requirements for water levels and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  As noted  supra, absent  some other method  of refilling,\r                               \r\nthe Pond would be refilled by the melting of acidic snow.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nwater  quality,  including daily  testing of  the transferred\r\n\nwater for turbidity, bacteria, and oil and grease.6\r\n\n          Dubois and RESTORE appealed the ROD to the Regional\r\n\nForester and, thereafter, to the Chief of the Forest Service.\r\n\nThese appeals were  denied.   On March 16,  1994, the  Forest\r\n\nService  issued   a  special   use  permit  to   Loon  Corp.,\r\n\nimplementing the decision described in the ROD.\r\n\n          B.

Proceedings Below\r                                          \r\n\n          Plaintiff  Dubois filed a  complaint in  the United\r\n\nStates  District   Court  for  the   District  of  Columbia,7\r\n\nchallenging   the  Forest  Service's  approval  of  the  Loon\r\n\nMountain  expansion  project.    He  made  three  arguments.8\r\n\nFirst, he argued that the Forest Service actions violated the\r\n\nCWA  because they  would lead  to violations  of state  water\r\n\nquality  standards which,  he  asserted, have  the effect  of\r\n\nfederal law because  they were approved  by the federal  EPA.\r\n\nSecond, he argued that the Forest Service  violated both NEPA\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  In  response  to  an  earlier  draft  EIS,  the  EPA  had\r\nexpressed the  following concern:    \"While monitoring  plans\r\nhave  merit, they should not be considered a substitute for a\r\nthorough evaluation  of a  project and its  potential impacts\r\nprior  to action  approval.\"   JA, vol.  I, at  97; see  also\r                                                                         \r\nMassachusetts  v. Watt, 716 F.2d  946, 951-52 (1st Cir. 1983)\r                                  \r\n(NEPA \"requires  an EIS according  to its terms,\"  before the\r\nagency becomes \"committed to  [a] previously chosen course of\r\naction\").\r\n\n7.  The  case  was later  transferred  to  the United  States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of New Hampshire.\r\n\n8.  Plaintiffs  made  other  arguments  below,  but  have not\r\npursued them on appeal.\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nand   Executive   Order  11,990   by   failing   to  consider\r\n\nalternatives to the use  of Loon Pond and failing  to develop\r\n\nadequate mitigation  measures.   Finally, he argued  that the\r\n\nForest Service violated the CWA, 33 U.S.C.   1311, by failing\r\n\nto obtain a National  Pollutant Discharge Elimination  System\r\n\n(\"NPDES\")  permit  before  approving Loon  Corp.'s  expansion\r\n\nplans, which  entailed removing  water from the  East Branch,\r\n\nusing it to pressurize and prevent freezing in its snowmaking\r\n\nequipment,  and then  discharging  the used  water into  Loon\r\n\nPond.  According to  Dubois, an NPDES permit was  required in\r\n\norder  for Loon Corp. to discharge pollutants into Loon Pond,\r\n\nincluding   the  discharge   from  Loon   Corp.'s  snowmaking\r\n\nequipment.     Plaintiff RESTORE,  a membership organization,\r\n\nintervened on behalf of its members to challenge the project.\r\n\nRESTORE first  reiterated Dubois' claim that  an NPDES permit\r\n\nwas  required.  In addition,  RESTORE claimed that the Forest\r\n\nService violated  NEPA by  failing to prepare  a Supplemental\r\n\nEIS  after  it  developed  Alternative  6  as  the  preferred\r\n\nalternative.  According to RESTORE, this new alternative, not\r\n\nspecifically mentioned in the  previously published draft EIS\r\n\nor  RDEIS,  contained  substantial changes  to  the  proposed\r\n\naction  that  are relevant  to environmental  concerns, which\r\n\nrequired   a  supplemental  EIS   under  NEPA   and  relevant\r\n\nimplementing regulations.   Finally, RESTORE  claimed that  a\r\n\nsupplemental  EIS was  required because the  Forest Service's\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nFinal  EIS  failed  to  \"rigorously explore  and  objectively\r\n\nevaluate all  reasonable  alternatives\" that  are capable  of\r\n\nmeeting  the stated goals of  the project, as  required by 40\r\n\nC.F.R.   1502.14 (1995).  According to RESTORE, the  asserted\r\n\ngoal of meeting skier demand could have been met by expanding\r\n\nski  areas other than Loon, in  particular, ski areas located\r\n\noutside the White Mountain National Forest.\r\n\n          The parties cross-moved for summary judgment.  Loon\r\n\nCorp.  intervened, and  moved to  dismiss on the  ground that\r\n\nboth plaintiffs  lacked standing.  The  district court denied\r\n\nLoon Corp.'s motion to  dismiss, granted summary judgment for\r\n\nthe Forest  Service, and denied the plaintiffs' cross-motions\r\n\nfor summary judgment.\r\n\n                   II.

The court expressed its  understanding of\r\n\nDubois' standing allegations as follows:\r\n\n          Mr.   Dubois'  injury   in  fact   is  he\r\n          periodically comes back  to the area  and\r\n          enjoys  its natural  beauty  and will  be\r\n          injured  by not being  able to experience\r\n          its  natural beauty  if  the  project  is\r\n          allowed  to go forward? . . .  It's not a\r\n          case  of someone who's  simply saying I'm\r\n          an environmentalist and I want to protect\r\n          the    environment,    which    everybody\r\n          presumably  has  an  interest  in  doing.\r\n          It's somebody who  says I'm back  there a\r\n          lot,  I drink  the  water a  lot, I'm  up\r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\n          there  in the  woods a  lot, and  this is\r\n          going to hurt me.\r\n\nId. at 8, 12.\r               \r\n\n          We think it useful to  compare the facts here  with\r\n\nthose  alleged in  AVX,  962 F.2d  at  116-17.   In  AVX, the\r                                                                    \r\n\nplaintiff organization had simply made conclusory allegations\r\n\nthat its \"members have been and will continue to be harmed by\r\n\nthe releases  that [were] the subject  of [that] litigation\";\r\n\nits  \"averment  [had]  no   substance:  the  members   [were]\r\n\nunidentified; their  places of  abode [were] not  stated; the\r\n\nextent and  frequency of any  individual use of  the affected\r\n\nresources [was] left  open to surmise.\"   Id.

These are the\r\n\ntypes of interests which  the Supreme Court has held  -- when\r\n\nasserted  by an organization such as RESTORE on behalf of its\r\n\nmembers   --  satisfy  the  constitutional  requirements  for\r\n\nstanding.   See  SCRAP, 412  U.S. at  685-87; Sierra  Club v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nMorton, 405 U.S.  at 734-35 &amp; n.8;  see also supra, note  10.\r                                                              \r\n\nThere  is certainly no reason  why an organization would have\r\n\nstanding to raise these interests  on behalf of its  members,\r\n\nbut an individual such  as Dubois would not have  standing to\r\n\nraise the same interests on his own behalf.\r\n\n          Thus, with the  degree of specificity  necessary at\r\n\nthe pleading stage, Dubois has articulated -- directly and by\r\n\ninference  -- how  his personal  interests will  be adversely\r\n\naffected  by the  Loon  expansion proposal.13   Finally,  his\r\n\ninjuries  are \"likely to be  redressed\" by the  relief he has\r\n\nrequested  in  the  complaint:   inter  alia,  an  injunction\r                                                        \r\n\nagainst the project's proceeding.

Our analysis is not altered by the fact that three of\r\nthe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The\r\nstanding issue was raised only in Loon Corp.'s motion to\r\ndismiss.  Where, as here, the defendants have not\r\ncontradicted the factual allegations concerning standing that\r\nwe deem adequate at the motion to dismiss stage, we will not\r\nsubject those allegations to a summary judgment level of\r\nscrutiny in the absence of a motion for summary judgment on\r\nthe issue.

Accordingly, we find\r\n\nthat Dubois has standing  to litigate the claims he  seeks to\r\n\npursue on appeal.\r\n\n                  III.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                              III.

The adverse environmental impacts of  using Loon\r\n\nPond  were before  the agency,  and more  than one  commenter\r\n\nproposed building artificial water storage  ponds, a proposal\r\n\nthat would, on its face, avoid some of those adverse impacts.\r\n\nOne such commenter, Paul Beaudin of the Lincoln  Committee of\r\n\nConcerned  Citizens  (LCCC), enclosed  clippings  pointing up\r\n\n                             -35-\r\r\n\n\"the  wisdom  of  [Loon Corp.'s]  need  to  enact the  LCCC's\r                                                  \r\n\nproposal for water  containment pond[s] high up on  the Boyle\r\n\nBrook.\"  JA, vol. II, Response  to Public Comment on RDEIS at\r\n\nA-12.   The  LCCC proposal itself,  made two  months earlier,\r\n\nreferred  to  a letter  from  the  National Ecology  Research\r\n\nCenter   recommending   consideration   of    water   storage\r\n\nalternatives  other  than  Loon  Pond,  and  enclosed  a  map\r\n\nindicating  where  up to  three  containment  ponds could  be\r\n\ninstalled.   LCCC listed some nine  advantages, including the\r\n\ncost-saving factor of  servicing two-thirds to  three-fourths\r\n\nof Loon Corp.'s snowmaking system by gravity feed.16\r\n\n          Instead of \"rigorously explor[ing]\" the alternative\r\n\nof using artificial water storage units instead of Loon Pond,\r\n\nthe  Forest Service's  Final  EIS did  not  respond to  these\r\n\ncomments at all.   The agency did not in  any way explain its\r\n\nreasoning  or  provide a  factual  basis for  its  refusal to\r\n\nconsider,  in general,  the  possibility of  alternatives  to\r\n\nusing  Loon  Pond   for  snowmaking,  or   LCCC's  reasonably\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  In addition to the Beaudin/LCCC proposal, plaintiff\r\nDubois' comments also suggested that Loon Corp. build\r\nartificial water storage units, in his case underground. \r\nThis suggestion, requiring costly subterranean construction,\r\nmay be more facially vulnerable than Beaudin/LCCC's; it may\r\nor may not alone have required an explicit response, however\r\nbrief.

JA, vol. I, at 457, 465.  This is 73%\r\n\nmore  than the  71  million gallons  of  water that  the  ROD\r\n\nestimates  would  be  withdrawn  from  Loon  Pond  under  the\r\n\napproved  Loon  Mountain  expansion  project.    Beaudin/LCCC\r\n\nproposed constructing three similar  ponds in the Boyle Brook\r\n\narea high up Loon Mountain.  In addition, the record contains\r\n\nevidence  that Loon Corp. owns  365 acres of  private land at\r\n\nthe base of the  ski area, where similar storage  ponds could\r\n\nbe constructed,  and that  such ponds  could  be filled  with\r\n\nwater from the East Branch, which is typically high enough in\r\n\nthe spring to contribute to flooding in downstream areas.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.

However, the Forest Service does not suggest that\r\nBeaudin's comment letter -- responding to the Forest\r\nService's RDEIS -- did not fairly refer to the prior LCCC\r\nproposal, or that this proposal was unknown to the Service.\r\n\n                             -37-\r\r\n\n          Our  conclusion is buttressed by NEPA's requirement\r\n\nthat an agency consider and an EIS discuss \"steps that can be\r\n\ntaken to mitigate the adverse environmental consequences\"  of\r\n\na proposed project.

The record indicates\r                            \r\n\nserious adverse consequences to Loon Pond if it is used \"as a\r\n\ncistern,\"  to use  EPA's  words, and  at  least a  reasonable\r\n\nprobability that  the use  of artificial storage  ponds could\r\n\navoid  those  consequences.

Moreover,\r\n\nbecause the  Forest Service  did not satisfy  the requirement\r\n\nthat  it \"rigorously  explore and  objectively  evaluate\" all\r\n\nreasonable  alternatives,18  40   C.F.R.     1502.14(a),  its\r\n\ndecision was not in  accordance with law.19   See 5 U.S.C.   \r                                                             \r\n\n706(2)(A).\r\n\n                 D.

In addition to  the question of  an alternative to  Loon\r\nPond as a source of water or  as a discharge point, plaintiff\r\nRESTORE  has  raised a  second issue  regarding alternatives.\r\nRESTORE  asserts   that  the   Forest  Service  should   have\r\nconsidered alternative sites for the entire  project, outside\r\nof the White Mountain  National Forest.   The  district court\r\nfound that  such alternative  sites were not  appropriate for\r\nstudy because  some draw from different markets and others do\r\nnot offer the same type of skiing experience as the  WMNF ski\r\nareas which have more terrain, higher mountains, more natural\r\nsnow, and better facilities  than their counterparts  outside\r\nthe WMNF.  We agree.\r\n\n19.  Dubois also notes that the  FEIS failed to disclose what\r\nhe  claims are  numerous  violations of  state water  quality\r\nstandards,  which \"renders the FEIS unacceptable under NEPA.\"\r\nDubois  Brief  at  16  n.11; see  Northwest  Indian  Cemetery\r                                                                         \r\nProtective Ass'n v.

It contends\r\n\nthat plaintiffs failed adequately to raise  their contentions\r\n\nduring the public comment period,  so they waived their right\r\n\nto  pursue  these challenges  on  their merits.    The Forest\r\n\nService argues  that, \"[i]f commenters could require agencies\r\n\nto   undertake  detailed   comparative  analyses   merely  by\r\n\nasserting   the   superiority   of   an   alternative   site,\r\n\nconfiguration  or  method, only  the imaginations  of project\r\n\nopponents  would limit the length of EISs and the duration of\r\n\nthe  NEPA process.\"  Forest Service Brief at 53.  Raising the\r\n\nspecter of catastrophe only  obfuscates the real issues here:\r\n\nwhether the Forest Service adequately considered alternatives\r\n\nto  using Loon Pond as a vehicle for Loon Corp.'s snowmaking,\r\n\nwith adequacy based on the reasonableness and practicality of\r\n\nthe alternatives, and  whether the Forest Service  adequately\r\n\nexplained   in  its   FEIS  why   it  decided   against  such\r\n\nalternatives.\r\n\n          The Forest Service  relies on Roosevelt Campobello:\r                                                                        \r\n\n\"In order to preserve an alternatives issue for review, it is\r\n\nnot enough  simply to  make a facially  plausible suggestion;\r\n\nrather, an  intervenor must  offer tangible evidence  that an\r                                                                         \r\n\nalternative  site  might  offer  a   substantial  measure  of\r                             \r\n\nsuperiority  as a site.\"   684 F.2d at  1047 (emphasis added)\r\n\n(quotation  omitted).    The  Forest  Service's  reliance  on\r\n\nRoosevelt  Campobello  is  misplaced.   That  case,  and  the\r                                 \r\n\n                             -42-\r\r\n\nprecedents it relied on,  dealt with a claim that  the agency\r\n\nhad not considered all appropriate alternative sites on which\r                                                                \r\n\nto locate  a particular  project.

Here, the  Forest Service  was\r\n\nalerted by commenters to  the alternative of using artificial\r\n\nstorage  ponds instead of Loon Pond for snowmaking;  but even\r\n\nwithout  such  comments,  it  should  have  been  \"reasonably\r\n\n                             -43-\r\r\n\napparent\" to the  Forest Service,  Roosevelt Campobello,  684\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d at 1047, not \"unknown,\" Seacoast  Anti-Pollution League,\r                                                                        \r\n\n598 F.2d at 1229, that such an alternative existed.\r\n\n          In the instant case,  at least two commenters, Paul\r\n\nBeaudin of LCCC and plaintiff  Dubois, provided notice to the\r\n\nForest  Service,  informing  it  of the  substance  of  their\r\n\nproposed alternative.   Though  not detailed,  these comments\r\n\nsubmitted  in response  to  the Forest  Service's RDEIS  made\r\n\nclear that the commenters  thought the agency should consider\r\n\nsome alternative source  of water  other than  Loon Pond  and\r\n\nsome  alternative place to  discharge the water  after it had\r\n\ngone  through the snowmaking pipes.  They argued that such an\r\n\nalternative would reduce the negative environmental impact on\r\n\nLoon Pond from depleting the  pond's water and from refilling\r\n\nthe pond with polluted  water either from the East  Branch or\r\n\nfrom  acidic  snowmelt.   Dubois  explicitly  and Beaudin  by\r\n\nreference suggested  the possibility of  new man-made storage\r\n\nunits  to accomplish  these goals.

Therefore, plaintiffs assert that,\r\n\nby  not describing  Alternative 6  in a  supplemental  EIS --\r\n\nwhich would give the  public an opportunity to comment  on it\r\n\nand  give the Forest Service the benefit of those comments in\r\n\nits consideration of the environmental impact of  Alternative\r\n\n6 --  the  Forest  Service  collided  with  both  the  public\r\n\ninformation and the  agency guidance objectives of  NEPA.  In\r\n\nresponse, defendants argue that plaintiffs' interpretation of\r\n\nthe  previously discussed alternatives  is incorrect, because\r\n\nAlternative  6  is  merely  a   scaled-down  modification  of\r\n\nAlternative  2 which, as proposed in two phases in the RDEIS,\r\n\nwould  have been  far larger  and far  more intrusive  on the\r\n\nenvironment than the new preferred Alternative 6.  Plaintiffs\r\n\nreply that only Phase I and not Phase II of Alternative 2 was\r\n\nseriously considered and analyzed prior to the development of\r\n\nAlternative  6 in  the  final EIS.22    Defendants deny  this\r\n\nassertion.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n22.  Plaintiffs point  to  several instances  where the  FEIS\r\nstated that further environmental analysis would be conducted\r\nin the future  if and  when Loon Corp.  sought permission  to\r\nproceed with Phase II.\r\n\n                             -48-\r\r\n\n          We conclude, based on the record in this case, that\r\n\na supplemental  EIS was required.   The scope of  review of a\r\n\nreviewing  court  is  the  APA's  \"arbitrary  and capricious\"\r\n\nstandard.

In the  instant case, however,\r                 \r\n\nnothing  in  the FEIS  indicates  that  any such  technically\r\n\ncomplex scientific  analysis would  be required in  order for\r\n\nthis  court  to  determine  that  Alternative  6  involves  a\r\n\n\"substantial  change\"  from  the   prior  proposals  at  Loon\r\n\nMountain.\r\n\n          Alternative 6, adopted by the Forest Service as its\r\n\npreferred alternative in the final EIS, does not fall \"within\r\n\nthe   spectrum  of  alternatives\"  that  were  considered  in\r\n\nprevious drafts, even if  Phase II of Alternative 2  had been\r\n\nadequately analyzed prior to the FEIS.  Alternative 6 entails\r\n\na different  configuration of  activities and  locations, not\r\n\nmerely   a   reduced  version   of   a  previously-considered\r\n\nalternative.   Phase II  of Alternative 2  proposed expanding\r\n\nthe ski area primarily on land that is not within the current\r\n\npermit area; in  contrast, Alternative 6 squeezes much of its\r\n\n                             -49-\r\r\n\nexpansion into that current permit area.  To accomplish this,\r\n\nAlternative  6  widens existing  trails  so  as to  eliminate\r\n\nbuffers  that  currently  separate   the  trails.    It  also\r\n\nenvisions a 28,500-square-foot base lodge facility within the\r\n\nexisting permit  area.   And it  develops ski  trails, access\r\n\nroads  and lifts on land that the prior alternatives had left\r\n\nas  a  woodland  buffer between  the  old  ski  area and  the\r\n\nproposed expansion area.   These are substantial changes from\r\n\nthe previously-discussed alternatives, not mere modifications\r\n\n\"within the spectrum\" of those prior  alternatives.  It would\r\n\nbe  one thing  if  the  Forest  Service  had  adopted  a  new\r\n\nalternative that was actually  within the range of previously\r\n\nconsidered alternatives,  e.g., simply reducing the  scale of\r                                          \r\n\nevery  relevant particular.   It  is quite  another thing  to\r\n\nadopt  a proposal  that is  configured differently,  in which\r\n\ncase  public commenters might have  pointed out, if given the\r\n\nopportunity --  and the  Forest Service might  have seriously\r\n\nconsidered  --   wholly  new   problems  posed  by   the  new\r\n\nconfiguration  (even if  some of  the  environmental problems\r\n\npresent in the prior alternatives have been eliminated).\r\n\n          Nor  can it  be  said that  these  changes are  not\r\n\n\"relevant to  environmental concerns.\"  They  could very well\r\n\nhave environmental  impacts that  the Forest Service  has not\r\n\nyet considered,  simply based on their  more compact physical\r\n\nlocation.   Indeed,  the RDEIS  said the  Forest  Service had\r\n\n                             -50-\r\r\n\nconsidered    expansion    alternatives   such    as   \"other\r\n\nconfigurations  on  the  existing  permit  area,\"  but  these\r\n\nalternatives \"were eliminated  from detailed analysis because\r\n\nthey were not reasonable or feasible alternatives.\"  JA, vol.\r\n\nI,  at 145-46.  Moreover, the plan selected, Alternative 6 in\r\n\nthe FEIS, would require that four million gallons  more water\r\n\nbe  withdrawn  annually  for snowmaking,  compared  with  the\r\n\nclosest alternative among the five  previously given detailed\r\n\nconsideration.   Whether or not  viewed in the  graphic terms\r\n\ndescribed  by  plaintiff  RESTORE  --  four  million  gallons\r\n\nannually is  enough water  \"to create  a lake  the size  of a\r\n\nfootball field more than eleven  feet deep,\" RESTORE Brief at\r\n\n33  --  this change  can be  expected  to have  a significant\r\n\nenough  effect on  the environment  that additional  analysis\r\n\nthrough a supplemental EIS would be required.

We conclude, based on the record in this\r\n\ncase, that Alternative 6 entails substantial changes from the\r\n\npreviously   proposed   actions   that   are    relevant   to\r\n\nenvironmental concerns, and that   the Forest Service did not\r\n\npresent  those changes to the  public in its  FEIS for review\r\n\nand comment.   Accordingly,  the Forest Service's  failure to\r\n\nprepare a supplemental EIS was arbitrary and capricious. \r\n\n                VI.   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11,990 \r                            VI.

The\r\n\ndistrict court rejected this argument on essentially the same\r\n\ngrounds as the NEPA argument.  \r\n\n          On  appeal,  the   government  contends  that   the\r\n\nExecutive  Order  is not  enforceable,  at  least by  private\r\n\nparties, because NEPA did  not confer rulemaking authority on\r\n\nthe President.  Plaintiffs argue that  the Executive Order is\r\n\naccorded  the  full   force  and  effect  of  a   statute  or\r\n\nregulation,  enforceable   under  the  APA.     We  have  not\r\n\npreviously decided this precise issue, nor need we decide  it\r\n\nnow.\r\n\n          Even   assuming  that   the   Executive  Order   is\r\n\nenforceable  under  the   APA,  it  does  not  apply  to  the\r\n\ncircumstances of this case.  The Executive  Order states that\r\n\nfederal agencies,\r\n\n          to  the  extent permitted  by  law, shall\r\n          avoid undertaking or providing assistance\r\n          for new construction located  in wetlands\r\n          unless the  head of the  agency finds (1)\r\n          that there is no  practicable alternative\r\n          to  such construction,  and (2)  that the\r\n          proposed action  includes all practicable\r\n          measures  to  minimize  harm to  wetlands\r\n          which may result from such use.\r\n\nExec. Order No.  11,990,   2.  There is  no dispute that Loon\r\n\nPond  is a \"wetland.\"   The Forest Service, however, contends\r\n\n                             -52-\r\r\n\nthat the Loon Corp.  expansion plan does not  constitute \"new\r\n\nconstruction.\"      The   Executive   Order    defines   \"new\r\n\nconstruction\" to include  \"draining, dredging,  channelizing,\r\n\nfilling, diking, impounding, and related activities.\"  Id.,  \r                                                                      \r\n\n7(b).  Dubois claims that the use of Loon Pond as a source of\r\n\nwater for snowmaking and the discharge of used water from the\r\n\nsnowmaking  pipes into  Loon Pond  constitute \"draining\"  and\r\n\n\"filling\" within the meaning of   7(b).\r\n\n          We  agree with  the  Forest Service  that the  mere\r\n\nexpansion of a previously ongoing withdrawal of water from or\r\n\naddition of  water to  a reservoir ordinarily  does not  fall\r\n\nwithin the ambit of  the Executive Order's \"new construction\"\r\n\nrequirement.23   This  conclusion  is dictated  by the  plain\r\n\nmeaning  of the  phrase  \"new construction,\"  which does  not\r\n\nordinarily  encompass  the  mere  expansion   of  an  ongoing\r\n\nactivity,   unless  that  activity  itself  constituted  \"new\r\n\nconstruction.\"     Likewise,  in  common   usage,  the  words\r\n\n\"draining\" and \"filling\"  generally refer to  activities that\r\n\neliminate a wetland to  convert it to another use, not to the\r\n\nexpansion  of  an activity  that  already  adds  water to  or\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n23.  It  is conceivable, of  course, that an  expansion of an\r\nalready existing activity could fall within the ambit of  the\r                                           \r\nExecutive Order's \"new construction\" requirement.  This could\r\noccur if  the expansion  effectuated a qualitative  change in\r\nthe nature of the  activity, rather than a  mere quantitative\r\nenlargement of that activity.  On the record before us in the\r\ninstant case, we cannot say that plaintiffs have demonstrated\r\nsuch a qualitative change.\r\n\n                             -53-\r\r\n\nwithdraws  water  from  an existing  pond.    Our reading  is\r\n\nbuttressed  by common sense:  one would not ordinarily think,\r\n\nwithout  more,  that a  federal  agency  operating a  dam  on\r\n\nfederal land would  be required, by  the Executive Order,  to\r\n\nissue  notices and make findings every time water is added to\r\n\nor  withdrawn from the dam (assuming that the dam has already\r\n\nmet all legal requirements to begin operation).\r\n\n          Applying  the foregoing  analysis of  the Executive\r\n\nOrder to the record in the instant case, we conclude that the\r\n\nsituation  here  is  more akin  to  an  expansion of  ongoing\r\n\nactivities than to  \"new construction.\"  The town  of Lincoln\r\n\nis already  using Loon Pond as  a source of town  water.  And\r\n\nLoon  Corp. has been using the Pond  as a source of water for\r\n\nsnowmaking, to  a depth of four  to six feet on  the average.\r\n\nIt is true  that the extent  of this intrusion  is less  than\r\n\nwould  be  the  case  under  the  proposed  expansion.    But\r\n\nplaintiffs   did   not  challenge   these  currently-existing\r\n\nintrusions, and  they have  not demonstrated a  factual basis\r\n\nfor their  conclusion that  there is something  qualitatively\r\n\n\"new\" about the  proposed drawdown.  Thus, the  proposed Loon\r\n\nCorp.  expansion project  --  by drawing  down a  substantial\r\n\nadditional amount of  water from Loon  Pond and refilling  it\r\n\nwith  East Branch  water or  with acidic  runoff --  does not\r\n\nsatisfy  the  definition  of  \"new  construction\"  within the\r\n\nmeaning of Executive Order 11,990, even though it constitutes\r\n\n                             -54-\r\r\n\na major  action with  significant impact on  the environment,\r\n\ntriggering NEPA's EIS requirements.\r\n\n              VII.

Defendants  argue that the NPDES permit\r\n\nissue  is not  properly raised  because plaintiffs  failed to\r\n\nprovide  notice  of  their  intentions to  sue  Loon  Corp.25\r\n\nDefendants contend that Section  505(b) of the CWA \"prohibits\r\n\ncitizen  plaintiffs from  filing [suit  to enforce  the CWA's\r\n\nNPDES  permit requirement] until at least  60 days after they\r\n\nhave provided notice of their intent  to sue\" to EPA, to  the\r\n\nState  in which the  alleged violation occurred,  and to \"any\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n24.  The  third major  aspect  of  the  CWA  is  the  use  of\r\nindustry-specific  effluent standards to  control the quality\r\nof effluent  that can  be attained using  available pollution\r\ncontrol technology.  33 U.S.C.    1311, et seq.

The Forest Service also asserts  that no claim can stand\r\nagainst it as a defendant  because EPA regulations place  the\r\nresponsibility   for  obtaining   an  NPDES  permit   on  the\r\n\"operator\"  of  a covered  activity;  the  Forest Service  is\r\nmerely  the owner  of the  land on  which the  activity takes\r\nplace.  This argument is unavailing:  if an NPDES permit were\r\nrequired,  as plaintiffs  contend,  then  the Forest  Service\r\nshould  not have granted a  special use permit  to Loon Corp.\r\nuntil the NPDES permit had been obtained.\r\n\n                             -56-\r\r\n\nalleged  violator\"  of the  standard,  limitation,  or order.\r\n\nForest  Service  Brief at  37; see  33  U.S.C.    1365 (b)(1)\r                                              \r\n\n(1994).  It is undisputed, however, that Dubois, the original\r\n\nplaintiff, did provide  notice to the  Forest Service of  his\r\n\nintent to sue.   The  Forest Service was  the only  defendant\r\n\nthat he did sue; and he alleged only that the Forest Service,\r\n\nnot Loon Corp., had  violated federal statutes, including the\r\n\nCWA, in approving Loon Corp.'s expansion plan.   The district\r\n\ncourt therefore  had jurisdiction to hear  Dubois' claim that\r\n\nthe Forest Service had approved the  project illegally by not\r\n\nensuring that  an NPDES  permit was obtained.   His  properly\r\n\nraised NEPA claim subsumed the CWA claim.26\r\n\n          Thus,  even  if Loon  Corp.'s  lack  of notice  did\r\n\ndeprive us  of jurisdiction  to hear  Dubois' claim  that the\r\n\nForest  Service violated  the  CWA by  failing to  require an\r\n\nNPDES permit  before approving  the special use  permit, this\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n26.

Cir. 1991).\r                                 \r\n\nThis  is because, as  noted supra,  NEPA requires  the Forest\r                                             \r\n\nService to identify in  its EIS all federal permits  that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n27.  Nor is RESTORE precluded from pursuing its claims on the\r\nground that it  did not  notify defendants of  its intent  to\r\nbring suit.  RESTORE was an intervenor, merely joining a suit\r\nthat was already  in esse; it did not  bring a new suit.   As\r                                     \r\nsuch,  RESTORE was not required  to notify Loon  Corp. of its\r\nintent to  bring suit.    We need  look no  further than  the\r\nstatutory  language itself:    \"No action  may be  commenced\"\r                                                                        \r\nwithout  the requisite notice.  33 U.S.C.   1365(b).  RESTORE\r\ndid not \"commence\" this action; it  intervened in an existing\r\naction.   Moreover, the purpose of  the notice requirement --\r\nto give  the parties  an opportunity to  resolve the  problem\r\nadministratively or  to settle  the matter without  resort to\r\nthe  courts,  before  the  parties  have assumed  adversarial\r\npositions brought about by litigation -- no longer applied at\r\nthe  time RESTORE intervened in the ongoing suit.  Hence, the\r\npurpose of  the notice  requirement would  not  be served  by\r\napplying it to an intervenor like RESTORE.\r\n\n            Nor  are  we faced  with  the  kind of  equitable\r\nconsiderations  discussed in  Hallstrom v.  Tillamook County,\r                                                                        \r\n493  U.S. 20,  29 (1989),  in holding  an  original plaintiff\r\nstrictly  to the  notice  requirement.   Unlike the  original\r\nplaintiff, who has full  control over when to file  the suit,\r\nan  intervenor like RESTORE has no control over the timing of\r\nthe initial  action.  Because  this action was  already being\r\nlitigated on  an expedited schedule, RESTORE  could well have\r\nlost  the  opportunity to  protect  its interests  if  it had\r\nserved  a notice  of intent to  sue and  then waited  60 days\r\nbefore intervening  in the  expedited case.   The balance  of\r\nequities here favors permitting RESTORE to pursue its claims.\r\n\n                             -58-\r\r\n\nproject  needed in  order to  comply with  applicable federal\r\n\nlaw.   40 C.F.R.    1502.25(b).   There is  no question  that\r\n\nplaintiffs  have properly  invoked  the jurisdiction  of this\r\n\ncourt, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1331 (general federal question\r\n\njurisdiction), to  challenge  defendants' failure  to  comply\r\n\nwith  NEPA  in this  regard.   For  these reasons,  we reject\r\n\ndefendants' jurisdictional argument and turn to the merits.\r\n\n          B.   NPDES Permit\r                      B.   NPDES Permit\r                                       \r\n\n          Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act prohibits the\r\n\n\"discharge of  any pollutant\" into navigable  waters from any\r\n\n\"point  source\" without an NPDES permit.  33 U.S.C.   1311(a)\r\n\n(1994).   Plaintiffs argue  that the Forest  Service violated\r\n\nSection 301(a) by  failing to obtain  an NPDES permit  before\r\n\napproving Loon's plan  to remove water from  the East Branch,\r\n\nuse  it to pressurize and prevent  freezing in its snowmaking\r\n\nequipment, and then  discharge the used water into Loon Pond.\r\n\nSection 301(a)  prohibits the \"discharge of  any pollutant by\r\n\nany person\"  except as authorized pursuant to a permit issued\r\n\nunder the  Act.   Id.; see  33 U.S.C.     1342, 1344  (1994);\r                                      \r\n\nCommonwealth of P.R., 721  F.2d at 835.  The  term \"discharge\r                                \r\n\nof  a pollutant\" is defined as \"any addition of any pollutant\r\n\nto  navigable waters  from any  point source.\"   33  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1362(12)(A) (1994).  The definition of a \"pollutant\" includes\r\n\n\"dredged  spoil, solid  waste, . .  . sewage, garbage,  . . .\r\n\nbiological materials, .  . .  heat,  . .  . sand, .  . .  and\r\n\n                             -59-\r\r\n\nagricultural waste.\"  33 U.S.C.   1362(6) (1994).  \"Navigable\r\n\nwaters\" is  defined as \"the waters of the United States.\"  33\r\n\nU.S.C.    1362(7) (1994).   The district court  found and the\r\n\nparties agree that Loon Pond is a water of the United States,\r\n\nthat  the  East Branch  water  discharged  from Loon  Corp.'s\r\n\nsnowmaking pipes  into Loon Pond  is a  pollutant within  the\r\n\nmeaning of the CWA,28 and that the pipe discharging the water\r\n\ninto Loon Pond  is a  point source.   The question, then,  is\r\n\nwhether  there is  an \"addition\"  of pollutants to  Loon Pond\r\n\nwhen  water containing  pollutants  is discharged  from  Loon\r\n\nCorp.'s snowmaking equipment into Loon Pond.\r\n\n          The district  court answered  this question in  the\r\n\nnegative.   The court reasoned that the intake water from the\r\n\nEast Branch of the  Pemigewasset River and the water  in Loon\r\n\nPond are  all part of \"a singular  entity, 'the waters of the\r                                                           \r\n\nUnited States,'\" and  therefore that \"the bodies of water are\r\n\nnot  to   be  considered  individually   in  this   context.\"\r\n\nMemorandum  and Order at 13.  Because it interpreted the East\r\n\nBranch  and  Loon  Pond to  be  part  of  the same  \"singular\r\n\nentity,\"  the court concluded that the transfer of water from\r\n\nthe  East  Branch into  Loon  Pond  would not  constitute  an\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n28.  It  contains  at least  the  same  pollutants that  were\r\npresent  in the water from the East Branch before intake into\r\nthe pipes.\r\n\n                             -60-\r\r\n\n\"addition\" into the Pond, at least if the pipes  added no new\r\n\npollutants.29  Id.\r                              \r\n\n          There is no basis  in law or fact for  the district\r\n\ncourt's \"singular  entity\" theory.  The error  in the court's\r\n\nreasoning  is highlighted by an  analogy the court  drew:  it\r\n\nhypothesized a pond in  which \"we place a  pipe . . .  and we\r\n\npump  the pond water from the bottom  to the surface.  No one\r\n\nwould  reasonably  contend that  internal  pumping  causes an\r\n\n'addition' of  pollutants to  the pond.    Instead, we  would\r\n\nconsider  the pumping  to be  a redistribution  of pollutants\r\n\nfrom one  part of the pond to  another.\"  Id. at  12.  Such a\r                                                         \r\n\nsituation is not at all analogous to the instant case.  There\r\n\nis no barrier separating the water at the top of  a pond from\r\n\nthe  water  at  the  bottom  of  the  same  pond;  chemicals,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n29.  This premise is a disputed issue.  Plaintiffs argue that\r\nallowing the water from  the East Branch to flow  through the\r\npipes before discharge into Loon Pond results in the addition\r\nof not insignificant  amounts of oil and  grease.  Defendants\r\ndispute this, which ordinarily would result in a reversal of\r\nsummary judgment on  this issue.  See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56(c).\r                                                 \r\nDefendants argue,  however, that  plaintiffs failed  to raise\r\nthis factual dispute before the  agency in timely fashion, so\r\nit  is not preserved for our review.  Plaintiffs respond that\r\nthey  could  not  have  raised  this  dispute  prior  to  the\r\npublication  of the FEIS  because the Forest  Service did not\r\neven collect the  data regarding oil  and grease until  after\r\nissuing its decision  (the ROD).   We need  not resolve  this\r\ndispute;  we hold infra  that, even if  the pipes add  no new\r                                   \r\npollutants, the  transfer of  East Branch water  through Loon\r\nCorp.'s  privately owned  pipes and  its discharge  into Loon\r\nPond constitutes  a point source  discharge of at  least some\r\npollutants into the Pond,  thereby requiring an NPDES permit.\r\nUpon remand,  the parties are not  foreclosed from presenting\r\ntheir factual disputes to  the EPA if they decide  to contest\r\nthe issuance of that permit.\r\n\n                             -61-\r\r\n\norganisms, and even heat are able to pass from the top to the\r\n\nbottom or vice versa, at rates determined only by the laws of\r                                \r\n\nscience.  \r\n\n          In contrast, the transfer  of water or its contents\r\n\nfrom  the East Branch to Loon Pond would not occur naturally.\r\n\nThis is more analogous to the example the district court gave\r\n\nfrom the opposite end of the spectrum:  where water is  added\r\n\n\"from an external source\"  to the pond and an NPDES permit is\r\n\nrequired.  Id.  As in this converse  example, the East Branch\r                          \r\n\nand Loon Pond are not the same body of water; the East Branch\r\n\nis indeed  a source  \"external\" to  Loon Pond.   We  can take\r\n\njudicial notice that the Pemigewasset River was for years one\r\n\nof the most  polluted rivers in  New England, the  repository\r\n\nfor  raw  sewage from  factories and  towns.   It  emitted an\r\n\noverwhelming  odor  and  was  known  to  peel  the paint  off\r\n\nbuildings  located on  its banks.   Yet,  under  the district\r\n\ncourt's theory,  even if  such conditions still  prevailed, a\r\n\nproposal to withdraw water from the Pemigewasset to discharge\r\n\nit into Loon Pond would be analogous to moving water from the\r\n\ntop to the bottom of  a single pond; it would not  constitute\r\n\nan \"addition\" of pollutants \"from an external source\" because\r\n\nboth the East Branch and Loon Pond are part of the \"singular\"\r\n\nwaters of the United States.30  The district court apparently\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n30.  Again,  we  leave  to  one  side  the  possibility  that\r\nadditional pollutants, such as oil and grease, would be added\r\nwhen the water flowed through the  system of pipes.  If  that\r\n\n                             -62-\r\r\n\nwould reach  the same  conclusion regardless of  how polluted\r\n\nthe Pemigewasset  was or how pristine  Loon Pond was.   We do\r\n\nnot believe Congress intended such an irrational result.\r\n\n          The district court's analysis also ignores the fact\r\n\nthat water  would pass  through Loon Corp.'s  privately owned\r\n\npipes on  its way from the  East Branch to Loon  Pond.  Thus,\r\n\nnature  would not regulate --  and neither the Forest Service\r\n\nnor the court could know in advance -- whether any pollutants\r\n\nwould be added to the  water as it passes through the  pipes.\r\n\nThe district court concluded that the  East Branch water does\r\n\nnot \"lose[] its  status as  navigable waters\" even  if it  is\r\n\n\"commercially exploited,\" Memorandum and Order at 18, as long\r\n\nas  Loon  Corp.  does  not  \"plan[]  to  add  any  additional\r\n\npollutants  to  the East  Branch  water  that it  intends  to\r\n\ndischarge into  Loon Pond.\"  Id.  at 10.  The  court does not\r                                            \r\n\nindicate  whether anyone assures  compliance with  the \"plan\"\r\n\nthat   no  pollutants   be   added  during   the   commercial\r\n\nexploitation, or if so  who makes that determination and  how\r\n\nit is  made, at  a  time when  the project  is  still just  a\r\n\nproposal and not yet  a fait accompli.  Cf.  Massachusetts v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nWatt, 716 F.2d at  952.  The district court's  analysis would\r                \r\n\napply equally if the water passed through a paper mill on its\r\n\nway to Loon Pond,  instead of through snowmaking pipes.   And\r\n\nthe analysis is equally unpersuasive in either  circumstance.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nwere true, that alone would require an NPDES permit.\r\n\n                             -63-\r\r\n\nEither  way, the  water leaves  the domain  of nature  and is\r\n\nsubject  to  private  control  rather  than   purely  natural\r\n\nprocesses.  As such, it has  lost its status as waters of the\r\n\nUnited States.  \r\n\n          Other  courts have  held  that an  NPDES permit  is\r\n\nrequired  before pollutants  may  be moved  from one  body of\r\n\nwater of the United States to another.

The\r\n\nForest Service  recognizes that \"[i]t is  possible that water\r\n\ntransferred between unrelated water bodies of different water\r\n\nquality would properly  be regarded as  losing its status  as\r\n\n'water [sic] of the United  States,'\" requiring a Section 402\r\n\npermit.  Forest  Service Brief at 47.  We  agree.  The Forest\r\n\nService qualifies this insight, however.  It argues that Loon\r\n\n                             -64-\r\r\n\nCorp.  \"moves  water between  hydrologically  connected water\r\n\nbodies  containing water of  like quality\"  which, therefore,\r\n\ndoes not \"introduce pollutants  'from the outside world' into\r\n\nthe receiving waters.\"  Id.  Accordingly, the Forest  Service\r                                       \r\n\nargues  no permit is required.   We disagree  with the Forest\r\n\nService's qualification.\r\n\n          First, there  is nothing in the  statute evincing a\r\n\nCongressional intent to distinguish between \"unrelated\" water\r\n\nbodies  and  related   or  \"hydrologically  connected\"  water\r\n\nbodies.    The  CWA simply  addresses  \"any  addition of  any\r\n\npollutant to  navigable waters  from any point  source.\"   33\r\n\nU.S.C.   1362(12)(A).  Nor  is the purpose of the  CWA served\r\n\nby means of  such a  distinction.  If  anything, the  purpose\r\n\nwould be  better served by  a distinction between  de minimis\r                                                                         \r\n\ntransfers  of   water  and  transfers  which   add  some  not\r\n\ninsignificant  amount of pollutants  to the  transferee water\r\n\nbody.  But no such distinction appears in the statute, and to\r\n\nimply  one would  thrust some  agencies with no  expertise on\r\n\nenvironmental issues  into the  role of deciding  whether the\r\n\nCWA's environmental protections should even be considered.31\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n31.  As discussed in Part  VII(C), infra, in another context,\r                                                    \r\nthe Forest Service argues that it is the EPA, not the  Forest\r\nService, that has the expertise and the congressional mandate\r\nto  determine whether  a proposed  project meets  state water\r\nquality standards.   We agree.   The availability  of EPA  to\r\nperform  this  task is  another  reason why  an  NPDES permit\r\nshould  be obtained  before the  Forest Service  approves the\r\nLoon  Corp. expansion  plan.   See  note 32  and accompanying\r                                              \r\ntext, infra.\r                       \r\n\n                             -65-\r\r\n\n          More    compellingly,    the    Forest    Service's\r\n\n\"hydrological connectedness\" proposal  ignores a  fundamental\r\n\nfact about  water:  the direction  of flow.  It  is true that\r\n\nLoon Pond and the  East Branch of the Pemigewasset  River are\r\n\n\"hydrologically connected\"  in the sense that  water from the\r\n\nPond flows down and  eventually empties into the River.   But\r                           \r\n\nwater from  the East  Branch certainly  does not flow  uphill\r                                                                         \r\n\ninto  Loon Pond, carrying  with it  the pollutants  that have\r\n\nundisputedly accumulated  in the East Branch  water from some\r\n\nof the other sources  of water entering the East  Branch from\r\n\nupstream.    Under  such  circumstances,   defendants  cannot\r\n\ncredibly argue  that these water  bodies are so  related that\r\n\nthe transfer  of water from the  East Branch to  Loon Pond is\r                                                           \r\n\nnot an  \"addition\" of water  from one  of the \"waters  of the\r\n\nUnited States\"  to another.   We therefore reject  the Forest\r\n\nService's \"hydrological connectedness\" proposal.\r\n\n          Likewise,  we reject its  assertion, unsupported by\r\n\nthe  record, that  in some  general sense  the two  bodies of\r\n\nwater are  \"of like  quality.\"   First, this  is the kind  of\r\n\nsubstantive  question  to  which  the  EPA  would  apply  its\r\n\ntechnical  expertise in  deciding whether  to issue  an NPDES\r\n\npermit  and what  conditions to  attach to  such a  permit in\r\n\norder  to protect  water  quality.   It  is not  the kind  of\r\n\nthreshold  question that  the  Forest Service  or this  court\r\n\n                             -66-\r\r\n\nshould address in deciding whether to  subject the Loon Corp.\r\n\nexpansion proposal to the NPDES permitting process.  \r\n\n          Second,  the   Forest  Service  does   not  contest\r\n\nplaintiffs' assertion that there are at least some pollutants\r\n\nin the East  Branch that do not exist naturally in Loon Pond.\r\n\nThe  Final EIS  itself noted  that the  East Branch  has been\r\n\ndesignated  by the  New Hampshire  legislature as  a  Class B\r\n\nWaterway,  a  lower  quality  designation than  the  Class  A\r\n\nquality rating  of Loon Pond.  JA, vol. II,  FEIS at 91.  The\r\n\ndifference in classifications -- the East Branch as a Class B\r\n\nwaterway,  Loon Pond as Class  A -- evinces  a higher quality\r\n\nlevel for the Pond than for the River, and  belies the Forest\r\n\nService's assertion that the two bodies of water are \"of like\r\n\nquality.\"\r\n\n          Even  if the  East  Branch were  rated in  the same\r\n\ngeneral class as Loon Pond (Class A), that would not mean the\r\n\ntwo bodies of water  were identical in quality, such  that an\r\n\nNPDES permit  would be unnecessary.  The East Branch contains\r\n\ndifferent  organisms than  Loon  Pond,  inter  alia,  Giardia\r                                                               \r\n\nlambia.    Loon Pond  is also  colder  overall than  the East\r\n\nBranch, and its  lower depths are significantly  colder.  The\r\n\ntwo  bodies  of   water  also  have  different   chemistries,\r\n\nespecially the  low level of  phosphorus in Loon  Pond, which\r\n\naffects  its  biological composition.    Nor  has the  Forest\r\n\nService argued  that all such pollutants  would be eliminated\r                                    \r\n\n                             -67-\r\r\n\nbefore any East  Branch water  would be pumped  up to  refill\r\n\nLoon  Pond after depletion  by Loon Corp.'s  snowmaking.  The\r\n\nService  cannot say,  therefore, that  the discharge  of East\r\n\nBranch  water  into  Loon  Pond  would  not  result  in  \"any\r\n\npollutants\"  being   added  to  the   Pond.    33   U.S.C.   \r\n\n1362(12)(A).\r\n\n          Aside  from the  difficulty of  defining a  general\r\n\nconcept  such  as  \"of  like quality,\"  it  would  defeat the\r\n\npurpose  of  the  CWA's   permit  process  to  interpret  the\r\n\nstatutory language \"discharge of  any pollutant,\" 33 U.S.C.  \r                                                 \r\n\n1311(a),  to be  implicitly qualified  by the  phrase \"except\r\n\nwhen  the transferee body of water  is of like quality.\"  The\r\n\nForest  Service  is simply  wrong  to  analogize the  present\r\n\nsituation to  a dam that  merely accumulates the  same water,\r                                                                  \r\n\nsee National  Wildlife Fed'n v.

We  cannot allow  such a  watering down  of Congress'\r\n\nclear statutory protections.\r\n\n          We hold  that the Pemigewasset River  and Loon Pond\r\n\nare  two distinct \"waters of the United States,\" and that the\r\n\nproposed transfer of  water from one to the other constitutes\r\n\n                             -68-\r\r\n\nan \"addition.\"  Where,  as is undisputed here,  the discharge\r\n\nis through  a  point source  and  the intake  water  contains\r\n\npollutants,  an  NPDES  permit   is  required.    The  Forest\r\n\nService's determination  to the  contrary  was arbitrary  and\r\n\ncapricious and not  in accordance with law.   See 5  U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n706(2)(A).\r\n\n          C.   Violation of State Water Quality Standards\r                      C.   Violation of State Water Quality Standards\r                                                                     \r\n\n          Plaintiff  Dubois claims  that state  water quality\r\n\nstandards are violated because  of the quality of water  that\r\n\nwould enter Loon Pond.  This water would come from one of two\r\n\nsources:  some of  it would come from snowmelt  that replaces\r\n\nthe water that Loon Corp. has pumped out of Loon Pond to make\r\n\nsnow; and  some would be water that Loon Corp. has taken from\r\n\nthe East Branch for snowmaking  and then discharged into Loon\r\n\nPond.    Dubois   contends  that   Loon  Corp.'s   snowmaking\r\n\noperations pose an impermissible  threat to Loon Pond because\r\n\ninfluxes  of  East  Branch  water  and  snowmelt --  the  two\r\n\nprincipal  sources of water to refill the Pond -- could alter\r\n\nthe Pond's naturally occurring  pH, bacteria, oil and grease,\r\n\nand turbidity levels.\r\n\n          On the merits of the water quality standards issue,\r\n\nDubois  argues that  the CWA requires  states to  adopt water\r\n\nquality  standards which protect  against degradation  of the\r\n\nphysical, chemical,  or biological attributes  of the state's\r\n\nwaters.   33 U.S.C.     1251(a),  1313(d)(4)(B); 40 C.F.R.   \r\n\n                             -69-\r\r\n\n131.12.   The greatest protection is  afforded to Outstanding\r\n\nResource  Waters,  including  Loon   Pond,  as  to  which  no\r\n\ndegradation  is permitted.   40  C.F.R.    131.12(a)(3); N.H.\r\n\nCode Admin. R. Env-Ws  437.06.  Dubois contends that  the ski\r\n\nresort's proposal to draw down  a significant amount of water\r\n\nchanges the  physical structure of Loon  Pond; that refilling\r\n\nit with East Branch  water containing phosphorus (and through\r\n\npipes that  might  contain oil  and  grease) or  with  acidic\r\n\nrunoff would change the Pond's chemical composition; and that\r\n\nthe  transfer  of  organisms   such  as  Giardia  lambia  and\r\n\nchemicals  such as phosphorus  into the Pond  would alter its\r\n\nbiological  attributes.   Because we  hold infra  that Dubois\r                                                            \r\n\ncannot,  in  a  challenge   to  the  Forest  Service's  FEIS,\r\n\ncollaterally  attack the state's  certification of compliance\r\n\nwith state  water quality standards,  we need  not reach  the\r\n\nmerits of the state water quality standards issue.\r\n\n          Defendants  argued  in  the  district   court  that\r\n\nDubois'  CWA claim  was not  properly presented,  that Dubois\r\n\nshould  have raised  his  objections  by  exhausting  various\r\n\nadministrative remedies and filing a timely appeal in the New\r\n\nHampshire Supreme Court.  They argued that the federal agency\r\n\n(Forest Service) and the federal court lack the authority  to\r\n\nreview   independently   and   determine   the   validity  of\r\n\nrequirements  imposed under state law  or in a  state's   401\r\n\ncertification, see 33 U.S.C.   1371(c)(2)(A) (1994), and that\r                              \r\n\n                             -70-\r\r\n\nsuch  authority  is expressly  delegated  to  the states,  33\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341(a) (1994).  \r\n\n          The district court agreed.  It held that, \"[i]f the\r\n\nplaintiffs in this case were dissatisfied with the state's   \r\n\n1341   certification,   they   could   have   challenged  the\r\n\ncertification by exhausting state administrative remedies and\r\n\nfiling  a  timely  challenge  in the  New  Hampshire  Supreme\r\n\nCourt.\"  Memorandum and Order at 21-23.  That is true insofar\r\n\nas it goes.  The question, however, is  whether a state court\r\n\naction is the plaintiffs'  only recourse, or whether,  in the\r                                           \r\n\nalternative, they had  a right to challenge in  federal court\r\n\nthe federal agency's issuance of a federal permit in reliance\r\n\non  the  state  certification,  where  the  basis  for  their\r\n\nchallenge  is that  the  project fails  to  meet the  minimum\r\n\nstandards of the federal Clean Water Act.\r\n\n          Defendants may be correct  that the cases they rely\r\n\nupon hold that the state courts are the only fora in which to\r\n\nchallenge  whatever requirements  the state adds,  beyond the\r                                                                     \r\n\nminimum  required by the CWA.   Those cases  do not, however,\r\n\ndeprive  the federal courts  of jurisdiction to  hear a claim\r\n\nthat defendants have violated the  floor level of clean water\r                                                    \r\n\nrequirements imposed by the CWA, i.e., the requirements which\r                                                 \r\n\nthe state regulations share with the federal CWA.\r                                       \r\n\n                             -71-\r\r\n\n          The cases relied upon by the  defendants and by the\r\n\ndistrict  court32  dealt  with  challenges  to   the  state's\r\n\nimposition of  more stringent  controls on a  project's water\r                                         \r\n\npollution effluent.  Such cases relied on the language of the\r\n\nCWA itself,  as well  as basic  principles of  federalism, to\r\n\nsupport their  holdings that the CWA  \"empower[s]\" the states\r\n\n\"to set more stringent water quality standards than those set\r\n\nby the Act and its  attendant requirements\" to prevent  water\r\n\npollution.

Dubois\r\n\nthen tries  to bootstrap  the fact  that  the Forest  Service\r\n\nfailed  to apply for an NPDES permit into a circumstance that\r\n\nrenders Section  511(c)(2)(A) inapplicable.  Dubois  Brief at\r\n\n27-28.  His argument is without merit.  \r\n\n          It is true that the Forest Service was obligated to\r\n\nobtain an NPDES permit before permitting Loon Corp. to expand\r\n\nits  ski resort.    See Part  VII(B),  supra.   However,  the\r                                                        \r\n\nviolation of  that statutory  obligation is a  separate issue\r\n\n                             -73-\r\r\n\nfrom the state water  quality standards issue.   For purposes\r\n\nof the  latter, the  fact  is that  there  do not  exist  any\r\n\neffluent limitations under CWA Sections 301(b) or 302 nor any\r\n\nstandards of  performance under CWA Sections 306  or 307 that\r\n\napply to  the discharge of  East Branch water  and pollutants\r\n\ninto Loon Pond.  Therefore, whether or not the Forest Service\r\n\nactually   obtained  the   required  NPDES   permit,  Section\r\n\n511(c)(2)(A) applies, and  Dubois' challenge to the  adequacy\r\n\nof the state's Section  401 certification may not proceed  in\r\n\nthis court.  \r\n\n          As the federal defendants argued in their brief and\r\n\nas we held in Roosevelt Campobello, 684 F.2d at 1056, Dubois'\r                                              \r\n\nchallenge  must be  addressed as  part of  EPA's \"independent\r\n\nobligation to ensure that EPA-issued NPDES permits meet state\r\n\nwater quality standards.\"  Forest Service Brief at 29; see 33\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.     1311(b)(1)(C)  (1994).33   If,  upon  remand,  EPA\r\n\ndetermines  that a  permit  is appropriate,  with or  without\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n33.  The availability of  EPA to perform this task is another\r\nreason supporting our holding in  Part VII(B), supra, that an\r                                                                \r\nNPDES permit is required.   See supra  note 30.  The  federal\r                                                 \r\nCWA  requires that  any state  certification ensure  that the\r\nminimal  federal  standards  have   been  adhered  to.    The\r\ngovernment  is correct  that  the  Forest  Service  possesses\r\nneither  the  congressional  mandate  nor  the  expertise  to\r\nsecond-guess  state water  quality certifications.

Facts\r                              \r\n\n          The White  Mountain National Forest  (\"WMNF\") is  a\r\n\npublic resource  managed by the United  States Forest Service\r\n\nfor  a wide  range  of competing  public  uses and  purposes,\r\n\nincluding \"outdoor recreation, range,  timber, watershed, . .\r\n\n.  wildlife and fish purposes,\"  16 U.S.C.    528 (1994), and\r\n\nskiing,  16 U.S.C.   497(b) (1994).  Pursuant to the National\r\n\nForest Management Act of 1976, the Forest Service makes long-\r\n\nterm  plans to  coordinate  these competing  uses, 16  U.S.C.\r\n\n  1604(e)(1)   (1994),  and  issues   \"special  use\"  permits\r\n\nauthorizing private recreational  services on national forest\r\n\nland, 36  C.F.R.    251.50-.65 (1995).   The Forest Service's\r\n\nexercise of  its permitting authority is  legally constrained\r\n\nby environmental  considerations emanating, inter  alia, from\r                                                                   \r\n\nNEPA, the CWA, and Executive Order 11,990.\r\n\n          Loon Pond is located in the WMNF at an elevation of\r\n\n2,400 feet.  It has a  surface area of 19 acres, with shallow\r\n\nareas around the perimeter  and a central bowl 65  feet deep.\r\n\nIt is unusual for  its relatively pristine nature.   There is\r\n\nvirtually no human activity within  the land it drains except\r\n\nskiing  at the privately owned  Loon Mountain Ski  Area.  New\r\n\nHampshire  Department  of  Environmental  Services  (\"NHDES\")\r\n\nregulations  classify  Loon  Pond  as a  Class  A  waterbody,\r\n\nprotected  by  demanding  water  quality  standards  under  a\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nvariety of criteria, see  N.H. Code Admin. R.  Env-Ws 432.03,\r                                    \r\n\nand  as  an  Outstanding  Resource  Water (\"ORW\"),  protected\r\n\nagainst any  measurable long-term degradation  by the State's\r\n\nanti-degradation   rules,  see   id.  437.06;  40   C.F.R.   \r                                                \r\n\n131.12(a)(3) (1995).   It ranks in the  upper 95th percentile\r\n\nof all lakes and ponds in northern New England for low levels\r\n\nof  phosphorus, which  results  in limited  plant growth  and\r\n\ntherefore  high  water clarity  and  higher  total biological\r\n\nproduction.  The pond supports a rich variety  of life in its\r\n\necosystem.    Loon Pond  also constitutes  a major  source of\r\n\ndrinking water for the  town of Lincoln 1,600 feet  below it.\r\n\nA dam  across the outlet  of the Pond  regulates the  flow of\r\n\nwater from the Pond to Lincoln's municipal reservoir.\r\n\n          Loon Corp., defendant-intervenor  herein, owns  the\r\n\nLoon Mountain  Ski Area, which  has operated since  the 1960s\r\n\nnot far from  Loon Pond.  Prior  to the permit  revision that\r\n\ngave rise to this  litigation, Loon Corp. held a  special use\r\n\npermit  to operate on  785 acres of  WMNF land.   That permit\r\n\nallowed Loon Corp. to  draw water (\"drawdown\") for snowmaking\r\n\nfrom Loon  Pond,  as well  as  from the  East Branch  of  the\r\n\nPemigewasset  River (\"East  Branch\")  and  from nearby  Boyle\r\n\nBrook.  In order to use water from Loon Pond, Loon Corp. also\r\n\nneeded authorization from  the Town of Lincoln  and the State\r\n\nof  New  Hampshire.    Beginning  in  1974,  Loon  Corp.  was\r\n\nauthorized to pump snowmaking water from Loon Pond down to 18\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ninches below full level.2  A 1988 amendment to this agreement\r\n\npermitted drawdown below the  18-inch level on a case-by-case\r\n\nbasis.   Combined uses by  Lincoln and Loon  Corp. during the\r\n\nperiod governed by these agreements typically caused four- to\r\n\nsix-foot fluctuations in the level of Loon Pond.\r\n\n          In  addition to being used as a source of water for\r\n\nsnowmaking, Loon Pond has been the repository for disposal of\r\n\nwater  after it  is  pumped through  the snowmaking  system.3\r\n\nThis includes water that  originally came from Loon Pond,  as\r\n\nwell  as water that originated in the East Branch or in Boyle\r\n\nBrook.   Approximately 250,000  gallons of East  Branch water\r\n\nhave  been  transferred into  Loon  Pond  each year  in  this\r\n\nmanner.    Obviously  the  water discharged  into  Loon  Pond\r\n\ncontains at  least the same  pollutants that were  present in\r\n\nthe  intake water.    Evidence in  the record  indicates that\r\n\nintake water  taken from  the East Branch  contains bacteria,\r\n\nother aquatic  organisms such as  Giardia lambia, phosphorus,\r\n\nturbidity and heat.   Evidence was also introduced in  court,\r\n\nbut not available prior to the  issuance of the Environmental\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The level of Loon Pond drops when Pond water  is used for\r\nsnowmaking, because  the Pond  does not receive  much natural\r\nwater through precipitation during the winter.\r\n\n3.  In  order for  Loon  Corp. to  make  snow, it  must  pump\r\nsignificantly more water through  the system than is actually\r\nmade into snow.   Passing this extra water through  the pipes\r\nkeeps them from freezing.  It also provides the pressure that\r\nforces the artificial snow out through snowmaking jets.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nImpact Statement (\"EIS\"), that oil and grease were present in\r\n\nthe discharge water, although their source was disputed.  \r\n\n          In 1986,  Loon Corp. applied to  the Forest Service\r\n\nfor an amendment to its special use permit to allow expansion\r\n\nof  its facilities  within the  WMNF.   Pursuant to  NEPA, 42\r\n\nU.S.C.     4332, the  Service developed  a  draft EIS,  and a\r\n\nsupplement  to the  draft.   Responding to  criticism  of the\r\n\nadequacy  of those  documents,  the Forest  Service issued  a\r\n\nrevised draft  EIS (\"RDEIS\"), which was  published for public\r\n\ncomment.  The RDEIS  set forth five alternatives to  meet the\r\n\nperceived demand for additional alpine skiing.  All five were\r\n\nlocated at the Loon Mountain site.4  \r\n\n          Many   individuals   and  groups,   including  both\r\n\nplaintiffs, filed comments pointing out various environmental\r\n\nproblems with each  alternative that  involved expanding  the\r\n\nski area.   One lengthy comment  from the U.S.  Environmental\r\n\nProtection Agency (\"EPA\") expressed  its concern that the use\r\n\nof  Loon Pond  for snowmaking  purposes would \"use  Loon Pond\r\n\nlike a cistern\" instead of treating it \"with care\" because it\r\n\nis \"acknowledged to be one of the rare high altitude ponds of\r\n\nits size  in the  White Mountains.\"   Joint  Appendix (\"JA\"),\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The Forest  Service's ten-year plan for  the WMNF, issued\r\nin 1986, included  plans for  accommodating increased  demand\r\nfor downhill skiing.   It determined that it would  meet this\r\ndemand through  expansion of  existing ski areas  rather than\r\nthrough the creation  of new ones.   It did  not discuss  the\r\npossibility of  meeting the demand  through alternative sites\r\noutside the national forest.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nvol. II, Response to Public Comment on RDEIS at  A-78.  Other\r\n\ncommenters  suggested that  Loon Corp.  be required  to build\r\n\nartificial  water storage  ponds, in  order to  eliminate the\r\n\nproblem  of depleting  Loon Pond  when withdrawing  water for\r\n\nsnowmaking as  well as  the problem  of adding  pollutants to\r\n\nLoon Pond when discharging water into the Pond after use.\r\n\n          During the EIS process, Ron Buso, a hydrologist for\r\n\nthe  WMNF,  expressed  concern  to   another  Forest  Service\r\n\nhydrologist that the proposed drawdown of Loon Pond by twenty\r\n\nfeet  was likely  to have a  severe impact  on the  Pond.  He\r\n\nexplained that natural snowmelt in New Hampshire is extremely\r\n\nacidic  and  that, as  a result  of  the planned  drawdown, a\r\n\nsubstantial amount  of acidic  snowmelt would remain  in Loon\r\n\nPond, increasing the  Pond's acidity  by a factor  of two  to\r\n\nthree times  what it would  be without the  planned drawdown.\r\n\nWithout  the drawdown, Loon Pond  would be relatively full in\r\n\nthe spring, and much of the snowmelt  from surrounding higher\r\n\nelevations  would glide over the surface of the Pond and down\r\n\nthe  mountain without  significantly mixing  with  other Loon\r\n\nPond water.   According to  Buso and a  number of  scientists\r\n\nwhose affidavits  were submitted  to the district  court, the\r\n\nincrease in the  Pond's acidity due  to the planned  drawdown\r\n\nwould change the chemistry of the Pond, cause toxic metals to\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nbe released  from the sediment, and  kill naturally occurring\r\n\norganisms.\r\n\n          Without addressing  the issues raised  in the  Buso\r\n\nmemorandum or in  the comments suggesting  artificial storage\r\n\nponds, the Forest Service prepared a Final EIS (\"FEIS\").  The\r\n\nFEIS added  a sixth alternative,  also on  the Loon  Mountain\r\n\nsite.   The new  alternative provided  for expansion of  Loon\r\n\nCorp.'s  permit area by 581 acres and for the construction of\r\n\none  new lift and approximately  70 acres of  new ski trails,\r\n\nchanges designed  to accommodate 3,200  additional skiers per\r\n\nday (from  the current 5,800 per  day).   The  Forest Service\r\n\ndeemed Alternative 6 as the preferred alternative.  Under it,\r\n\nLoon  Corp. would more than  double the amount  of water used\r\n\nfor  snowmaking, from  67  million gallons  per  year to  138\r\n\nmillion gallons.   Seventeen million gallons  of the increase\r\n\nwould be drawn from  the East Branch, and 54  million gallons\r\n\nfrom  Loon Pond.  In  addition, Loon Corp.  was authorized to\r\n\ndraw the Pond down  for snowmaking by fifteen feet,  compared\r\n\nto the current eighteen  inches.  The Forest  Service assumed\r\n\nthat the Town of Lincoln would need up  to an additional five\r\n\nfeet  of Pond water, making  a total of  twenty feet that the\r\n\nPond was  expected to be  drawn down  each year.   This would\r\n\nconstitute approximately 63%  of the Pond's water.   In March\r\n\n1993, the Forest Service published a Record of Decision (ROD)\r\n\nadopting Alternative 6.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\n          As  a  mitigation  measure  to  blunt  the  adverse\r\n\nenvironmental  impact  on  Loon  Pond,  the   Forest  Service\r\n\nrequired Loon Corp.  to pump  water from the  East Branch  to\r\n\nLoon Pond  in December and May  of each year if  the Pond was\r\n\nnot otherwise full at those times.   In its FEIS, the  Forest\r\n\nService  recognized  that the  East  Branch  is a  relatively\r\n\nunprotected  Class B  waterway under  New Hampshire  law, and\r\n\nthat  transfer of East Branch water to Loon Pond, a protected\r\n\nClass A waterbody and  Outstanding Resource Water under state\r\n\nand federal  law, would  introduce pollutants into  the Pond.\r\n\nAccordingly, it  specified that this transfer  of East Branch\r\n\nwater  could  not occur  if  it  exceeded certain  levels  of\r\n\nturbidity, bacteria, or oil and grease.  Neither the FEIS nor\r\n\nthe  ROD  set  any limits,  however,  on  the  level of  non-\r\n\nbacterial organisms  such as Giardia lambia  or on pollutants\r\n\nsuch as  phosphorus that  may be  present in the  transferred\r\n\nwater.  Nor  did the  FEIS indicate an  alternative means  of\r\n\nrefilling Loon Pond -- with clean water -- if conditions were\r\n\nsuch  that the transfer of East Branch water would exceed the\r\n\nspecified  levels.5   It did,  however,  provide a  series of\r\n\nrestrictions and monitoring requirements for water levels and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  As noted  supra, absent  some other method  of refilling,\r                               \r\nthe Pond would be refilled by the melting of acidic snow.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nwater  quality,  including daily  testing of  the transferred\r\n\nwater for turbidity, bacteria, and oil and grease.6\r\n\n          Dubois and RESTORE appealed the ROD to the Regional\r\n\nForester and, thereafter, to the Chief of the Forest Service.\r\n\nThese appeals were  denied.   On March 16,  1994, the  Forest\r\n\nService  issued   a  special   use  permit  to   Loon  Corp.,\r\n\nimplementing the decision described in the ROD.\r\n\n          B.

He  made  three  arguments.8\r\n\nFirst, he argued that the Forest Service actions violated the\r\n\nCWA  because they  would lead  to violations  of state  water\r\n\nquality  standards which,  he  asserted, have  the effect  of\r\n\nfederal law because  they were approved  by the federal  EPA.\r\n\nSecond, he argued that the Forest Service  violated both NEPA\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  In  response  to  an  earlier  draft  EIS,  the  EPA  had\r\nexpressed the  following concern:    \"While monitoring  plans\r\nhave  merit, they should not be considered a substitute for a\r\nthorough evaluation  of a  project and its  potential impacts\r\nprior  to action  approval.\"   JA, vol.

The  case  was later  transferred  to  the United  States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of New Hampshire.\r\n\n8.  Plaintiffs  made  other  arguments  below,  but  have not\r\npursued them on appeal.\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nand   Executive   Order  11,990   by   failing   to  consider\r\n\nalternatives to the use  of Loon Pond and failing  to develop\r\n\nadequate mitigation  measures.   Finally, he argued  that the\r\n\nForest Service violated the CWA, 33 U.S.C.   1311, by failing\r\n\nto obtain a National  Pollutant Discharge Elimination  System\r\n\n(\"NPDES\")  permit  before  approving Loon  Corp.'s  expansion\r\n\nplans, which  entailed removing  water from the  East Branch,\r\n\nusing it to pressurize and prevent freezing in its snowmaking\r\n\nequipment,  and then  discharging  the used  water into  Loon\r\n\nPond.  According to  Dubois, an NPDES permit was  required in\r\n\norder  for Loon Corp. to discharge pollutants into Loon Pond,\r\n\nincluding   the  discharge   from  Loon   Corp.'s  snowmaking\r\n\nequipment.     Plaintiff RESTORE,  a membership organization,\r\n\nintervened on behalf of its members to challenge the project.\r\n\nRESTORE first  reiterated Dubois' claim that  an NPDES permit\r\n\nwas  required.  In addition,  RESTORE claimed that the Forest\r\n\nService violated  NEPA by  failing to prepare  a Supplemental\r\n\nEIS  after  it  developed  Alternative  6  as  the  preferred\r\n\nalternative.  According to RESTORE, this new alternative, not\r\n\nspecifically mentioned in the  previously published draft EIS\r\n\nor  RDEIS,  contained  substantial changes  to  the  proposed\r\n\naction  that  are relevant  to environmental  concerns, which\r\n\nrequired   a  supplemental  EIS   under  NEPA   and  relevant\r\n\nimplementing regulations.   Finally, RESTORE  claimed that  a\r\n\nsupplemental  EIS was  required because the  Forest Service's\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nFinal  EIS  failed  to  \"rigorously explore  and  objectively\r\n\nevaluate all  reasonable  alternatives\" that  are capable  of\r\n\nmeeting  the stated goals of  the project, as  required by 40\r\n\nC.F.R.   1502.14 (1995).  According to RESTORE, the  asserted\r\n\ngoal of meeting skier demand could have been met by expanding\r\n\nski  areas other than Loon, in  particular, ski areas located\r\n\noutside the White Mountain National Forest.\r\n\n          The parties cross-moved for summary judgment.  Loon\r\n\nCorp.  intervened, and  moved to  dismiss on the  ground that\r\n\nboth plaintiffs  lacked standing.  The  district court denied\r\n\nLoon Corp.'s motion to  dismiss, granted summary judgment for\r\n\nthe Forest  Service, and denied the plaintiffs' cross-motions\r\n\nfor summary judgment.\r\n\n                   II.

In that case,\r                  \r\n\nwe held that the court need not determine the standing of all\r\n\nplaintiffs if at least one plaintiff has standing to maintain\r\n\neach  claim.

We agree\r\n\nthat RESTORE would have  standing to raise, on behalf  of its\r\n\nmembers, all the issues  in dispute in this litigation.   But\r\n\nthe  district  court  erred   in  concluding  that  it  could\r\n\ntherefore  reach  the  merits  of  all  claims,  because  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's premise  was incorrect:   RESTORE  did not,\r\n\neven at the  district court level, raise  the issues relating\r\n\nto  Executive  Order  11,990  and  the  state  water  quality\r\n\nstandards, which only Dubois is pursuing here.

Our analysis is not altered by the fact that three of\r\nthe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The\r\nstanding issue was raised only in Loon Corp.'s motion to\r\ndismiss.  Where, as here, the defendants have not\r\ncontradicted the factual allegations concerning standing that\r\nwe deem adequate at the motion to dismiss stage, we will not\r\nsubject those allegations to a summary judgment level of\r\nscrutiny in the absence of a motion for summary judgment on\r\nthe issue.

The adverse environmental impacts of  using Loon\r\n\nPond  were before  the agency,  and more  than one  commenter\r\n\nproposed building artificial water storage  ponds, a proposal\r\n\nthat would, on its face, avoid some of those adverse impacts.\r\n\nOne such commenter, Paul Beaudin of the Lincoln  Committee of\r\n\nConcerned  Citizens  (LCCC), enclosed  clippings  pointing up\r\n\n                             -35-\r\r\n\n\"the  wisdom  of  [Loon Corp.'s]  need  to  enact the  LCCC's\r                                                  \r\n\nproposal for water  containment pond[s] high up on  the Boyle\r\n\nBrook.\"  JA, vol. II, Response  to Public Comment on RDEIS at\r\n\nA-12.   The  LCCC proposal itself,  made two  months earlier,\r\n\nreferred  to  a letter  from  the  National Ecology  Research\r\n\nCenter   recommending   consideration   of    water   storage\r\n\nalternatives  other  than  Loon  Pond,  and  enclosed  a  map\r\n\nindicating  where  up to  three  containment  ponds could  be\r\n\ninstalled.   LCCC listed some nine  advantages, including the\r\n\ncost-saving factor of  servicing two-thirds to  three-fourths\r\n\nof Loon Corp.'s snowmaking system by gravity feed.16\r\n\n          Instead of \"rigorously explor[ing]\" the alternative\r\n\nof using artificial water storage units instead of Loon Pond,\r\n\nthe  Forest Service's  Final  EIS did  not  respond to  these\r\n\ncomments at all.   The agency did not in  any way explain its\r\n\nreasoning  or  provide a  factual  basis for  its  refusal to\r\n\nconsider,  in general,  the  possibility of  alternatives  to\r\n\nusing  Loon  Pond   for  snowmaking,  or   LCCC's  reasonably\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  In addition to the Beaudin/LCCC proposal, plaintiff\r\nDubois' comments also suggested that Loon Corp. build\r\nartificial water storage units, in his case underground. \r\nThis suggestion, requiring costly subterranean construction,\r\nmay be more facially vulnerable than Beaudin/LCCC's; it may\r\nor may not alone have required an explicit response, however\r\nbrief.

JA, vol. I, at 457, 465.  This is 73%\r\n\nmore  than the  71  million gallons  of  water that  the  ROD\r\n\nestimates  would  be  withdrawn  from  Loon  Pond  under  the\r\n\napproved  Loon  Mountain  expansion  project.    Beaudin/LCCC\r\n\nproposed constructing three similar  ponds in the Boyle Brook\r\n\narea high up Loon Mountain.  In addition, the record contains\r\n\nevidence  that Loon Corp. owns  365 acres of  private land at\r\n\nthe base of the  ski area, where similar storage  ponds could\r\n\nbe constructed,  and that  such ponds  could  be filled  with\r\n\nwater from the East Branch, which is typically high enough in\r\n\nthe spring to contribute to flooding in downstream areas.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.

However, the Forest Service does not suggest that\r\nBeaudin's comment letter -- responding to the Forest\r\nService's RDEIS -- did not fairly refer to the prior LCCC\r\nproposal, or that this proposal was unknown to the Service.\r\n\n                             -37-\r\r\n\n          Our  conclusion is buttressed by NEPA's requirement\r\n\nthat an agency consider and an EIS discuss \"steps that can be\r\n\ntaken to mitigate the adverse environmental consequences\"  of\r\n\na proposed project.   See Robertson,  490 U.S. at 351.   Even\r                                               \r\n\nthough  there  is no  requirement  that  the agency  reach  a\r\n\nparticular substantive  result, such as  actually formulating\r\n\nand  adopting a  complete  mitigation plan,  the agency  must\r\n\ndiscuss \"the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided,\"\r\n\ni.e., by mitigation measures, \"in sufficient detail to ensure\r                \r\n\nthat  environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated.\"\r\n\nId. at 352.  This duty  -- coupled with the comments alerting\r               \r\n\nthe agency  to the  environmental consequences of  using Loon\r\n\nPond  for  snowmaking  and suggesting  the  containment  pond\r\n\nsolution -- required the Forest Service to seriously consider\r\n\nthis alternative and to explain its reasoning if  it rejected\r\n\nthe proposal.\r\n\n          Nor can  the Forest Service claim  that its failure\r\n\nto consider  an alternative to using Loon Pond for snowmaking\r\n\nwas a de minimis  or \"fly speck\" issue.  The record indicates\r                            \r\n\nserious adverse consequences to Loon Pond if it is used \"as a\r\n\ncistern,\"  to use  EPA's  words, and  at  least a  reasonable\r\n\nprobability that  the use  of artificial storage  ponds could\r\n\navoid  those  consequences.

In\r\n\nresponse, defendants argue that plaintiffs' interpretation of\r\n\nthe  previously discussed alternatives  is incorrect, because\r\n\nAlternative  6  is  merely  a   scaled-down  modification  of\r\n\nAlternative  2 which, as proposed in two phases in the RDEIS,\r\n\nwould  have been  far larger  and far  more intrusive  on the\r\n\nenvironment than the new preferred Alternative 6.

In the  instant case, however,\r                 \r\n\nnothing  in  the FEIS  indicates  that  any such  technically\r\n\ncomplex scientific  analysis would  be required in  order for\r\n\nthis  court  to  determine  that  Alternative  6  involves  a\r\n\n\"substantial  change\"  from  the   prior  proposals  at  Loon\r\n\nMountain.\r\n\n          Alternative 6, adopted by the Forest Service as its\r\n\npreferred alternative in the final EIS, does not fall \"within\r\n\nthe   spectrum  of  alternatives\"  that  were  considered  in\r\n\nprevious drafts, even if  Phase II of Alternative 2  had been\r\n\nadequately analyzed prior to the FEIS.  Alternative 6 entails\r\n\na different  configuration of  activities and  locations, not\r\n\nmerely   a   reduced  version   of   a  previously-considered\r\n\nalternative.   Phase II  of Alternative 2  proposed expanding\r\n\nthe ski area primarily on land that is not within the current\r\n\npermit area; in  contrast, Alternative 6 squeezes much of its\r\n\n                             -49-\r\r\n\nexpansion into that current permit area.  To accomplish this,\r\n\nAlternative  6  widens existing  trails  so  as to  eliminate\r\n\nbuffers  that  currently  separate   the  trails.    It  also\r\n\nenvisions a 28,500-square-foot base lodge facility within the\r\n\nexisting permit  area.   And it  develops ski  trails, access\r\n\nroads  and lifts on land that the prior alternatives had left\r\n\nas  a  woodland  buffer between  the  old  ski  area and  the\r\n\nproposed expansion area.   These are substantial changes from\r\n\nthe previously-discussed alternatives, not mere modifications\r\n\n\"within the spectrum\" of those prior  alternatives.  It would\r\n\nbe  one thing  if  the  Forest  Service  had  adopted  a  new\r\n\nalternative that was actually  within the range of previously\r\n\nconsidered alternatives,  e.g., simply reducing the  scale of\r                                          \r\n\nevery  relevant particular.   It  is quite  another thing  to\r\n\nadopt  a proposal  that is  configured differently,  in which\r\n\ncase  public commenters might have  pointed out, if given the\r\n\nopportunity --  and the  Forest Service might  have seriously\r\n\nconsidered  --   wholly  new   problems  posed  by   the  new\r\n\nconfiguration  (even if  some of  the  environmental problems\r\n\npresent in the prior alternatives have been eliminated).\r\n\n          Nor  can it  be  said that  these  changes are  not\r\n\n\"relevant to  environmental concerns.\"  They  could very well\r\n\nhave environmental  impacts that  the Forest Service  has not\r\n\nyet considered,  simply based on their  more compact physical\r\n\nlocation.   Indeed,  the RDEIS  said the  Forest  Service had\r\n\n                             -50-\r\r\n\nconsidered    expansion    alternatives   such    as   \"other\r\n\nconfigurations  on  the  existing  permit  area,\"  but  these\r\n\nalternatives \"were eliminated  from detailed analysis because\r\n\nthey were not reasonable or feasible alternatives.\"  JA, vol.\r\n\nI,  at 145-46.  Moreover, the plan selected, Alternative 6 in\r\n\nthe FEIS, would require that four million gallons  more water\r\n\nbe  withdrawn  annually  for snowmaking,  compared  with  the\r\n\nclosest alternative among the five  previously given detailed\r\n\nconsideration.   Whether or not  viewed in the  graphic terms\r\n\ndescribed  by  plaintiff  RESTORE  --  four  million  gallons\r\n\nannually is  enough water  \"to create  a lake  the size  of a\r\n\nfootball field more than eleven  feet deep,\" RESTORE Brief at\r\n\n33  --  this change  can be  expected  to have  a significant\r\n\nenough  effect on  the environment  that additional  analysis\r\n\nthrough a supplemental EIS would be required.   Cf. Roosevelt\r                                                                         \r\n\nCampobello, 684 F.2d at 1055 (requiring a supplemental EIS to\r                      \r\n\nconsider newly completed studies  regarding the small risk of\r\n\na major oil spill).  We conclude, based on the record in this\r\n\ncase, that Alternative 6 entails substantial changes from the\r\n\npreviously   proposed   actions   that   are    relevant   to\r\n\nenvironmental concerns, and that   the Forest Service did not\r\n\npresent  those changes to the  public in its  FEIS for review\r\n\nand comment.   Accordingly,  the Forest Service's  failure to\r\n\nprepare a supplemental EIS was arbitrary and capricious. \r\n\n                VI.   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11,990 \r                            VI.   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11,990 \r                                                        \r\n\n                             -51-\r\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  contend  that   the  Forest   Service's\r\n\nfailure  to adequately  consider alternatives  to the  use of\r\n\nLoon Pond and failure to develop adequate mitigation measures\r\n\nviolates  Executive Order  11,990,  as  well  as NEPA.    The\r\n\ndistrict court rejected this argument on essentially the same\r\n\ngrounds as the NEPA argument.  \r\n\n          On  appeal,  the   government  contends  that   the\r\n\nExecutive  Order  is not  enforceable,  at  least by  private\r\n\nparties, because NEPA did  not confer rulemaking authority on\r\n\nthe President.  Plaintiffs argue that  the Executive Order is\r\n\naccorded  the  full   force  and  effect  of  a   statute  or\r\n\nregulation,  enforceable   under  the  APA.     We  have  not\r\n\npreviously decided this precise issue, nor need we decide  it\r\n\nnow.\r\n\n          Even   assuming  that   the   Executive  Order   is\r\n\nenforceable  under  the   APA,  it  does  not  apply  to  the\r\n\ncircumstances of this case.  The Executive  Order states that\r\n\nfederal agencies,\r\n\n          to  the  extent permitted  by  law, shall\r\n          avoid undertaking or providing assistance\r\n          for new construction located  in wetlands\r\n          unless the  head of the  agency finds (1)\r\n          that there is no  practicable alternative\r\n          to  such construction,  and (2)  that the\r\n          proposed action  includes all practicable\r\n          measures  to  minimize  harm to  wetlands\r\n          which may result from such use.\r\n\nExec. Order No.  11,990,   2.  There is  no dispute that Loon\r\n\nPond  is a \"wetland.\"   The Forest Service, however, contends\r\n\n                             -52-\r\r\n\nthat the Loon Corp.  expansion plan does not  constitute \"new\r\n\nconstruction.\"      The   Executive   Order    defines   \"new\r\n\nconstruction\" to include  \"draining, dredging,  channelizing,\r\n\nfilling, diking, impounding, and related activities.\"  Id.,  \r                                                                      \r\n\n7(b).  Dubois claims that the use of Loon Pond as a source of\r\n\nwater for snowmaking and the discharge of used water from the\r\n\nsnowmaking  pipes into  Loon Pond  constitute \"draining\"  and\r\n\n\"filling\" within the meaning of   7(b).\r\n\n          We  agree with  the  Forest Service  that the  mere\r\n\nexpansion of a previously ongoing withdrawal of water from or\r\n\naddition of  water to  a reservoir ordinarily  does not  fall\r\n\nwithin the ambit of  the Executive Order's \"new construction\"\r\n\nrequirement.23   This  conclusion  is dictated  by the  plain\r\n\nmeaning  of the  phrase  \"new construction,\"  which does  not\r\n\nordinarily  encompass  the  mere  expansion   of  an  ongoing\r\n\nactivity,   unless  that  activity  itself  constituted  \"new\r\n\nconstruction.\"     Likewise,  in  common   usage,  the  words\r\n\n\"draining\" and \"filling\"  generally refer to  activities that\r\n\neliminate a wetland to  convert it to another use, not to the\r\n\nexpansion  of  an activity  that  already  adds  water to  or\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n23.  It  is conceivable, of  course, that an  expansion of an\r\nalready existing activity could fall within the ambit of  the\r                                           \r\nExecutive Order's \"new construction\" requirement.  This could\r\noccur if  the expansion  effectuated a qualitative  change in\r\nthe nature of the  activity, rather than a  mere quantitative\r\nenlargement of that activity.  On the record before us in the\r\ninstant case, we cannot say that plaintiffs have demonstrated\r\nsuch a qualitative change.\r\n\n                             -53-\r\r\n\nwithdraws  water  from  an existing  pond.    Our reading  is\r\n\nbuttressed  by common sense:  one would not ordinarily think,\r\n\nwithout  more,  that a  federal  agency  operating a  dam  on\r\n\nfederal land would  be required, by  the Executive Order,  to\r\n\nissue  notices and make findings every time water is added to\r\n\nor  withdrawn from the dam (assuming that the dam has already\r\n\nmet all legal requirements to begin operation).\r\n\n          Applying  the foregoing  analysis of  the Executive\r\n\nOrder to the record in the instant case, we conclude that the\r\n\nsituation  here  is  more akin  to  an  expansion of  ongoing\r\n\nactivities than to  \"new construction.\"  The town  of Lincoln\r\n\nis already  using Loon Pond as  a source of town  water.  And\r\n\nLoon  Corp. has been using the Pond  as a source of water for\r\n\nsnowmaking, to  a depth of four  to six feet on  the average.\r\n\nIt is true  that the extent  of this intrusion  is less  than\r\n\nwould  be  the  case  under  the  proposed  expansion.    But\r\n\nplaintiffs   did   not  challenge   these  currently-existing\r\n\nintrusions, and  they have  not demonstrated a  factual basis\r\n\nfor their  conclusion that  there is something  qualitatively\r\n\n\"new\" about the  proposed drawdown.  Thus, the  proposed Loon\r\n\nCorp.  expansion project  --  by drawing  down a  substantial\r\n\nadditional amount of  water from Loon  Pond and refilling  it\r\n\nwith  East Branch  water or  with acidic  runoff --  does not\r\n\nsatisfy  the  definition  of  \"new  construction\"  within the\r\n\nmeaning of Executive Order 11,990, even though it constitutes\r\n\n                             -54-\r\r\n\na major  action with  significant impact on  the environment,\r\n\ntriggering NEPA's EIS requirements.\r\n\n              VII.

Defendants  argue that the NPDES permit\r\n\nissue  is not  properly raised  because plaintiffs  failed to\r\n\nprovide  notice  of  their  intentions to  sue  Loon  Corp.25\r\n\nDefendants contend that Section  505(b) of the CWA \"prohibits\r\n\ncitizen  plaintiffs from  filing [suit  to enforce  the CWA's\r\n\nNPDES  permit requirement] until at least  60 days after they\r\n\nhave provided notice of their intent  to sue\" to EPA, to  the\r\n\nState  in which the  alleged violation occurred,  and to \"any\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n24.  The  third major  aspect  of  the  CWA  is  the  use  of\r\nindustry-specific  effluent standards to  control the quality\r\nof effluent  that can  be attained using  available pollution\r\ncontrol technology.  33 U.S.C.    1311, et seq.

The Forest Service also asserts  that no claim can stand\r\nagainst it as a defendant  because EPA regulations place  the\r\nresponsibility   for  obtaining   an  NPDES  permit   on  the\r\n\"operator\"  of  a covered  activity;  the  Forest Service  is\r\nmerely  the owner  of the  land on  which the  activity takes\r\nplace.  This argument is unavailing:  if an NPDES permit were\r\nrequired,  as plaintiffs  contend,  then  the Forest  Service\r\nshould  not have granted a  special use permit  to Loon Corp.\r\nuntil the NPDES permit had been obtained.\r\n\n                             -56-\r\r\n\nalleged  violator\"  of the  standard,  limitation,  or order.\r\n\nForest  Service  Brief at  37; see  33  U.S.C.    1365 (b)(1)\r                                              \r\n\n(1994).  It is undisputed, however, that Dubois, the original\r\n\nplaintiff, did provide  notice to the  Forest Service of  his\r\n\nintent to sue.   The  Forest Service was  the only  defendant\r\n\nthat he did sue; and he alleged only that the Forest Service,\r\n\nnot Loon Corp., had  violated federal statutes, including the\r\n\nCWA, in approving Loon Corp.'s expansion plan.   The district\r\n\ncourt therefore  had jurisdiction to hear  Dubois' claim that\r\n\nthe Forest Service had approved the  project illegally by not\r\n\nensuring that  an NPDES  permit was obtained.   His  properly\r\n\nraised NEPA claim subsumed the CWA claim.26\r\n\n          Thus,  even  if Loon  Corp.'s  lack  of notice  did\r\n\ndeprive us  of jurisdiction  to hear  Dubois' claim  that the\r\n\nForest  Service violated  the  CWA by  failing to  require an\r\n\nNPDES permit  before approving  the special use  permit, this\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n26.  Thereafter, Loon Corp. chose to intervene in the action\r\nin order to protect its business interests.  When Loon Corp.\r\nvoluntarily intervened in an ongoing action, it \"step[ped]\r\ninto the shoes\" of the original defendants -- who were\r\nproperly before the court -- insofar as the 60-day notice is\r\nconcerned.

We need  look no  further than  the\r\nstatutory  language itself:    \"No action  may be  commenced\"\r                                                                        \r\nwithout  the requisite notice.  33 U.S.C.   1365(b).  RESTORE\r\ndid not \"commence\" this action; it  intervened in an existing\r\naction.   Moreover, the purpose of  the notice requirement --\r\nto give  the parties  an opportunity to  resolve the  problem\r\nadministratively or  to settle  the matter without  resort to\r\nthe  courts,  before  the  parties  have assumed  adversarial\r\npositions brought about by litigation -- no longer applied at\r\nthe  time RESTORE intervened in the ongoing suit.  Hence, the\r\npurpose of  the notice  requirement would  not  be served  by\r\napplying it to an intervenor like RESTORE.\r\n\n            Nor  are  we faced  with  the  kind of  equitable\r\nconsiderations  discussed in  Hallstrom v.  Tillamook County,\r                                                                        \r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  29 (1989),  in holding  an  original plaintiff\r\nstrictly  to the  notice  requirement.   Unlike the  original\r\nplaintiff, who has full  control over when to file  the suit,\r\nan  intervenor like RESTORE has no control over the timing of\r\nthe initial  action.  Because  this action was  already being\r\nlitigated on  an expedited schedule, RESTORE  could well have\r\nlost  the  opportunity to  protect  its interests  if  it had\r\nserved  a notice  of intent to  sue and  then waited  60 days\r\nbefore intervening  in the  expedited case.   The balance  of\r\nequities here favors permitting RESTORE to pursue its claims.\r\n\n                             -58-\r\r\n\nproject  needed in  order to  comply with  applicable federal\r\n\nlaw.   40 C.F.R.    1502.25(b).   There is  no question  that\r\n\nplaintiffs  have properly  invoked  the jurisdiction  of this\r\n\ncourt, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1331 (general federal question\r\n\njurisdiction), to  challenge  defendants' failure  to  comply\r\n\nwith  NEPA  in this  regard.   For  these reasons,  we reject\r\n\ndefendants' jurisdictional argument and turn to the merits.\r\n\n          B.   NPDES Permit\r                      B.   NPDES Permit\r                                       \r\n\n          Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act prohibits the\r\n\n\"discharge of  any pollutant\" into navigable  waters from any\r\n\n\"point  source\" without an NPDES permit.  33 U.S.C.   1311(a)\r\n\n(1994).   Plaintiffs argue  that the Forest  Service violated\r\n\nSection 301(a) by  failing to obtain  an NPDES permit  before\r\n\napproving Loon's plan  to remove water from  the East Branch,\r\n\nuse  it to pressurize and prevent  freezing in its snowmaking\r\n\nequipment, and then  discharge the used water into Loon Pond.\r\n\nSection 301(a)  prohibits the \"discharge of  any pollutant by\r\n\nany person\"  except as authorized pursuant to a permit issued\r\n\nunder the  Act.   Id.; see  33 U.S.C.     1342, 1344  (1994);\r                                      \r\n\nCommonwealth of P.R., 721  F.2d at 835.  The  term \"discharge\r                                \r\n\nof  a pollutant\" is defined as \"any addition of any pollutant\r\n\nto  navigable waters  from any  point source.\"   33  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1362(12)(A) (1994).  The definition of a \"pollutant\" includes\r\n\n\"dredged  spoil, solid  waste, . .  . sewage, garbage,  . . .\r\n\nbiological materials, .  . .  heat,  . .  . sand, .  . .  and\r\n\n                             -59-\r\r\n\nagricultural waste.\"  33 U.S.C.   1362(6) (1994).  \"Navigable\r\n\nwaters\" is  defined as \"the waters of the United States.\"  33\r\n\nU.S.C.    1362(7) (1994).   The district court  found and the\r\n\nparties agree that Loon Pond is a water of the United States,\r\n\nthat  the  East Branch  water  discharged  from Loon  Corp.'s\r\n\nsnowmaking pipes  into Loon Pond  is a  pollutant within  the\r\n\nmeaning of the CWA,28 and that the pipe discharging the water\r\n\ninto Loon Pond  is a  point source.   The question, then,  is\r\n\nwhether  there is  an \"addition\"  of pollutants to  Loon Pond\r\n\nwhen  water containing  pollutants  is discharged  from  Loon\r\n\nCorp.'s snowmaking equipment into Loon Pond.\r\n\n          The district  court answered  this question in  the\r\n\nnegative.   The court reasoned that the intake water from the\r\n\nEast Branch of the  Pemigewasset River and the water  in Loon\r\n\nPond are  all part of \"a singular  entity, 'the waters of the\r                                                           \r\n\nUnited States,'\" and  therefore that \"the bodies of water are\r\n\nnot  to   be  considered  individually   in  this   context.\"\r\n\nMemorandum  and Order at 13.  Because it interpreted the East\r\n\nBranch  and  Loon  Pond to  be  part  of  the same  \"singular\r\n\nentity,\"  the court concluded that the transfer of water from\r\n\nthe  East  Branch into  Loon  Pond  would not  constitute  an\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n28.  It  contains  at least  the  same  pollutants that  were\r\npresent  in the water from the East Branch before intake into\r\nthe pipes.\r\n\n                             -60-\r\r\n\n\"addition\" into the Pond, at least if the pipes  added no new\r\n\npollutants.29  Id.\r                              \r\n\n          There is no basis  in law or fact for  the district\r\n\ncourt's \"singular  entity\" theory.  The error  in the court's\r\n\nreasoning  is highlighted by an  analogy the court  drew:  it\r\n\nhypothesized a pond in  which \"we place a  pipe . . .  and we\r\n\npump  the pond water from the bottom  to the surface.  No one\r\n\nwould  reasonably  contend that  internal  pumping  causes an\r\n\n'addition' of  pollutants to  the pond.    Instead, we  would\r\n\nconsider  the pumping  to be  a redistribution  of pollutants\r\n\nfrom one  part of the pond to  another.\"  Id. at  12.  Such a\r                                                         \r\n\nsituation is not at all analogous to the instant case.  There\r\n\nis no barrier separating the water at the top of  a pond from\r\n\nthe  water  at  the  bottom  of  the  same  pond;  chemicals,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n29.  This premise is a disputed issue.  Plaintiffs argue that\r\nallowing the water from  the East Branch to flow  through the\r\npipes before discharge into Loon Pond results in the addition\r\nof not insignificant  amounts of oil and  grease.  Defendants\r\ndispute this, which ordinarily would result in a reversal of\r\nsummary judgment on  this issue.  See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56(c).\r                                                 \r\nDefendants argue,  however, that  plaintiffs failed  to raise\r\nthis factual dispute before the  agency in timely fashion, so\r\nit  is not preserved for our review.  Plaintiffs respond that\r\nthey  could  not  have  raised  this  dispute  prior  to  the\r\npublication  of the FEIS  because the Forest  Service did not\r\neven collect the  data regarding oil  and grease until  after\r\nissuing its decision  (the ROD).   We need  not resolve  this\r\ndispute;  we hold infra  that, even if  the pipes add  no new\r                                   \r\npollutants, the  transfer of  East Branch water  through Loon\r\nCorp.'s  privately owned  pipes and  its discharge  into Loon\r\nPond constitutes  a point source  discharge of at  least some\r\npollutants into the Pond,  thereby requiring an NPDES permit.\r\nUpon remand,  the parties are not  foreclosed from presenting\r\ntheir factual disputes to  the EPA if they decide  to contest\r\nthe issuance of that permit.\r\n\n                             -61-\r\r\n\norganisms, and even heat are able to pass from the top to the\r\n\nbottom or vice versa, at rates determined only by the laws of\r                                \r\n\nscience.  \r\n\n          In contrast, the transfer  of water or its contents\r\n\nfrom  the East Branch to Loon Pond would not occur naturally.\r\n\nThis is more analogous to the example the district court gave\r\n\nfrom the opposite end of the spectrum:  where water is  added\r\n\n\"from an external source\"  to the pond and an NPDES permit is\r\n\nrequired.  Id.  As in this converse  example, the East Branch\r                          \r\n\nand Loon Pond are not the same body of water; the East Branch\r\n\nis indeed  a source  \"external\" to  Loon Pond.   We  can take\r\n\njudicial notice that the Pemigewasset River was for years one\r\n\nof the most  polluted rivers in  New England, the  repository\r\n\nfor  raw  sewage from  factories and  towns.   It  emitted an\r\n\noverwhelming  odor  and  was  known  to  peel  the paint  off\r\n\nbuildings  located on  its banks.   Yet,  under  the district\r\n\ncourt's theory,  even if  such conditions still  prevailed, a\r\n\nproposal to withdraw water from the Pemigewasset to discharge\r\n\nit into Loon Pond would be analogous to moving water from the\r\n\ntop to the bottom of  a single pond; it would not  constitute\r\n\nan \"addition\" of pollutants \"from an external source\" because\r\n\nboth the East Branch and Loon Pond are part of the \"singular\"\r\n\nwaters of the United States.30  The district court apparently\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n30.  Again,  we  leave  to  one  side  the  possibility  that\r\nadditional pollutants, such as oil and grease, would be added\r\nwhen the water flowed through the  system of pipes.  If  that\r\n\n                             -62-\r\r\n\nwould reach  the same  conclusion regardless of  how polluted\r\n\nthe Pemigewasset  was or how pristine  Loon Pond was.   We do\r\n\nnot believe Congress intended such an irrational result.\r\n\n          The district court's analysis also ignores the fact\r\n\nthat water  would pass  through Loon Corp.'s  privately owned\r\n\npipes on  its way from the  East Branch to Loon  Pond.  Thus,\r\n\nnature  would not regulate --  and neither the Forest Service\r\n\nnor the court could know in advance -- whether any pollutants\r\n\nwould be added to the  water as it passes through the  pipes.\r\n\nThe district court concluded that the  East Branch water does\r\n\nnot \"lose[] its  status as  navigable waters\" even  if it  is\r\n\n\"commercially exploited,\" Memorandum and Order at 18, as long\r\n\nas  Loon  Corp.  does  not  \"plan[]  to  add  any  additional\r\n\npollutants  to  the East  Branch  water  that it  intends  to\r\n\ndischarge into  Loon Pond.\"  Id.  at 10.  The  court does not\r                                            \r\n\nindicate  whether anyone assures  compliance with  the \"plan\"\r\n\nthat   no  pollutants   be   added  during   the   commercial\r\n\nexploitation, or if so  who makes that determination and  how\r\n\nit is  made, at  a  time when  the project  is  still just  a\r\n\nproposal and not yet  a fait accompli.  Cf.  Massachusetts v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nWatt, 716 F.2d at  952.  The district court's  analysis would\r                \r\n\napply equally if the water passed through a paper mill on its\r\n\nway to Loon Pond,  instead of through snowmaking pipes.   And\r\n\nthe analysis is equally unpersuasive in either  circumstance.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nwere true, that alone would require an NPDES permit.\r\n\n                             -63-\r\r\n\nEither  way, the  water leaves  the domain  of nature  and is\r\n\nsubject  to  private  control  rather  than   purely  natural\r\n\nprocesses.  As such, it has  lost its status as waters of the\r\n\nUnited States.  \r\n\n          Other  courts have  held  that an  NPDES permit  is\r\n\nrequired  before pollutants  may  be moved  from one  body of\r\n\nwater of the United States to another.

The\r\n\nForest Service  recognizes that \"[i]t is  possible that water\r\n\ntransferred between unrelated water bodies of different water\r\n\nquality would properly  be regarded as  losing its status  as\r\n\n'water [sic] of the United  States,'\" requiring a Section 402\r\n\npermit.  Forest  Service Brief at 47.  We  agree.  The Forest\r\n\nService qualifies this insight, however.  It argues that Loon\r\n\n                             -64-\r\r\n\nCorp.  \"moves  water between  hydrologically  connected water\r\n\nbodies  containing water of  like quality\"  which, therefore,\r\n\ndoes not \"introduce pollutants  'from the outside world' into\r\n\nthe receiving waters.\"  Id.  Accordingly, the Forest  Service\r                                       \r\n\nargues  no permit is required.   We disagree  with the Forest\r\n\nService's qualification.\r\n\n          First, there  is nothing in the  statute evincing a\r\n\nCongressional intent to distinguish between \"unrelated\" water\r\n\nbodies  and  related   or  \"hydrologically  connected\"  water\r\n\nbodies.    The  CWA simply  addresses  \"any  addition of  any\r\n\npollutant to  navigable waters  from any point  source.\"   33\r\n\nU.S.C.   1362(12)(A).  Nor  is the purpose of the  CWA served\r\n\nby means of  such a  distinction.  If  anything, the  purpose\r\n\nwould be  better served by  a distinction between  de minimis\r                                                                         \r\n\ntransfers  of   water  and  transfers  which   add  some  not\r\n\ninsignificant  amount of pollutants  to the  transferee water\r\n\nbody.  But no such distinction appears in the statute, and to\r\n\nimply  one would  thrust some  agencies with no  expertise on\r\n\nenvironmental issues  into the  role of deciding  whether the\r\n\nCWA's environmental protections should even be considered.31\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n31.  As discussed in Part  VII(C), infra, in another context,\r                                                    \r\nthe Forest Service argues that it is the EPA, not the  Forest\r\nService, that has the expertise and the congressional mandate\r\nto  determine whether  a proposed  project meets  state water\r\nquality standards.   We agree.   The availability  of EPA  to\r\nperform  this  task is  another  reason why  an  NPDES permit\r\nshould  be obtained  before the  Forest Service  approves the\r\nLoon  Corp. expansion  plan.   See  note 32  and accompanying\r                                              \r\ntext, infra.\r                       \r\n\n                             -65-\r\r\n\n          More    compellingly,    the    Forest    Service's\r\n\n\"hydrological connectedness\" proposal  ignores a  fundamental\r\n\nfact about  water:  the direction  of flow.  It  is true that\r\n\nLoon Pond and the  East Branch of the Pemigewasset  River are\r\n\n\"hydrologically connected\"  in the sense that  water from the\r\n\nPond flows down and  eventually empties into the River.   But\r                           \r\n\nwater from  the East  Branch certainly  does not flow  uphill\r                                                                         \r\n\ninto  Loon Pond, carrying  with it  the pollutants  that have\r\n\nundisputedly accumulated  in the East Branch  water from some\r\n\nof the other sources  of water entering the East  Branch from\r\n\nupstream.    Under  such  circumstances,   defendants  cannot\r\n\ncredibly argue  that these water  bodies are so  related that\r\n\nthe transfer  of water from the  East Branch to  Loon Pond is\r                                                           \r\n\nnot an  \"addition\" of water  from one  of the \"waters  of the\r\n\nUnited States\"  to another.   We therefore reject  the Forest\r\n\nService's \"hydrological connectedness\" proposal.\r\n\n          Likewise,  we reject its  assertion, unsupported by\r\n\nthe  record, that  in some  general sense  the two  bodies of\r\n\nwater are  \"of like  quality.\"   First, this  is the kind  of\r\n\nsubstantive  question  to  which  the  EPA  would  apply  its\r\n\ntechnical  expertise in  deciding whether  to issue  an NPDES\r\n\npermit  and what  conditions to  attach to  such a  permit in\r\n\norder  to protect  water  quality.   It  is not  the kind  of\r\n\nthreshold  question that  the  Forest Service  or this  court\r\n\n                             -66-\r\r\n\nshould address in deciding whether to  subject the Loon Corp.\r\n\nexpansion proposal to the NPDES permitting process.  \r\n\n          Second,  the   Forest  Service  does   not  contest\r\n\nplaintiffs' assertion that there are at least some pollutants\r\n\nin the East  Branch that do not exist naturally in Loon Pond.\r\n\nThe  Final EIS  itself noted  that the  East Branch  has been\r\n\ndesignated  by the  New Hampshire  legislature as  a  Class B\r\n\nWaterway,  a  lower  quality  designation than  the  Class  A\r\n\nquality rating  of Loon Pond.  JA, vol. II,  FEIS at 91.  The\r\n\ndifference in classifications -- the East Branch as a Class B\r\n\nwaterway,  Loon Pond as Class  A -- evinces  a higher quality\r\n\nlevel for the Pond than for the River, and  belies the Forest\r\n\nService's assertion that the two bodies of water are \"of like\r\n\nquality.\"\r\n\n          Even  if the  East  Branch were  rated in  the same\r\n\ngeneral class as Loon Pond (Class A), that would not mean the\r\n\ntwo bodies of water  were identical in quality, such  that an\r\n\nNPDES permit  would be unnecessary.  The East Branch contains\r\n\ndifferent  organisms than  Loon  Pond,  inter  alia,  Giardia\r                                                               \r\n\nlambia.    Loon Pond  is also  colder  overall than  the East\r\n\nBranch, and its  lower depths are significantly  colder.  The\r\n\ntwo  bodies  of   water  also  have  different   chemistries,\r\n\nespecially the  low level of  phosphorus in Loon  Pond, which\r\n\naffects  its  biological composition.    Nor  has the  Forest\r\n\nService argued  that all such pollutants  would be eliminated\r                                    \r\n\n                             -67-\r\r\n\nbefore any East  Branch water  would be pumped  up to  refill\r\n\nLoon  Pond after depletion  by Loon Corp.'s  snowmaking.  The\r\n\nService  cannot say,  therefore, that  the discharge  of East\r\n\nBranch  water  into  Loon  Pond  would  not  result  in  \"any\r\n\npollutants\"  being   added  to  the   Pond.    33   U.S.C.   \r\n\n1362(12)(A).\r\n\n          Aside  from the  difficulty of  defining a  general\r\n\nconcept  such  as  \"of  like quality,\"  it  would  defeat the\r\n\npurpose  of  the  CWA's   permit  process  to  interpret  the\r\n\nstatutory language \"discharge of  any pollutant,\" 33 U.S.C.  \r                                                 \r\n\n1311(a),  to be  implicitly qualified  by the  phrase \"except\r\n\nwhen  the transferee body of water  is of like quality.\"  The\r\n\nForest  Service  is simply  wrong  to  analogize the  present\r\n\nsituation to  a dam that  merely accumulates the  same water,\r                                                                  \r\n\nsee National  Wildlife Fed'n v.

This water would come from one of two\r\n\nsources:  some of  it would come from snowmelt  that replaces\r\n\nthe water that Loon Corp. has pumped out of Loon Pond to make\r\n\nsnow; and  some would be water that Loon Corp. has taken from\r\n\nthe East Branch for snowmaking  and then discharged into Loon\r\n\nPond.    Dubois   contends  that   Loon  Corp.'s   snowmaking\r\n\noperations pose an impermissible  threat to Loon Pond because\r\n\ninfluxes  of  East  Branch  water  and  snowmelt --  the  two\r\n\nprincipal  sources of water to refill the Pond -- could alter\r\n\nthe Pond's naturally occurring  pH, bacteria, oil and grease,\r\n\nand turbidity levels.\r\n\n          On the merits of the water quality standards issue,\r\n\nDubois  argues that  the CWA requires  states to  adopt water\r\n\nquality  standards which protect  against degradation  of the\r\n\nphysical, chemical,  or biological attributes  of the state's\r\n\nwaters.   33 U.S.C.     1251(a),  1313(d)(4)(B); 40 C.F.R.   \r\n\n                             -69-\r\r\n\n131.12.   The greatest protection is  afforded to Outstanding\r\n\nResource  Waters,  including  Loon   Pond,  as  to  which  no\r\n\ndegradation  is permitted.   40  C.F.R.    131.12(a)(3); N.H.\r\n\nCode Admin. R. Env-Ws  437.06.  Dubois contends that  the ski\r\n\nresort's proposal to draw down  a significant amount of water\r\n\nchanges the  physical structure of Loon  Pond; that refilling\r\n\nit with East Branch  water containing phosphorus (and through\r\n\npipes that  might  contain oil  and  grease) or  with  acidic\r\n\nrunoff would change the Pond's chemical composition; and that\r\n\nthe  transfer  of  organisms   such  as  Giardia  lambia  and\r\n\nchemicals  such as phosphorus  into the Pond  would alter its\r\n\nbiological  attributes.   Because we  hold infra  that Dubois\r                                                            \r\n\ncannot,  in  a  challenge   to  the  Forest  Service's  FEIS,\r\n\ncollaterally  attack the state's  certification of compliance\r\n\nwith state  water quality standards,  we need  not reach  the\r\n\nmerits of the state water quality standards issue.\r\n\n          Defendants  argued  in  the  district   court  that\r\n\nDubois'  CWA claim  was not  properly presented,  that Dubois\r\n\nshould  have raised  his  objections  by  exhausting  various\r\n\nadministrative remedies and filing a timely appeal in the New\r\n\nHampshire Supreme Court.  They argued that the federal agency\r\n\n(Forest Service) and the federal court lack the authority  to\r\n\nreview   independently   and   determine   the   validity  of\r\n\nrequirements  imposed under state law  or in a  state's   401\r\n\ncertification, see 33 U.S.C.   1371(c)(2)(A) (1994), and that\r                              \r\n\n                             -70-\r\r\n\nsuch  authority  is expressly  delegated  to  the states,  33\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341(a) (1994).  \r\n\n          The district court agreed.  It held that, \"[i]f the\r\n\nplaintiffs in this case were dissatisfied with the state's   \r\n\n1341   certification,   they   could   have   challenged  the\r\n\ncertification by exhausting state administrative remedies and\r\n\nfiling  a  timely  challenge  in the  New  Hampshire  Supreme\r\n\nCourt.\"  Memorandum and Order at 21-23.  That is true insofar\r\n\nas it goes.  The question, however, is  whether a state court\r\n\naction is the plaintiffs'  only recourse, or whether,  in the\r                                           \r\n\nalternative, they had  a right to challenge in  federal court\r\n\nthe federal agency's issuance of a federal permit in reliance\r\n\non  the  state  certification,  where  the  basis  for  their\r\n\nchallenge  is that  the  project fails  to  meet the  minimum\r\n\nstandards of the federal Clean Water Act.\r\n\n          Defendants may be correct  that the cases they rely\r\n\nupon hold that the state courts are the only fora in which to\r\n\nchallenge  whatever requirements  the state adds,  beyond the\r                                                                     \r\n\nminimum  required by the CWA.   Those cases  do not, however,\r\n\ndeprive  the federal courts  of jurisdiction to  hear a claim\r\n\nthat defendants have violated the  floor level of clean water\r                                                    \r\n\nrequirements imposed by the CWA, i.e., the requirements which\r                                                 \r\n\nthe state regulations share with the federal CWA.\r                                       \r\n\n                             -71-\r\r\n\n          The cases relied upon by the  defendants and by the\r\n\ndistrict  court32  dealt  with  challenges  to   the  state's\r\n\nimposition of  more stringent  controls on a  project's water\r                                         \r\n\npollution effluent.  Such cases relied on the language of the\r\n\nCWA itself,  as well  as basic  principles of  federalism, to\r\n\nsupport their  holdings that the CWA  \"empower[s]\" the states\r\n\n\"to set more stringent water quality standards than those set\r\n\nby the Act and its  attendant requirements\" to prevent  water\r\n\npollution.

Dubois  Brief at 27; see 33 U.S.C.   \r                                                            \r\n\n1341(a).    Such  effluent  limitations   and  standards  are\r\n\nestablished  in NPDES permits  for point  source dischargers.\r\n\n33  U.S.C.    1311(b),  1312, 1316,  1317, 1362(11).   Dubois\r\n\nthen tries  to bootstrap  the fact  that  the Forest  Service\r\n\nfailed  to apply for an NPDES permit into a circumstance that\r\n\nrenders Section  511(c)(2)(A) inapplicable.  Dubois  Brief at\r\n\n27-28.  His argument is without merit.  \r\n\n          It is true that the Forest Service was obligated to\r\n\nobtain an NPDES permit before permitting Loon Corp. to expand\r\n\nits  ski resort.    See Part  VII(B),  supra.   However,  the\r                                                        \r\n\nviolation of  that statutory  obligation is a  separate issue\r\n\n                             -73-\r\r\n\nfrom the state water  quality standards issue.   For purposes\r\n\nof the  latter, the  fact  is that  there  do not  exist  any\r\n\neffluent limitations under CWA Sections 301(b) or 302 nor any\r\n\nstandards of  performance under CWA Sections 306  or 307 that\r\n\napply to  the discharge of  East Branch water  and pollutants\r\n\ninto Loon Pond.  Therefore, whether or not the Forest Service\r\n\nactually   obtained  the   required  NPDES   permit,  Section\r\n\n511(c)(2)(A) applies, and  Dubois' challenge to the  adequacy\r\n\nof the state's Section  401 certification may not proceed  in\r\n\nthis court.  \r\n\n          As the federal defendants argued in their brief and\r\n\nas we held in Roosevelt Campobello, 684 F.2d at 1056, Dubois'\r                                              \r\n\nchallenge  must be  addressed as  part of  EPA's \"independent\r\n\nobligation to ensure that EPA-issued NPDES permits meet state\r\n\nwater quality standards.\"  Forest Service Brief at 29; see 33\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.     1311(b)(1)(C)  (1994).33   If,  upon  remand,  EPA\r\n\ndetermines  that a  permit  is appropriate,  with or  without\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n33.  The availability of  EPA to perform this task is another\r\nreason supporting our holding in  Part VII(B), supra, that an\r                                                                \r\nNPDES permit is required.   See supra  note 30.  The  federal\r                                                 \r\nCWA  requires that  any state  certification ensure  that the\r\nminimal  federal  standards  have   been  adhered  to.    The\r\ngovernment  is correct  that  the  Forest  Service  possesses\r\nneither  the  congressional  mandate  nor  the  expertise  to\r\nsecond-guess  state water  quality certifications.   But  EPA\r\ndoes; and the CWA envisions that EPA make those assurances in\r\nthe context of deciding whether to issue an NPDES permit.\r\n\n                             -74-\r\r\n\nconditions or limitations,34 and if  plaintiffs disagree with\r\n\nEPA's  decision, then they may challenge such decision in any\r\n\nmanner that is  available to them at the time.   But EPA, not\r\n\nthe  Forest  Service,  is   the  proper  entity  to  evaluate\r\n\ncompliance with state water quality standards.\r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          We affirm the district  court's denial of defendant\r\n\nLoon's  motion  to dismiss  plaintiff  Dubois'  complaint for\r\n\nfailure to  meet his burden  of establishing his  standing to\r\n\nsue.\r\n\n          We  reverse the  district court's grant  of summary\r\n\njudgment  in favor  of  defendants and  reverse the  district\r\n\ncourt's denial  of summary  judgment in favor  of plaintiffs,\r\n\nwith \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n34.  Whether  or not  the  NHDES certifies  that state  water\r\nquality  standards have  been  met, EPA  would  be \"bound  to\r\ninclude in the federal permit 'any more stringent limitations\r\n.  . . established pursuant  to any State  law or regulations\r\n(under  authority preserved  by  section  510).'\"   Roosevelt\r                                                                         \r\nCampobello,   684  F.2d   at  1056   (quoting  33   U.S.C.   \r                      \r\n1311(b)(1)(C)).\r\n\n                             -75-\r\r\n\nrespect to \r\n\n          (1) the NEPA/EIS issue relating to consideration of\r\n\nalternatives, \r\n\n          (2) the supplemental EIS issue, and \r\n\n          (3) the NPDES permit issue. \r\n\n          We  affirm the  district court's  grant of  summary\r\n\njudgment  in  favor of  defendants  and  affirm the  district\r\n\ncourt's  denial of  summary  judgment in  favor of  plaintiff\r\n\nDubois, with respect to the alleged violations of \r\n\n          (1) Executive Order 11,990, and \r\n\n          (2) state water quality standards under the CWA.\r\n\n          Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded; costs\r                      Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded; costs\r                                                                         \r\n\non appeal awarded to plaintiffs.\r            on appeal awarded to plaintiffs.\r                                           \r\n\n                             -76-\r\r\n</pre>",
