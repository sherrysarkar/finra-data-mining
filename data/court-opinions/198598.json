Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Emiro Passos-Paternina on brief pro se.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E.

Appellant, Emiro Passos-Paternina, has\r\nappealed the district court's denial of his motion, filed\r\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255.  We have carefully reviewed the\r\nparties' briefs and the record on appeal.  We affirm\r\nessentially for the reasons stated in the district court's\r\nopinion.  See Passos-Paternina v. United States, 12 F.Supp.2d\r\n231 (D.P.R. 1998).  We add only the following:\r\n          The district court determined that, although\r\nproffered as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the\r\nsecond of Passos-Paternina's two claims was really a claim of\r\nthe denial of his right to testify on his own behalf and that\r\nsuch a claim should not be analyzed under the Strickland\r\nstandard for ineffective assistance of counsel claims; rather,\r\nsuch a claim should be reviewed as a constitutional \"trial\r\nerror\" subject to the Brecht harmless error standard.  Passos-\r\nPaternina v. United States, 12 F.Supp.2d at 240 (agreeing on\r\nthis point with the Fifth Circuit's opinion in Jordan v.\r\nHargett, 34 F.3d 310, 316 n.5 (5th Cir. 1994), vacated on other\r\ngrounds, 53 F.3d 94 (1995) (en banc)).\r\n          We need not decide which of the two standards is\r\nappropriate here.  To establish Strickland prejudice, a\r\ndefendant must show that \"there is a reasonable probability\r\nthat, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of\r\nthe proceeding would have been different.\"  Strickland v.\r\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).  Pursuant to the Brecht\r\nharmless error standard, a defendant must show \"actual\r\nprejudice,\" defined as showing that the constitutional trial\r\nerror had a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in\r\ndetermining the jury's verdict.\"  Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507\r\nU.S. 619, 637 (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328\r\nU.S. 750, 776 (1946)).  In the instant case, the district court\r\nconcluded that Passos-Paternina had not demonstrated that the\r\ndenial of his right to testify actually prejudiced his defense. \r\nPassos-Paternina v. United States, 12 F.Supp.2d at 242-43. \r\nThat conclusion was correct and the result would not change\r\neven if analyzed under the Strickland standard.\r\n          Affirmed.\n",
