George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n                Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n        and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\r\n\nThomas J. Gleason for appellant.\r\nStephen C. Pfaff, with whom Douglas I. Louison and Merrick and\r\nLouison were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 1, 1998\r\n\n          \r\n*Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.  SELYA, Circuit Judge.  This appeal presents a problematic\r\nFirst Amendment question as to whether the plaintiff was a\r\n\"limited-purpose public figure\" required to prove actual malice in\r\norder to recover for defamation.  After careful consideration of\r\nthis, and other, issues, we reject the plaintiff's appeal.\r\nI.  THE PREDICATE FACTS\r\nPlaintiff-appellant Toney Pendleton, an African American\r\nin his mid-forties, hails from Haverhill, Massachusetts.  He is\r\nwell known in the community both because of his family ties and\r\nbecause of his exploits as a high-school athlete.\r\n                  A.  The Job Market.\r\nStarting in the late 1980s, Pendleton tried to land a\r\nfull-time teaching position in the Haverhill public school system. \r\nAlthough he worked as a substitute teacher from time to time, he\r\nprogressed no further.  In August 1993, he vented his frustration\r\nto a reporter, Anita Perkins, who found considerable irony in\r\nPendleton's inability to secure a permanent teaching position \r\nnotwithstanding a student-led outcry for a more diverse public\r\nschool faculty.  She wrote an article to that effect in the\r\nLawrence Eagle-Tribune, a newspaper serving the Haverhill area. \r\nSee Anita Perkins, Black Teacher Has Grown Impatient Awaiting A\r\nChance, Eagle-Trib., Aug. 17, 1993, at 13.\r\nPerkins's article profiled Pendleton and described his\r\nfamily, educational background, career aspirations, temporary\r\nteaching assignments, and his trepidation that school officials\r\nwere not giving appropriate priority to minority hires.  Reflecting\r\non his experience as an African-American student in the Haverhill\r\nschools, Pendleton was quoted as saying:  \"Twenty years later\r\nthings are still the same.\"  He also was quoted as asking,\r\nrhetorically:  \"How can you expect a black child who is called a\r\n'n         ' to go to a white counselor and teacher with his\r\nfeelings?\"  The article commented on the dearth of minority\r\nteachers in the Haverhill schools, described some of the steps that\r\nHaverhill had taken to increase minority representation within the\r\nschool system, and concluded with Pendleton's plaintive comment: \r\n\"I'm tired of substitute teaching.  I just want a chance to show my\r\nqualifications.\"\r\nThat fall, Pendleton accepted a Haverhill-based position\r\nas a vocational counselor with Jobs For Bay State Graduates, Inc.\r\n(JBSG), a private, nonprofit organization.  JBSG counselors advise\r\npublic school students who do not plan to attend college about\r\ncareer opportunities.  Pendleton held this job at the time of his\r\narrest.\r\n              B.  Arrest and Prosecution.\r\nOn the evening of May 27, 1994, Pendleton parked his car\r\non a busy, well-lit street in his home town, ran some errands, and\r\nthen repaired to a local tavern.  At some point, Arnaldo Pagan, a\r\nboyhood friend, asked Pendleton to give him a ride home.  After\r\nPagan grew increasingly insistent, Pendleton acquiesced.  The two\r\nmen then proceeded to Pendleton's automobile.  The vehicle was\r\nstill parked when two Haverhill policemen on routine neighborhood\r\npatrol shined a flashlight into it.  The officers, John Arahovites\r\nand Lawrence Newman, claimed that \"two heads popped up\" from behind\r\nthe dashboard and that they noticed a powdery substance on\r\nPendleton's face.  Upon further investigation, the officers\r\nobserved powder on Pagan's lap and throughout the car's interior. \r\nThey also saw a small bag containing what appeared to be cocaine on\r\nthe floor of the vehicle.  Based on these observations, the\r\ngendarmes promptly arrested Pendleton and Pagan.\r\nPendleton's arrest made front-page news in both the\r\nEagle-Tribune and a competing newspaper, the Haverhill Gazette. \r\nThe stories revealed that charges of cocaine possession and\r\nconspiracy to violate the drug laws had been brought against\r\nPendleton in the state district court.  The articles described\r\nPendleton as a \"school jobs counselor\" and a \"high school advisor\"\r\nwho worked in a classroom five days a week with 30 to 40 high-\r\nschool seniors.\r\nPendleton entered a not guilty plea.  At a court hearing\r\non July 12, 1994, he asserted that when Pagan, after entering his\r\nvehicle, produced a small plastic bag, he (Pendleton) suspected the\r\nbag contained drugs and slapped it out of Pagan's hand.  In turn,\r\nthis act caused the contents to spill onto Pagan's lap and scatter\r\nthroughout the car.  In responding to an unrelated inquiry from the\r\ncourt, the prosecutor admitted that, due to a mix-up, the powder\r\nseized from Pendleton's car had not been tested.  The judge\r\nobviously did not like what he had heard.  He declared Pendleton\r\nnot guilty and dismissed the charges.\r\n                 C.  Subsequent Events.\r\nA flurry of media reports followed the case's\r\ntermination.  In them, the district attorney's office accused the\r\npolice of bungling the investigation and the police chief responded\r\nthat delays in laboratory testing are sometimes an inevitable\r\nconcomitant of the evidence-gathering process.  As part of this\r\ncoverage, a local reporter interviewed Pendleton and his attorney. \r\nThe lawyer theorized that Pendleton had been in the wrong place at\r\nthe wrong time, and that he now could \"get back to doing . . .\r\npositive things in the community,\" such as \"helping kids.\"  Bill\r\nBurke, Pendleton Tells His Side:  But Did Police Drop The Ball?,\r\nHaverhill Gazette, July 14, 1994, at A1. Pendleton asserted that he\r\nwas \"the happiest guy in America that my innocence has been borne\r\nout.\"  Id.\r\nOn July 18, the arresting officers responded to a call\r\nfrom the Eagle-Tribune.  At the newspaper's offices, Arahovites and\r\nNewman voiced indignation over the disposition of the charges,\r\nemphasizing that they had not been notified about the July 12\r\nproceeding and expressing disappointment that the judge had refused\r\nto order Pendleton to undergo drug rehabilitation.  See Bill\r\nCantwell &amp; Eileen Pendleton, Judge's Release Of Suspect Outrages\r\nPolice, Eagle-Trib., July 18, 1994, at 1.  The article quoted\r\nArahovites as saying that the police were \"not trying to crucify\r\nPendleton,\" but \"[t]hat guy should be in rehab right now.\"  Id. \r\nWhen arrested, Arahovites said, Pendleton \"had coke all over his\r\nface, from the tip of his chin to his eyebrows,\" unlike \"[a] first-\r\ntime user [who] would not have had it all over his face.\"\r\nThe same article reported Arahovites's claims that he had\r\n\"never made an arrest where there was this much cocaine on a\r\nperson's face,\" and that he had found \"a big bag of cocaine at\r\n[Pendleton's] feet.\"  Id.  Finally, the journalists noted\r\nArahovites's protest that the officers should not be held\r\naccountable for Pendleton's predicament.  In Arahovites's words,\r\n\"[t]hese guys [Pendleton and Pagan] were doing cocaine and they got\r\ncaught.  Period.\"  Id.  Thus, despite the fact that Pendleton \"was\r\nfighting for a school department job\" and \"outside forces [were]\r\nfighting for him to become a teacher,\" he had only himself to blame\r\nif the negative publicity hampered his bid.  Id.\r\nOn August 18, 1994, JBSG terminated Pendleton's\r\nemployment.\r\nII.  THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r\nOn December 19, 1995, Pendleton sued the city of\r\nHaverhill, Arahovites, and Newman in the federal district court. \r\nIn pertinent part, his complaint invoked 42 U.S.C.  1983 (1994)\r\nand claimed that the officers' post-acquittal statements to the\r\npress violated his constitutional rights.  The complaint also\r\nalleged various state-law claims, including counts for defamation,\r\ninfliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, negligence,\r\nnegligent supervision, and malicious interference with employment\r\nrelations.\r\nAfter protracted pretrial discovery, the defendants moved\r\nfor summary judgment.  The district court, ruling from the bench,\r\ngranted brevis disposition (i) in Newman's favor on all claims,\r\n(ii) in Arahovites's and the city's favor with respect to the\r\nsection 1983 claims, and (iii) exercising supplemental\r\njurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C.  1367(c), in the defendants' favor on\r\nall other causes of action save for the defamation claim against\r\nArahovites.\r\nTrial on the surviving count commenced on October 27,\r\n1997.  At the conclusion of the evidence, the court entertained\r\narguments as to whether Pendleton should be deemed a public figure,\r\nand if so, to what extent.  Noting the nature of Pendleton's work\r\nin the public schools, his stature in the Haverhill community, the\r\nfact that charges against him were a matter of public interest, and\r\nhis willingness to \"engage[] in th[e] process of communication in\r\nthe form of a newspaper interview, just as the defendant did,\" the\r\ncourt concluded that Pendleton was a limited-purpose public figure\r\nand instructed the jury accordingly.  The jurors returned a take-\r\nnothing verdict.  This appeal followed.\r\nPendleton now assigns error to the pretrial entry of\r\npartial summary judgment, three evidentiary rulings that occurred\r\nat trial, and the public figure status determination.  We address\r\nhis asseverations in accordance with these groupings.\r\nIII.  THE PRETRIAL RULINGS\r\nThe district court granted summary judgment on seven of\r\nthe enumerated counts lodged in Pendleton's complaint.  Pendleton\r\ndoes not challenge any of them as they pertain to Newman, but he\r\ndoes challenge four of the rulings as they pertain to Arahovites\r\nand Haverhill.  We review these determinations de novo, taking the\r\nfacts as they appeared in the summary judgment record in the light\r\nmost hospitable to Pendleton.  See Elliot v. S.D. Warren Co., 134\r\nF.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\n              A.  The Section 1983 Claims.\r\nSection 1983 \"provides a cause of action when an\r\nindividual, acting under color of state law, deprives a person of\r\nfederally assured rights.\"  Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos,     F.3d    ,\r\n(1st Cir. 1998) [No. 97-2260, slip op. at 7].  Pendleton's\r\nsection 1983 claims hypothesize that Arahovites's scurrilous\r\nstatements to the press led JBSG to discharge Pendleton, thereby\r\ndepriving him of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process\r\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nThe Supreme Court has determined authoritatively that\r\ndefamation, even from the lips of a government actor, does not in\r\nand of itself transgress constitutionally assured rights.  See Paulv. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 700-01 (1976) (establishing that although\r\nstate law may provide a remedy for defamatory statements uttered by\r\na government official, no cognizable constitutional harm ordinarily\r\noccurs).  In an effort to avoid this holding and to state an\r\nactionable section 1983 claim grounded upon defamation, Pendleton\r\nstrives to fit his case into the narrow category of situations that\r\ninvolve more than simple stigmatization.  These precedents discern\r\na deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest\r\nwhen, in addition to mere reputational injury, words spoken by a\r\ngovernment actor adversely impact a right or status previously\r\nenjoyed under state law.  See id. at 708-09; Rodriguez de Quinonezv. Perez, 596 F.2d 486, 489 (1st Cir. 1979); Dennis v. S &amp; S\r\nConsol. Rural High Sch. Dist., 577 F.2d 338, 341 (5th Cir. 1978). \r\nBecause his case juxtaposes slanderous language and loss of\r\nemployment, Pendleton posits that it comes within this \"stigma\r\nplus\" rubric.  The district court did not agree.  Nor do we.\r\nIn the first place, to achieve a sufficient \"plus\" in a\r\nloss-of-job context, words spoken must be \"uttered incident to the\r\ntermination.\"  Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 234 (1991).  Here,\r\nhowever, the alleged defamation and the decision to cashier\r\nPendleton came from two separate, unrelated sources, and the former\r\ncannot plausibly be said to have occurred \"incident to\" the latter. \r\nAs such, the allegedly defamatory remarks cannot be viewed as\r\nworking a denial of a previously recognized right or status.\r\nIn the second place, a violation of constitutional\r\nproportions under a \"stigma plus\" theory exists only if, and to the\r\nextent that, the opportunities lost are government benefices denied\r\nas a result of governmental action.  See Paul, 424 U.S. at 708-09;\r\nRodriguez de Quinonez, 596 F.2d at 489.  Pendleton's claim founders\r\non these shoals:  he worked for a non-governmental employer and\r\nlost a private (not a public) position.  Although JBSG receives\r\nsome financial assistance from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\r\nand operates within the public school system, it is not an arm of\r\nthe state.  See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 840 (1982).\r\nTo the extent that Pendleton asserts section 1983 claims\r\napart from his claim that Arahovites deprived him of a liberty\r\ninterest, we dismiss them out of hand.  Some of these claims (e.g.,\r\nhis allegations that the officers falsified their reports and acted\r\nout of racial animus) are simply unsupported by the evidence. \r\nOthers (e.g., Pendleton's assertion that his federal civil rights\r\nwere violated because Arahovites spoke out in contravention of\r\ndepartmental rules) are legally impuissant.  See, e.g., Snowden v.\r\nHughes, 321 U.S. 1, 11 (1944); Colon v. Schneider, 899 F.2d 660,\r\n672 (7th Cir. 1990).  Finally, in the absence of individual\r\nliability on any officer's part, Pendleton's counterpart section\r\n1983 claims against Haverhill, as the officers' municipal employer,\r\ncannot succeed.  See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469,\r\n480 (1986); Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1039 (1st Cir. 1996),\r\ncert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1693 (1997).\r\n                  B.  The Tort Claims.\r\nOn appeal, Pendleton concedes the propriety of summary\r\njudgment on many of his state-law tort claims, but challenges the\r\nrejection of his claims for negligence, invasion of privacy, and\r\nmalicious interference with employment relations.  The subject\r\nwarrants scant comment.\r\nTo prevail on a negligence claim under Massachusetts law,\r\na plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant owed him a duty, (2)\r\nthat the defendant breached the duty, and (3) that the breach\r\ncaused the plaintiff's injuries.  See Cannon v. Sears, Roebuck &amp;\r\nCo., 374 N.E.2d 582, 584 (Mass. 1978).  In this case, Pendleton\r\nconclusorily attributed the loss of his employment to Arahovites's\r\nremarks, but he did not produce evidence at the summary judgment\r\nstage sufficient to permit a finding that these remarks prompted\r\nJBSG to fire him.  Absent such evidence, his claim is untenable. \r\nSee, e.g., Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc., 670 N.E.2d 383,\r\n385-86 (Mass. 1996).\r\nPendleton's malicious interference claim suffers from the\r\nsame defect.  And, moreover, Pendleton failed to proffer any\r\nevidence related to another essential element of this claim; the\r\nsummary judgment record contains no proof that Arahovites knowingly\r\nattempted to induce JBSG to act.  See G.S. Enters., Inc. v.\r\nFalmouth Marine, Inc., 571 N.E.2d 1363, 1369 (Mass. 1991).\r\nThe privacy claim is no more substantial.  Pendleton\r\nnever identified the specific statements that supposedly intrude\r\nupon his privacy, nor can we glean the essentials of an actionable\r\nclaim from the summary judgment record.  Massachusetts law\r\nprohibits unreasonable public disclosure of private information. \r\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 214,  1B; see also Bratt v. International\r\nBus. Mach. Corp., 467 N.E.2d 126, 134 (Mass. 1984).  But this does\r\nnot profit Pendleton because neither Arahovites's descriptions nor\r\nperceptions of Pendleton's conduct in a public place constitute\r\nprivate information.  See generally United States v. Dionisio, 410\r\nU.S. 1, 14 (1973) (concluding that there is no reasonable\r\nexpectation of privacy in one's appearance); Brown v. Hearst Corp.,\r\n862 F. Supp. 622, 631 (D. Mass. 1994) (explaining that there can be\r\nno expectation of privacy vis--vis information that has already\r\nfiltered into the public domain), aff'd, 54 F.3d 21 (1st Cir.\r\n1995); Whirty v. Lynch, 539 N.E.2d 1064, 1065 (Mass. App. Ct. 1989)\r\n(sanctioning release of information pertaining to plaintiff's\r\ncriminal background).  The cases upon which Pendleton relies in his\r\nstruggle to reach a contrary result are plainly distinguishable\r\nbecause they deal with quintessentially private information.  See,\r\ne.g., Pressman v. Brigham Med. Group Found., Inc., 919 F. Supp.\r\n516, 524 (D. Mass. 1996) (medical information); Gauthier v. Police\r\nComm'r, 557 N.E.2d 1374, 1376 (Mass. 1990) (toxicology results).\r\nIV.  THE EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\r\nPendleton challenges three evidentiary rulings.  Two of\r\nthese relate to the exclusion of evidence and the third relates to\r\nthe admission of evidence.  In each instance, we review the\r\ndistrict court's determination for abuse of discretion.  SeeWilliams v. Drake,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1998) [No. 98-1014,\r\nslip op. at 5]; Blinzler v. Marriot Int'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).\r\n            A.  Negative Drug Test Results.\r\nAt trial, Pendleton sought to introduce evidence that he\r\ntested negative for drugs on the Tuesday following his Friday night\r\narrest.  Arahovites objected on relevancy grounds.  Judge O'Toole\r\ncalled counsel to the bench and asked Pendleton's lawyer what the\r\njury could conclude from this evidence.  Counsel replied that the\r\nevidence tended to show that \"he [Pendleton] doesn't have a drug\r\nproblem.\"  The judge then asked the lawyer:  \"Is it evidence that\r\n[Pendleton] did not ingest any amount of cocaine on Friday night?\" \r\nThe lawyer responded in the negative.  After a further colloquy,\r\nthe judge ruled that Pendleton could show \"the fact of the test\"\r\nand that he voluntarily arranged for it, but not the results.\r\nWe discern no misuse of discretion in the trial court's\r\nexclusion of the test results.  Relevant evidence is \"evidence\r\nhaving any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\nconsequence to the determination of the action more or less\r\nprobable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid.\r\n401.  Since   as Pendleton readily admits   a negative test result\r\non Tuesday lacks probative value as to whether Pendleton was using\r\ncocaine on the previous Friday, the court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in ruling that the test results were irrelevant to\r\nArahovites's statements about Pendleton's cocaine use on the night\r\nof the arrest.  See, e.g., United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67 F.3d\r\n1002, 1016 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 1558 (1996);\r\nUnited States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 444 (1st Cir. 1994); seealso Fed. R. Evid. 402. \r\nIn this venue, Pendleton embroiders his argument,\r\ncontending that he should have been allowed to introduce the\r\nnegative test results as evidence tending to disprove Arahovites's\r\ngeneral suggestion that Pendleton had a drug problem.  We disagree. \r\nEven if the officer's opinion could be construed as defamatory   a\r\nmatter on which we take no view, see Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l,\r\nLtd., 840 F.2d 1012, 1016 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"If the challenged\r\nstatement is one of opinion rather than fact, then under the First\r\nAmendment, it generally cannot give rise to a defamation claim.\")\r\nthe proffered evidence does not prove or disprove whether\r\nPendleton regularly used drugs.  At most, it establishes that\r\nPendleton had no drugs in his bloodstream at the time the test was\r\nadministered (and, perhaps, that he had not used drugs immediately\r\nprior thereto).  These are topics that Arahovites did not broach in\r\nhis allegedly defamatory comments.\r\n      B.  Police Department Rules and Regulations.\r\nPendleton next challenges the trial court's decision to\r\nexclude the testimony of Deputy Chief Shea, who Pendleton sought to\r\nquestion about the Haverhill police department's rules regarding\r\ndissemination of information to the press.  Pendleton offered\r\nShea's testimony to assist in establishing malice.  Specifically,\r\nPendleton's counsel told the court that this testimony would show\r\n\"how deeply [Arahovites] felt about [speaking out], how much he\r\nwanted to do it, that he would violate all of these rules\" against\r\ntalking to the press.\r\nThis iteration of relevancy misapprehends the concept of\r\n\"actual malice\" in defamation law.  In the defamation context,\r\n\"malice\" does not relate to the defendant's motive for speaking, or\r\neven to whether the defendant made the challenged statement out of\r\nill-will.  Rather, \"malice\" for this purpose requires proof that\r\nthe speaker published the statement with knowledge of its falsity\r\nor with reckless disregard as to whether it was false.  See St.\r\nAmant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968); Milgroom v. News Group\r\nBoston, Inc., 586 N.E.2d 985, 987 (Mass. 1992).  Pendleton did not\r\noffer Shea's testimony for any purpose bearing on these issues,\r\nbut, rather, according to his offer of proof, in an endeavor to\r\nlink evidence of rule violations to Arahovites's motive for having\r\nmade the allegedly defamatory statements.  Motive, however, is not\r\nan element of a defamation claim under Massachusetts law.  SeeMcAvoy v. Shufrin, 518 N.E.2d 513, 517 (Mass. 1988).  Hence, the\r\ntrial court properly sustained Arahovites's objection.\r\n             C.  The Second Bag of Cocaine.\r\nDuring Arahovites's direct examination, the following\r\nsnippet of testimony emerged:\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL:  Do you know what evidence\r\nwas obtained at the time of the arrest of Mr.\r\nPendleton by you or Officer Newman?\r\n\nARAHOVITES:  Yes.\r\n\nDEFENSE COUNSEL:  What was it?\r\n\nARAHOVITES:  The bag of cocaine   there was\r\none bag of cocaine that was found in the car\r\nthat was charged to Mr. Pendleton, and there\r\nwas another bag of cocaine that was found in\r\nthe back seat of our police cruiser. . . . \r\nThere was another bag of cocaine that came\r\nfrom Mr. Pagan that was in the back seat of\r\nour cruiser.\r\n\nPendleton objected to this testimony on relevancy grounds and\r\nargues here that evidence regarding the second bag of cocaine was\r\nboth irrelevant and prejudicial.  He is half-right:  the evidence\r\nwas irrelevant and the objection should have been sustained.\r\nPendleton is also half-wrong:  the error was benign.  The\r\nsecond bag of cocaine was mentioned to the jury only once.  In\r\nthat passage, quoted above, Arahovites made it crystal clear that\r\nthe second bag belonged to Pagan, not Pendleton.  This fact\r\ndovetailed with   and arguably bolstered   Pendleton's assertion\r\nthat Pagan was the drug user and that he (Pendleton) was merely an\r\ninnocent bystander.  Under the circumstances, we conclude that the\r\nerror in permitting Arahovites's statement to stand was harmless\r\nand does not warrant a new trial.  See United States v. Ladd, 885\r\nF.2d 954, 957 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 61.\r\nV.  THE STATUS DETERMINATION\r\nThe principal issue on appeal concerns the correctness of\r\nthe lower court's determination that Pendleton was a limited-\r\npurpose public figure.  Pendleton challenges both the judge's\r\nauthority to make this determination (rather than submit the\r\nquestion to the jury) and the substance of the determination\r\nitself.  We subdivide our analysis into three segments, plotting\r\nthe legal landscape and tackling Pendleton's procedural point\r\nbefore grappling with the merits.\r\n                A.  The Legal Landscape.\r\nIn an effort to strike a balance between First Amendment\r\nfreedoms and state defamation laws, our jurisprudence accords\r\ndecretory significance to the status of each individual plaintiff. \r\nUnder the taxonomy developed by the Supreme Court, private\r\nplaintiffs can succeed in defamation actions on a state-set\r\nstandard of proof (typically, negligence), whereas the Constitution\r\nimposes a higher hurdle for public figures and requires them to\r\nprove actual malice.  See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S.\r\n323, 342-48 (1974); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254,\r\n283 (1964); Kassel v. Gannett Co., 875 F.2d 935, 938 (1st Cir.\r\n1989); Bruno &amp; Stillman, Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 633 F.2d 583,\r\n586-88 (1st Cir. 1980).  We briefly summarize the evolution of the\r\nlaw in this area.\r\nIn 1964, the Court considered for the first time the\r\nissue of \"the extent to which the constitutional protections for\r\nspeech and press limit a State's power to award damages in a libel\r\naction brought by a public official against critics of his official\r\nconduct.\"  New York Times, 376 U.S. at 256.  Due in large part to\r\nthe \"profound national commitment to the principle that debate on\r\npublic issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\" id. at\r\n270, the Court concluded that even falsehoods are entitled to some\r\nconstitutional protection when directed at public officials, seeid. at 282-83 &amp; n.21.  Thus, the Constitution does not allow a\r\npublic official to recover damages for defamation unless he\r\nestablishes with \"convincing clarity\" that the defamatory\r\nstatements were published with \"actual malice.\"  Id. at 285-86.\r\nTwo years later, the Court found occasion to consider who\r\nqualified as a \"public official\" for the purpose of applying the\r\nNew York Times rule.  In Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75, 85\r\n(1966), the Justices held that \"the 'public official' designation\r\napplies at the very least to those among the hierarchy of\r\ngovernment employees who have, or appear to the public to have,\r\nsubstantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of\r\ngovernmental affairs.\"  At base, the designation covers those\r\ngovernment employees in positions that \"would invite public\r\nscrutiny and discussion of the person holding [them], entirely\r\napart from the scrutiny and discussion occasioned by [any]\r\nparticular charges in controversy.\"  Id. at 86 n.13.\r\nDuring its next term, the Court extended the New York\r\nTimes rule to defamation cases in which the plaintiff, though not\r\na government official, was a \"public figure.\"  Curtis Pub. Co. v.\r\nButts, 388 U.S. 130, 155 (1967).  The Justices considered public\r\nfigures to be those who \"commanded sufficient public interest and\r\nhad sufficient access to the means of counterargument to be able to\r\nexpose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies of the\r\ndefamatory statements.\"  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).\r\nAfter some short-lived experimentation, see, e.g.,\r\nRosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U.S. 29, 43-44 (1971), the\r\nCourt settled on a defamation model that ties the constitutionally\r\nrequired showing in a defamation action to the plaintiff's status. \r\nIt contemplated that \"public figure\" status usually would arise in\r\none of two ways:  (1) when persons \"assume[] roles of especial\r\nprominence in the affairs of society,\" perhaps by occupying\r\npositions of \"persuasive power and influence,\" or (2) when persons\r\n\"thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public\r\ncontroversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues\r\ninvolved.\"  Gertz, 418 U.S. at 345.  The Court noted, however,\r\nthat not all public figures are equal:  an individual who achieves\r\n\"pervasive fame or notoriety,\" or otherwise comes within the first\r\ncategory, is deemed a public figure for all purposes, whereas an\r\nindividual who dives headfirst into troubled waters, or otherwise\r\ncomes within the second category, \"becomes a public figure only for\r\na limited range of issues.\"  Id. at 351.  That range is identified\r\n\"by looking to the nature and extent of an individual's\r\nparticipation in the particular controversy giving rise to the\r\ndefamation.\"  Id. at 352.\r\n                   B.  Judge or Jury.\r\nTurning from the general to the particular, we first mull\r\nPendleton's claim that Judge O'Toole usurped the jury's province by\r\nmaking the public figure determination himself.  In addressing this\r\nissue, we do not write on a pristine page.  The Rosenblatt Court\r\ndeclared that \"it is for the trial judge in the first instance to\r\ndetermine whether the proofs show [the plaintiff] to be a 'public\r\nofficial,'\" 383 U.S. at 88, and it explained that ceding this\r\nresponsibility to the bench reduced the chance that jurors might\r\n\"use the cloak of a general verdict to punish unpopular ideas or\r\nspeakers,\" id. at 88 n.15.  Extrapolating from this pronouncement,\r\na number of federal courts (including this one) have treated First\r\nAmendment status determinations as grist for the court's   not the\r\njury's   mill.  See, e.g., Lundell Mfg. Co. v. American Broad.\r\nCos., 98 F.3d 351, 362 (8th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct.\r\n1470 (1997); Reuber v. Food Chem. News, Inc., 925 F.2d 703, 708\r\n(4th Cir. 1991); Marcone v. Penthouse Int'l Mag. for Men, 754 F.2d\r\n1072, 1081 n.4 (3d Cir. 1985); Rebozo v. Washington Post Co., 637\r\nF.2d 375, 379 (5th Cir. 1981); Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publs., Inc.,\r\n627 F.2d 1287, 1293 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1980); see also Penobscot\r\nIndian Nation v. Key Bank, 112 F.3d 538, 561 (1st Cir.) (describing\r\n\"public figure status\" as presenting \"a question of law,\"\r\nnotwithstanding that it \"necessitates a detailed fact-sensitive\r\ndetermination\"), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 297 (1997).\r\nIgnoring these authorities, Pendleton exhorts us to adopt\r\nthe more particularized interpretation of the Rosenblatt rule\r\nexplicated in Stone v. Essex County Newspapers, Inc., 330 N.E.2d\r\n161 (Mass. 1975).  Using Stone as a talisman, he insists that a\r\ncourt may make the public figure determination only if the facts\r\nbearing thereon are uncontroverted.  Building on this foundation,\r\nPendleton then asserts that the public figure question in this case\r\nshould have been submitted to the jury because the parties\r\ndisagreed as to whether Pendleton injected himself into a public\r\ncontroversy to such an extent that he became a limited-purpose\r\npublic figure.\r\nWe reject Pendleton's importuning.  The principal problem\r\nwith his argument is that it assumes (wrongly, we believe) that the\r\nquestion of whether a person is sufficiently entangled in a public\r\ncontroversy to qualify him as a limited-purpose public figure is\r\nfor the jury.  That question is of constitutional dimension and,\r\nthus, federal law controls.  Consistent with the federal precedents\r\nassembled above, which illustrate that the status issue is treated\r\nin federal defamation jurisprudence as a question of law, we hold\r\nthat the question of whether a defamation plaintiff is a public\r\nfigure is properly resolved by the court, not by the jury,\r\nregardless of the contestability of the predicate facts.\r\nIn this case, moreover, all roads lead to Rome.  The\r\nrecord reveals complete accord as to who Pendleton was and what he\r\ndid and said both before and after the events of May 27, 1994. \r\nThere is no conflict as to any material fact; the issue is whether\r\nthe discerned facts suffice to establish that Pendleton acted in a\r\nway sufficient to make him a public figure for the purpose of this\r\ndefamation action (say, by previously achieving pervasive fame and\r\nnotoriety, or by injecting himself into a public controversy).  We\r\nhave no doubt that this archetypical legal question is exactly the\r\nsort of inquiry that the Rosenblatt Court intended the judge to\r\nhandle.  Hence, the trial court did not err in ruling directly on\r\nthe public figure question.\r\n                C.  Pendleton's Status.\r\nWe turn now to the efficacy of Judge O'Toole's\r\ndetermination that Pendleton, although not a public official, was\r\na limited-purpose public figure.  As with other questions of law,\r\nwe afford plenary review to this determination.  See McCarthy v.\r\nAzure, 22 F.3d 351, 354 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nSome of the arguments advanced in support of the\r\nproposition that Pendleton was a limited-purpose public figure are\r\ncanards.  It is by now apodictic that an individual's involvement\r\nin a criminal proceeding   even one that attracts substantial\r\nnotoriety   is not enough, in itself, to ingeminate public figure\r\nstatus.  See Wolston v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, 443 U.S. 157, 168\r\n(1979).  By like token, one does not become a public figure merely\r\nby defending oneself publicly against accusations.  See Time, Inc.v. Firestone, 424 U.S. 448, 454 n.3 (1976); Foretich v. Capital\r\nCities/ABC, Inc., 37 F.3d 1541, 1558 (4th Cir. 1994).  Finally,\r\nArahovites's claim that Pendleton achieved pervasive fame as a\r\nsports star at Haverhill High School two decades ago and retains\r\nthat celebrity to this day elevates hope over reason.  The passage\r\nof time obviously diluted whatever fame the now forty-something-\r\nyear-old Pendleton had acquired during his adolescent heyday.\r\nThese false starts notwithstanding, we glean from the\r\nappellees' briefs and the trial court's bench decision several\r\nother suggested bases on which the court's decision arguably might\r\nrest.  Rather than canvassing the universe of possibilities, we\r\nproceed directly to the strongest argument in support of this\r\ndetermination, mindful that an appellate court possesses the power\r\nto affirm a lower court's rulings of law on any independent ground\r\nmade manifest by the record.  See Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex,\r\nInc., 827 F.2d 859, 860-61 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\nIn mid-1993, Pendleton effectively announced his\r\ncandidacy to become a permanent teacher within the Haverhill school\r\nsystem.  He proclaimed as much in a newspaper story (entitled\r\n\"Black Teacher Has Grown Impatient Awaiting A Chance\") that\r\nfeatured him and his aspiration.  Although the record is bereft of\r\ninformation regarding the genesis of this published profile, the\r\narticle speaks eloquently for itself.\r\nIts author, Anita Perkins, describes a school system\r\nemploying 480 full-time teachers, only 15 of whom are minorities,\r\nto instruct 7,500 pupils, approximately 1,050 of whom are\r\nminorities.  Perkins reports Pendleton's avowal that the Haverhill\r\nschool system, in which minorities account for 14% of the student\r\nbody but only 3% of the faculty, is not taking appropriate steps to\r\nincrease the number of minority instructors.  In Pendleton's\r\nopinion, \"school officials are not making minority hirings a\r\npriority,\"    a failing that he says leaves minority students\r\nwithout suitable role models.\r\nThe gist of the article is that Pendleton, a Haverhill\r\nnative with a degree from the University of Massachusetts and ample\r\nexperience working with Haverhill youths, should be given a\r\nteaching opportunity.  Perkins discusses Pendleton's \"lifelong\r\ndream of teaching in the schools that gave him and his family so\r\nmuch,\" and explains that, despite completing two years as a\r\nsubstitute teacher in a Haverhill school, \"three attempts to land\r\na really permanent position in the city schools failed.\"  The\r\narticle concludes with Pendleton's poignant lament:  \"I am tired of\r\nsubstitute teaching.  I just want a chance to show my\r\nqualifications.\"\r\nIn addition to conveying Pendleton's views, Perkins\r\nreported that, following a recent spate of racially tinged\r\nincidents at Haverhill High School, students of all hues \"called\r\nfor more minority teachers, a recommendation school officials said\r\nthey would heed.\"  This, and similar statements in the article,\r\nmake it transparently clear that the racial attributes of the\r\nteacher-pupil mix by then had become a matter of public concern. \r\nThis circumstance possesses great significance for a First\r\nAmendment analysis:  by granting an interview to Perkins and\r\nlobbying for a permanent teaching post at a time when the racial\r\ncomposition of the public school faculty had become a matter of\r\nintense interest in the community, Pendleton invited public\r\nscrutiny of the qualities that equipped him to teach in the\r\nHaverhill school system.  Accordingly, he became a public figure\r\nfor that limited purpose.\r\nWe base this conclusion, in part, on the case law\r\nconcerning candidates for public office.  Monitor Patriot Co. v.\r\nRoy, 401 U.S. 265 (1971), involved a claim that a newspaper was\r\nliable for erroneously reporting that a senatorial candidate was a\r\n\"former small-time bootlegger.\"  Id. at 266.  The candidate sued,\r\nmaintaining that he need not prove actual malice because he had\r\nnever held a public office.  The Court demurred, holding that\r\n\"publications concerning candidates must be accorded at least as\r\nmuch protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments as those\r\nconcerning occupants of public office.\"  Id. at 271.  In a\r\ncompanion case decided the same day, the Court reiterated its\r\nconclusion that candidates for public office   there, a candidate\r\nfor a position as a county tax assessor   fall within the purview\r\nof the New York Times rule.  See Ocala Star-Mirror Co. v. Damron,\r\n401 U.S. 295, 299 (1971).\r\nWe believe that, by analogy, these holdings are\r\ninstructive in respect to the circumstances at bar.  Of course,\r\nunlike the candidates in Monitor Patriot and Ocala Star-Mirror,\r\nPendleton was not running for an elected political office   but it\r\nis at least arguable that if a person holds (or aspires to hold)\r\nany public post which entails control over matters of substantial\r\npublic concern, then his qualifications for serving in that\r\ncapacity are likely to engender the type of public debate and\r\ndiscussion that the First Amendment protects.  See Rosenblatt, 383\r\nU.S. at 85-86.  After all, the Court's defamation jurisprudence\r\nmakes no distinction between government officials who are selected\r\nby the voters and those who are selected in other ways, and logic\r\nsuggests that it is the status of the official, not the manner in\r\nwhich he attains (or hopes to attain) the office, that is the key\r\ndeterminant of the extent to which state defamation law can be\r\nallowed to curb free discussion.\r\nHere, however, we need not rely solely on this rationale. \r\nThe Perkins article leaves no doubt that an independent public\r\ncontroversy existed within Haverhill regarding the need to increase\r\nminority faculty representation and the adequacy of the measures\r\nemployed by school officials to that end.  Pendleton voluntarily\r\ninjected himself into this preexisting controversy in at least\r\nthree ways:  by making (and authorizing the publication of)\r\nstatements bearing on the issue; by airing his qualifications in a\r\nmanner calculated to suggest that hiring him would ameliorate the\r\nproblem; and by seeking to influence public opinion not only on the\r\ndesirability of more minority hires, but also on the virtues of his\r\nown candidacy for such employment.  In short, when Pendleton\r\nstated, \"I just want a chance to show my qualifications,\" he\r\ninvited public debate both on the general issue of minority\r\nrepresentation and on the specific characteristics that made him\r\nsuitable (or not) for a teaching position.\r\nWe think that this conclusion comports comfortably with\r\nthe teachings of Gertz.  Pendleton had \"access to the channels of\r\neffective communication,\" 418 U.S. at 344, as evidenced by the fact\r\nthat his arrest on cocaine charges made the front page of both the\r\nGazette and the Eagle-Tribune well prior to the uproar over his\r\nexoneration.  Similarly, the Gertz Court's statement that \"[a]n\r\nindividual who decides to seek governmental office must accept\r\ncertain necessary consequences of that involvement in public\r\naffairs,\" among them, \"the risk of closer public scrutiny than\r\nmight otherwise be the case,\" 418 U.S. at 344, informs our\r\nassessment.\r\nTo be sure, there may be a temporal dimension to any\r\n\"limited-purpose public figure\" analysis.  Intuitively, one should\r\nnot become fair game for eternity merely by injecting oneself into\r\nthe debate of the moment.  Cf. Rosenblatt, 383 U.S. at 87 n.14\r\n(hypothesizing that \"there may be cases where a person is so far\r\nremoved from a former position of authority that comment on the\r\nmanner in which he performed his responsibilities no longer has the\r\ninterest necessary to justify [applying] the New York Times rule\"). \r\nThe case law, however, tends to contradict this intuition.  SeeAlan Kaminsky, Note, Defamation Law:  Once A Public Figure Always\r\nA Public Figure?, 10 Hofstra L. Rev. 803, 812-13 (1982) (collecting\r\ncases).  Yet, we need not probe this point, for the temporal link\r\nin this instance is more than adequate.  Perkins's article\r\nespousing Pendleton's qualifications appeared in August 1993, less\r\nthan a year before the utterances that are the subject of this\r\nsuit.  There is no evidence that, in the interim, the controversy\r\nabout minority faculty representation had subsided or that\r\nPendleton had abandoned his quest for a permanent teaching\r\nposition.\r\nUnder the circumstances, Pendleton became a limited-\r\npurpose public figure whose alleged peccadilloes, even if falsely\r\nportrayed, were fair game in the absence of actual malice. \r\nConsequently, those with information bearing on Pendleton's\r\nqualifications for a teaching position should not be punished for\r\nspeaking out, absent evidence that they knowingly or recklessly\r\ndisseminated falsehoods.  It follows that, because Arahovites's\r\nallegedly defamatory statements relate directly to Pendleton's\r\nqualifications for the public position to which he aspired and by\r\nextension to the controversy which swirled around that position   \r\na controversy into which Pendleton had thrust himself   the\r\ndistrict court correctly applied the New York Times rule.  Cf.Monitor Patriot, 401 U.S. at 277 (holding \"as a matter of\r\nconstitutional law that a charge of criminal conduct . . . can\r\nnever be irrelevant to an official's or candidate's fitness for\r\noffice\").\r\nLet us be perfectly clear.  Our conclusion here, as in\r\nmost public figure cases, is factbound and restricted to the\r\nspecific circumstances revealed in the record.  See Bruno &amp;\r\nStillman, 633 F.2d at 589 (explaining that \"particularized\r\ndeterminations of public figure status are the rule\").  We are\r\naware of the scholarly debate surrounding teacher status in the\r\ndefamation context, see generally Eugene C. Bjorklun, Are Teachers\r\nPublic Officials For Defamation Purposes?, 80 West Ed. L. Rep. 527\r\n(1993); Richard E. Johnson, No More Teachers' Dirty Looks   Now\r\nThey Sue:  An Analysis Of Plaintiff Status Determinations In\r\nDefamation Actions By Public Educators, 17 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 761\r\n(1990); Peter S. Cane, Note, Defamation Of Teachers:  Behind The\r\nTimes?, 56 Fordham L. Rev. 1191 (1988), and we leave that ramified\r\ninquiry for another day.  To resolve the case at hand, it is\r\nunnecessary for us to hold that teachers are public figures for all\r\npurposes or that each and every applicant for a teaching post is to\r\nbe deemed a public figure.  What we do hold is that when an\r\nindividual freely comments on a community controversy that he views\r\nas precluding his ascension to a government office (such as that of\r\npublic school teacher) and puts his qualifications into the public\r\nrealm in a manner that suggests that he is trying to influence\r\npublic opinion, he becomes a public figure for the purpose of\r\ndiscussions regarding his fitness for the office.\r\nWe need go no further.  Pendleton made himself a public\r\nfigure by voluntarily stepping into the midst of an ongoing\r\ncontroversy and inviting the citizenry to judge his bid to become\r\na teacher.  Having extended that invitation, he assumed the risk\r\nthat the ensuing discourse might contain errors of fact   errors\r\nfor which the speakers, in the absence of a showing of actual\r\nmalice, could not be held liable.  Hence, the court below did not\r\nerr in requiring Pendleton to prove actual malice as an element of\r\nhis defamation action.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

THE PREDICATE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Toney Pendleton, an African American in his mid-forties, hails from Haverhill, Massachusetts.

Although he worked as a substitute teacher from time to time, he progressed no further.  In August 1993, he vented his frustration to a reporter, Anita Perkins, who found considerable irony in Pendleton's inability to secure a permanent teaching position notwithstanding a student-led outcry for a more diverse public school faculty.  She wrote an article to that effect in the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune, a newspaper serving the Haverhill area.  See Anita Perkins, Black Teacher Has Grown Impatient Awaiting A Chance, Eagle-Trib., Aug. 17, 1993, at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perkins's article profiled Pendleton and described his family, educational background, career aspirations, temporary teaching assignments, and his trepidation that school officials were not giving appropriate priority to minority hires.  Reflecting on his experience as an African-American student in the Haverhill schools, Pendleton was quoted as saying:  \"Twenty years later things are still the same.\"   He also was quoted as asking, rhetorically:  \"How can you expect a black child who is called a 'n_____' to go to a white counselor and teacher with his feelings?\"   The article commented on the dearth of minority teachers in the Haverhill schools, described some of the steps that Haverhill had taken to increase minority representation within the school system, and concluded with Pendleton's plaintive comment:  \"I'm tired of substitute teaching.  I just want a chance to show my qualifications.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That fall, Pendleton accepted a Haverhill-based position as a vocational counselor with Jobs For Bay State Graduates, Inc.  (JBSG), a private, nonprofit organization.  JBSG counselors advise public school students who do not plan to attend college about career opportunities.  Pendleton held this job at the time of his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>B. Arrest and Prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of May 27, 1994, Pendleton parked his car on a busy, well-lit street in his home town, ran some errands, and then repaired to a local tavern.  At some point, Arnaldo Pagan, a boyhood friend, asked Pendleton to give him a ride home.  After Pagan grew increasingly insistent, Pendleton acquiesced.  The two men then proceeded to Pendleton's automobile.  The vehicle was still parked when two Haverhill policemen on routine neighborhood patrol shined a flashlight into it.  The officers, John Arahovites and Lawrence Newman, claimed that \"two heads popped up\" from behind the dashboard and that they noticed a powdery substance on Pendleton's face.  Upon further investigation, the officers observed powder on Pagan's lap and throughout the car's interior.  They also saw a small bag containing what appeared to be cocaine on the floor of the vehicle.  Based on these observations, the gendarmes promptly arrested Pendleton and Pagan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton's arrest made front-page news in both the Eagle-Tribune and a competing newspaper, the Haverhill Gazette.  The stories revealed that charges of cocaine possession and conspiracy to violate the drug laws had been brought against Pendleton in the state district court.  The articles described Pendleton as a \"school jobs counselor\" and a \"high school advisor\" who worked in a classroom five days a week with 30 to 40 high-school seniors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton entered a not guilty plea.  At a court hearing on July 12, 1994, he asserted that when Pagan, after entering his vehicle, produced a small plastic bag, he (Pendleton) suspected the bag contained drugs and slapped it out of Pagan's hand.  In turn, this act caused the contents to spill onto Pagan's lap and scatter throughout the car.  In responding to an unrelated inquiry from the court, the prosecutor admitted that, due to a mix-up, the powder seized from Pendleton's car had not been tested.  The judge obviously did not like what he had heard.  He declared Pendleton not guilty and dismissed the charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>C. Subsequent Events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A flurry of media reports followed the case's termination.  In them, the district attorney's office accused the police of bungling the investigation and the police chief responded that delays in laboratory testing are sometimes an inevitable concomitant of the evidence-gathering process.  As part of this coverage, a local reporter interviewed Pendleton and his attorney.  The lawyer theorized that Pendleton had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he now could \"get back to doing ... positive things in the community,\" such as \"helping kids.\"   Bill Burke, Pendleton Tells His Side:  But Did Police Drop The Ball?, Haverhill Gazette, July 14, 1994, at A1. Pendleton asserted that he was \"the happiest guy in America that my innocence has been borne out.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 18, the arresting officers responded to a call from the Eagle-Tribune.  At the newspaper's offices, Arahovites and Newman voiced indignation over the disposition of the charges, emphasizing that they had not been notified about the July 12 proceeding and expressing disappointment that the judge had refused to order Pendleton to undergo drug rehabilitation.  See Bill Cantwell &amp; Eileen Pendleton, Judge's Release Of Suspect Outrages Police, Eagle-Trib., July 18, 1994, at 1. The article quoted Arahovites as saying that the police were \"not trying to crucify Pendleton,\" but \"[t]hat guy should be in rehab right now.\"  Id. When arrested, Arahovites said, Pendleton \"had coke all over his face, from the tip of his chin to his eyebrows,\" unlike \"[a] first-time user [who] would not have had it all over his face.\"The same article reported Arahovites's claims that he had \"never made an arrest where there was this much cocaine on a person's face,\" and that he had found \"a big bag of cocaine at [Pendleton's] feet.\"  Id. Finally, the journalists noted Arahovites's protest that the officers should not be held accountable for Pendleton's predicament.  In Arahovites's words, \"[t]hese guys [Pendleton and Pagan] were doing cocaine and they got caught.  Period.\"  Id.  Thus, despite the fact that Pendleton \"was fighting for a school department job\" and \"outside forces [were] fighting for him to become a teacher,\" he had only himself to blame if the negative publicity hampered his bid.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 18, 1994, JBSG terminated Pendleton's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 19, 1995, Pendleton sued the city of Haverhill, Arahovites, and Newman in the federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In pertinent part, his complaint invoked 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994) and claimed that the officers' post-acquittal statements to the press violated his constitutional rights.  The complaint also alleged various state-law claims, including counts for defamation, infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, negligence, negligent supervision, and malicious interference with employment relations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After protracted pretrial discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment.  The district court, ruling from the bench, granted brevis disposition (i) in Newman's favor on all claims, (ii) in Arahovites's and the city's favor with respect to the section 1983 claims, and (iii) exercising supplemental jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c), in the defendants' favor on all other causes of action save for the defamation claim against Arahovites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial on the surviving count commenced on October 27, 1997.  At the conclusion of the evidence, the court entertained arguments as to whether Pendleton should be deemed a public figure, and if so, to what extent.  Noting the nature of Pendleton's work in the public schools, his stature in the Haverhill community, the fact that charges against him were a matter of public interest, and his willingness to \"engage[ ] in th[e] process of communication in the form of a newspaper interview, just as the defendant did,\" the court concluded that Pendleton was a limited-purpose public figure and instructed the jury accordingly.  The jurors returned a take-nothing verdict.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton now assigns error to the pretrial entry of partial summary judgment, three evidentiary rulings that occurred at trial, and the public figure status determination.  We address his asseverations in accordance with these groupings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE PRETRIAL RULINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on seven of the enumerated counts lodged in Pendleton's complaint.  Pendleton does not challenge any of them as they pertain to Newman, but he does challenge four of the rulings as they pertain to Arahovites and Haverhill.  We review these determinations de novo, taking the facts as they appeared in the summary judgment record in the light most hospitable to Pendleton.  See Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co., 134 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Section 1983</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>Claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1983 \"provides a cause of action when an individual, acting under color of state law, deprives a person of federally assured rights.\"  Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1998).  Pendleton's section 1983 claims hypothesize that Arahovites's scurrilous statements to the press led JBSG to discharge Pendleton, thereby depriving him of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has determined authoritatively that defamation, even from the lips of a government actor, does not in and of itself transgress constitutionally assured rights.  See Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 700-01, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976) (establishing that although state law may provide a remedy for defamatory statements uttered by a government official, no cognizable constitutional harm ordinarily occurs).  In an effort to avoid this holding and to state an actionable section 1983 claim grounded upon defamation, Pendleton strives to fit his case into the narrow category of situations that involve more than simple stigmatization.  These precedents discern a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest when, in addition to mere reputational injury, words spoken by a government actor adversely impact a right or status previously enjoyed under state law.  See id. at 708-09, 96 S.Ct. 1155;  Rodriguez de Quinonez v. Perez, 596 F.2d 486, 489 (1st Cir.1979);  Dennis v. S &amp; S Consol. Rural High Sch. Dist., 577 F.2d 338, 341 (5th Cir.1978).  Because his case juxtaposes slanderous language and loss of employment, Pendleton posits that it comes within this \"stigma plus\" rubric.  The district court did not agree.  Nor do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, to achieve a sufficient \"plus\" in a loss-of-job context, words spoken must be \"uttered incident to the termination.\"  Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 234, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991).  Here, however, the alleged defamation and the decision to cashier Pendleton came from two separate, unrelated sources, and the former cannot plausibly be said to have occurred \"incident to\" the latter.  As such, the allegedly defamatory remarks cannot be viewed as working a denial of a previously recognized right or status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, a violation of constitutional proportions under a \"stigma plus\" theory exists only if, and to the extent that, the opportunities lost are government benefices denied as a result of governmental action.  See Paul, 424 U.S. at 708-09, 96 S.Ct. 1155;  Rodriguez de Quinonez, 596 F.2d at 489.   Pendleton's claim founders on these shoals:  he worked for a non-governmental employer and lost a private (not a public) position.  Although JBSG receives some financial assistance from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and operates within the public school system, it is not an arm of the state.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 840, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Pendleton asserts section 1983 claims apart from his claim that Arahovites deprived him of a liberty interest, we dismiss them out of hand.  Some of these claims (e.g., his allegations that the officers falsified their reports and acted out of racial animus) are simply unsupported by the evidence.  Others (e.g., Pendleton's assertion that his federal civil rights were violated because Arahovites spoke out in contravention of departmental rules) are legally impuissant.  See, e.g., Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 11, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1944);  Colon v. Schneider, 899 F.2d 660, 672 (7th Cir.1990).  Finally, in the absence of individual liability on any officer's part, Pendleton's counterpart section 1983 claims against Haverhill, as the officers' municipal employer, cannot succeed.  See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986);  Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1039 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1693, 137 L.Ed.2d 820 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>B. The Tort Claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Pendleton concedes the propriety of summary judgment on many of his state-law tort claims, but challenges the rejection of his claims for negligence, invasion of privacy, and malicious interference with employment relations.  The subject warrants scant comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on a negligence claim under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant owed him a duty, (2) that the defendant breached the duty, and (3) that the breach caused the plaintiff's injuries.  See Cannon v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 374 Mass. 739, 374 N.E.2d 582, 584 (1978).  In this case, Pendleton conclusorily attributed the loss of his employment to Arahovites's remarks, but he did not produce evidence at the summary judgment stage sufficient to permit a finding that these remarks prompted JBSG to fire him.  Absent such evidence, his claim is untenable.  See, e.g., Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 670 N.E.2d 383, 385-86 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton's malicious interference claim suffers from the same defect.  And, moreover, Pendleton failed to proffer any evidence related to another essential element of this claim;  the summary judgment record contains no proof that Arahovites knowingly attempted to induce JBSG to act.  See G.S. Enters., Inc. v. Falmouth Marine, Inc., 410 Mass. 262, 571 N.E.2d 1363, 1369 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The privacy claim is no more substantial.  Pendleton never identified the specific statements that supposedly intrude upon his privacy, nor can we glean the essentials of an actionable claim from the summary judgment record.  Massachusetts law prohibits unreasonable public disclosure of private information.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws. ch. 214, &#167; 1B;  see also Bratt v. International Bus.  Mach. Corp., 392 Mass. 508, 467 N.E.2d 126, 134 (1984).  But this does not profit Pendleton because neither Arahovites's descriptions nor perceptions of Pendleton's conduct in a public place constitute private information.  See generally United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 14, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973) (concluding that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in one's appearance);  Brown v. Hearst Corp., 862 F.Supp. 622, 631 (D.Mass.1994) (explaining that there can be no expectation of privacy vis-a-vis information that has already filtered into the public domain), aff'd, 54 F.3d 21 (1st Cir.1995);  Whirty v. Lynch, 27 Mass.App.Ct. 498, 539 N.E.2d 1064, 1065 (1989) (sanctioning release of information pertaining to plaintiff's criminal background).  The cases upon which Pendleton relies in his struggle to reach a contrary result are plainly distinguishable because they deal with quintessentially private information.  See, e.g., Pressman v. Brigham Med.  Group Found., Inc., 919 F.Supp. 516, 524 (D.Mass.1996) (medical information);  Gauthier v. Police Comm'r, 408 Mass. 335, 557 N.E.2d 1374, 1376 (1990) (toxicology results).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton challenges three evidentiary rulings.  Two of these relate to the exclusion of evidence and the third relates to the admission of evidence.  In each instance, we review the district court's determination for abuse of discretion.  See Williams v. Drake, 146 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir.1998);  Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>A. Negative Drug Test Results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Pendleton sought to introduce evidence that he tested negative for drugs on the Tuesday following his Friday night arrest.  Arahovites objected on relevancy grounds.  Judge O'Toole called counsel to the bench and asked Pendleton's lawyer what the jury could conclude from this evidence.  Counsel replied that the evidence tended to show that \"he [Pendleton] doesn't have a drug problem.\"   The judge then asked the lawyer:  \"Is it evidence that [Pendleton] did not ingest any amount of cocaine on Friday night?\"   The lawyer responded in the negative.  After a further colloquy, the judge ruled that Pendleton could show \"the fact of the test\" and that he voluntarily arranged for it, but not the results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no misuse of discretion in the trial court's exclusion of the test results.  Relevant evidence is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 401.  Since--as Pendleton readily admits--a negative test result on Tuesday lacks probative value as to whether Pendleton was using cocaine on the previous Friday, the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the test results were irrelevant to Arahovites's statements about Pendleton's cocaine use on the night of the arrest.  See, e.g., United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67 F.3d 1002, 1016 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1162, 116 S.Ct. 1558, 134 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996);  United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 444 (1st Cir.1994);  see also Fed.R.Evid. 402.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, Pendleton embroiders his argument, contending that he should have been allowed to introduce the negative test results as evidence tending to disprove Arahovites's general suggestion that Pendleton had a drug problem.  We disagree.  Even if the officer's opinion could be construed as defamatory--a matter on which we take no view, see Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., 840 F.2d 1012, 1016 (1st Cir.1988) (\"If the challenged statement is one of opinion rather than fact, then under the First Amendment, it generally cannot give rise to a defamation claim.\")--the proffered evidence does not prove or disprove whether Pendleton regularly used drugs.  At most, it establishes that Pendleton had no drugs in his bloodstream at the time the test was administered (and, perhaps, that he had not used drugs immediately prior thereto).  These are topics that Arahovites did not broach in his allegedly defamatory comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>B. Police Department Rules and Regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton next challenges the trial court's decision to exclude the testimony of Deputy Chief Shea, who Pendleton sought to question about the Haverhill police department's rules regarding dissemination of information to the press.  Pendleton offered Shea's testimony to assist in establishing malice.  Specifically, Pendleton's counsel told the court that this testimony would show \"how deeply [Arahovites] felt about [speaking out], how much he wanted to do it, that he would violate all of these rules\" against talking to the press.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This iteration of relevancy misapprehends the concept of \"actual malice\" in defamation law.  In the defamation context, \"malice\" does not relate to the defendant's motive for speaking, or even to whether the defendant made the challenged statement out of ill-will.  Rather, \"malice\" for this purpose requires proof that the speaker published the statement with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard as to whether it was false.  See St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968);  Milgroom v. News Group Boston, Inc., 412 Mass. 9, 586 N.E.2d 985, 987 (1992).  Pendleton did not offer Shea's testimony for any purpose bearing on these issues, but, rather, according to his offer of proof, in an endeavor to link evidence of rule violations to Arahovites's motive for having made the allegedly defamatory statements.  Motive, however, is not an element of a defamation claim under Massachusetts law.  See McAvoy v. Shufrin, 401 Mass. 593, 518 N.E.2d 513, 517 (1988).  Hence, the trial court properly sustained Arahovites's objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>C. The Second Bag of Cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Arahovites's direct examination, the following snippet of testimony emerged:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Do you know what evidence was obtained at the time of the arrest of Mr. Pendleton by you or Officer Newman?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>ARAHOVITES:  Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>DEFENSE COUNSEL:  What was it?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>ARAHOVITES:  The bag of cocaine--there was one bag of cocaine that was found in the car that was charged to Mr. Pendleton, and there was another bag of cocaine that was found in the back seat of our police cruiser....  There was another bag of cocaine that came from Mr. Pagan that was in the back seat of our cruiser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton objected to this testimony on relevancy grounds and argues here that evidence regarding the second bag of cocaine was both irrelevant and prejudicial.  He is half-right: the evidence was irrelevant and the objection should have been sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton is also half-wrong:  the error was benign.  The second bag of cocaine was mentioned to the jury only once.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In that passage, quoted above, Arahovites made it crystal clear that the second bag belonged to Pagan, not Pendleton.  This fact dovetailed with--and arguably bolstered--Pendleton's assertion that Pagan was the drug user and that he (Pendleton) was merely an innocent bystander.  Under the circumstances, we conclude that the error in permitting Arahovites's statement to stand was harmless and does not warrant a new trial.  See United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 957 (1st Cir.1989);  see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE STATUS DETERMINATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal issue on appeal concerns the correctness of the lower court's determination that Pendleton was a limited purpose public figure.  Pendleton challenges both the judge's authority to make this determination (rather than submit the question to the jury) and the substance of the determination itself.  We subdivide our analysis into three segments, plotting the legal landscape and tackling Pendleton's procedural point before grappling with the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>A. The Legal Landscape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to strike a balance between First Amendment freedoms and state defamation laws, our jurisprudence accords decretory significance to the status of each individual plaintiff.  Under the taxonomy developed by the Supreme Court, private plaintiffs can succeed in defamation actions on a state-set standard of proof (typically, negligence), whereas the Constitution imposes a higher hurdle for public figures and requires them to prove actual malice.  See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 342-48, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974);  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 283, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964);  Kassel v. Gannett Co., 875 F.2d 935, 938 (1st Cir.1989);  Bruno &amp; Stillman, Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 633 F.2d 583, 586-88 (1st Cir.1980).  We briefly summarize the evolution of the law in this area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1964, the Court considered for the first time the issue of \"the extent to which the constitutional protections for speech and press limit a State's power to award damages in a libel action brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct.\"  New York Times, 376 U.S. at 256, 84 S.Ct. 710.   Due in large part to the \"profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\" id. at 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, the Court concluded that even falsehoods are entitled to some constitutional protection when directed at public officials, see id. at 282-83 &amp; n. 21, 84 S.Ct. 710.  Thus, the Constitution does not allow a public official to recover damages for defamation unless he establishes with \"convincing clarity\" that the defamatory statements were published with \"actual malice.\"  Id. at 285-86, 84 S.Ct. 710.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years later, the Court found occasion to consider who qualified as a \"public official\" for the purpose of applying the New York Times rule.  In Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75, 85, 86 S.Ct. 669, 15 L.Ed.2d 597 (1966), the Justices held that \"the 'public official' designation applies at the very least to those among the hierarchy of government employees who have, or appear to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs.\"   At base, the designation covers those government employees in positions that \"would invite public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding [them], entirely apart from the scrutiny and discussion occasioned by [any] particular charges in controversy.\"  Id. at 86 n. 13, 86 S.Ct. 669.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During its next term, the Court extended the New York Times rule to defamation cases in which the plaintiff, though not a government official, was a \"public figure.\"  Curtis Pub. Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 155, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967).  The Justices considered public figures to be those who \"commanded sufficient public interest and had sufficient access to the means of counterargument to be able to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies of the defamatory statements.\"  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After some short-lived experimentation, see, e.g., Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U.S. 29, 43-44, 91 S.Ct. 1811, 29 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), the Court settled on a defamation model that ties the constitutionally required showing in a defamation action to the plaintiff's status.  It contemplated that \"public figure\" status usually would arise in one of two ways:  (1) when persons \"assume[ ] roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society,\" perhaps by occupying positions of \"persuasive power and influence,\" or (2) when persons \"thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.\"  Gertz, 418 U.S. at 345, 94 S.Ct. 2997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The Court noted, however, that not all public figures are equal:  an individual who achieves \"pervasive fame or notoriety,\" or otherwise comes within the first category, is deemed a public figure for all purposes, whereas an individual who dives headfirst into troubled waters, or otherwise comes within the second category, \"becomes a public figure only for a limited range of issues.\"  Id. at 351, 94 S.Ct. 2997.   That range is identified \"by looking to the nature and extent of an individual's participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.\"  Id. at 352, 94 S.Ct. 2997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>B. Judge or Jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning from the general to the particular, we first mull Pendleton's claim that Judge O'Toole usurped the jury's province by making the public figure determination himself.  In addressing this issue, we do not write on a pristine page.  The Rosenblatt Court declared that \"it is for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether the proofs show [the plaintiff] to be a 'public official,' \" 383 U.S. at 88, 86 S.Ct. 669, and it explained that ceding this responsibility to the bench reduced the chance that jurors might \"use the cloak of a general verdict to punish unpopular ideas or speakers,\" id. at 88 n. 15, 86 S.Ct. 669.  Extrapolating from this pronouncement, a number of federal courts (including this one) have treated First Amendment status determinations as grist for the court's--not the jury's--mill.  See, e.g., Lundell Mfg. Co. v. American Broad.  Cos., 98 F.3d 351, 362 (8th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1470, 137 L.Ed.2d 683 (1997);  Reuber v. Food Chem.  News, Inc., 925 F.2d 703, 708 (4th Cir.1991);  Marcone v. Penthouse Int'l Mag. for Men, 754 F.2d 1072, 1081 n. 4 (3d Cir.1985);  Rebozo v. Washington Post Co., 637 F.2d 375, 379 (5th Cir.1981);  Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publications, Inc., 627 F.2d 1287, 1293 n. 12 (D.C.Cir.1980);  see also Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, 112 F.3d 538, 561 (1st Cir.1997) (describing \"public figure status\" as presenting \"a question of law,\" notwithstanding that it \"necessitates a detailed fact-sensitive determination\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 297, 139 L.Ed.2d 229 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ignoring these authorities, Pendleton exhorts us to adopt the more particularized interpretation of the Rosenblatt rule explicated in Stone v. Essex County Newspapers, Inc., 367 Mass. 849, 330 N.E.2d 161 (1975).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Using Stone as a talisman, he insists that a court may make the public figure determination only if the facts bearing thereon are uncontroverted.  Building on this foundation, Pendleton then asserts that the public figure question in this case should have been submitted to the jury because the parties disagreed as to whether Pendleton injected himself into a public controversy to such an extent that he became a limited-purpose public figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Pendleton's importuning.  The principal problem with his argument is that it assumes (wrongly, we believe) that the question of whether a person is sufficiently entangled in a public controversy to qualify him as a limited-purpose public figure is for the jury.  That question is of constitutional dimension and, thus, federal law controls.  Consistent with the federal precedents assembled above, which illustrate that the status issue is treated in federal defamation jurisprudence as a question of law, we hold that the question of whether a defamation plaintiff is a public figure is properly resolved by the court, not by the jury, regardless of the contestability of the predicate facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, moreover, all roads lead to Rome.  The record reveals complete accord as to who Pendleton was and what he did and said both before and after the events of May 27, 1994.  There is no conflict as to any material fact;  the issue is whether the discerned facts suffice to establish that Pendleton acted in a way sufficient to make him a public figure for the purpose of this defamation action (say, by previously achieving pervasive fame and notoriety, or by injecting himself into a public controversy).  We have no doubt that this archetypical legal question is exactly the sort of inquiry that the Rosenblatt Court intended the judge to handle.  Hence, the trial court did not err in ruling directly on the public figure question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>C. Pendleton's Status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the efficacy of Judge O'Toole's determination that Pendleton, although not a public official, was a limited-purpose public figure.  As with other questions of law, we afford plenary review to this determination.  See McCarthy v. Azure, 22 F.3d 351, 354 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the arguments advanced in support of the proposition that Pendleton was a limited-purpose public figure are canards.  It is by now apodictic that an individual's involvement in a criminal proceeding--even one that attracts substantial notoriety--is not enough, in itself, to ingeminate public figure status.  See Wolston v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, 443 U.S. 157, 168, 99 S.Ct. 2701, 61 L.Ed.2d 450 (1979).  By like token, one does not become a public figure merely by defending oneself publicly against accusations.  See Time, Inc. v. Firestone, 424 U.S. 448, 454 n. 3, 96 S.Ct. 958, 47 L.Ed.2d 154 (1976);  Foretich v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 37 F.3d 1541, 1558 (4th Cir.1994).  Finally, Arahovites's claim that Pendleton achieved pervasive fame as a sports star at Haverhill High School two decades ago and retains that celebrity to this day elevates hope over reason.  The passage of time obviously diluted whatever fame the now forty-something-year-old Pendleton had acquired during his adolescent heyday.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These false starts notwithstanding, we glean from the appellees' briefs and the trial court's bench decision several other suggested bases on which the court's decision arguably might rest.  Rather than canvassing the universe of possibilities, we proceed directly to the strongest argument in support of this determination, mindful that an appellate court possesses the power to affirm a lower court's rulings of law on any independent ground made manifest by the record.  See Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., 827 F.2d 859, 860-61 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1993, Pendleton effectively announced his candidacy to become a permanent teacher within the Haverhill school system.  He proclaimed as much in a newspaper story (entitled \"Black Teacher Has Grown Impatient Awaiting A Chance\") that featured him and his aspiration.  Although the record is bereft of information regarding the genesis of this published profile, the article speaks eloquently for itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Its author, Anita Perkins, describes a school system employing 480 full-time teachers, only 15 of whom are minorities, to instruct 7,500 pupils, approximately 1,050 of whom are minorities.  Perkins reports Pendleton's avowal that the Haverhill school system, in which minorities account for 14% of the student body but only 3% of the faculty, is not taking appropriate steps to increase the number of minority instructors.  In Pendleton's opinion, \"school officials are not making minority hirings a priority,\"--a failing that he says leaves minority students without suitable role models.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of the article is that Pendleton, a Haverhill native with a degree from the University of Massachusetts and ample experience working with Haverhill youths, should be given a teaching opportunity.  Perkins discusses Pendleton's \"lifelong dream of teaching in the schools that gave him and his family so much,\" and explains that, despite completing two years as a substitute teacher in a Haverhill school, \"three attempts to land a really permanent position in the city schools failed.\"   The article concludes with Pendleton's poignant lament:  \"I am tired of substitute teaching.  I just want a chance to show my qualifications.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to conveying Pendleton's views, Perkins reported that, following a recent spate of racially tinged incidents at Haverhill High School, students of all hues \"called for more minority teachers, a recommendation school officials said they would heed.\"   This, and similar statements in the article, make it transparently clear that the racial attributes of the teacher-pupil mix by then had become a matter of public concern.  This circumstance possesses great significance for a First Amendment analysis:  by granting an interview to Perkins and lobbying for a permanent teaching post at a time when the racial composition of the public school faculty had become a matter of intense interest in the community, Pendleton invited public scrutiny of the qualities that equipped him to teach in the Haverhill school system.  Accordingly, he became a public figure for that limited purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We base this conclusion, in part, on the case law concerning candidates for public office.  Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 91 S.Ct. 621, 28 L.Ed.2d 35 (1971), involved a claim that a newspaper was liable for erroneously reporting that a senatorial candidate was a \"former small-time bootlegger.\"  Id. at 266, 91 S.Ct. 621.   The candidate sued, maintaining that he need not prove actual malice because he had never held a public office.  The Court demurred, holding that \"publications concerning candidates must be accorded at least as much protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments as those concerning occupants of public office.\"  Id. at 271, 91 S.Ct. 621.   In a companion case decided the same day, the Court reiterated its conclusion that candidates for public office--there, a candidate for a position as a county tax assessor--fall within the purview of the New York Times rule.  See Ocala Star-Banner Co. v. Damron, 401 U.S. 295, 299, 91 S.Ct. 628, 28 L.Ed.2d 57 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that, by analogy, these holdings are instructive in respect to the circumstances at bar.  Of course, unlike the candidates in Monitor Patriot and Ocala Star-Banner, Pendleton was not running for an elected political office--but it is at least arguable that if a person holds (or aspires to hold) any public post which entails control over matters of substantial public concern, then his qualifications for serving in that capacity are likely to engender the type of public debate and discussion that the First Amendment protects.  See Rosenblatt, 383 U.S. at 85-86.   After all, the Court's defamation jurisprudence makes no distinction between government officials who are selected by the voters and those who are selected in other ways, and logic suggests that it is the status of the official, not the manner in which he attains (or hopes to attain) the office, that is the key determinant of the extent to which state defamation law can be allowed to curb free discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, we need not rely solely on this rationale.  The Perkins article leaves no doubt that an independent public controversy existed within Haverhill regarding the need to increase minority faculty representation and the adequacy of the measures employed by school officials to that end.  Pendleton voluntarily injected himself into this preexisting controversy in at least three ways:  by making (and authorizing the publication of) statements bearing on the issue;  by airing his qualifications in a manner calculated to suggest that hiring him would ameliorate the problem;  and by seeking to influence public opinion not only on the desirability of more minority hires, but also on the virtues of his own candidacy for such employment.  In short, when Pendleton stated, \"I just want a chance to show my qualifications,\" he invited public debate both on the general issue of minority representation and on the specific characteristics that made him suitable (or not) for a teaching position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this conclusion comports comfortably with the teachings of Gertz.   Pendleton had \"access to the channels of effective communication,\" 418 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. 2997, as evidenced by the fact that his arrest on cocaine charges made the front page of both the Gazette and the Eagle-Tribune well prior to the uproar over his exoneration.  Similarly, the Gertz Court's statement that \"[a]n individual who decides to seek governmental office must accept certain necessary consequences of that involvement in public affairs,\" among them, \"the risk of closer public scrutiny than might otherwise be the case,\" 418 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. 2997, informs our assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there may be a temporal dimension to any \"limited-purpose public figure\" analysis.  Intuitively, one should not become fair game for eternity merely by injecting oneself into the debate of the moment.  Cf. Rosenblatt, 383 U.S. at 87 n. 14, 86 S.Ct. 669 (hypothesizing that \"there may be cases where a person is so far removed from a former position of authority that comment on the manner in which he performed his responsibilities no longer has the interest necessary to justify [applying] the New York Times rule\").  The case law, however, tends to contradict this intuition.  See Alan Kaminsky, Note, Defamation Law:  Once A Public Figure Always A Public Figure?, 10 Hofstra L.Rev. 803, 812-13 (1982) (collecting cases).  Yet, we need not probe this point, for the temporal link in this instance is more than adequate.  Perkins's article espousing Pendleton's qualifications appeared in August 1993, less than a year before the utterances that are the subject of this suit.  There is no evidence that, in the interim, the controversy about minority faculty representation had subsided or that Pendleton had abandoned his quest for a permanent teaching position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances, Pendleton became a limited-purpose public figure whose alleged peccadilloes, even if falsely portrayed, were fair game in the absence of actual malice.  Consequently, those with information bearing on Pendleton's qualifications for a teaching position should not be punished for speaking out, absent evidence that they knowingly or recklessly disseminated falsehoods.  It follows that, because Arahovites's allegedly defamatory statements relate directly to Pendleton's qualifications for the public position to which he aspired<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and by extension to the controversy which swirled around that position--a controversy into which Pendleton had thrust himself--the district court correctly applied the New York Times rule.  Cf. Monitor Patriot, 401 U.S. at 277, 91 S.Ct. 621 (holding \"as a matter of constitutional law that a charge of criminal conduct ... can never be irrelevant to an official's or candidate's fitness for office\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear.  Our conclusion here, as in most public figure cases, is factbound and restricted to the specific circumstances revealed in the record.  See Bruno &amp; Stillman, 633 F.2d at 589 (explaining that \"particularized determinations of public figure status are the rule\").  We are aware of the scholarly debate surrounding teacher status in the defamation context, see generally Eugene C. Bjorklun, Are Teachers Public Officials For Defamation Purposes?, 80 West Ed. L. Rep. 527 (1993);  Richard E. Johnson, No More Teachers' Dirty Looks--Now They Sue:  An Analysis Of Plaintiff Status Determinations In Defamation Actions By Public Educators, 17 Fla.  St. U.L.Rev. 761 (1990);  Peter S. Cane, Note, Defamation Of Teachers:  Behind The Times?, 56 Fordham L.Rev. 1191 (1988), and we leave that ramified inquiry for another day.  To resolve the case at hand, it is unnecessary for us to hold that teachers are public figures for all purposes or that each and every applicant for a teaching post is to be deemed a public figure.  What we do hold is that when an individual freely comments on a community controversy that he views as precluding his ascension to a government office (such as that of public school teacher) and puts his qualifications into the public realm in a manner that suggests that he is trying to influence public opinion, he becomes a public figure for the purpose of discussions regarding his fitness for the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Pendleton made himself a public figure by voluntarily stepping into the midst of an ongoing controversy and inviting the citizenry to judge his bid to become a teacher.  Having extended that invitation, he assumed the risk that the ensuing discourse might contain errors of fact--errors for which the speakers, in the absence of a showing of actual malice, could not be held liable.  Hence, the court below did not err in requiring Pendleton to prove actual malice as an element of his defamation action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pendleton also sued JBSG for wrongful termination of employment.

The Job Market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting in the late 1980s, Pendleton tried to land a full-time teaching position in the Haverhill public school system.  Although he worked as a substitute teacher from time to time, he progressed no further.  In August 1993, he vented his frustration to a reporter, Anita Perkins, who found considerable irony in Pendleton's inability to secure a permanent teaching position notwithstanding a student-led outcry for a more diverse public school faculty.  She wrote an article to that effect in the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune, a newspaper serving the Haverhill area.  See Anita Perkins, Black Teacher Has Grown Impatient Awaiting A Chance, Eagle-Trib., Aug. 17, 1993, at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perkins's article profiled Pendleton and described his family, educational background, career aspirations, temporary teaching assignments, and his trepidation that school officials were not giving appropriate priority to minority hires.  Reflecting on his experience as an African-American student in the Haverhill schools, Pendleton was quoted as saying:  \"Twenty years later things are still the same.\"   He also was quoted as asking, rhetorically:  \"How can you expect a black child who is called a 'n_____' to go to a white counselor and teacher with his feelings?\"   The article commented on the dearth of minority teachers in the Haverhill schools, described some of the steps that Haverhill had taken to increase minority representation within the school system, and concluded with Pendleton's plaintive comment:  \"I'm tired of substitute teaching.  I just want a chance to show my qualifications.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That fall, Pendleton accepted a Haverhill-based position as a vocational counselor with Jobs For Bay State Graduates, Inc.  (JBSG), a private, nonprofit organization.  JBSG counselors advise public school students who do not plan to attend college about career opportunities.  Pendleton held this job at the time of his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>B. Arrest and Prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of May 27, 1994, Pendleton parked his car on a busy, well-lit street in his home town, ran some errands, and then repaired to a local tavern.  At some point, Arnaldo Pagan, a boyhood friend, asked Pendleton to give him a ride home.  After Pagan grew increasingly insistent, Pendleton acquiesced.  The two men then proceeded to Pendleton's automobile.  The vehicle was still parked when two Haverhill policemen on routine neighborhood patrol shined a flashlight into it.  The officers, John Arahovites and Lawrence Newman, claimed that \"two heads popped up\" from behind the dashboard and that they noticed a powdery substance on Pendleton's face.  Upon further investigation, the officers observed powder on Pagan's lap and throughout the car's interior.  They also saw a small bag containing what appeared to be cocaine on the floor of the vehicle.  Based on these observations, the gendarmes promptly arrested Pendleton and Pagan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton's arrest made front-page news in both the Eagle-Tribune and a competing newspaper, the Haverhill Gazette.  The stories revealed that charges of cocaine possession and conspiracy to violate the drug laws had been brought against Pendleton in the state district court.  The articles described Pendleton as a \"school jobs counselor\" and a \"high school advisor\" who worked in a classroom five days a week with 30 to 40 high-school seniors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton entered a not guilty plea.  At a court hearing on July 12, 1994, he asserted that when Pagan, after entering his vehicle, produced a small plastic bag, he (Pendleton) suspected the bag contained drugs and slapped it out of Pagan's hand.  In turn, this act caused the contents to spill onto Pagan's lap and scatter throughout the car.  In responding to an unrelated inquiry from the court, the prosecutor admitted that, due to a mix-up, the powder seized from Pendleton's car had not been tested.  The judge obviously did not like what he had heard.  He declared Pendleton not guilty and dismissed the charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>C. Subsequent Events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A flurry of media reports followed the case's termination.  In them, the district attorney's office accused the police of bungling the investigation and the police chief responded that delays in laboratory testing are sometimes an inevitable concomitant of the evidence-gathering process.  As part of this coverage, a local reporter interviewed Pendleton and his attorney.  The lawyer theorized that Pendleton had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he now could \"get back to doing ... positive things in the community,\" such as \"helping kids.\"   Bill Burke, Pendleton Tells His Side:  But Did Police Drop The Ball?, Haverhill Gazette, July 14, 1994, at A1. Pendleton asserted that he was \"the happiest guy in America that my innocence has been borne out.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 18, the arresting officers responded to a call from the Eagle-Tribune.  At the newspaper's offices, Arahovites and Newman voiced indignation over the disposition of the charges, emphasizing that they had not been notified about the July 12 proceeding and expressing disappointment that the judge had refused to order Pendleton to undergo drug rehabilitation.  See Bill Cantwell &amp; Eileen Pendleton, Judge's Release Of Suspect Outrages Police, Eagle-Trib., July 18, 1994, at 1. The article quoted Arahovites as saying that the police were \"not trying to crucify Pendleton,\" but \"[t]hat guy should be in rehab right now.\"  Id. When arrested, Arahovites said, Pendleton \"had coke all over his face, from the tip of his chin to his eyebrows,\" unlike \"[a] first-time user [who] would not have had it all over his face.\"The same article reported Arahovites's claims that he had \"never made an arrest where there was this much cocaine on a person's face,\" and that he had found \"a big bag of cocaine at [Pendleton's] feet.\"  Id. Finally, the journalists noted Arahovites's protest that the officers should not be held accountable for Pendleton's predicament.  In Arahovites's words, \"[t]hese guys [Pendleton and Pagan] were doing cocaine and they got caught.  Period.\"  Id.  Thus, despite the fact that Pendleton \"was fighting for a school department job\" and \"outside forces [were] fighting for him to become a teacher,\" he had only himself to blame if the negative publicity hampered his bid.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 18, 1994, JBSG terminated Pendleton's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 19, 1995, Pendleton sued the city of Haverhill, Arahovites, and Newman in the federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In pertinent part, his complaint invoked 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994) and claimed that the officers' post-acquittal statements to the press violated his constitutional rights.  The complaint also alleged various state-law claims, including counts for defamation, infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, negligence, negligent supervision, and malicious interference with employment relations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After protracted pretrial discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment.  The district court, ruling from the bench, granted brevis disposition (i) in Newman's favor on all claims, (ii) in Arahovites's and the city's favor with respect to the section 1983 claims, and (iii) exercising supplemental jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c), in the defendants' favor on all other causes of action save for the defamation claim against Arahovites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial on the surviving count commenced on October 27, 1997.  At the conclusion of the evidence, the court entertained arguments as to whether Pendleton should be deemed a public figure, and if so, to what extent.  Noting the nature of Pendleton's work in the public schools, his stature in the Haverhill community, the fact that charges against him were a matter of public interest, and his willingness to \"engage[ ] in th[e] process of communication in the form of a newspaper interview, just as the defendant did,\" the court concluded that Pendleton was a limited-purpose public figure and instructed the jury accordingly.  The jurors returned a take-nothing verdict.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton now assigns error to the pretrial entry of partial summary judgment, three evidentiary rulings that occurred at trial, and the public figure status determination.  We address his asseverations in accordance with these groupings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE PRETRIAL RULINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on seven of the enumerated counts lodged in Pendleton's complaint.  Pendleton does not challenge any of them as they pertain to Newman, but he does challenge four of the rulings as they pertain to Arahovites and Haverhill.  We review these determinations de novo, taking the facts as they appeared in the summary judgment record in the light most hospitable to Pendleton.  See Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750688\"><a href=\"/opinion/750688/darryl-w-elliott-v-sd-warren-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Pendleton's section 1983 claims hypothesize that Arahovites's scurrilous statements to the press led JBSG to discharge Pendleton, thereby depriving him of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has determined authoritatively that defamation, even from the lips of a government actor, does not in and of itself transgress constitutionally assured rights.  See Paul v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 700-01, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (1976) (establishing that although state law may provide a remedy for defamatory statements uttered by a government official, no cognizable constitutional harm ordinarily occurs).  In an effort to avoid this holding and to state an actionable section 1983 claim grounded upon defamation, Pendleton strives to fit his case into the narrow category of situations that involve more than simple stigmatization.  These precedents discern a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest when, in addition to mere reputational injury, words spoken by a government actor adversely impact a right or status previously enjoyed under state law.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span> (1991).  Here, however, the alleged defamation and the decision to cashier Pendleton came from two separate, unrelated sources, and the former cannot plausibly be said to have occurred \"incident to\" the latter.  As such, the allegedly defamatory remarks cannot be viewed as working a denial of a previously recognized right or status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, a violation of constitutional proportions under a \"stigma plus\" theory exists only if, and to the extent that, the opportunities lost are government benefices denied as a result of governmental action.

Pendleton's claim founders on these shoals:  he worked for a non-governmental employer and lost a private (not a public) position.  Although JBSG receives some financial assistance from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and operates within the public school system, it is not an arm of the state.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Rendell-Baker v.

Some of these claims (e.g., his allegations that the officers falsified their reports and acted out of racial animus) are simply unsupported by the evidence.  Others (e.g., Pendleton's assertion that his federal civil rights were violated because Arahovites spoke out in contravention of departmental rules) are legally impuissant.  See, e.g., Snowden v. Hughes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103921\"><a href=\"/opinion/103921/snowden-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103921\"><a href=\"/opinion/103921/snowden-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Finally, in the absence of individual liability on any officer's part, Pendleton's counterpart section 1983 claims against Haverhill, as the officers' municipal employer, cannot succeed.

The Tort Claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Pendleton concedes the propriety of summary judgment on many of his state-law tort claims, but challenges the rejection of his claims for negligence, invasion of privacy, and malicious interference with employment relations.  The subject warrants scant comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on a negligence claim under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant owed him a duty, (2) that the defendant breached the duty, and (3) that the breach caused the plaintiff's injuries.  See Cannon v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2081880\"><a href=\"/opinion/2081880/cannon-v-sears-roebuck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2081880\"><a href=\"/opinion/2081880/cannon-v-sears-roebuck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 584 (1978).  In this case, Pendleton conclusorily attributed the loss of his employment to Arahovites's remarks, but he did not produce evidence at the summary judgment stage sufficient to permit a finding that these remarks prompted JBSG to fire him.  Absent such evidence, his claim is untenable.  See, e.g., Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span>, 385-86 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton's malicious interference claim suffers from the same defect.  And, moreover, Pendleton failed to proffer any evidence related to another essential element of this claim;  the summary judgment record contains no proof that Arahovites knowingly attempted to induce JBSG to act.  See G.S. Enters., Inc. v. Falmouth Marine, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2125714\"><a href=\"/opinion/2125714/gs-enterprises-inc-v-falmouth-marine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2125714\"><a href=\"/opinion/2125714/gs-enterprises-inc-v-falmouth-marine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1363</span></a></span>, 1369 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The privacy claim is no more substantial.  Pendleton never identified the specific statements that supposedly intrude upon his privacy, nor can we glean the essentials of an actionable claim from the summary judgment record.  Massachusetts law prohibits unreasonable public disclosure of private information.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws. ch. 214, &#167; 1B;  see also Bratt v. International Bus.  Mach. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2027157\"><a href=\"/opinion/2027157/bratt-v-international-business-machines-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2027157\"><a href=\"/opinion/2027157/bratt-v-international-business-machines-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 134 (1984).  But this does not profit Pendleton because neither Arahovites's descriptions nor perceptions of Pendleton's conduct in a public place constitute private information.  See generally United States v.

THE EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton challenges three evidentiary rulings.  Two of these relate to the exclusion of evidence and the third relates to the admission of evidence.  In each instance, we review the district court's determination for abuse of discretion.  See Williams v. Drake, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198058\"><a href=\"/opinion/198058/williams-v-drake/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1998);  Blinzler v.

Negative Drug Test Results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Pendleton sought to introduce evidence that he tested negative for drugs on the Tuesday following his Friday night arrest.  Arahovites objected on relevancy grounds.  Judge O'Toole called counsel to the bench and asked Pendleton's lawyer what the jury could conclude from this evidence.  Counsel replied that the evidence tended to show that \"he [Pendleton] doesn't have a drug problem.\"   The judge then asked the lawyer:  \"Is it evidence that [Pendleton] did not ingest any amount of cocaine on Friday night?\"   The lawyer responded in the negative.  After a further colloquy, the judge ruled that Pendleton could show \"the fact of the test\" and that he voluntarily arranged for it, but not the results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no misuse of discretion in the trial court's exclusion of the test results.  Relevant evidence is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 401.  Since--as Pendleton readily admits--a negative test result on Tuesday lacks probative value as to whether Pendleton was using cocaine on the previous Friday, the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the test results were irrelevant to Arahovites's statements about Pendleton's cocaine use on the night of the arrest.  See, e.g., United States v.

We disagree.  Even if the officer's opinion could be construed as defamatory--a matter on which we take no view, see Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502426\"><a href=\"/opinion/502426/leslie-fudge-v-penthouse-international-ltd-leslie-fudge-v-penthouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span>, 1016 (1st Cir.1988) (\"If the challenged statement is one of opinion rather than fact, then under the First Amendment, it generally cannot give rise to a defamation claim.\")--the proffered evidence does not prove or disprove whether Pendleton regularly used drugs.  At most, it establishes that Pendleton had no drugs in his bloodstream at the time the test was administered (and, perhaps, that he had not used drugs immediately prior thereto).  These are topics that Arahovites did not broach in his allegedly defamatory comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>B. Police Department Rules and Regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton next challenges the trial court's decision to exclude the testimony of Deputy Chief Shea, who Pendleton sought to question about the Haverhill police department's rules regarding dissemination of information to the press.  Pendleton offered Shea's testimony to assist in establishing malice.  Specifically, Pendleton's counsel told the court that this testimony would show \"how deeply [Arahovites] felt about [speaking out], how much he wanted to do it, that he would violate all of these rules\" against talking to the press.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This iteration of relevancy misapprehends the concept of \"actual malice\" in defamation law.  In the defamation context, \"malice\" does not relate to the defendant's motive for speaking, or even to whether the defendant made the challenged statement out of ill-will.  Rather, \"malice\" for this purpose requires proof that the speaker published the statement with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard as to whether it was false.  See St. Amant v.

Pendleton did not offer Shea's testimony for any purpose bearing on these issues, but, rather, according to his offer of proof, in an endeavor to link evidence of rule violations to Arahovites's motive for having made the allegedly defamatory statements.  Motive, however, is not an element of a defamation claim under Massachusetts law.  See McAvoy v. Shufrin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2020225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2020225/mcavoy-v-shufrin/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2020225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2020225/mcavoy-v-shufrin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 517 (1988).

There was another bag of cocaine that came from Mr. Pagan that was in the back seat of our cruiser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton objected to this testimony on relevancy grounds and argues here that evidence regarding the second bag of cocaine was both irrelevant and prejudicial.  He is half-right: the evidence was irrelevant and the objection should have been sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pendleton is also half-wrong:  the error was benign.  The second bag of cocaine was mentioned to the jury only once.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In that passage, quoted above, Arahovites made it crystal clear that the second bag belonged to Pagan, not Pendleton.  This fact dovetailed with--and arguably bolstered--Pendleton's assertion that Pagan was the drug user and that he (Pendleton) was merely an innocent bystander.  Under the circumstances, we conclude that the error in permitting Arahovites's statement to stand was harmless and does not warrant a new trial.  See United States v.

Under the taxonomy developed by the Supreme Court, private plaintiffs can succeed in defamation actions on a state-set standard of proof (typically, negligence), whereas the Constitution imposes a higher hurdle for public figures and requires them to prove actual malice.

The Rosenblatt Court declared that \"it is for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether the proofs show [the plaintiff] to be a 'public official,' \" 383 U.S. at 88, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107163\"><a href=\"/opinion/107163/rosenblatt-v-baer/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Essex County Newspapers, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017899\"><a href=\"/opinion/2017899/stone-v-essex-county-newspapers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017899\"><a href=\"/opinion/2017899/stone-v-essex-county-newspapers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span> (1975).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Using Stone as a talisman, he insists that a court may make the public figure determination only if the facts bearing thereon are uncontroverted.  Building on this foundation, Pendleton then asserts that the public figure question in this case should have been submitted to the jury because the parties disagreed as to whether Pendleton injected himself into a public controversy to such an extent that he became a limited-purpose public figure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Pendleton's importuning.  The principal problem with his argument is that it assumes (wrongly, we believe) that the question of whether a person is sufficiently entangled in a public controversy to qualify him as a limited-purpose public figure is for the jury.  That question is of constitutional dimension and, thus, federal law controls.  Consistent with the federal precedents assembled above, which illustrate that the status issue is treated in federal defamation jurisprudence as a question of law, we hold that the question of whether a defamation plaintiff is a public figure is properly resolved by the court, not by the jury, regardless of the contestability of the predicate facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, moreover, all roads lead to Rome.  The record reveals complete accord as to who Pendleton was and what he did and said both before and after the events of May 27, 1994.  There is no conflict as to any material fact;  the issue is whether the discerned facts suffice to establish that Pendleton acted in a way sufficient to make him a public figure for the purpose of this defamation action (say, by previously achieving pervasive fame and notoriety, or by injecting himself into a public controversy).  We have no doubt that this archetypical legal question is exactly the sort of inquiry that the Rosenblatt Court intended the judge to handle.  Hence, the trial court did not err in ruling directly on the public figure question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>C. Pendleton's Status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the efficacy of Judge O'Toole's determination that Pendleton, although not a public official, was a limited-purpose public figure.  As with other questions of law, we afford plenary review to this determination.  See McCarthy v. Azure, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195334\"><a href=\"/opinion/195334/mccarthy-v-azure/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 354 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the arguments advanced in support of the proposition that Pendleton was a limited-purpose public figure are canards.  It is by now apodictic that an individual's involvement in a criminal proceeding--even one that attracts substantial notoriety--is not enough, in itself, to ingeminate public figure status.  See Wolston v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110133\"><a href=\"/opinion/110133/wolston-v-readers-digest-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110133\"><a href=\"/opinion/110133/wolston-v-readers-digest-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Finally, Arahovites's claim that Pendleton achieved pervasive fame as a sports star at Haverhill High School two decades ago and retains that celebrity to this day elevates hope over reason.  The passage of time obviously diluted whatever fame the now forty-something-year-old Pendleton had acquired during his adolescent heyday.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These false starts notwithstanding, we glean from the appellees' briefs and the trial court's bench decision several other suggested bases on which the court's decision arguably might rest.  Rather than canvassing the universe of possibilities, we proceed directly to the strongest argument in support of this determination, mindful that an appellate court possesses the power to affirm a lower court's rulings of law on any independent ground made manifest by the record.  See Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493609\"><a href=\"/opinion/493609/polyplastics-inc-v-transconex-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span>, 860-61 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1993, Pendleton effectively announced his candidacy to become a permanent teacher within the Haverhill school system.  He proclaimed as much in a newspaper story (entitled \"Black Teacher Has Grown Impatient Awaiting A Chance\") that featured him and his aspiration.  Although the record is bereft of information regarding the genesis of this published profile, the article speaks eloquently for itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Its author, Anita Perkins, describes a school system employing 480 full-time teachers, only 15 of whom are minorities, to instruct 7,500 pupils, approximately 1,050 of whom are minorities.  Perkins reports Pendleton's avowal that the Haverhill school system, in which minorities account for 14% of the student body but only 3% of the faculty, is not taking appropriate steps to increase the number of minority instructors.  In Pendleton's opinion, \"school officials are not making minority hirings a priority,\"--a failing that he says leaves minority students without suitable role models.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of the article is that Pendleton, a Haverhill native with a degree from the University of Massachusetts and ample experience working with Haverhill youths, should be given a teaching opportunity.  Perkins discusses Pendleton's \"lifelong dream of teaching in the schools that gave him and his family so much,\" and explains that, despite completing two years as a substitute teacher in a Haverhill school, \"three attempts to land a really permanent position in the city schools failed.\"   The article concludes with Pendleton's poignant lament:  \"I am tired of substitute teaching.  I just want a chance to show my qualifications.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to conveying Pendleton's views, Perkins reported that, following a recent spate of racially tinged incidents at Haverhill High School, students of all hues \"called for more minority teachers, a recommendation school officials said they would heed.\"   This, and similar statements in the article, make it transparently clear that the racial attributes of the teacher-pupil mix by then had become a matter of public concern.  This circumstance possesses great significance for a First Amendment analysis:  by granting an interview to Perkins and lobbying for a permanent teaching post at a time when the racial composition of the public school faculty had become a matter of intense interest in the community, Pendleton invited public scrutiny of the qualities that equipped him to teach in the Haverhill school system.  Accordingly, he became a public figure for that limited purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We base this conclusion, in part, on the case law concerning candidates for public office.  Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108275\"><a href=\"/opinion/108275/monitor-patriot-co-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108275\"><a href=\"/opinion/108275/monitor-patriot-co-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span> (1971), involved a claim that a newspaper was liable for erroneously reporting that a senatorial candidate was a \"former small-time bootlegger.\"  Id. at 266, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108275\"><a href=\"/opinion/108275/monitor-patriot-co-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>.   The candidate sued, maintaining that he need not prove actual malice because he had never held a public office.  The Court demurred, holding that \"publications concerning candidates must be accorded at least as much protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments as those concerning occupants of public office.\"  Id. at 271, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108275\"><a href=\"/opinion/108275/monitor-patriot-co-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>.   In a companion case decided the same day, the Court reiterated its conclusion that candidates for public office--there, a candidate for a position as a county tax assessor--fall within the purview of the New York Times rule.  See Ocala Star-Banner Co. v. Damron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108277\"><a href=\"/opinion/108277/ocala-star-banner-co-v-damron/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span>, 299, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108277\"><a href=\"/opinion/108277/ocala-star-banner-co-v-damron/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span> (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that, by analogy, these holdings are instructive in respect to the circumstances at bar.  Of course, unlike the candidates in Monitor Patriot and Ocala Star-Banner, Pendleton was not running for an elected political office--but it is at least arguable that if a person holds (or aspires to hold) any public post which entails control over matters of substantial public concern, then his qualifications for serving in that capacity are likely to engender the type of public debate and discussion that the First Amendment protects.  See Rosenblatt, 383 U.S. at 85-86.   After all, the Court's defamation jurisprudence makes no distinction between government officials who are selected by the voters and those who are selected in other ways, and logic suggests that it is the status of the official, not the manner in which he attains (or hopes to attain) the office, that is the key determinant of the extent to which state defamation law can be allowed to curb free discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, we need not rely solely on this rationale.  The Perkins article leaves no doubt that an independent public controversy existed within Haverhill regarding the need to increase minority faculty representation and the adequacy of the measures employed by school officials to that end.  Pendleton voluntarily injected himself into this preexisting controversy in at least three ways:  by making (and authorizing the publication of) statements bearing on the issue;  by airing his qualifications in a manner calculated to suggest that hiring him would ameliorate the problem;  and by seeking to influence public opinion not only on the desirability of more minority hires, but also on the virtues of his own candidacy for such employment.  In short, when Pendleton stated, \"I just want a chance to show my qualifications,\" he invited public debate both on the general issue of minority representation and on the specific characteristics that made him suitable (or not) for a teaching position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this conclusion comports comfortably with the teachings of Gertz.   Pendleton had \"access to the channels of effective communication,\" 418 U.S. at 344, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109091\"><a href=\"/opinion/109091/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2997</span></a></span>, as evidenced by the fact that his arrest on cocaine charges made the front page of both the Gazette and the Eagle-Tribune well prior to the uproar over his exoneration.  Similarly, the Gertz Court's statement that \"[a]n individual who decides to seek governmental office must accept certain necessary consequences of that involvement in public affairs,\" among them, \"the risk of closer public scrutiny than might otherwise be the case,\" 418 U.S. at 344, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109091\"><a href=\"/opinion/109091/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2997</span></a></span>, informs our assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there may be a temporal dimension to any \"limited-purpose public figure\" analysis.  Intuitively, one should not become fair game for eternity merely by injecting oneself into the debate of the moment.  Cf. Rosenblatt, 383 U.S. at 87 n. 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107163\"><a href=\"/opinion/107163/rosenblatt-v-baer/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span> (hypothesizing that \"there may be cases where a person is so far removed from a former position of authority that comment on the manner in which he performed his responsibilities no longer has the interest necessary to justify [applying] the New York Times rule\").  The case law, however, tends to contradict this intuition.  See Alan Kaminsky, Note, Defamation Law:  Once A Public Figure Always A Public Figure?, 10 Hofstra L.Rev. 803, 812-13 (1982) (collecting cases).  Yet, we need not probe this point, for the temporal link in this instance is more than adequate.  Perkins's article espousing Pendleton's qualifications appeared in August 1993, less than a year before the utterances that are the subject of this suit.  There is no evidence that, in the interim, the controversy about minority faculty representation had subsided or that Pendleton had abandoned his quest for a permanent teaching position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances, Pendleton became a limited-purpose public figure whose alleged peccadilloes, even if falsely portrayed, were fair game in the absence of actual malice.  Consequently, those with information bearing on Pendleton's qualifications for a teaching position should not be punished for speaking out, absent evidence that they knowingly or recklessly disseminated falsehoods.  It follows that, because Arahovites's allegedly defamatory statements relate directly to Pendleton's qualifications for the public position to which he aspired<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and by extension to the controversy which swirled around that position--a controversy into which Pendleton had thrust himself--the district court correctly applied the New York Times rule.  Cf. Monitor Patriot, 401 U.S. at 277, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108275\"><a href=\"/opinion/108275/monitor-patriot-co-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span> (holding \"as a matter of constitutional law that a charge of criminal conduct ... can never be irrelevant to an official's or candidate's fitness for office\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear.  Our conclusion here, as in most public figure cases, is factbound and restricted to the specific circumstances revealed in the record.  See Bruno &amp; Stillman, 633 F.2d at 589 (explaining that \"particularized determinations of public figure status are the rule\").  We are aware of the scholarly debate surrounding teacher status in the defamation context, see generally Eugene C. Bjorklun, Are Teachers Public Officials For Defamation Purposes?, 80 West Ed. L. Rep. 527 (1993);  Richard E. Johnson, No More Teachers' Dirty Looks--Now They Sue:  An Analysis Of Plaintiff Status Determinations In Defamation Actions By Public Educators, 17 Fla.  St. U.L.Rev. 761 (1990);  Peter S. Cane, Note, Defamation Of Teachers:  Behind The Times?, 56 Fordham L.Rev. 1191 (1988), and we leave that ramified inquiry for another day.  To resolve the case at hand, it is unnecessary for us to hold that teachers are public figures for all purposes or that each and every applicant for a teaching post is to be deemed a public figure.  What we do hold is that when an individual freely comments on a community controversy that he views as precluding his ascension to a government office (such as that of public school teacher) and puts his qualifications into the public realm in a manner that suggests that he is trying to influence public opinion, he becomes a public figure for the purpose of discussions regarding his fitness for the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Pendleton made himself a public figure by voluntarily stepping into the midst of an ongoing controversy and inviting the citizenry to judge his bid to become a teacher.  Having extended that invitation, he assumed the risk that the ensuing discourse might contain errors of fact--errors for which the speakers, in the absence of a showing of actual malice, could not be held liable.
