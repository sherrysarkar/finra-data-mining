McCullough on brief for appellees Trustees of the\r\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst.\r\n   Robert B. Smith on brief for appellees Trustees of Boston\r\nUniversity.\r\n   Alan D. Rose, Alan D. Rose, Jr. and Rose &amp; Associates on brief\r\nfor appellees Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and John A.

The judgment of dismissal is summarily\r\naffirmed on the ground that plaintiff has failed to state a\r\nclaim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  We reject the assertion\r\nthat the district court acted \"prematurely,\" and we find in any\r\nevent that plaintiff has had ample opportunity to set forth his\r\nallegations.  Having scrutinized his various submissions, we\r\nagree, for the reasons enumerated by defendants and relied on\r\nby the district court, that dismissal was warranted.  With all\r\nof plaintiff's well-pled factual averments accepted as true and\r\nwith all reasonable inferences drawn in his favor, no basis for\r\nrecovery has been established--whether under 42 U.S.C.  1983\r\nor any of the other cited statutory provisions.  See, e.g.,\r\nRockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 260-61 (1st Cir. 1994);\r\nThe Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st\r\nCir. 1989).\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc.
