These  cross-appeals arise\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nout  of the sale  of a defective  wastewater treatment system\r\n\nfor use in  an electroplating operation.  For want  of a $620\r\n\npart, there was  a damages verdict  of over $7 million.   The\r\n\npurchaser of  the system,  Cambridge Plating Co.,  Inc., sued\r\n\nthe seller, Napco, Inc., for, among other things,  failing to\r\n\nreveal that it had knowingly omitted a critical part from the\r\n\nsystem.      The  complaint   alleged  breach   of  contract,\r\n\nintentional  misrepresentation,  negligent  misrepresentation\r\n\nand  a violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A,    2, 11 (\"Chapter\r\n\n93A\").   After a  twelve-day trial, Cambridge  Plating won on\r\n\nall counts, with a  jury finding liability on the  common law\r\n\ncounts and the district court finding liability under Chapter\r\n\n93A.   Both the jury and the district court awarded Cambridge\r\n\nPlating  significant  damages.    Napco  now  raises  various\r\n\nchallenges  to the verdicts.   We believe there  was error in\r\n\nthe  striking of  post-judgment motions  and that  the claims\r\n\nwere timely filed under  the Massachusetts discovery rule; we\r\n\nfind  the evidence  sufficient and  affirm on  liability (but\r\n\nreverse the  multiple damages under Chapter  93A), and vacate\r\n\nand remand the award of damages.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          We recite the facts as the  jury and district court\r\n\ncould have  found them.  See Sampson v. Eaton Corp., 809 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n156, 157 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n          Cambridge Plating, as part of its metal plating and\r\n\nmetal finishing  operations, uses  large quantities of  water\r\n\nfor  bath   solutions  and  rinsing.     This  water  becomes\r\n\ncontaminated   with  chemicals  and  metals.    Environmental\r\n\nregulations require that Cambridge Plating  decontaminate the\r\n\nwastewater before discharging it into the sewers.\r\n\n          Napco manufactures and  sells wastewater  treatment\r\n\nsystems  for commercial  users.   In January  1984, Cambridge\r\n\nPlating   entered  into   a   contract   to   purchase,   for\r\n\napproximately  $398,000, a  wastewater treatment  system that\r\n\nwould remove the contaminants from the water.  As part of the\r\n\ncontract, Napco provided a \"performance warranty\" under which\r\n\nNapco warranted  that the system, if  operated within certain\r\n\ndefined  limits, would  meet  all Massachusetts  and  federal\r\n\npollution  abatement requirements.    The warranty,  however,\r\n\nexcluded liability  for all consequential damages or business\r\n\nloss  Cambridge Plating might incur in the event of a breach.\r\n\n          The system  Napco sold to Cambridge  Plating used a\r\n\nprecipitation process  to  remove the  contaminants from  the\r\n\nwater.   The wastewater was  fed through pipes,  and injected\r\n\nwith a polymer solution.  The  polymers were to attach to the\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ncontaminants  and  then   aggregate  them   to  form   larger\r\n\nparticles, known  as \"floc.\"  The  floc was to  settle out of\r\n\nthe water and form sludge at the bottom of a clarifying tank.\r\n\nThe clean water  layer on  top would be  discharged into  the\r\n\nsewer  and Cambridge  Plating would  properly dispose  of the\r\n\nsludge left behind in the tank.  \"Flocculation,\"  the joining\r\n\nof  the smaller  particles into  bigger ones,  was absolutely\r\n\ncritical to  the success of the  wastewater treatment system.\r\n\nAbsent   proper   flocculation,  contaminants   would  remain\r\n\nsuspended  in the water and the water could not be discharged\r\n\ninto the sewer.\r\n\n          For  proper  flocculation  to  occur,  the  polymer\r\n\nsolution  had  to be  thoroughly  mixed  into the  wastewater\r\n\nstream.  The system needed  some means of creating turbulence\r\n\nin  the  stream  sufficient  to  perform  that  mixing.   One\r\n\nmechanism designed  to create  the necessary turbulence  is a\r\n\n\"static  mixer.\"   A  static  mixer  is  a  section  of  pipe\r\n\ncontaining a  series of \"baffles,\" small  metal plates placed\r\n\nat  an  angle inside  the pipe  which create  resistance and,\r\n\nconsequently, turbulence.   The polymer solution  is injected\r\n\ninto  the waste  stream  just before  the  water reaches  the\r\n\nstatic  mixer.  Once the water with the polymer solution hits\r\n\nthe baffles, mixing occurs.\r\n\n          There are  alternatives to static  mixers to create\r\n\nthe   required  turbulence  for  a  precipitation  wastewater\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ntreatment system.  As Joseph Aliota, Napco's expert engineer,\r\n\ntestified,  proper mixing can occur if the system is designed\r\n\nwith a series of  significant bends in the piping  around the\r\n\narea  where the polymer is  injected into the  stream.  Napco\r\n\ndid not opt for  that design.  The engineering  drawings (and\r\n\nother  items)  for  the   Cambridge  Plating  system  clearly\r\n\nindicate that the system was to include a static mixer.\r\n\n          Napco did not install the static mixer.  Nor did it\r\n\ntell  Cambridge Plating  that the  static mixer had  not been\r\n\ninstalled.  It did, however, provide Cambridge Plating with a\r\n\n\"tech   manual\"   containing    blueprints   and    operating\r\n\ninstructions for the system.  This manual, given to Cambridge\r\n\nPlating upon completion of the system, purported to show what\r\n\nhad actually  been built.1 It contained  engineering drawings\r\n\nindicating that  the static mixer  had been installed  in the\r\n\nsystem.  Napco  also provided a  control panel that  depicted\r\n\nthe static mixer as being part of the system.\r\n\n          Napco's  employees were aware that the static mixer\r\n\nhad  not  been installed.    Bob  Triplett, Napco's  plumbing\r\n\nsubcontractor,  testified  that  he  was  instructed  not  to\r\n\ninstall  the static  mixer at  the direction  of either  Carl\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Although  the  parties  vigorously  dispute  whether  the\r\ndrawings  in  the tech  manual can  be  considered to  be \"as\r\nbuilt\" drawings as  that term  is used  among engineers,  the\r\nevidence shows clearly that these drawings were placed in the\r\nmanual  to  show Cambridge  Plating  what  had actually  been\r\nbuilt.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nBredfield,  a  Napco  employee,  or Bob  DeBisschop,  Napco's\r\n\nproject  manager on the  Cambridge Plating job.   John Eason,\r\n\nNapco's  Manager  of  Pollution  Abatement  and  the   person\r\n\nprincipally responsible  for the  design of the  system, also\r\n\ntestified  that  he knew  the  static  mixer was  not  there,\r\n\nalthough he  claimed that the  static mixer was  installed at\r\n\nfirst but later removed because it had a tendency to clog.\r\n\n          The system was installed in late 1984.  For several\r\n\nmonths  after  installation,  the  system  generally met  the\r\n\napplicable  pollution  limits.   A series  of reports  from a\r\n\ntesting  laboratory that  Cambridge Plating forwarded  to the\r\n\nMassachusetts   Water   Resources  Authority   (\"MWRA\")  (the\r\n\nrelevant  state regulatory  body)  showed  that from  roughly\r\n\nMarch 1985 until  September 1985, the system  usually met the\r\n\napplicable discharge limits.\r\n\n          As time  went  on, however,  the  system  regularly\r\n\nfailed to meet the  applicable pollution limits and Cambridge\r\n\nPlating complained  to Napco about the problems.  Starting in\r\n\nearly  1986,  Edward  Marullo, a  Cambridge  Plating employee\r\n\nresponsible  for running  the  system,  called DeBisschop  at\r\n\nNapco  to complain  about the  poor performance.   DeBisschop\r\n\ntold Marullo to  manipulate the  polymer and pH  levels.   In\r\n\nMarch 1986,  Laurence  Tosi, Cambridge  Plating's  President,\r\n\ncalled DeBisschop \"yelling and screaming\" about the  system's\r\n\nfailures.  Tosi  thought that Napco's  equipment might be  at\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nfault,  but  DeBisschop  allayed  his concerns,  saying  that\r\n\noperator error was the likely cause of the problem.  Based on\r\n\nDeBisschop's assurances,  Tosi took no further  steps to have\r\n\nthe system inspected  for defects.   Again, in 1987,  Marullo\r\n\ncalled Eason  at Napco,  who, like his  colleague DeBisschop,\r\n\ntold Marullo to manipulate the polymer flow and pH level.  At\r\n\nsome point, Napco told Tosi that it would be willing to  send\r\n\nengineers to examine the system or to train further Cambridge\r\n\nPlating's operators.   But there  was a price  tag: Cambridge\r\n\nPlating had to agree  to pay $1000 per day  for such service.\r\n\nTosi declined.  At no time did Napco inform Cambridge Plating\r\n\nthat the static mixer was missing.\r\n\n          During  this  period,  Cambridge  Plating  hired  a\r\n\nseries of experts to  determine what was wrong.   In December\r\n\n1986,  it hired Patrick Hunt, a  waste treatment operator for\r\n\nHewlett-Packard  who was  also an  instructor of  a licensing\r\n\ncourse for  wastewater treatment operators  at the University\r\n\nof   Lowell.     Hunt   inspected   the  system,   recognized\r\n\n\"insufficient floc formation\" as a problem, and made numerous\r\n\nsuggestions,  most of which  related to operation.   Hunt did\r\n\nnot discover that the static mixer was missing.  In May 1987,\r\n\nRobert Capaccio, also a wastewater  treatment expert, visited\r\n\nCambridge Plating but failed to  detect that the static mixer\r\n\nwas missing.   A third  group of experts  from Memtek,  which\r\n\ndesigns  and  manufactures   wastewater  treatment   systems,\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nexamined  the  system in  September 1987  for the  purpose of\r\n\nproposing a course of action.  They recommended a substantial\r\n\noverhaul  of the  system  at a  cost  that Cambridge  Plating\r\n\nconsidered prohibitive.   During  their review, they  did not\r\n\nnotice that the static mixer was missing.\r\n\n          As  Cambridge Plating  was trying  to identify  and\r\n\nsolve  the problems with the  system, it was  also becoming a\r\n\nconsistent violator  of the MWRA's regulations.   In December\r\n\n1988  the   MWRA   fined  Cambridge   Plating  $682,250   for\r\n\ndischarging  excessive levels  of  contaminants.    Cambridge\r\n\nPlating  challenged  the fine,  which  was  later reduced  to\r\n\n$128,500,  but   at  a  cost  of   approximately  $54,000  in\r\n\nattorneys' fees.\r\n\n          Cambridge  Plating  tried  to  manage  the system's\r\n\ndeficiencies  by rigging  the system  so that  the wastewater\r\n\nwould  be recirculated and retreated  in the system.  \"Closed\r\n\nlooping,\"  as this practice  was called,  gave more  time for\r\n\nflocculation  to  occur.    It also  slowed  down  production\r\n\nconsiderably.  When there was closed  looping, the system had\r\n\nto  process both  the retreated  wastewater and  the incoming\r\n\nwastewater generated  by production.   From 1985  to February\r\n\n1989,  the  closed  looping  was  accomplished  by  attaching\r\n\nflexible hoses  to the system.   In February  1989, Cambridge\r\n\nPlating  replaced  the flexible  hoses  with  hard piping  to\r\n\ncreate permanent closed looping.  Cambridge Plating also shut\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\ndown  its zinc  plating operation  because, even  with closed\r\n\nlooping, the  system could  not remove the  contaminants from\r\n\nthat  operation.    Because  of its  slowdown  in  production\r\n\ncapacity,  Cambridge Plating's business began to deteriorate.\r\n\nNet sales declined from a  high of approximately $6.2 million\r\n\nin 1985 to approximately $4.8 million in 1989.\r\n\n          In  February 1989  Cambridge  Plating  hired  Peter\r\n\nMoleux,  another  expert  in  wastewater  treatment  systems.\r\n\nMoleux  reviewed   Napco's   proposal  and   copies  of   the\r\n\nengineering drawings.  By chance, Moleux had been given a bad\r\n\nphotocopy  of the drawings.  The portion of the drawings that\r\n\ndepicted the  static mixer did  not appear on  the photocopy.\r\n\nHe decided  to look for the  static mixer in the  system.  He\r\n\nphysically examined the system and  inspected the area of the\r\n\nsystem where the static  mixer should have been.   Because of\r\n\nhis expertise,  he noticed  that the piping  looked different\r\n\nthan it should have  if the static mixer had  been installed.\r\n\nHe  later confirmed  that  the  static  mixer  had  not  been\r\n\ninstalled.    He told  Cambridge Plating  that the  mixer was\r\n\nmissing.\r\n\n          Shortly  thereafter, on  March 17,  1989, Cambridge\r\n\nPlating sent a  letter to Napco  enclosing a draft  complaint\r\n\n\"concerning difficulties\" Cambridge  Plating had  experienced\r\n\nwith Napco.  The draft complaint mentioned the missing static\r\n\nmixer  and  the letter  requested  an \"amicable  resolution.\"\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nNapco ignored the letter, never agreeing to come to a meeting\r\n\nto  seek  an amicable  resolution  nor  agreeing  to fix  the\r\n\nproblem.    \r\n\n          Despite Moleux's discovery,  Cambridge Plating  did\r\n\nnot order the static  mixer until December 1989.   It arrived\r\n\nat the plant in January 1990 but  was not installed until May\r\n\n1990.   Installation required the  plant to be  shut down for\r\n\none day.  Once  the static mixer was installed,  the system's\r\n\nperformance improved dramatically,  and Cambridge Plating was\r\n\nable  to discontinue, for the most part, closed looping.  The\r\n\nstatic mixer cost $620.\r\n\n          Cambridge  Plating sued  Napco  on  June  22,  1990\r\n\ncharging breach of contract (including willful repudiation of\r\n\nwarranty),    intentional     misrepresentation,    negligent\r\n\nmisrepresentation  and  violation  of  Chapter  93A.    Napco\r\n\nsubsequently moved for summary  judgment.  The district court\r\n\ngranted the  motion, holding that  Cambridge Plating's claims\r\n\nwere  time-barred.   This  court  reversed  and remanded  for\r\n\ntrial,  see  Cambridge  Plating  Co.,  Inc.  v.  Napco,  Inc.\r                                                                         \r\n\n(Cambridge Plating  I),  991 F.2d  21,  22 (1st  Cir.  1993),\r                                  \r\n\nholding that a genuine  issue of material fact existed  as to\r\n\nwhether Cambridge Plating  could benefit  from the  discovery\r\n\nrule.\r\n\n          On  remand,  the  case  was  tried  to  a  jury  in\r\n\nSeptember 1994.  The district court submitted Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n49(b) special interrogatories to  the jury on the  statute of\r\n\nlimitations question,  the three  common law counts,  and the\r\n\nChapter  93A   count.     The  jury   answered  all   of  the\r\n\ninterrogatories  in Cambridge  Plating's  favor,  returned  a\r\n\ngeneral verdict on each of the common law counts, and awarded\r\n\nCambridge Plating $12,183,120.  The district court treated as\r\n\nadvisory the jury's answers to the Rule 49(b) interrogatories\r\n\non  the  Chapter 93A  count, and,  on  February 7,  1995, the\r\n\ndistrict court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law\r\n\non the Chapter 93A count.  See Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nNapco,  Inc. (Cambridge  Plating II),  876  F. Supp.  326 (D.\r                                                \r\n\nMass. 1995).   In that opinion, the  district court concluded\r\n\nthat  the  Chapter  93A  count  was  timely,  that  Napco had\r\n\nviolated Chapter 93A, and that Cambridge Plating was entitled\r\n\nto compensatory  damages in the  amount of $3,363,120.2   The\r\n\ndistrict court  also concluded that the  violation of Chapter\r\n\n93A  was \"willful or knowing\" and ordered a punitive award of\r\n\ndouble damages.\r\n\n          Napco filed post-judgment motions for judgment as a\r\n\nmatter  of law, a new trial, remittitur, and amended findings\r\n\non the  Chapter 93A  claim.   After Cambridge  Plating argued\r\n\nthat  the  post-judgment motions  failed  to  set forth  with\r\n\nsufficient  specificity the grounds  for relief, the district\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.

The district court then granted a remittitur in\r\n\nthe  amount  of $7,839,000  and  gave  Cambridge Plating  the\r\n\noption of  accepting  the  remittitur,  thereby  accepting  a\r\n\nreduced damage award on  the common law counts in  the amount\r\n\nof $4,344,120, or submitting  to a new trial.

Cambridge Plating accepted\r\n\nthe remittitur.\r\n\n          Napco  now  challenges   the  sufficiency  of   the\r\n\nevidence, both  as to liability and  damages.  Alternatively,\r\n\nit seeks  a new trial  due to instructional  error.   It also\r\n\nargues  that  the  district  court should  have  limited  the\r\n\ndamages even  more.   We turn  first to  the question  of our\r\n\nscope of review.\r\n\n                     II.  Scope Of Review\r\n\n          The  district court's  decision  to strike  Napco's\r\n\npost-judgment motions affects the scope of our review.  Napco\r\n\nchallenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show willful or\r\n\nintentional misconduct, seeking a judgment as a matter of law\r\n\nor, in  the alternative,  a  new trial  on the  \"intentional\"\r\n\ncounts: intentional misrepresentation, willful repudiation of\r\n\nwarranty  and Chapter  93A.   This  court will  not, however,\r\n\nreview sufficiency  challenges absent a proper  motion in the\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court for  judgment  as a  matter of  law or  a new\r\n\ntrial.

April  30, 1996) (\"It  is\r\n\nbeyond   peradventure  that   in  order   to  challenge   the\r\n\nsufficiency  of the evidence  on appeal,  a party  must first\r\n\nhave  presented the  claim to  the district court,  either by\r\n\nmoving for  judgment as a  matter of law  before the case  is\r\n\nsubmitted  to the  jury and  renewing  that motion  after the\r\n\nverdict, Fed. R.  Civ. P. 50(a), (b), or by  moving for a new\r\n\ntrial  pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 59.\").   If the district\r\n\ncourt acted properly in striking the motions, the motions are\r\n\nnullities, and,  under Johnson  and Pinkham, Napco  is barred\r                                                       \r\n\nfrom  challenging  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence.    We\r\n\nbelieve, however, that the district court understandably  but\r\n\nimproperly struck the post-judgment motions.\r\n\n          A.  Procedural Background\r                                               \r\n\n          The district court entered  judgment on February 8,\r\n\n1995.  The next day, Napco moved for an extension of time for\r\n\nfiling its memoranda in support of its post-judgment motions,\r\n\nstating:\r\n\n          Plaintiff has prevailed on  four separate\r\n          and distinct legal claims.  Therefore, in\r\n          order  to   obtain  postjudgment  relief,\r\n          Napco must  challenge all four  bases for\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\n          the judgment.  This will require Napco to\r\n          argue   several  substantial   legal  and\r\n          factual  issues  including, for  example,\r\n          the  recoverability  of lost  profits for\r\n          negligent      misrepresentation,     the\r\n          sufficiency    of    the   evidence    of\r\n          intentional   misrepresentation   and  of\r\n          repudiation of warranty,  the statute  of\r\n          limitations  (three-year and  four-year),\r\n          as well as issues relating to Chapter 93A\r\n          and damages. \r\n\nOn February 14, the district court granted the motion, giving\r\n\nNapco  until   March  1,  1995  to   file  the  post-judgment\r\n\nmemoranda.  On February  17, six days before the  10-day time\r\n\nlimit for filing post-judgment motions expired, Napco filed a\r\n\nmotion pursuant  to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) and 59.  In summary\r\n\nfashion, the motion outlined its  subject matter and said the\r\n\ngrounds would  be set forth in  the March 1  memorandum to be\r\n\nfiled later in accord  with the Court's extension.3   Also on\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The text of the motion was:\r\n\n          Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) and 59,\r\n          the defendant, Napco, Inc., hereby:\r\n\n               (1) renews the motion for entry\r\n               of judgment as  a matter of law\r\n               that  it made  at the  close of\r\n               the  plaintiff's  evidence  and\r\n               again at  the close of  all the\r\n               evidence;\r\n               (2)  moves for  a new  trial on\r\n               the  common law  counts decided\r\n               by the jury; and\r\n               (3) moves for a remittitur or a\r\n               new  trial  on  damages on  the\r\n               common  law  counts decided  by\r\n               the jury.\r\n\n          The grounds  for this motion  will be set\r\n          forth in Napco's Memorandum in Support of\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\nFebruary  17, Napco filed a similar motion under Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP.  52(b) and 59 seeking either to amend the district court's\r\n\nfindings of  fact and  conclusions of  law or  to have  a new\r\n\ntrial on  the Chapter 93A claim.   This motion also said that\r\n\nthe grounds  for the motion would be set forth in the March 1\r\n\nmemorandum.  \r\n\n          On  February 24,  1995, one  day after  the ten-day\r\n\nperiod  expired,  Cambridge Plating  moved to  strike Napco's\r\n\npost-judgment  motions, arguing  that they  lacked sufficient\r\n\n\"particularity\"  under  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.  7(b)(1) and  that,\r\n\naccordingly,  no \"motion\"  had been  timely filed  within the\r\n\nten-day period prescribed by  Rules 50(b), 52(b) and 59.   In\r\n\ngranting Cambridge Plating's motion, except on the remittitur\r\n\nissue, the district court  refused to take into consideration\r\n\nNapco's  extension motion  or  any of  the other  surrounding\r\n\ncircumstances.\r\n\n          B.  Analysis\r                                  \r\n\n          Rule  7(b)(1)  requires  that motions  \"state  with\r\n\nparticularity the grounds therefor.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1).\r\n\nNapco's post-judgment motions are subject to the requirements\r\n\nof Rule 7(b)(1).   The particularity requirement, however, is\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          Motion for Judgment  as a Matter of  Law,\r\n          for a  New Trial or for Remittitur, which\r\n          Napco  will  file  on  March  1, 1995  in\r\n          accordance  with  the  Court's ruling  on\r\n          Defendant's Motion for Additional Time to\r\n          File Memorandum.\r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n\nto  be   read  flexibly  in  \"recognition   of  the  peculiar\r\n\ncircumstances of the case.\"   Registration Control Sys., Inc.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

(supporting  memorandum filed\r\n\nwith  insufficiently particular  motion),  cert. denied,  506\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 829 (1992).  The extension motion specified the bases of\r\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\nthe  judgment  that  Napco  \"must challenge,\"  including  the\r\n\nsufficiency    of   the    evidence   on    the   intentional\r\n\nmisrepresentation  claim  and   the  willful  repudiation  of\r\n\nwarranty claim, as well as issues relating to Chapter 93A and\r\n\ndamages.    Napco thus  represented  to  both the  court  and\r\n\nCambridge Plating the grounds  for its post-judgment motions.\r\n\nNo  claim is made that  there was any  intervening event that\r\n\nwould have  made the representations in  the extension motion\r\n\nunreliable.\r\n\n          Cambridge Plating  makes a passing  argument in its\r\n\nbrief that it was unable to respond to, or the district court\r\n\nto process, Napco's motions.  If the Rule 50(b), 59 and 52(b)\r\n\nmotions  are viewed  in  isolation, Cambridge  Plating has  a\r\n\npoint.   But the motions cannot  be viewed in isolation.   In\r\n\naddition to the  closely filed extension motion,  significant\r\n\nbriefing on the  Chapter 93A issues  had just been  completed\r\n\nand  Napco  had  earlier  made quite  a  detailed  Rule 50(a)\r\n\nmotion, of which  the Rule 50(b) motion was  a \"renewal.\"  In\r\n\nshort,  the   record  shows  that  Napco   was  taking  steps\r\n\nspecifically to make evidentiary challenges to the verdict on\r\n\nall  of the  major issues  litigated at  trial.   The grounds\r\n\nNapco  would  press   in  its   post-judgment  motions   were\r\n\nsufficiently known.   The motions  under Rules 50(b),  59 and\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\n52(b)   were   adequate,    although   barely,   under    the\r\n\ncircumstances.4\r\n\n          The  district court  premised  its decision  on the\r\n\nbelief that the law prevented it from looking beyond the four\r\n\ncorners of  the motion  to determine  whether the  motion had\r\n\nstated  its grounds  with  sufficient  particularity.   While\r\n\nunderstandable,  such a view of Rule 7(b)(1) is, in our view,\r\n\ntoo narrow.  \"Overly technical\"  evaluations of particularity\r\n\nare  disfavored.

The question  to be  resolved at  trial was  whether\r\n\nCambridge Plating \"knew  or should have  known of its  claims\r\n\nbefore June  22, 1987 [or June 22, 1986].\"  Id.  Napco argues\r                                                           \r\n\nthat the  evidence was insufficient  for a  jury to  conclude\r\n\nthat Cambridge Plating  should not have  known of its  claims\r\n\nbefore the pertinent cut-off dates.  We disagree.\r\n\n          The  question of  the timeliness  of the  breach of\r\n\nwarranty and  Chapter 93A claims under  the four-year statute\r\n\nis, we believe, largely answered by the admirable description\r\n\nof  the evidence provided by  the district court  in light of\r\n\nour previous opinion in Cambridge Plating I.  The evidence at\r                                                       \r\n\ntrial showed that Cambridge Plating was aware that the system\r\n\nwas complex and that  the performance warranty Napco provided\r\n\ncontained the implicit condition  that the system be operated\r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\nproperly.    At  least  at  first,  Cambridge  Plating  could\r\n\nreasonably  have believed that  its own  inexperience, rather\r\n\nthan Napco's defective equipment, was to blame.\r\n\n          Of  course,  at some  point,  when  things were  no\r\n\nbetter, Cambridge  Plating should have thought that something\r\n\nother  than operator error was  causing the problem.   And as\r\n\nNapco points out, there  was evidence that such a  point came\r\n\nfor  Cambridge Plating  either  in early  1986, when  Marullo\r\n\ncomplained  to Debisschop  about the  system, or  March 1986,\r\n\nwhen Tosi \"kept yelling and screaming\" at Debisschop that the\r\n\nproblems were due to the equipment.\r\n\n          But  the  critical  question is  whether  Cambridge\r\n\nPlating reasonably relied on Napco's responses to those early\r\n\n1986  inquiries that  operator error,  rather than  equipment\r\n\ndefect, was the  cause of the  trouble.  The  fact that  Tosi\r\n\ncomplained vociferously  that the  equipment was at  fault is\r\n\nnot dispositive if DeBisschop was reasonably able to convince\r\n\nTosi  he  was  wrong.      Napco  had  considerably  superior\r\n\nexpertise in this area.   The absence of the static mixer was\r\n\nnot something Cambridge Plating, with its level of expertise,\r\n\nshould   have  detected.     We   believe  that   under  such\r\n\ncircumstances, when Napco  gave Tosi its \"assur[ances]\"  that\r\n\nthe problem had to be with the Cambridge Plating's operators,\r\n\nCambridge Plating reasonably took Napco at its word.\r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\n          The  misrepresentation claims, governed by a three-\r\n\nyear  statute, were also  timely.  Cambridge  Plating did not\r\n\nsit  idle  during  the  next twelve  months.    When  Napco's\r\n\nsuggestions  did  not solve  the  problem, Cambridge  Plating\r\n\nhired Patrick Hunt, in late 1986, to evaluate the system.  In\r\n\nJanuary 1987 Hunt gave Cambridge Plating his recommendations,\r\n\nwhich suggested  operational changes but not  that the static\r\n\nmixer  was either missing or  not working properly.   If Hunt\r\n\nwere  unqualified  to  examine  the  system,  then  Cambridge\r\n\nPlating  might have  difficulty  arguing that  it was  acting\r\n\nreasonably.  But  Hunt was an expert in  wastewater treatment\r\n\nsystems and competent to evaluate the system.\r\n\n          Was  Hunt's failure  to  discover  that the  static\r\n\nmixer was missing  reasonable?  See Cambridge  Plating I, 991\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 29-30.   We think the jury was  entitled to think so.\r\n\nFirst, the absence of the static mixer was not something that\r\n\ncould be easily detected from  a physical observation of  the\r\n\nsystem.  Indeed, other experts after Hunt who looked over the\r\n\nsystem  were  also fooled.    Second, Napco  had  supplied to\r\n\nCambridge Plating drawings representing that the static mixer\r\n\nhad been  installed.   According to Cambridge  Plating, these\r\n\ndrawings were \"as built\"  drawings.  Napco disputes Cambridge\r\n\nPlating's  characterization  of  the  drawings,  pointing  to\r\n\ntestimony  that   \"as  built\"   drawings,  as  the   term  is\r\n\ntechnically  used, were  never prepared.   Yet  regardless of\r\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\nwhether the drawings technically  could be called \"as built,\"\r\n\nNapco admitted supplying the drawings to Cambridge Plating in\r\n\nthe tech manual \"[t]o show what was built.\"\r\n\n          Perhaps,  given the  problems with the  system, the\r\n\naccuracy  of  the  drawings  should  have  been  called  into\r\n\nquestion  at this  time.   The  jury  was entitled  to  think\r\n\notherwise.  The system was extremely complex and the cause of\r\n\nthe  malfunction  could have  been  any  number of  problems,\r\n\nincluding, as  Napco points  out, problems  of  design.   The\r\n\nfactfinder could reasonably conclude  on this record that the\r\n\nprobability the drawings were false was sufficiently low that\r\n\nquestioning  the accuracy  of the  drawings would  be low  on\r\n\nCambridge Plating's  (or Hunt's)  diagnostic checklist.   The\r\n\nevidence was sufficient to support  a finding that the claims\r\n\nwere timely.   Nor was such  a finding against the  weight of\r\n\nthe evidence.\r\n\n          2.  Special interrogatory.\r                                               \r\n\n          Napco  alternatively argues that a new trial should\r\n\nbe  granted  on  the  misrepresentation  counts  because  the\r\n\nspecial interrogatory submitted to the jury on this point was\r\n\ndefectively  worded.    Over  Napco's  objection,  the  court\r\n\nsubmitted interrogatory 1(b), which asked:  \"Should plaintiff\r\n\nCambridge Plating reasonably have  known before June 22, 1987\r                                                                         \r\n\nof defendant  Napco's failure  to install the  static mixer?\"\r\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\n          Review  of  this  interrogatory  is  for  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion.  See Frank Briscoe Co., Inc. v. Clark County, 857\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  606, 614 (9th Cir.  1988), cert. denied,  490 U.S. 1048\r                                                         \r\n\n(1989).     Abuse   of  discretion  may   be  found   if  the\r\n\ninterrogatories are worded in such a way that they are likely\r\n\nto  mislead or  confuse  the jury  or inaccurately  state the\r\n\nissues.  Id.   Although Napco's argument has some  merit, the\r                        \r\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion.\r\n\n          Cambridge  Plating I  stated  that the  appropriate\r                                          \r\n\ntest  for the  discovery rule  was whether  Cambridge Plating\r\n\n\"should  have known that  Napco might be  responsible for the\r\n\nwater  treatment system's  failing  performance.\"   Cambridge\r                                                                         \r\n\nPlating I, 991 F.2d at 29.  Napco points out that the opinion\r                     \r\n\ndrew no specific distinction among the claims and argues that\r\n\nit was improper to  direct the jury's focus onto  the failure\r\n\nto  discover  the static  mixer  specifically.6   Napco  also\r\n\nrelies on  the  passage from  the opinion  stating that  \"the\r\n\nstatute of limitations will  begin to run once the  plaintiff\r\n\nhas enough information to target the  defendant as a suspect,\r\n\nthough  not  necessarily  to  identify  the  defendant  as  a\r\n\nculprit.\"  Id. at 29-30.  Under Napco's reading, all claims -\r                          \r\n\n-  warranty,  negligence and  fraud  -- would  have  the same\r\n\ntrigger  date  under  the  discovery rule:    when  Cambridge\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Napco  requested  an  interrogatory  that  asked  whether\r\nplaintiff  \"knew or should  have known of  its claims against\r\nNapco before June 22, 1987.\"\r\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n\nPlating should  have thought  Napco might be  responsible for\r\n\nthe problems with the system.\r\n\n          Cambridge Plating I did not  say that.  The opinion\r                                         \r\n\ndoes  not   address  the   question   specifically  of   what\r\n\ninformation is needed to \"target  the defendant as a suspect\"\r\n\nfor  a breach  of  contract as  compared to  that information\r\n\nneeded to \"target the defendant as a suspect\" for fraud.  The\r\n\ninformation needed to target the  defendant as a suspect  is,\r\n\nin  fact,  different  for  each claim.    Although  Cambridge\r\n\nPlating  may have had reason  to know that  Napco might be in\r\n\nbreach of its warranty when the  system did not perform up to\r\n\nsnuff  and Cambridge  Plating had  ruled out  operator error,\r\n\nthat  does not mean that Cambridge Plating had reason to know\r\n\nthat Napco  had deceived it.   Cf. Childers Oil Co.,  Inc. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nExxon Corp., 960 F.2d 1265, 1275 (4th Cir. 1992) (Luttig, J.,\r                       \r\n\ndissenting) (\"[A]lthough appellants knew or should have known\r\n\nwhen  construction  of  the  station  began  that  Exxon  had\r\n\nbreached its contract, appellants did not have reason to know\r\n\nof the possibility  of deception until  they learned in  1988\r\n\nthat  Exxon   had  always  intended  to   build  a  competing\r\n\nstation.\").\r\n\n          Under  Massachusetts  law, a  cause  of  action for\r\n\ndeceit accrues when  the plaintiff knew or  should have known\r\n\nof  the misrepresentation.   See  Friedman v.  Jablonski, 358\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d   994,  997   (Mass.  1976)   (cause  of   action  for\r\n\n                             -26-\r\r\n\nmisrepresentation in the sale of real estate accrues when the\r\n\nplaintiff  knew  or  reasonably  should  have  known  of  the\r\n\nmisrepresentation); see also Tagliente v. Himmer, 949 F.2d 1,\r                                                            \r\n\n5 (1st  Cir. 1991) (\"The burden is  on the plaintiff to prove\r\n\nthat in  the exercise of  reasonable diligence she  could not\r\n\nhave  known of  the misrepresentation  within the  statute of\r\n\nlimitations.\").7  In this  case, the misrepresentation was in\r\n\nthe  failure to disclose that  the static mixer  had not been\r\n\ninstalled.    Thus, under  Massachusetts  law,  the cause  of\r\n\naction for  misrepresentation did not  accrue until Cambridge\r\n\nPlating  should have known that the static mixer had not been\r\n\ninstalled.  The special interrogatory was not erroneous.8\r\n\n          B.  Intentional Misrepresentation\r                                                       \r\n\n          Cambridge Plating  had the  burden of  proving that\r\n\nNapco  had  engaged   in  an  intentional  misrepresentation.\r\n\nCambridge  Plating  alleged  in  its  complaint   that  Napco\r\n\nfraudulently induced it to  purchase the wastewater system by\r\n\nfalsely  promising that  the  system would  contain a  static\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Indeed, in accordance with that case law, Napco requested\r\nan instruction  stating that the pertinent  issue was whether\r\n\"Cambridge Plating  knew or  should have known  of the  facts\r\ngiving rise  to its misrepresentation claims  more than three\r\nyears before it filed suit on June 22, 1990.\" \r\n\n8.  Cambridge Plating  I was  concerned with the  question of\r                                    \r\nwhether  the  plaintiff had  acted  reasonably  diligently in\r\ndiscovering the claim, rather than whether some theoretically\r\nreasonable  investigation  would have  discovered  the claim.\r\nSuch a focus of inquiry does not require that distinctions be\r\ndrawn  among  the nature  of  the  claims  the plaintiff  has\r\nasserted.\r\n\n                             -27-\r\r\n\nmixer.  At trial, however, the district court did not believe\r\n\nthat  Cambridge Plating had  presented sufficient evidence to\r\n\nshow  such fraudulent  inducement,  and did  not submit  that\r\n\ntheory  to  the  jury.   The  district  court,  nevertheless,\r\n\nbelieved  that  Cambridge  Plating  had  presented sufficient\r\n\nevidence to show  fraudulent nondisclosure9 and, accordingly,\r\n\ncharged  the  jury on  that  theory.   The  jury subsequently\r\n\nfound, as  framed in the special  interrogatories, that Napco\r\n\nhad  \"intentionally conceal[ed]\" its  failure to  install the\r\n\nstatic mixer \"while aware of the System's failure to meet the\r\n\napplicable  discharge  limits\"   and  was  thus   liable  for\r\n\nintentional misrepresentation.\r\n\n          Napco   raises  two  challenges  to  this  verdict.\r\n\nFirst, it argues  that the evidence was  insufficient to show\r\n\nfraudulent nondisclosure.  Second, it argues that, regardless\r\n\nof  the evidence,  the intentional  misrepresentation verdict\r\n\nwas  tainted by a  defective jury  instruction.   It requests\r\n\nthat either judgment  be entered in its favor  or a new trial\r\n\ngranted.\r\n\n          1.  Sufficiency of the evidence.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Napco argues  that there was  insufficient evidence\r\n\nto support the  jury's finding  of fraudulent  nondisclosure.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  The parties have used the terms  \"wrongful nondisclosure\"\r\nand \"intentional nondisclosure.\"   We use the term fraudulent\r\nnondisclosure simply to distinguish the theory from negligent\r\nnondisclosure.  \r\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\nTo set aside a jury verdict and enter a  contrary verdict for\r\n\nNapco, we  must  examine  the  evidence  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable   to  Cambridge   Plating,  drawing   all  possible\r\n\ninferences in its favor.   See Havinga v. Crowley  Towing and\r                                                                         \r\n\nTransp.  Co., 24  F.3d 1480,  1483 (1st  Cir. 1994).   To set\r                        \r\n\naside  a  verdict and  remand for  a new  trial based  on the\r\n\nevidence, Napco must  show that the  verdict was against  the\r\n\ngreat  weight  of  the  evidence, viewed  in  the  light most\r\n\nfavorable  to  Cambridge  Plating,  or  would  work  a  clear\r\n\nmiscarriage  of justice.  See  id. at 1482-83.   Napco cannot\r                                              \r\n\nmeet either standard. \r\n\n          Napco's  sufficiency challenge  largely rests  on a\r\n\nsingle  proposition:   that there  was insufficient  evidence\r\n\nfrom  which a jury could conclude that Napco knew or believed\r\n\nthat  the static mixer was responsible  for the problems with\r\n\nthe system.10    In  Napco's words,  \"every  piece  of  proof\r                                                       \r\n\nbearing on the issue confirmed that Napco  never believed the\r                                                            \r\n\nstatic mixer was necessary,  and in fact, believed the  mixer\r\n\nmight impair  system performance.\"   (Emphasis in  original.)\r                        \r\n\nBut  there was such evidence:   Napco designed  the system to\r\n\ninclude  the  static  mixer.   It  knew  that  the mixer  was\r\n\noriginally included in the system to create the proper mixing\r\n\nof the polymer solution,  without which flocculation would be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  Napco  also argues  that the  materiality of  the static\r\nmixer was not a  fact susceptible of actual knowledge.   That\r\nargument is without merit.\r\n\n                             -29-\r\r\n\nhindered.   This  evidence, when  combined with  the evidence\r\n\nthat Napco knew the mixer had not been installed (so that the\r\n\nomission  was not mere oversight) and that it knew the system\r\n\nwas  not  working, adequately  supports  the conclusion  that\r\n\nNapco intentionally failed to tell Cambridge Plating that the\r\n\nstatic mixer was missing, knowing it was responsible  for the\r\n\nsystem's problems.\r\n\n          Napco protests  that it  simply made a  \"good faith\r\n\n(and, at worst, negligent) professional judgment that a mixer\r\n\nwas  not material to the system.\"  After all, it argues, what\r\n\ndid it have to gain from omitting a $620 part from the system\r\n\nor from hiding  a problem that could  be inexpensively cured.\r\n\nNapco    relies   on   testimony   from   Triplett,   Napco's\r\n\nsubcontractor, Aliota,  Napco's  expert, and  Eason,  Napco's\r\n\nmanager of pollution abatement.  But Triplett's testimony and\r\n\nAliota's testimony  do not  much help  Napco.  Although  both\r\n\nTriplett  and Aliota testified  that the use  of \"elbows,\" or\r\n\npipe bends,  could create the necessary turbulence in lieu of\r\n\nthe  static mixer, Napco did not show that such \"elbows\" were\r\n\nspecifically  designed into the  system.  More  to the point,\r\n\nAliota, who  was not a  fact witness, did  not testify as  to\r\n\nwhat the people  at Napco  were thinking in  leaving out  the\r\n\nstatic  mixer,  and Triplett,  at  best,  had only  a  \"vague\r\n\nrecollection\"  of  \"some discussion that  when the pumps came\r\n\n                             -30-\r\r\n\non they hit the  two -- they hit a  90 and a T, and  that was\r\n\nenough turbulence to mix with the polymer.\"\r\n\n          And, unfortunately  for Napco, the  jury could have\r\n\nfound Eason's testimony  in a  number of respects  not to  be\r\n\ncredible.  His account of the events surrounding the decision\r\n\nto omit  the static mixer  conflicted somewhat  with that  of\r\n\nother Napco witnesses.  Triplett testified that the mixer was\r\n\nnever installed, while Eason said it was  installed but taken\r\n\nout.   Eason's  testimony that  the static mixer  was omitted\r\n\nbecause it was \"minor\" was damaged by his admission on cross-\r\n\nexamination that he  could not find even one  other component\r\n\ndepicted  on the drawings that  was \"minor.\"   Napco does not\r\n\npoint to  other evidence presented to the  jury (for example,\r\n\ncontemporaneous memos showing that  Napco had made a judgment\r\n\nthat  the  mixer was  irrelevant)  that  corroborates Eason's\r\n\ntestimony.  In short,  the \"professional judgment\" theory was\r\n\nlargely  a  credibility  question.   In  light  of  the shaky\r\n\naspects  of  Eason's  testimony,  the jury  was  entitled  to\r\n\nconclude that  Eason was  not believable and  that Triplett's\r\n\n\"vague   recollection\"   was   not  enough   to   rebut   the\r\n\ncircumstantial  evidence  (particularly  the  drawings)  that\r\n\nNapco knew the absence of the static mixer was the problem.\r\n\n          Napco properly  makes  the point  that it  \"strains\r\n\ncredulity\" to suppose that Napco would expose itself  to such\r\n\ndrastic  liability  over a  $620 part  that  took one  day to\r\n\n                             -31-\r\r\n\ninstall.  Why Napco would do so is something of  a puzzle and\r\n\ncould  raise questions  about the  reliability of  the jury's\r\n\nfinding that Napco intentionally concealed the absence of the\r\n\nmixer.   But Napco's behavior is not wholly inexplicable.  It\r\n\nmight  be explained in terms of the theory of \"agency costs\":\r\n\nthe  aberrant  conduct  occurred when  Napco's  interests  in\r\n\navoiding exposure to drastic liability diverged from those of\r\n\nits  employees.   Cf.  AMPAT/Midwest, Inc.  v. Illinois  Tool\r                                                                         \r\n\nWorks, Inc., 896 F.2d 1035, 1043 (7th Cir. 1990) (Posner, J.)\r                       \r\n\n(seemingly irrational  behavior on the part  of a corporation\r\n\nmay be  explained by  the \"divergence of  objectives\" between\r\n\nthe  corporation  and  its  employees).    For  example,  the\r\n\ndesigner Eason  and the  project manager DeBisschop  may each\r\n\nhave  wished to avoid individual blame for the defects in the\r\n\nsystem.  \r\n\n          Finally, Napco's current focus on plaintiff's proof\r\n\nof scienter represents a shift  from its defense at  trial.11\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  At trial  Napco's principal defense was  that the system\r\nworked  fine,  i.e.  that  there  never  was  any  breach  of\r                               \r\nwarranty.   Napco placed great reliance  on discharge reports\r\nsent to the MWRA  from March 1985 to September  1985 (shortly\r\nafter the  system was  installed) indicating that  the system\r\nwas meeting  the discharge limits.   The importance  of these\r\nreports  was hotly  contested.   Cambridge Plating  explained\r\naway  these reports  by noting that  the materials  it plated\r\nwere  often  different,  using different  concentrations  and\r\ntypes of  chemicals, and  that the  system could  handle some\r\njobs but not others.   Cambridge Plating also noted  that its\r\nclosed looping masked the inadequacies of the system, but did\r\nnot  solve them.  The finding that the system did not perform\r\nas warranted is not challenged on appeal.\r\n\n                             -32-\r\r\n\nIts   defense  to  the  misrepresentation  count  principally\r\n\nfocussed  on whether the static mixer was in fact material to\r\n\nthe  problem.   Moreover, Napco's  defense to  the breach  of\r\n\nwarranty claim,  which rested in large part  on the assertion\r\n\nthat it  never had any  idea that Cambridge  Plating's system\r\n\nwas   not  meeting   the   effluent   requirements,  was   in\r\n\nconsiderable   tension  with   any   defense   made  on   the\r\n\nmisrepresentation  claims  that,  once  it  heard  about  the\r\n\nproblems,  Napco made  a judgment  that the static  mixer was\r\n\nunimportant.    Not  surprisingly,  then,  there  was  little\r\n\nspecific testimony that Napco seriously  considered Cambridge\r\n\nPlating's complaints and then made a judgment that the static\r\n\nmixer was the problem.   Napco principally chose to  take the\r\n\nposition at trial  that it did not know there  was a problem,\r\n\nrather than that it thought there was a problem but the cause\r\n\nwas  something  else.   Since  there  was competent  evidence\r\n\nshowing that  Eason and  DeBisschop were contacted  about the\r                                                    \r\n\nproblems with  the system on numerous occasions, and that the\r\n\nsystem worked after the static mixer was installed, Napco was\r                               \r\n\nvulnerable on the intentional misrepresentation count.\r\n\n          Cambridge  Plating  needed   to  show   intentional\r\n\nmisrepresentation only by  a preponderance  of the  evidence.\r\n\nSee Compagnie De  Reassurance D'Ile De France  v.

Instructional error.\r                                             \r\n\n          In   its  initial   charge,   the  district   court\r\n\ninstructed    the    jury     that    Napco's     intentional\r\n\nmisrepresentation  was  in its  \"silence.\"12    It instructed\r\n\nthat  \"[t]he question to  be decided  here is  whether .  . .\r\n\n[the] defendant  willfully concealed from  the plaintiff  the\r\n\nabsence of  the  static mixer  when  it knew . . .  that  the\r\n\ndischarge limits were not being met and that the inclusion of\r\n\nthe static mixer would,  at least to some extent,  enable the\r\n\nsystem  to  perform as  it  was  intended.\"   Following  this\r\n\ninitial charge, plaintiff's  counsel requested an instruction\r\n\nspecifying  that materiality  was to  be measured  against an\r\n\nobjective standard.  In response,the court gave the following\r\n\nsupplemental instruction:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  The charge was:\r\n\n          The fraud  is  in the  silence, you  see,\r\n          that  characterizes  the  conduct of  the\r\n          defendant; that is, their failure to tell\r\n          the  plaintiff  of  the  absence  of this\r\n          static   mixer   while  aware   that  the\r\n          discharge limits were not being met.  You\r\n          see, that's  when the  duty arises.   And\r\n          that's    when   the    concealment,   if\r\n          intentional,    is     what    we    call\r\n          \"actionable,\"  that  is,  a  basis  for a\r\n          lawsuit.\r\n\n                             -34-\r\r\n\n          [I]n discussing the state of  mind of the\r\n          defendant with regard  to the  importance\r\n          of the static  mixer to the system .  . .\r\n          the standard is objective.  It's not what\r\n          the defendant did or did not subjectively\r\n          think  about  it.    It's  what  would  a\r\n          reasonable  manufacturer or  seller under\r\n          the same circumstances have thought about\r\n          it.\r\n\nNapco argues  that this  instruction \"conflated the  torts of\r\n\nintentional   and   negligent   misrepresentation\"  and   was\r\n\n\"manifestly  erroneous.\"13   In  Napco's view,  it cannot  be\r\n\nheld liable  unless it  actually knew  the  static mixer  was\r\n\nmaterial.\r\n\n          The  standard under  which we review  this argument\r\n\ndepends upon whether Napco  properly preserved it.  Cambridge\r\n\nPlating protests  that Napco has not  preserved this argument\r\n\nbecause it failed to lodge a proper objection before the jury\r\n\nretired to  consider its verdict.  Under  Fed. R. Civ. P. 51,\r\n\nobjections  must \"stat[e] distinctly  the matter  objected to\r\n\nand the grounds of  the objection.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.  51.  An\r\n\nobjection  based on  one ground  does not  preserve appellate\r\n\nreview of a different ground.

This  point is  important because  lost profits  are not\r\ncompensable    for    negligent    misrepresentation    under\r\nMassachusetts  law,   see  Section  IV-D,  and  lost  profits\r                                     \r\nrepresent   the   bulk  of   the   damages   in  this   case.\r\nAdditionally, Napco claims that this instruction tainted both\r\nthe  willful  breach of  warranty  verdict  and the  district\r\ncourt's Chapter 93A decision.\r\n\n                             -35-\r\r\n\n          Napco states that  the instruction  was given  over\r\n\nits \"opposition.\"   But Napco's objection to the  charge only\r\n\nidentified three  problems with the instruction,  and not the\r\n\nissue it now raises.  Napco complained that (1) the complaint\r\n\ndid  not fairly  disclose the  nondisclosure theory,  (2) the\r\n\ntheory was not supported  by the evidence, and (3)  there was\r\n\nno obligation on  the part of the seller  to disclose.  Napco\r\n\ndid not object that the instruction was  incorrect because it\r\n\nfailed to make clear that actual knowledge of materiality was\r\n\nrequired  for  liability,  nor  did  Napco  object  that  the\r\n\ninstruction     conflated    negligent     and    intentional\r\n\nmisrepresentation.      Thus,   Napco  failed   to   \"state[]\r\n\ndistinctly\"  the  argument  it  makes  now,  i.e.,  that  the\r                                                             \r\n\ninstruction imposed an incorrect scienter requirement.\r\n\n          Napco urges  that colloquies occurring  days before\r\n\nthe charge satisfy Rule 51.  Without considering whether such\r\n\ncolloquies  may   be  used  to   determine  compliance,   the\r\n\ncolloquies Napco  directs us to  do not contain  any specific\r\n\nstatement that Napco needed to have \"actual knowledge\" of the\r\n\nstatic mixer's materiality to  be liable.  Napco's contention\r\n\nthat this lack  of specificity should be  excused because the\r\n\nfraudulent  nondisclosure theory  was \"novel\"  and came  as a\r\n\n\"surprise\" to counsel is contrary to what the record shows.14\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  Napco  characterizes  the  nondisclosure  theory  as  an\r\n\"eleventh-hour reformulation\" which was \"improvised literally\r\nat the final hour -- at the end of the ninth day of trial and\r\n\n                             -36-\r\r\n\n          In  any  event, Napco  concedes  that  the district\r\n\ncourt charged the  jury correctly on the scienter  element of\r                                             \r\n\nintentional misrepresentation during its initial charge.   It\r\n\nwas only  after plaintiff objected to  the charge, suggesting\r\n\nthat  the court make clear that materiality be viewed from an\r\n\nobjective point of view, that the court gave the supplemental\r\n\ninstruction.  The supplemental instruction thus created a new\r                                                                         \r\n\nissue,  independent  of   the  supposed  surprise  over   the\r\n\nfraudulent nondisclosure theory.  Despite this,  Napco's only\r\n\nobjections to the supplemental charge related to the charging\r\n\nof the fraudulent nondisclosure  theory generally, not to the\r\n\nnew  ambiguity the  instruction  created  over  the  scienter\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\non  the eve  of closing  arguments\" to  which counsel  had no\r\n\"foreshadowing.\"  But as early as  the third day of trial the\r\ncourt  had   asked  counsel  to  research   the  question  of\r\nnondisclosure.  The nondisclosure theory  was foreshadowed on\r\nthe   fifth   day  of   trial   where,   in  discussing   the\r\nmisrepresentation   count,   the   court  stated   that   the\r\nplaintiff's theory was that \"upon learning of  the absence of\r\nthe  static mixer,  it  became  defendant's  duty to  do  two\r\nthings:  first, to  install  it; and  secondly,  to tell  the\r\nplaintiff that it  wasn't in.\"   On the eighth day  of trial,\r\nwhich was a Friday, the district  court asked counsel whether\r\n\"the  lack of disclosure or  the absence of  the static mixer\r\n[could] serve as  a basis of a misrepresentation  and fraud,\"\r\nand asked them to think about the issue over the weekend.  On\r\nthe  ninth day of trial, the  court announced its view that a\r\nfraudulent  nondisclosure   theory  might  be  a   basis  for\r\nliability.   After having a chance overnight  to consider the\r\nobjections  it  would  lodge  against  the  district  court's\r\ntheory, Napco  lodged basically the same  objections it later\r\ngave  to  the supplemental  instruction.   In  light  of this\r\nrecord, we do not agree that Napco's failure to object should\r\nbe excused because the  fraudulent nondisclosure theory was a\r\nsurprise.\r\n\n                             -37-\r\r\n\nrequirement.   On  the question  of scienter,  Napco remained\r\n\nsilent.15\r\n\n          Absent  a proper  objection,  review is  for  plain\r\n\nerror.

Napco\r\ndisparages this evidence as a \"red herring[]\" saying that any\r\ninference that Napco refused to meet \"misreads\" the testimony\r\nFishman gave about  the letter  and that, in  any event,  the\r\nletter was  turned over  to lawyers  and  therefore sheds  no\r\nlight on  whether Napco  willfully  repudiated its  warranty.\r\nFishman's testimony on this point, however, is hardly helpful\r\nto  Napco.  Fishman testified that  he personally ignored the\r\nletter because it raised only a \"minor\" issue.  By \"minor\" he\r\nmeant  that there  wasn't enough  money involved  to  get his\r\nattention.    At  the  time,  Fishman  apparently  had  other\r\nproblems with a \"dollar volume  [that] was much greater  than\r\nwhat this was here\" and \"people were supposedly handling this\r\nfor [him].\"   Napco does not seriously dispute that, whatever\r\nFishman thought about the  problem, his \"people\" did nothing.\r\nNapco's awareness  of the  problem, its consideration  of its\r\nscope  as \"minor,\"  and  its failure  to respond,  support at\r\nleast to some degree an inference of willful repudiation.    \r\n\n                             -41-\r\r\n\n          Section  2  of Chapter  93A  makes  it unlawful  to\r\n\nengage  in  \"unfair  methods  of competition  and  unfair  or\r\n\ndeceptive acts or practices.\"   Mass.

The\r\n\ndistrict court appropriately found that:\r\n\n          NAPCO,  which  knew  throughout that  the\r\n          static mixer was  not installed,  learned\r\n          that  the system  was  not performing  as\r\n          warranted and nevertheless  1) failed  to\r\n          reveal  knowledge  within its  possession\r\n          which  would  have  stemmed the  tide  of\r\n          damages   being   caused   by   its   own\r\n          misconduct and 2) misdirected plaintiff's\r\n          attention to operator error as the source\r\n          of the System's shortcomings.\r\n\nCambridge Plating II,  876 F.  Supp. at 337.   This  finding,\r                                \r\n\nwhich was not clearly erroneous, supports the conclusion that\r\n\nNapco behaved both \"deceptively\" and \"unfairly\" under Chapter\r\n\n93A.18\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.  Because the  Chapter 93A claim is  predicated on conduct\r\namounting  to an  intentional  misrepresentation and  willful\r\nbreach of  warranty, Napco's limitation  of damages provision\r\ndoes  not bar consequential damages on this count.  Cf. Canal\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -43-\r\r\n\n          Moreover,  Napco's argument  --  that  Chapter  93A\r\n\nliability is  inappropriate because its decision  to omit the\r\n\nstatic mixer was simply a professional judgment -- misses the\r\n\nmark.  Even  if at  the time of  installation Napco  believed\r\n\nthat the  probability was small  that the static  mixer would\r\n\nmake   a  difference   to  the   system's  performance,   the\r\n\nprobability was  large enough  that it  should not have  been\r\n\nignored once Napco learned  that Cambridge Plating was having\r\n\nproblems.   Yet even  after Cambridge Plating  had complained\r\n\nabout  the  system's   performance,  Napco  never   seriously\r\n\nreconsidered its professed  judgment about the  static mixer.\r\n\nNapco  also knew  all along  that it  had provided  Cambridge\r\n\nPlating with inaccurate  drawings.  So  Napco also knew  that\r\n\nCambridge Plating  would be  handicapped in reaching  its own\r\n\nconclusion  on the matter.   Where Napco knew  the system was\r\n\nnot performing as warranted, Napco was not free to ignore the\r\n\nfact that  Cambridge Plating might benefit  from knowing that\r\n\nthe  mixer   had  been  omitted.     Napco's  silence  became\r\n\nsufficiently \"unscrupulous\" to fall within a  \"penumbra . . .\r\n\nof  [an] established concept of unfairness.\"  PMP Assoc., 321\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d  at 917.

L. ch. 93A,    11 (providing for up\r\n\nto three, but  not less  than two, times  actual damages  for\r\n\nwillful  or knowing  violations  of section  2).   Here,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  imposed double  damages based  on essentially\r\n\nthe same finding upon  which it imposed substantive liability\r\n\nunder Chapter 93A:   that  Napco failed to  disclose what  it\r\n\nknew  about  the  static  mixer  while knowing  that  it  was\r\n\nmaterial  to the problem.

At first  blush,  this conclusion  may seem\r\n\nsound,  given  the  \"willful  or  knowing\"  language  of  the\r\n\nstatute.  Napco's conduct,  which also amounts to intentional\r\n\nmisrepresentation (and  willful breach of  warranty), clearly\r\n\ninvolves a certain level of deliberateness.\r\n\n            But shades of culpability are supposed to  matter\r\n\nin applying  the punitive  damages provision of  the statute.\r\n\nSee Kansallis Fin.

We do not think so.  If Napco's\r\n\nconduct was fraud  and a willful repudiation  of warranty, it\r\n\nwas only marginally  so.   Napco had reason  to believe  that\r\n\noperator error was the cause of Cambridge Plating's problems.\r\n\nThe system, after all, had worked for  a period of time after\r\n\nits  installation.   Indeed,  Cambridge  Plating itself  took\r\n\nnearly a  year and a half to install the static mixer once it\r\n\nfound it was  missing.  Napco did not stand  to profit by its\r\n\nactions,  and   there  was  no  evidence   that  Napco  acted\r\n\nmaliciously towards Cambridge  Plating or remained  silent so\r\n\nthat  it  could watch  Cambridge  Plating  go into  distress.\r\n\nRather,  as the district court  noted, this was  a case where\r\n\nNapco simply ignored the problem hoping that it would somehow\r\n\nresolve itself.

On  this\r\n\npoint Napco is wrong.\r\n\n          Cambridge Plating  provided evidence  of  causation\r\n\nprincipally through  three witnesses  -- Mssrs.  Tosi, Moleux\r\n\nand Joseph  Finn, Cambridge  Plating's damages expert.   Tosi\r\n\ntestified that, in the  plating business, customers insist on\r\n\nquick  turn-around time.  He  also testified that because the\r\n\nwastewater   treatment  system   was  not   working  properly\r\n\nCambridge Plating had to  employ closed looping, which slowed\r\n\ndown  the  amount  of  wastewater  fed  through  the  system,\r\n\nconsequently  slowing  down  the  plating  process.    Moleux\r\n\nconfirmed that closed looping  \"required Cambridge Plating to\r\n\neither partially  or totally shut down.\"   Additionally, Tosi\r\n\ntestified that the zinc  plating operation closed because the\r\n\nsystem was  unable to remove  sufficiently the  contaminants.\r\n\n                             -50-\r\r\n\nFurther,  Debisschop directly linked the wastewater treatment\r\n\nsystem to a plating operation's profitability.\r\n\n          Finally, Finn testified that until 1985, the  first\r\n\nfull  year the  wastewater treatment system  was operational,\r\n\nCambridge Plating  had generally  experienced an increase  in\r\n\nsales.   He also  testified that for the  years following the\r\n\ninstallation  of the  system,  Cambridge  Plating's  revenues\r\n\ndecreased  from approximately  $6.2 million  in 1985  to $4.8\r\n\nmillion in  1989, and net income  declined from approximately\r\n\n$284,000 in 1985 to  a net loss of approximately  $131,000 in\r\n\n1989.  During  this time  period, the plating  industry as  a\r\n\nwhole averaged modest growth.\r\n\n          Cambridge  Plating  provided  a simple  before-and-\r\n\nafter financial picture  of an established company.   It also\r\n\nprovided  testimony  from people  expert  in  plating and  in\r\n\nwastewater treatment  that the difference in  profits was due\r\n\nto  a slowdown  in production  and failure  to meet  effluent\r\n\nlimitations,  both  of  which  could be  traced  back  to the\r\n\nmalfunctioning wastewater  treatment system.  Napco chose not\r\n\nto  present  an expert  of  its own  to break  the connection\r\n\nbetween the financial decline  and the malfunctioning system.\r\n\nInstead,  Napco was content to try to poke holes in Cambridge\r\n\nPlating's damages  testimony.  \"This [was]  a risky strategy,\r\n\nand it  failed.\"  AMPAT/Midwest,  896 F.2d at  1046 (internal\r                                           \r\n\n                             -51-\r\r\n\ncitation  omitted).

Nevertheless, in its Chapter  93A decision,\r\n\nthe district court awarded damages for both 1990 and 1991 and\r\n\nthen discounted them.  It also did  not adjust the jury award\r\n\nin  its  remittitur  to  take  account  of  this  failure  to\r\n\nmitigate.  We agree with  Napco that both the Chapter 93A and\r\n\nthe remittitur rulings were in error.\r\n\n          Cambridge Plating argues that it should be absolved\r\n\nfor its failure to mitigate after February 1989 because there\r\n\n                             -52-\r\r\n\nwould have, in any  event, been recovery time.   The recovery\r\n\ntime,  it  says, was  needed  in order  to offset  the damage\r\n\nresulting from its new  reputation as a polluter, and  to get\r\n\nword  out to customers  that it could fill  their needs while\r\n\ncomplying  with the  environmental  regulations.   This is  a\r\n\nplausible theory.  But Cambridge Plating did  not provide the\r\n\ntype or  quantity of proof that Massachusetts law requires to\r\n\nsupport damages for this \"reputational\"  injury sufficient to\r\n\novercome its failure to mitigate.\r\n\n          Cambridge   Plating  points  to  no  evidence  from\r\n\ncustomers  that it  would  not  have  been  able  to  recover\r\n\nbusiness  because of its  reputation as a polluter.   The one\r\n\ncustomer who  testified, Alfred Jacques  of General Electric,\r\n\ndid  not  support  Cambridge  Plating's  reputational  injury\r\n\ntheory.  The   evidence  Cambridge Plating relies  upon --  a\r\n\nstatement from DeBisschop agreeing  that companies \"tend\"  to\r\n\nlose  business when they  are found  to be  polluters, Tosi's\r\n\ntestimony   that  Cambridge   Plating  became  \"known   as  a\r\n\npolluter,\"   and  an  advertisement  from  Cambridge  Plating\r\n\ntouting  its  system  --   provides  scant  support  for  the\r\n\nproposition  that  there was  any  reputational  harm.   This\r\n\nevidence  of  reputational injury  is  also  in tension  with\r\n\nFinn's  testimony that  if  Cambridge Plating  had a  working\r\n\nwastewater treatment  system,  it  could  have  replaced  its\r\n\nbusiness \"almost immediately.\"  Even Cambridge Plating states\r\n\n                             -53-\r\r\n\nin its brief  that \"demand  for plating  and metal  finishing\r\n\nservices  such as  those  provided by  Cambridge Plating  was\r\n\nstrong  throughout  the  late   1980s  and  to  the  time  of\r\n\ntrial.\"21\r\n\n          On  this  record,  Cambridge  Plating's  theory  of\r\n\nreputational  injury is,  to  say  the least,  \"speculative.\"\r\n\nAugat II,  631 N.E.2d at 998.  Cambridge  Plating can find no\r                    \r\n\ncomfort in the case  law that allows for some  uncertainty in\r\n\nproving damages  in tort  cases.   See,  e.g., Computer  Sys.\r                                                                         \r\n\nEng., Inc. v.

In the absence of evidence showing Cambridge Plating\r\n\nmitigated  its damages, the  outer limit for  such damages on\r\n\nthe record before  the trial  court was November  1989.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n21.  Although  Cambridge  notes that  its sales  continued to\r\ndecline after May  1990, the booming economic  times had come\r\nto an end by then.  Indeed, the declining sales following the\r\ninstallation of the static mixer might even suggest  that the\r\nmissing  static  mixer  had  nothing  to  do  with  Cambridge\r\nPlating's financial problems.\r\n\n                             -54-\r\r\n\nAugat II, 631 N.E.2d at 1000 (reducing period of lost profits\r                    \r\n\nto six months).\r\n\n          We also  believe that both the  Chapter 93A damages\r\n\nand the  remittitur should equally take  account of Cambridge\r\n\nPlating's  failure  to mitigate.

Jet  Spray Cooler,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc.  v.

In  this case,  however, Cambridge  Plating\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n22.  Because we believe both the district court damages award\r\nand  the jury award  must be adjusted in  the same manner, we\r\nneed  not address  Napco's argument  that the  district court\r\nerred in allowing damages on the jury award that exceeded the\r\ndamages under Chapter 93A.\r\n\n                             -55-\r\r\n\nargued that SG&amp;A  expenses would  not have  increased as  its\r\n\nsales increased and thus the anticipated gross profits should\r\n\nnot be reduced by SG&amp;A expenses.  The district court accepted\r\n\nCambridge Plating's argument, as do we.\r\n\n          Cambridge Plating relies  on the testimony of  Finn\r\n\nthat \"lost  gross profit for  Cambridge Plating is  the exact\r\n\nsame  number  as  the  lost  net  profit  for  the  years  in\r\n\nquestion.\"   Although, as Napco points  out, the consolidated\r\n\nfinancial  statements  from  1980  to  1985  show  a  general\r\n\nincrease in both sales and SG&amp;A expenses, Finn testified that\r\n\nSG&amp;A expenses  increased only 10%-11% as  sales increased 30%\r\n\nfor  the  period  1982  to 1984.    Moreover,  in 1984,  SG&amp;A\r\n\nexpenses decreased  slightly as  sales increased.   From this\r\n\nevidence,  Finn   believed  that  there   was  \"no  dependent\r\n\nrelationship  between  S G  and  A and  sales\" and  that SG&amp;A\r\n\nexpenses  would  not  have  necessarily  increased  as  gross\r\n\nprofits  increased.    Although  these  inferences  from  the\r\n\nevidence are weak, they are sufficiently plausible to survive\r\n\nNapco's challenge on appeal.\r\n\n          D.

For want of a $620 part, there was a damages verdict of over $7 million.  The purchaser of the system, Cambridge Plating Co., Inc., sued the seller, Napco, Inc., for, among other things, failing to reveal that it had knowingly omitted a critical part from the system.  The complaint alleged breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and a violation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93A, &#167;&#167; 2, 11 (\"Chapter 93A\").  After a twelve-day trial, Cambridge Plating won on all counts, with a jury finding liability on the common law counts and the district court finding liability under Chapter 93A.  Both the jury and the district court awarded Cambridge Plating significant damages.  Napco now raises various challenges to the verdicts.  We believe there was error in the striking of post-judgment motions and that the claims were timely filed under the Massachusetts discovery rule;  we find the evidence sufficient and affirm on liability (but reverse the multiple damages under Chapter 93A), and vacate and remand the award of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts as the jury and district court could have found them.  See Sampson v. Eaton Corp., 809 F.2d 156, 157 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating, as part of its metal plating and metal finishing operations, uses large quantities of water for bath solutions and rinsing.  This water becomes contaminated with chemicals and metals.  Environmental regulations require that Cambridge Plating decontaminate the wastewater before discharging it into the sewers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco manufactures and sells wastewater treatment systems for commercial users.  In January 1984, Cambridge Plating entered into a contract to purchase, for approximately $398,000, a wastewater treatment system that would remove the contaminants from the water.  As part of the contract, Napco provided a \"performance warranty\" under which Napco warranted that the system, if operated within certain defined limits, would meet all Massachusetts and federal pollution abatement requirements.  The warranty, however, excluded liability for all consequential damages or business losses Cambridge Plating might incur in the event of a breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The system Napco sold to Cambridge Plating used a precipitation process to remove the contaminants from the water.  The wastewater was fed through pipes, and injected with a polymer solution.  The polymers were to attach to the contaminants and then aggregate them to form larger particles, known as \"floc.\"   The floc was to settle out of the water and form sludge at the bottom of a clarifying tank.  The clean water layer on top would be discharged into the sewer and Cambridge Plating would properly dispose of the sludge left behind in the tank.  \"Flocculation,\" the joining of the smaller particles into bigger ones, was absolutely critical to the success of the wastewater treatment system.  Absent proper flocculation, contaminants would remain suspended in the water and the water could not be discharged into the sewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For proper flocculation to occur, the polymer solution had to be thoroughly mixed into the wastewater stream.  The system needed some means of creating turbulence in the stream sufficient to perform that mixing.  One mechanism designed to create the necessary turbulence is a \"static mixer.\"   A static mixer is a section of pipe containing a series of \"baffles,\" small metal plates placed at an angle inside the pipe which create resistance and, consequently, turbulence.  The polymer solution is injected into the waste stream just before the water reaches the static mixer.  Once the water with the polymer solution hits the baffles, mixing occurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are alternatives to static mixers to create the required turbulence for a precipitation wastewater treatment system.  As Joseph Aliota, Napco's expert engineer, testified, proper mixing can occur if the system is designed with a series of significant bends in the piping around the area where the polymer is injected into the stream.  Napco did not opt for that design.  The engineering drawings (and other items) for the Cambridge Plating system clearly indicate that the system was to include a static mixer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco did not install the static mixer.  Nor did it tell Cambridge Plating that the static mixer had not been installed.  It did, however, provide Cambridge Plating with a \"tech manual\" containing blueprints and operating instructions for the system.  This manual, given to Cambridge Plating upon completion of the system, purported to show what had actually been built.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  It contained engineering drawings indicating that the static mixer had been installed in the system.  Napco also provided a control panel that depicted the static mixer as being part of the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco's employees were aware that the static mixer had not been installed.  Bob Triplett, Napco's plumbing subcontractor, testified that he was instructed not to install the static mixer at the direction of either Carl Bredfield, a Napco employee, or Bob DeBisschop, Napco's project manager on the Cambridge Plating job.  John Eason, Napco's Manager of Pollution Abatement and the person principally responsible for the design of the system, also testified that he knew the static mixer was not there, although he claimed that the static mixer was installed at first but later removed because it had a tendency to clog.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The system was installed in late 1984.  For several months after installation, the system generally met the applicable pollution limits.  A series of reports from a testing laboratory that Cambridge Plating forwarded to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (\"MWRA\") (the relevant state regulatory body) showed that from roughly March 1985 until September 1985, the system usually met the applicable discharge limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As time went on, however, the system regularly failed to meet the applicable pollution limits and Cambridge Plating complained to Napco about the problems.  Starting in early 1986, Edward Marullo, a Cambridge Plating employee responsible for running the system, called DeBisschop at Napco to complain about the poor performance.  DeBisschop told Marullo to manipulate the polymer and pH levels.  In March 1986, Laurence Tosi, Cambridge Plating's President, called DeBisschop \"yelling and screaming\" about the system's failures.  Tosi thought that Napco's equipment might be at fault, but DeBisschop allayed his concerns, saying that operator error was the likely cause of the problem.  Based on DeBisschop's assurances, Tosi took no further steps to have the system inspected for defects.  Again, in 1987, Marullo called Eason at Napco, who, like his colleague DeBisschop, told Marullo to manipulate the polymer flow and pH level.  At some point, Napco told Tosi that it would be willing to send engineers to examine the system or to train further Cambridge Plating's operators.  But there was a price tag:  Cambridge Plating had to agree to pay $1000 per day for such service.  Tosi declined.  At no time did Napco inform Cambridge Plating that the static mixer was missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, Cambridge Plating hired a series of experts to determine what was wrong.  In December 1986, it hired Patrick Hunt, a waste treatment operator for Hewlett-Packard who was also an instructor of a licensing course for wastewater treatment operators at the University of Lowell.  Hunt inspected the system, recognized \"insufficient floc formation\" as a problem, and made numerous suggestions, most of which related to operation.  Hunt did not discover that the static mixer was missing.  In May 1987, Robert Capaccio, also a wastewater treatment expert, visited Cambridge Plating but failed to detect that the static mixer was missing.  A third group of experts from Memtek, which designs and manufactures wastewater treatment systems, examined the system in September 1987 for the purpose of proposing a course of action.  They recommended a substantial overhaul of the system at a cost that Cambridge Plating considered prohibitive.  During their review, they did not notice that the static mixer was missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Cambridge Plating was trying to identify and solve the problems with the system, it was also becoming a consistent violator of the MWRA's regulations.  In December 1988 the MWRA fined Cambridge Plating $682,250 for discharging excessive levels of contaminants.  Cambridge Plating challenged the fine, which was later reduced to $128,500, but at a cost of approximately $54,000 in attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating tried to manage the system's deficiencies by rigging the system so that the wastewater would be recirculated and retreated in the system.  \"Closed looping,\" as this practice was called, gave more time for flocculation to occur.  It also slowed down production considerably.  When there was closed looping, the system had to process both the retreated wastewater and the incoming wastewater generated by production.  From 1985 to February 1989, the closed looping was accomplished by attaching flexible hoses to the system.  In February 1989, Cambridge Plating replaced the flexible hoses with hard piping to create permanent closed looping.  Cambridge Plating also shut down its zinc plating operation because, even with closed looping, the system could not remove the contaminants from that operation.  Because of its slowdown in production capacity, Cambridge Plating's business began to deteriorate.  Net sales declined from a high of approximately $6.2 million in 1985 to approximately $4.8 million in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1989 Cambridge Plating hired Peter Moleux, another expert in wastewater treatment systems.  Moleux reviewed Napco's proposal and copies of the engineering drawings.  By chance, Moleux had been given a bad photocopy of the drawings.  The portion of the drawings that depicted the static mixer did not appear on the photocopy.  He decided to look for the static mixer in the system.  He physically examined the system and inspected the area of the system where the static mixer should have been.  Because of his expertise, he noticed that the piping looked different than it should have if the static mixer had been installed.  He later confirmed that the static mixer had not been installed.  He told Cambridge Plating that the mixer was missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, on March 17, 1989, Cambridge Plating sent a letter to Napco enclosing a draft complaint \"concerning difficulties\" Cambridge Plating had experienced with Napco.  The draft complaint mentioned the missing static mixer and the letter requested an \"amicable resolution.\"   Napco ignored the letter, never agreeing to come to a meeting to seek an amicable resolution nor agreeing to fix the problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Moleux's discovery, Cambridge Plating did not order the static mixer until December 1989.  It arrived at the plant in January 1990 but was not installed until May 1990.  Installation required the plant to be shut down for one day.  Once the static mixer was installed, the system's performance improved dramatically, and Cambridge Plating was able to discontinue, for the most part, closed looping.  The static mixer cost $620.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating sued Napco on June 22, 1990 charging breach of contract (including willful repudiation of warranty), intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and violation of Chapter 93A. Napco subsequently moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted the motion, holding that Cambridge Plating's claims were time-barred.  This court reversed and remanded for trial, see Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v. Napco, Inc.  (Cambridge Plating I), 991 F.2d 21, 22 (1st Cir.1993), holding that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Cambridge Plating could benefit from the discovery rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the case was tried to a jury in September 1994.  The district court submitted Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b) special interrogatories to the jury on the statute of limitations question, the three common law counts, and the Chapter 93A count.  The jury answered all of the interrogatories in Cambridge Plating's favor, returned a general verdict on each of the common law counts, and awarded Cambridge Plating $12,183,120.  The district court treated as advisory the jury's answers to the Rule 49(b) interrogatories on the Chapter 93A count, and, on February 7, 1995, the district court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law on the Chapter 93A count.  See Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v. NAPCO, Inc.  (Cambridge Plating II), 876 F.Supp. 326 (D.Mass.1995).  In that opinion, the district court concluded that the Chapter 93A count was timely, that Napco had violated Chapter 93A, and that Cambridge Plating was entitled to compensatory damages in the amount of $3,363,120.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court also concluded that the violation of Chapter 93A was \"willful or knowing\" and ordered a punitive award of double damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco filed post-judgment motions for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial, remittitur, and amended findings on the Chapter 93A claim.  After Cambridge Plating argued that the post-judgment motions failed to set forth with sufficient specificity the grounds for relief, the district court struck all of the motions, except the motion for remittitur.  The district court then granted a remittitur in the amount of $7,839,000 and gave Cambridge Plating the option of accepting the remittitur, thereby accepting a reduced damage award on the common law counts in the amount of $4,344,120, or submitting to a new trial.  See Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v. NAPCO, Inc.  (Cambridge Plating III), 890 F.Supp. 55, 59 (D.Mass. 1995).  Cambridge Plating accepted the remittitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco now challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, both as to liability and damages.  Alternatively, it seeks a new trial due to instructional error.  It also argues that the district court should have limited the damages even more.  We turn first to the question of our scope of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Scope Of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision to strike Napco's post-judgment motions affects the scope of our review.  Napco challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show willful or intentional misconduct, seeking a judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial on the \"intentional\" counts:  intentional misrepresentation, willful repudiation of warranty and Chapter 93A.  This court will not, however, review sufficiency challenges absent a proper motion in the district court for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.  See Johnson v. New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R.R. Co., 344 U.S. 48, 54, 73 S.Ct. 125, 128, 97 L.Ed. 77 (1952) (motion for j.n.o.v.);  Pinkham v. Burgess, 933 F.2d 1066, 1070 (1st Cir.1991) (motion for new trial);  cf. Hammond v. T.J. Litle &amp; Co., Inc., 82 F.3d 1166, 1171 (1st Cir.1996) (\"It is beyond peradventure that in order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, a party must first have presented the claim to the district court, either by moving for judgment as a matter of law before the case is submitted to the jury and renewing that motion after the verdict, Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), (b), or by moving for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59.\").  If the district court acted properly in striking the motions, the motions are nullities, and, under Johnson and Pinkham, Napco is barred from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.  We believe, however, that the district court understandably but improperly struck the post-judgment motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered judgment on February 8, 1995.  The next day, Napco moved for an extension of time for filing its memoranda in support of its post-judgment motions, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Plaintiff has prevailed on four separate and distinct legal claims.  Therefore, in order to obtain postjudgment relief, Napco must challenge all four bases for the judgment.  This will require Napco to argue several substantial legal and factual issues including, for example, the recoverability of lost profits for negligent misrepresentation, the sufficiency of the evidence of intentional misrepresentation and of repudiation of warranty, the statute of limitations (three-year and four-year), as well as issues relating to Chapter 93A and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, the district court granted the motion, giving Napco until March 1, 1995 to file the post-judgment memoranda.  On February 17, six days before the 10-day time limit for filing post-judgment motions expired, Napco filed a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) and 59.  In summary fashion, the motion outlined its subject matter and said the grounds would be set forth in the March 1 memorandum to be filed later in accord with the Court's extension.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Also on February 17, Napco filed a similar motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b) and 59 seeking either to amend the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law or to have a new trial on the Chapter 93A claim.

In granting Cambridge Plating's motion, except on the remittitur issue, the district court refused to take into consideration Napco's extension motion or any of the other surrounding circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 7(b)(1) requires that motions \"state with particularity the grounds therefor.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b)(1).  Napco's post-judgment motions are subject to the requirements of Rule 7(b)(1).  The particularity requirement, however, is to be read flexibly in \"recognition of the peculiar circumstances of the case.\"  Registration Control Sys., Inc. v. Compusystems, Inc., 922 F.2d 805, 808 (Fed.Cir.1990).  This is because Rule 7 is designed \"to afford notice of the grounds and prayer of the motion to both the court and the opposing party, providing that party with a meaningful opportunity to respond and the court with enough information to process the motion correctly.\"  Id. at 807.   When a motion is challenged for lack of particularity the question is \"whether any party is prejudiced by a lack of particularity or 'whether the court can comprehend the basis for the motion and deal with it fairly.' \"  Id. at 807-08 (quoting 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 1192, at 42 (1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Napco's motion was at best sloppy practice, we believe that it was sufficiently particular when read in conjunction with the extension motion and prior filings.  Although the extension motion was not filed simultaneously with the Rule 50(b), 59 and 52(b) motions, it was filed only a week before, within the ten-day period, and was obviously closely related to the Rule 50(b) motion.  Compare Lac Du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Wisconsin, 957 F.2d 515, 517 (7th Cir.)  (supporting memorandum filed with insufficiently particular motion), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 829, 113 S.Ct. 91, 121 L.Ed.2d 53 (1992).  The extension motion specified the bases of the judgment that Napco \"must challenge,\" including the sufficiency of the evidence on the intentional misrepresentation claim and the willful repudiation of warranty claim, as well as issues relating to Chapter 93A and damages.  Napco thus represented to both the court and Cambridge Plating the grounds for its post-judgment motions.  No claim is made that there was any intervening event that would have made the representations in the extension motion unreliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating makes a passing argument in its brief that it was unable to respond to, or the district court to process, Napco's motions.  If the Rule 50(b), 59 and 52(b) motions are viewed in isolation, Cambridge Plating has a point.  But the motions cannot be viewed in isolation.  In addition to the closely filed extension motion, significant briefing on the Chapter 93A issues had just been completed and Napco had earlier made quite a detailed Rule 50(a) motion, of which the Rule 50(b) motion was a \"renewal.\"   In short, the record shows that Napco was taking steps specifically to make evidentiary challenges to the verdict on all of the major issues litigated at trial.  The grounds Napco would press in its post-judgment motions were sufficiently known.  The motions under Rules 50(b), 59 and 52(b) were adequate, although barely, under the circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court premised its decision on the belief that the law prevented it from looking beyond the four corners of the motion to determine whether the motion had stated its grounds with sufficient particularity.  While understandable, such a view of Rule 7(b)(1) is, in our view, too narrow.  \"Overly technical\" evaluations of particularity are disfavored.  Wright &amp; Miller, supra, &#167; 1192, at 43.  Courts routinely take into consideration other closely filed pleadings to determine whether sufficient notice of the grounds for the motion are given and the opposing party has a fair opportunity to respond.  See Chippewa Indians, 957 F.2d at 517 (motion failing to state grounds is sufficiently particular where supporting memorandum adequately discusses the grounds);  Brown v. United States Postal Serv., 860 F.2d 884, 887 (9th Cir.1988) (motion for reconsideration was adequate under Rule 7 even though a particular ground was omitted, where the parties had already briefed and argued the issue and no prejudice would result);  see also King v. Mordowanec, 46 F.R.D. 474, 477 (D.R.I.1969) (where grounds for Rule 60(b) motion were stated at oral argument previous day and were discussed after filing, during in-chambers argument, motion did not run afoul of Rule 7(b)(1) particularity requirement).  Accordingly, we reach Napco's various challenges to the sufficiency (and weight) of the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Liability</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Statute Of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco first argues that none of the claims survive the statute of limitations.  Cambridge Plating filed suit on June 22, 1990.  A four-year statute of limitations governs the Chapter 93A and breach of warranty claims.  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-725 (contract for sale of goods);  Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 260, &#167; 5A (Chapter 93A).  A three-year statute of limitations governs the intentional and negligent misrepresentation claims.  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 260, &#167; 2A.  As established in Cambridge Plating I, 991 F.2d at 27, Cambridge Plating must rely on the discovery rule to prove its claims were timely filed.  The discovery rule \" 'prescribes as crucial the date when a plaintiff discovers, or any earlier date when she should reasonably have discovered, that she has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant's conduct.' \"  Id. (quoting Bowen v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Inc., 408 Mass. 204, 557 N.E.2d 739, 740-41 (1990)).  The discovery rule here \"turns on when the company should have known that Napco might be responsible for the water treatment system's failing performance.\"  Cambridge Plating I, 991 F.2d at 29.   The question to be resolved at trial was whether Cambridge Plating \"knew or should have known of its claims before June 22, 1987 [or June 22, 1986].\"  Id.  Napco argues that the evidence was insufficient for a jury to conclude that Cambridge Plating should not have known of its claims before the pertinent cut-off dates.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of the timeliness of the breach of warranty and Chapter 93A claims under the four-year statute is, we believe, largely answered by the admirable description of the evidence provided by the district court in light of our previous opinion in Cambridge Plating I. The evidence at trial showed that Cambridge Plating was aware that the system was complex and that the performance warranty Napco provided contained the implicit condition that the system be operated properly.  At least at first, Cambridge Plating could reasonably have believed that its own inexperience, rather than Napco's defective equipment, was to blame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, at some point, when things were no better, Cambridge Plating should have thought that something other than operator error was causing the problem.  And as Napco points out, there was evidence that such a point came for Cambridge Plating either in early 1986, when Marullo complained to Debisschop about the system, or March 1986, when Tosi \"kept yelling and screaming\" at Debisschop that the problems were due to the equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the critical question is whether Cambridge Plating reasonably relied on Napco's responses to those early 1986 inquiries that operator error, rather than equipment defect, was the cause of the trouble.  The fact that Tosi complained vociferously that the equipment was at fault is not dispositive if DeBisschop was reasonably able to convince Tosi he was wrong.  Napco had considerably superior expertise in this area.  The absence of the static mixer was not something Cambridge Plating, with its level of expertise, should have detected.  We believe that under such circumstances, when Napco gave Tosi its \"assur[ances]\" that the problem had to be with Cambridge Plating's operators, Cambridge Plating reasonably took Napco at its word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The misrepresentation claims, governed by a three-year statute, were also timely.  Cambridge Plating did not sit idle during the next twelve months.  When Napco's suggestions did not solve the problem, Cambridge Plating hired Patrick Hunt, in late 1986, to evaluate the system.  In January 1987 Hunt gave Cambridge Plating his recommendations, which suggested operational changes but not that the static mixer was either missing or not working properly.  If Hunt were unqualified to examine the system, then Cambridge Plating might have difficulty arguing that it was acting reasonably.  But Hunt was an expert in wastewater treatment systems and competent to evaluate the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Was Hunt's failure to discover that the static mixer was missing reasonable?   See Cambridge Plating I, 991 F.2d at 29-30.   We think the jury was entitled to think so.  First, the absence of the static mixer was not something that could be easily detected from a physical observation of the system.  Indeed, other experts after Hunt who looked over the system were also fooled.  Second, Napco had supplied to Cambridge Plating drawings representing that the static mixer had been installed.  According to Cambridge Plating, these drawings were \"as built\" drawings.  Napco disputes Cambridge Plating's characterization of the drawings, pointing to testimony that \"as built\" drawings, as the term is technically used, were never prepared.  Yet regardless of whether the drawings technically could be called \"as built,\" Napco admitted supplying the drawings to Cambridge Plating in the tech manual \"[t]o show what was built.\"Perhaps, given the problems with the system, the accuracy of the drawings should have been called into question at this time.  The jury was entitled to think otherwise.  The system was extremely complex and the cause of the malfunction could have been any number of problems, including, as Napco points out, problems of design.  The factfinder could reasonably conclude on this record that the probability the drawings were false was sufficiently low that questioning the accuracy of the drawings would be low on Cambridge Plating's (or Hunt's) diagnostic checklist.  The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the claims were timely.  Nor was such a finding against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Special interrogatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco alternatively argues that a new trial should be granted on the misrepresentation counts because the special interrogatory submitted to the jury on this point was defectively worded.  Over Napco's objection, the court submitted interrogatory 1(b), which asked:  \"Should plaintiff Cambridge Plating reasonably have known before June 22, 1987 of defendant Napco's failure to install the static mixer?\"  (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of this interrogatory is for abuse of discretion.  See Frank Briscoe Co., Inc. v. Clark County, 857 F.2d 606, 614 (9th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1048, 109 S.Ct. 1957, 104 L.Ed.2d 426 (1989).  Abuse of discretion may be found if the interrogatories are worded in such a way that they are likely to mislead or confuse the jury or inaccurately state the issues.  Id.  Although Napco's argument has some merit, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating I stated that the appropriate test for the discovery rule was whether Cambridge Plating \"should have known that Napco might be responsible for the water treatment system's failing performance.\"  Cambridge Plating I, 991 F.2d at 29.   Napco points out that the opinion drew no specific distinction among the claims and argues that it was improper to direct the jury's focus onto the failure to discover the static mixer specifically.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Napco also relies on the passage from the opinion stating that \"the statute of limitations will begin to run once the plaintiff has enough information to target the defendant as a suspect, though not necessarily to identify the defendant as a culprit.\"  Id. at 29-30.   Under Napco's reading, all claims--warranty, negligence and fraud--would have the same trigger date under the discovery rule:  when Cambridge Plating should have thought Napco might be responsible for the problems with the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating I did not say that.  The opinion does not address the question specifically of what information is needed to \"target the defendant as a suspect\" for a breach of contract as compared to that information needed to \"target the defendant as a suspect\" for fraud.  The information needed to target the defendant as a suspect is, in fact, different for each claim.  Although Cambridge Plating may have had reason to know that Napco might be in breach of its warranty when the system did not perform up to snuff and Cambridge Plating had ruled out operator error, that does not mean that Cambridge Plating had reason to know that Napco had deceived it.  Cf. Childers Oil Co., Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 960 F.2d 1265, 1275 (4th Cir.1992) (Luttig, J., dissenting) (\"[A]lthough appellants knew or should have known when construction of the station began that Exxon had breached its contract, appellants did not have reason to know of the possibility of deception until they learned in 1988 that Exxon had always intended to build a competing station.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, a cause of action for deceit accrues when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the misrepresentation.  See Friedman v. Jablonski, 371 Mass. 482, 358 N.E.2d 994, 997 (1976) (cause of action for misrepresentation in the sale of real estate accrues when the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of the misrepresentation);  see also Tagliente v. Himmer, 49 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1991) (\"The burden is on the plaintiff to prove that in the exercise of reasonable diligence she could not have known of the misrepresentation within the statute of limitations.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In this case, the misrepresentation was in the failure to disclose that the static mixer had not been installed.  Thus, under Massachusetts law, the cause of action for misrepresentation did not accrue until Cambridge Plating should have known that the static mixer had not been installed.  The special interrogatory was not erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Intentional Misrepresentation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating had the burden of proving that Napco had engaged in an intentional misrepresentation.  Cambridge Plating alleged in its complaint that Napco fraudulently induced it to purchase the wastewater system by falsely promising that the system would contain a static mixer.  At trial, however, the district court did not believe that Cambridge Plating had presented sufficient evidence to show such fraudulent inducement, and did not submit that theory to the jury.  The district court, nevertheless, believed that Cambridge Plating had presented sufficient evidence to show fraudulent nondisclosure<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and, accordingly, charged the jury on that theory.  The jury subsequently found, as framed in the special interrogatories, that Napco had \"intentionally conceal[ed]\" its failure to install the static mixer \"while aware of the System's failure to meet the applicable discharge limits\" and was thus liable for intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco raises two challenges to this verdict.  First, it argues that the evidence was insufficient to show fraudulent nondisclosure.  Second, it argues that, regardless of the evidence, the intentional misrepresentation verdict was tainted by a defective jury instruction.  It requests that either judgment be entered in its favor or a new trial granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of fraudulent nondisclosure.  To set aside a jury verdict and enter a contrary verdict for Napco, we must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to Cambridge Plating, drawing all possible inferences in its favor.  See Havinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co., 24 F.3d 1480, 1483 (1st Cir.1994).  To set aside a verdict and remand for a new trial based on the evidence, Napco must show that the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Cambridge Plating, or would work a clear miscarriage of justice.  See id. at 1482-83.   Napco cannot meet either standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco's sufficiency challenge largely rests on a single proposition:  that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that Napco knew or believed that the static mixer was responsible for the problems with the system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  In Napco's words, \"every piece of proof bearing on the issue confirmed that Napco never believed the static mixer was necessary, and in fact, believed the mixer might impair system performance.\"  (Emphasis in original.)   But there was such evidence:  Napco designed the system to include the static mixer.  It knew that the mixer was originally included in the system to create the proper mixing of the polymer solution, without which flocculation would be hindered.  This evidence, when combined with the evidence that Napco knew the mixer had not been installed (so that the omission was not a mere oversight) and that it knew the system was not working, adequately supports the conclusion that Napco intentionally failed to tell Cambridge Plating that the static mixer was missing, knowing it was responsible for the system's problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco protests that it simply made a \"good faith (and, at worst, negligent) professional judgment that a mixer was not material to the system.\"   After all, it argues, what did it have to gain from omitting a $620 part from the system or from hiding a problem that could be inexpensively cured.  Napco relies on testimony from Triplett, Napco's subcontractor, Aliota, Napco's expert, and Eason, Napco's manager of pollution abatement.  But Triplett's testimony and Aliota's testimony do not much help Napco.  Although both Triplett and Aliota testified that the use of \"elbows,\" or pipe bends, could create the necessary turbulence in lieu of the static mixer, Napco did not show that such \"elbows\" were specifically designed into the system.  More to the point, Aliota, who was not a fact witness, did not testify as to what the people at Napco were thinking in leaving out the static mixer, and Triplett, at best, had only a \"vague recollection\" of \"some discussion that when the pumps came on they hit the two--they hit a 90 and a T, and that was enough turbulence to mix with the polymer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, unfortunately for Napco, the jury could have found Eason's testimony in a number of respects not to be credible.  His account of the events surrounding the decision to omit the static mixer conflicted somewhat with that of other Napco witnesses.  Triplett testified that the mixer was never installed, while Eason said it was installed but taken out.  Eason's testimony that the static mixer was omitted because it was \"minor\" was damaged by his admission on cross-examination that he could not find even one other component depicted on the drawings that was \"minor.\"   Napco does not point to other evidence presented to the jury (for example, contemporaneous memos showing that Napco had made a judgment that the mixer was irrelevant) that corroborates Eason's testimony.  In short, the \"professional judgment\" theory was largely a credibility question.  In light of the shaky aspects of Eason's testimony, the jury was entitled to conclude that Eason was not believable and that Triplett's \"vague recollection\" was not enough to rebut the circumstantial evidence (particularly the drawings) that Napco knew the absence of the static mixer was the problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco properly makes the point that it \"strains credulity\" to suppose that Napco would expose itself to such drastic liability over a $620 part that took one day to install.  Why Napco would do so is something of a puzzle and could raise questions about the reliability of the jury's finding that Napco intentionally concealed the absence of the mixer.  But Napco's behavior is not wholly inexplicable.  It might be explained in terms of the theory of \"agency costs\":  the aberrant conduct occurred when Napco's interests in avoiding exposure to drastic liability diverged from those of its employees.  Cf. AMPAT/Midwest, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 896 F.2d 1035, 1043 (7th Cir.1990) (Posner, J.)  (seemingly irrational behavior on the part of a corporation may be explained by the \"divergence of objectives\" between the corporation and its employees).  For example, the designer Eason and the project manager DeBisschop may each have wished to avoid individual blame for the defects in the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Napco's current focus on plaintiff's proof of scienter represents a shift from its defense at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Its defense to the misrepresentation count principally focussed on whether the static mixer was in fact material to the problem.  Moreover, Napco's defense to the breach of warranty claim, which rested in large part on the assertion that it never had any idea that Cambridge Plating's system was not meeting the effluent requirements, was in considerable tension with any defense made on the misrepresentation claims that, once it heard about the problems, Napco made a judgment that the static mixer was unimportant.  Not surprisingly, then, there was little specific testimony that Napco seriously considered Cambridge Plating's complaints and then made a judgment that the static mixer was the problem.  Napco principally chose to take the position at trial that it did not know there was a problem, rather than that it thought there was a problem but the cause was something else.  Since there was competent evidence showing that Eason and DeBisschop were contacted about the problems with the system on numerous occasions, and that the system worked after the static mixer was installed, Napco was vulnerable on the intentional misrepresentation count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating needed to show intentional misrepresentation only by a preponderance of the evidence.  See Compagnie De Reassurance D'Ile De France v. New England Reinsurance Corp., 57 F.3d 56, 72 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 564, 133 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995).  Under this standard, there was sufficient evidence of fraudulent nondisclosure, and the district court was entitled to submit the theory to the jury.  The verdict was also not against the weight of the evidence and a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

[the] defendant willfully concealed from the plaintiff the absence of the static mixer when it knew ... that the discharge limits were not being met and that the inclusion of the static mixer would, at least to some extent, enable the system to perform as it was intended.\"   Following this initial charge, plaintiff's counsel requested an instruction specifying that materiality was to be measured against an objective standard.  In response,the court gave the following supplemental instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>[I]n discussing the state of mind of the defendant with regard to the importance of the static mixer to the system ... the standard is objective.  It's not what the defendant did or did not subjectively think about it.  It's what would a reasonable manufacturer or seller under the same circumstances have thought about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco argues that this instruction \"conflated the torts of intentional and negligent misrepresentation\" and was \"manifestly erroneous.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In Napco's view, it cannot be held liable unless it actually knew the static mixer was material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard under which we review this argument depends upon whether Napco properly preserved it.  Cambridge Plating protests that Napco has not preserved this argument because it failed to lodge a proper objection before the jury retired to consider its verdict.  Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, objections must \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.  An objection based on one ground does not preserve appellate review of a different ground.  See Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 809 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955, 109 S.Ct. 392, 102 L.Ed.2d 381 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco states that the instruction was given over its \"opposition.\"   But Napco's objection to the charge only identified three problems with the instruction, and not the issue it now raises.  Napco complained that (1) the complaint did not fairly disclose the nondisclosure theory, (2) the theory was not supported by the evidence, and (3) there was no obligation on the part of the seller to disclose.  Napco did not object that the instruction was incorrect because it failed to make clear that actual knowledge of materiality was required for liability, nor did Napco object that the instruction conflated negligent and intentional misrepresentation.  Thus, Napco failed to \"state[ ] distinctly\" the argument it makes now, i.e., that the instruction imposed an incorrect scienter requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco urges that colloquies occurring days before the charge satisfy Rule 51.  Without considering whether such colloquies may be used to determine compliance, the colloquies Napco directs us to do not contain any specific statement that Napco needed to have \"actual knowledge\" of the static mixer's materiality to be liable.  Napco's contention that this lack of specificity should be excused because the fraudulent nondisclosure theory was \"novel\" and came as a \"surprise\" to counsel is contrary to what the record shows.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, Napco concedes that the district court charged the jury correctly on the scienter element of intentional misrepresentation during its initial charge.  It was only after plaintiff objected to the charge, suggesting that the court make clear that materiality be viewed from an objective point of view, that the court gave the supplemental instruction.  The supplemental instruction thus created a new issue, independent of the supposed surprise over the fraudulent nondisclosure theory.  Despite this, Napco's only objections to the supplemental charge related to the charging of the fraudulent nondisclosure theory generally, not to the new ambiguity the instruction created over the scienter requirement.  On the question of scienter, Napco remained silent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a proper objection, review is for plain error.  On this record, the plain error hurdle is too high for Napco to overcome.  \"Plain error [ ] is a rare species in civil litigation.\"  Gay v. P.K. Lindsay Co., Inc., 666 F.2d 710, 712 n. 1 (1st Cir.1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 975, 102 S.Ct. 2240, 72 L.Ed.2d 849 (1982);  see also Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1196 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[T]he plain error standard, high in any event, ... is near its zenith in the Rule 51 milieu.\"  (internal quotations omitted)).  \"[I]t applies only where the error results in a clear miscarriage of justice or seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Clausen, 21 F.3d at 1196 (internal quotations omitted).  Napco cannot show on this record that a miscarriage of justice will result if the error is not corrected.  There was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to conclude that Napco knew that the static mixer was the problem with the system.  Nor can Napco show that the error seriously affects the integrity or impairs public confidence in the proceedings.  Under the circumstances, the supplemental instruction did not reach the \"pinnacle of fault\" envisioned by the plain error standard.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Willful Breach Of Warranty</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco's warranty excludes liability for consequential damages.  By its terms, this damages limitation provision bars Cambridge Plating from recovering consequential damages and, under usual circumstances, would be enforceable.  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-719(3);  Deerskin Trading Post, Inc. v. Spencer Press, Inc., 398 Mass. 118, 495 N.E.2d 303, 306 (1986).  Massachusetts law provides, however, that the damages limitation provision is not enforceable if Napco either willfully repudiated or was willfully dilatory in performing its warranty obligations.  Cf. Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 406 Mass. 369, 548 N.E.2d 182, 186 (1990).  The jury concluded that Napco willfully repudiated or was dilatory in performing its warranty obligations.  Napco claims this finding was not supported by the evidence and, in any event, was fatally tainted by the district court's \"state of mind\" supplemental instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments are worth only brief comment.  Napco concedes that evidence it knew the static mixer was to blame \"might well amount to 'willful repudiation.' \"   Since Cambridge Plating adduced sufficient evidence of this fact, the willful breach of warranty verdict stands.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  As for Napco's claim of instructional error, Napco's challenge suffers the same fate as it did on the intentional misrepresentation count:  there was no objection and no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

Napco challenges both aspects of the district court's decision.  Review of the district court's findings of fact is for clear error, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a);  review of its conclusions of law is de novo.  Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 287, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1789, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Neither \"unfair\" nor \"deceptive\" is specifically defined in the statute;  nor has the case law supplied precise definitions.  There is a rubric:  \"The objectionable conduct must attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\"  Levings v.

But, as the Supreme Judicial Court has recently observed, the rhetoric of \"rascality\" is \"uninstructive.\"  Massachusetts Employers Ins. Exch. v.

Blue Cross of Massachusetts, Inc., 403 Mass. 722, 532 N.E.2d 660, 664 (1989) (\"a violation of G.L. c. 93A, &#167; 11, need not be premised on a violation of an independent common law or statutory duty\"), may be sufficient.  See Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v.

The district court appropriately found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>NAPCO, which knew throughout that the static mixer was not installed, learned that the system was not performing as warranted and nevertheless 1) failed to reveal knowledge within its possession which would have stemmed the tide of damages being caused by its own misconduct and 2) misdirected plaintiff's attention to operator error as the source of the System's shortcomings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating II, 876 F.Supp. at 337.   This finding, which was not clearly erroneous, supports the conclusion that Napco behaved both \"deceptively\" and \"unfairly\" under Chapter 93A.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Napco's argument--that Chapter 93A liability is inappropriate because its decision to omit the static mixer was simply a professional judgment--misses the mark.  Even if at the time of installation Napco believed that the probability was small that the static mixer would make a difference to the system's performance, the probability was large enough that it should not have been ignored once Napco learned that Cambridge Plating was having problems.  Yet even after Cambridge Plating had complained about the system's performance, Napco never seriously reconsidered its professed judgment about the static mixer.  Napco also knew all along that it had provided Cambridge Plating with inaccurate drawings.  So Napco also knew that Cambridge Plating would be handicapped in reaching its own conclusion on the matter.  Where Napco knew the system was not performing as warranted, Napco was not free to ignore the fact that Cambridge Plating might benefit from knowing that the mixer had been omitted.  Napco's silence became sufficiently \"unscrupulous\" to fall within a \"penumbra ... of [an] established concept of unfairness.\"  PMP Assoc., 321 N.E.2d at 917.   We therefore affirm the district court's judgment of liability for single damages under Chapter 93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We part company with the district court on the question of punitive damages.  Punitive damages are awarded only for \"willful or knowing\" violations of section 2 of Chapter 93A. Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93A, &#167; 11 (providing for up to three, but not less than two, times actual damages for willful or knowing violations of section 2).  Here, the district court imposed double damages based on essentially the same finding upon which it imposed substantive liability under Chapter 93A:  that Napco failed to disclose what it knew about the static mixer while knowing that it was material to the problem.  See Cambridge Plating II, 876 F.Supp. at 346.   At first blush, this conclusion may seem sound, given the \"willful or knowing\" language of the statute.  Napco's conduct, which also amounts to intentional misrepresentation (and willful breach of warranty), clearly involves a certain level of deliberateness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But shades of culpability are supposed to matter in applying the punitive damages provision of the statute.  See Kansallis Fin.  Ltd. v. Fern, 421 Mass. 659, 659 N.E.2d 731, 738 (1996) (\"[T]he Legislature envisaged multiple damage awards against those defendants with a higher degree of culpability than that sufficient to ground simple liability.\");   Heller v. Silverbranch Constr.  Corp., 376 Mass. 621, 382 N.E.2d 1065, 1070 (1978) (only \"callous and intentional violations\" merit multiple damages);  VMark Software, 642 N.E.2d at 596 (court refused to multiply damages in intentional misrepresentation case stating that section 11 multiple damages are an \"extraordinary remedy\" not applicable to a case of \"dogged bumbling\");  cf. International Fidelity Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 387 Mass. 841, 443 N.E.2d 1308, 1317 (1983) (\"The Massachusetts legislature consciously enacted a rule whereby defendant's [Chapter 93A] liability is measured by the degree of his culpability.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liability under Chapter 93A for conduct amounting to intentional misrepresentation (or breach of warranty like that here) does not automatically trigger punitive damages.  There must be something more.  See VMark Software, 642 N.E.2d at 595 (liability for intentional misrepresentation supported Chapter 93A liability, but misrepresentations were not \"made so 'knowingly' as to warrant the punitive sanctions of double damages under Chapter 93A\");  International Totalizing Sys., Inc. v. PepsiCo, Inc., 29 Mass.App.Ct. 424, 560 N.E.2d 749, 757 (1990) (defendant liable for \"knowing\" misrepresentation and failure to disclose also violated Chapter 93A, but was not liable for multiple damages because of the absence of \"willful or intentional conduct within the purview of [Chapter 93A]\" (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appropriately recognized these principles.  See Cambridge Plating II, 876 F.Supp. at 346.   It believed, however, that its findings supported the conclusion that Napco's conduct was sufficiently egregious to warrant a punitive sanction.  We do not think so.  If Napco's conduct was fraud and a willful repudiation of warranty, it was only marginally so.  Napco had reason to believe that operator error was the cause of Cambridge Plating's problems.  The system, after all, had worked for a period of time after its installation.  Indeed, Cambridge Plating itself took nearly a year and a half to install the static mixer once it found it was missing.  Napco did not stand to profit by its actions, and there was no evidence that Napco acted maliciously towards Cambridge Plating or remained silent so that it could watch Cambridge Plating go into distress.  Rather, as the district court noted, this was a case where Napco simply ignored the problem hoping that it would somehow resolve itself.  Id.;  cf. VMark Software, 642 N.E.2d at 596 (\"The inept blend of hopeful dissembling and dogged bumbling displayed by VMark does not, however, reflect the culpable state of mind required for imposition of &#167; 11's extraordinary damage penalty.\"  (internal quotation omitted)).  This evidence does not rise to the level of callousness or meretriciousness that would justify multiple damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  See Wasserman v. Agnastopoulos, 22 Mass.App.Ct. 672, 497 N.E.2d 19, 24-25 (setting aside award of multiple damages because facts as found by the trial court did not rise to the \"purposeful level of culpability\" contemplated by the statute), rev. den., 398 Mass. 1105, 499 N.E.2d 298 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded Cambridge Plating $3,363,120 in compensatory damages for the Chapter 93A violation.  The district court then remitted the $12,183,120 jury award on the common law counts to $4,344,120, reasoning that no rational jury could award more than $4,161,000 in lost profits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  See Cambridge Plating III, 890 F.Supp. at 59.   Napco argues that the award of lost profits still \"exceeds any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based upon the evidence.\"   See Eastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., Inc., 40 F.3d 492, 502 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2247, 132 L.Ed.2d 256 (1995).  Napco argues that the entire award of lost profits should be set aside or be further remitted to reflect (1) Cambridge Plating's failure to mitigate damages and (2) Cambridge Plating's failure to account for selling, general and administrative (\"SG &amp; A\") expenses associated with the lost profits.  Napco separately argues that the award of lost profits for the negligent misrepresentation count must be set aside because such damages are not cognizable under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Sufficiency Of The Evidence On Lost Profits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating had the burden of providing a reasonably certain basis to believe that Napco's wrongful conduct caused the loss of anticipated profits, cf. Augat, Inc. v. Aegis, Inc.  (Augat I), 409 Mass.165, 565 N.E.2d 415, 421 (1991) (plaintiff must prove losses would not have occurred but for the wrongful conduct), and proving with sufficient certainty the amount of those anticipated profits.  \"The nature of the business or venture upon which the anticipated profits are claimed must be such as to support an inference of definite profits grounded upon a reasonably sure basis of facts.\"  Augat, Inc. v. Aegis, Inc.  (Augat II), 417 Mass.484, 631 N.E.2d 995, 998 (1994) (internal quotations omitted).  Because every calculation of lost profits has some element of uncertainty, a plaintiff need not calculate lost profits with \"mathematical exactness.\"  Id.  But they cannot be \"remote, speculative [or] hypothetical.\"  Id.  Napco argues that Cambridge Plating failed to establish the critical connection between the defective wastewater treatment system and Cambridge Plating's inability to do plating work.  On this point Napco is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating provided evidence of causation principally through three witnesses--Mssrs.  Tosi, Moleux and Joseph Finn, Cambridge Plating's damages expert.  Tosi testified that, in the plating business, customers insist on quick turn-around time.  He also testified that because the wastewater treatment system was not working properly Cambridge Plating had to employ closed looping, which slowed down the amount of wastewater fed through the system, consequently slowing down the plating process.  Moleux confirmed that closed looping \"required Cambridge Plating to either partially or totally shut down.\"   Additionally, Tosi testified that the zinc plating operation closed because the system was unable to remove sufficiently the contaminants.  Further, Debisschop directly linked the wastewater treatment system to a plating operation's profitability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Finn testified that until 1985, the first full year the wastewater treatment system was operational, Cambridge Plating had generally experienced an increase in sales.  He also testified that for the years following the installation of the system, Cambridge Plating's revenues decreased from approximately $6.2 million in 1985 to $4.8 million in 1989, and net income declined from approximately $284,000 in 1985 to a net loss of approximately $131,000 in 1989.  During this time period, the plating industry as a whole averaged modest growth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating provided a simple before-and-after financial picture of an established company.  It also provided testimony from people expert in plating and in wastewater treatment that the difference in profits was due to a slowdown in production and failure to meet effluent limitations, both of which could be traced back to the malfunctioning wastewater treatment system.  Napco chose not to present an expert of its own to break the connection between the financial decline and the malfunctioning system.  Instead, Napco was content to try to poke holes in Cambridge Plating's damages testimony.  \"This [was] a risky strategy, and it failed.\"  AMPAT/Midwest, 896 F.2d at 1046 (internal citation omitted).  There was sufficient evidence of causation to support an award of lost profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Mitigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The general principle is well settled that a party cannot recover for harms that its own reasonable precautions would have avoided.\"  Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., 72 F.3d 190, 204-05 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2500, 135 L.Ed.2d 191 (1996).   Cambridge Plating did not install the static mixer until 15 months after it knew in February 1989 that the mixer was missing.  Installation took one day.  This was an inexcusable failure to mitigate damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court recognized that Cambridge Plating had failed to mitigate its damages.  See Cambridge Plating II, 876 F.Supp. at 345 (\"Once Moleux informed Cambridge Plating that the System was missing a vital part .... [t]he obvious next step was to buy and install a mixer immediately.\").  Nevertheless, in its Chapter 93A decision, the district court awarded damages for both 1990 and 1991 and then discounted them.  It also did not adjust the jury award in its remittitur to take account of this failure to mitigate.  We agree with Napco that both the Chapter 93A and the remittitur rulings were in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating argues that it should be absolved for its failure to mitigate after February 1989 because there would have, in any event, been recovery time.  The recovery time, it says, was needed in order to offset the damage resulting from its new reputation as a polluter, and to get word out to customers that it could fill their needs while complying with the environmental regulations.  This is a plausible theory.  But Cambridge Plating did not provide the type or quantity of proof that Massachusetts law requires to support damages for this \"reputational\" injury sufficient to overcome its failure to mitigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating points to no evidence from customers that it would not have been able to recover business because of its reputation as a polluter.  The one customer who testified, Alfred Jacques of General Electric, did not support Cambridge Plating's reputational injury theory.  The evidence Cambridge Plating relies upon--a statement from DeBisschop agreeing that companies \"tend\" to lose business when they are found to be polluters, Tosi's testimony that Cambridge Plating became \"known as a polluter,\" and an advertisement from Cambridge Plating touting its system--provides scant support for the proposition that there was any reputational harm.  This evidence of reputational injury is also in tension with Finn's testimony that if Cambridge Plating had a working wastewater treatment system, it could have replaced its business \"almost immediately.\"   Even Cambridge Plating states in its brief that \"demand for plating and metal finishing services such as those provided by Cambridge Plating was strong throughout the late 1980s and to the time of trial.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, Cambridge Plating's theory of reputational injury is, to say the least, \"speculative.\"  Augat II, 631 N.E.2d at 998.   Cambridge Plating can find no comfort in the case law that allows for some uncertainty in proving damages in tort cases.  See, e.g., Computer Sys. Eng., Inc. v. Qantel Corp., 740 F.2d 59, 67 (1st Cir.1984).  Those cases reason that some uncertainty is allowed because it has been created by the defendant's wrongful conduct.  Id.  Here, however, the uncertainty for the period following February 1989 was largely caused by Cambridge Plating's own wrongful conduct in failing to mitigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, Napco has conceded that the period through November 1989, or nine months after Cambridge Plating should have installed the static mixer, is a reasonable recovery period.  In the absence of evidence showing Cambridge Plating mitigated its damages, the outer limit for such damages on the record before the trial court was November 1989.  Cf. Augat II, 631 N.E.2d at 1000 (reducing period of lost profits to six months).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also believe that both the Chapter 93A damages and the remittitur should equally take account of Cambridge Plating's failure to mitigate.

See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106 (appellate court may vacate any judgment and remand to require such further proceedings as may be just);  Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline Servs., Inc., 17 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir.1994) (remanding with directions to district court to grant a remittitur).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Of course, plaintiff has the option to seek a new trial on damages in lieu of the remittitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. SG &amp; A Expenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating had to prove lost profits in terms of net profits, not gross profits.  Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, 377 Mass. 159, 385 N.E.2d 1349, 1359 n. 15 (1979).  Generally, this requires that gross profits be adjusted for SG &amp; A expenses.  In this case, however, Cambridge Plating argued that SG &amp; A expenses would not have increased as its sales increased and thus the anticipated gross profits should not be reduced by SG &amp; A expenses.  The district court accepted Cambridge Plating's argument, as do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating relies on the testimony of Finn that \"lost gross profit for Cambridge Plating is the exact same number as the lost net profit for the years in question.\"   Although, as Napco points out, the consolidated financial statements from 1980 to 1985 show a general increase in both sales and SG &amp; A expenses, Finn testified that SG &amp; A expenses increased only 10%-11% as sales increased 30% for the period 1982 to 1984.  Moreover, in 1984, SG &amp; A expenses decreased slightly as sales increased.  From this evidence, Finn believed that there was \"no dependent relationship between S G and A and sales\" and that SG &amp; A expenses would not have necessarily increased as gross profits increased.  Although these inferences from the evidence are weak, they are sufficiently plausible to survive Napco's challenge on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

Lost profits, which are a species of benefit of the bargain damages, are therefore prohibited.  See also Redstone v. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., 583 F.Supp. 74, 76-77 (D.Mass.1984) (lost profits not available for negligent misrepresentation).

Napco placed great reliance on discharge reports sent to the MWRA from March 1985 to September 1985 (shortly after the system was installed) indicating that the system was meeting the discharge limits.  The importance of these reports was hotly contested.  Cambridge Plating explained away these reports by noting that the materials it plated were often different, using different concentrations and types of chemicals, and that the system could handle some jobs but not others.  Cambridge Plating also noted that its closed looping masked the inadequacies of the system, but did not solve them.  The finding that the system did not perform as warranted is not challenged on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The charge was:</p>\n        <p>The fraud is in the silence, you see, that characterizes the conduct of the defendant;  that is, their failure to tell the plaintiff of the absence of this static mixer while aware that the discharge limits were not being met.  You see, that's when the duty arises.  And that's when the concealment, if intentional, is what we call \"actionable,\" that is, a basis for a lawsuit.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> This point is important because lost profits are not compensable for negligent misrepresentation under Massachusetts law, see Section IV-D, and lost profits represent the bulk of the damages in this case.  Additionally, Napco claims that this instruction tainted both the willful breach of warranty verdict and the district court's Chapter 93A decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Napco characterizes the nondisclosure theory as an \"eleventh-hour reformulation\" which was \"improvised literally at the final hour--at the end of the ninth day of trial and on the eve of closing arguments\" to which counsel had no \"foreshadowing.\"   But as early as the third day of trial the court had asked counsel to research the question of nondisclosure.  The nondisclosure theory was foreshadowed on the fifth day of trial where, in discussing the misrepresentation count, the court stated that the plaintiff's theory was that \"upon learning of the absence of the static mixer, it became defendant's duty to do two things:  first, to install it;  and secondly, to tell the plaintiff that it wasn't in.\"   On the eighth day of trial, which was a Friday, the district court asked counsel whether \"the lack of disclosure or the absence of the static mixer [could] serve as a basis of a misrepresentation and fraud,\" and asked them to think about the issue over the weekend.  On the ninth day of trial, the court announced its view that a fraudulent nondisclosure theory might be a basis for liability.  After having a chance overnight to consider the objections it would lodge against the district court's theory, Napco lodged basically the same objections it later gave to the supplemental instruction.  In light of this record, we do not agree that Napco's failure to object should be excused because the fraudulent nondisclosure theory was a surprise</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Jerlyn Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Wayne R. Roman Yacht Brokerage, 950 F.2d 60 (1st Cir.1991), a case upon which Napco places great reliance, is inapplicable.  In Jerlyn Yacht Sales there was at least some request that the court include an instruction on the specific issue raised on appeal.  Id. at 64.   There was no such request here.  Despite Napco's claims to the contrary, this is a garden variety failure to object situation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Because Napco cannot satisfy the discretionary elements of the plain error standard, we need not decide whether the instruction was \"plainly\" incorrect.  Cf. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (\"Plain is synonymous with clear or, equivalently, obvious\";  the error must be \"clear under current law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Napco argues that Massachusetts law is clear that knowledge of materiality is required.  According to Napco, under Massachusetts law, \"[a]bsent a showing that the defendant knew that his statement was false, and intended to induce reliance, the tort of intentional misrepresentation simply does not lie.\"  (Emphases in original.)   Napco argues that there must be an \"intent to deceive\" to be liable for fraud.  But Massachusetts fraud law does not require an \"intent to deceive.\"  Snyder v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., 368 Mass. 433, 333 N.E.2d 421, 428 (1975).  Moreover, \"knowledge of falsity\" in the sense that Napco urges--that defendant actually know the statement is false--is also probably not required.  This court has said that \"[n]othing is clearer than the fact that under Massachusetts law, plaintiff need not prove that [the defendant] knew his statement to be false.\"  Nickerson v. Matco Tools Corp., 813 F.2d 529, 530 (1st Cir.1987) (citing Powell v. Rasmussen, 355 Mass. 117, 243 N.E.2d 167, 168 (1969) (holding that knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity is not required for an action of intentional misrepresentation;  it is enough if representation was false and susceptible of actual knowledge));  see also VMark Software, Inc. v. EMC Corp., 37 Mass.App.Ct. 610, 642 N.E.2d 587, 593 n. 9 (1994) (same);  Zimmerman v. Kent, 31 Mass.App.Ct. 72, 575 N.E.2d 70, 74 (1991) (same).  The case upon which Napco principally relies, Danca v. Taunton Savings Bank, 385 Mass. 1, 429 N.E.2d 1129, 1133 (1982), does list \"knowledge of falsity\" as an element.  But this does not help Napco.  Either there is lack of clarity in the Massachusetts case law, see In re Friedlander, 170 B.R. 472, 476-78 (Bankr.D.Mass.1994) (noting the confusion), or \"knowledge of falsity\" does not mean what Napco urges.  See Roadmaster Indus., Inc. v. Columbia Mfg. Co., Inc., 893 F.Supp. 1162, 1176 (D.Mass.1995) (\"knowledge of falsity\" under Danca does not require that defendant \"actually knew its statement was false\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Other evidence is also relevant to this count.  For example, once Cambridge Plating discovered that the static mixer was missing, its attorney wrote to Napco's president, Herbert Fishman, asking for \"an amicable resolution\" and a \"meeting\" to \"explore the prospects of such a resolution.\"   Napco ignored the letter and a meeting was never held.  Napco disparages this evidence as a \"red herring[ ]\" saying that any inference that Napco refused to meet \"misreads\" the testimony Fishman gave about the letter and that, in any event, the letter was turned over to lawyers and therefore sheds no light on whether Napco willfully repudiated its warranty.  Fishman's testimony on this point, however, is hardly helpful to Napco.  Fishman testified that he personally ignored the letter because it raised only a \"minor\" issue.  By \"minor\" he meant that there wasn't enough money involved to get his attention.  At the time, Fishman apparently had other problems with a \"dollar volume [that] was much greater than what this was here\" and \"people were supposedly handling this for [him].\"  Napco does not seriously dispute that, whatever Fishman thought about the problem, his \"people\" did nothing.  Napco's awareness of the problem, its consideration of its scope as \"minor,\" and its failure to respond, support at least to some degree an inference of willful repudiation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Because the Chapter 93A claim is predicated on conduct amounting to an intentional misrepresentation and willful breach of warranty, Napco's limitation of damages provision does not bar consequential damages on this count.  Cf. Canal Elec., 548 N.E.2d at 186</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> That Napco raises a legitimate argument that it should not be liable for multiple damages does not undercut the finding of liability for intentional misconduct.  The considerations discussed above mitigate Napco's culpability;  they do not excuse Napco.  See VMark Software, 642 N.E.2d at 596 (intentional misrepresentation \"is surely market disruptive to the same extent whether the promisor is genuinely hopeful of fulfilling his contract, or is deliberately deceptive and entirely disdainful of [its] commitments.\");   accord AMPAT/Midwest, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 896 F.2d 1035, 1044 (7th Cir.1990) (punitive damages not awarded, but failure to disclose defects was deemed to be fraud, even though the court indulged the assumption that (1) there was some reason to believe that it was the plaintiff's installation, rather than the defect, that was responsible for the problem, and (2) the defendant honestly believed that the plaintiff was to blame;  \"[e]ven deep conviction of the rightness of one's cause does not justify fraud\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The $183,120 difference between the amount of lost profits awarded and the total damages awarded on the jury counts represents the MWRA fine, the attorneys' fees Cambridge Plating incurred in connection with the fine, and the cost of the static mixer.  Also, the district court's lost profits award for the 93A count was $981,000 less than the lost profits awarded after the remittitur of the jury award because the court believed that the $981,000 in lost profits was an amount over which fact finders might reasonably differ.

For want of a $620 part, there was a damages verdict of over $7 million.  The purchaser of the system, Cambridge Plating Co., Inc., sued the seller, Napco, Inc., for, among other things, failing to reveal that it had knowingly omitted a critical part from the system.  The complaint alleged breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and a violation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93A, &#167;&#167; 2, 11 (\"Chapter 93A\").  After a twelve-day trial, Cambridge Plating won on all counts, with a jury finding liability on the common law counts and the district court finding liability under Chapter 93A.  Both the jury and the district court awarded Cambridge Plating significant damages.  Napco now raises various challenges to the verdicts.  We believe there was error in the striking of post-judgment motions and that the claims were timely filed under the Massachusetts discovery rule;  we find the evidence sufficient and affirm on liability (but reverse the multiple damages under Chapter 93A), and vacate and remand the award of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

This water becomes contaminated with chemicals and metals.  Environmental regulations require that Cambridge Plating decontaminate the wastewater before discharging it into the sewers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco manufactures and sells wastewater treatment systems for commercial users.  In January 1984, Cambridge Plating entered into a contract to purchase, for approximately $398,000, a wastewater treatment system that would remove the contaminants from the water.  As part of the contract, Napco provided a \"performance warranty\" under which Napco warranted that the system, if operated within certain defined limits, would meet all Massachusetts and federal pollution abatement requirements.  The warranty, however, excluded liability for all consequential damages or business losses Cambridge Plating might incur in the event of a breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The system Napco sold to Cambridge Plating used a precipitation process to remove the contaminants from the water.  The wastewater was fed through pipes, and injected with a polymer solution.  The polymers were to attach to the contaminants and then aggregate them to form larger particles, known as \"floc.\"   The floc was to settle out of the water and form sludge at the bottom of a clarifying tank.  The clean water layer on top would be discharged into the sewer and Cambridge Plating would properly dispose of the sludge left behind in the tank.  \"Flocculation,\" the joining of the smaller particles into bigger ones, was absolutely critical to the success of the wastewater treatment system.  Absent proper flocculation, contaminants would remain suspended in the water and the water could not be discharged into the sewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For proper flocculation to occur, the polymer solution had to be thoroughly mixed into the wastewater stream.  The system needed some means of creating turbulence in the stream sufficient to perform that mixing.  One mechanism designed to create the necessary turbulence is a \"static mixer.\"   A static mixer is a section of pipe containing a series of \"baffles,\" small metal plates placed at an angle inside the pipe which create resistance and, consequently, turbulence.  The polymer solution is injected into the waste stream just before the water reaches the static mixer.  Once the water with the polymer solution hits the baffles, mixing occurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are alternatives to static mixers to create the required turbulence for a precipitation wastewater treatment system.  As Joseph Aliota, Napco's expert engineer, testified, proper mixing can occur if the system is designed with a series of significant bends in the piping around the area where the polymer is injected into the stream.  Napco did not opt for that design.  The engineering drawings (and other items) for the Cambridge Plating system clearly indicate that the system was to include a static mixer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco did not install the static mixer.  Nor did it tell Cambridge Plating that the static mixer had not been installed.  It did, however, provide Cambridge Plating with a \"tech manual\" containing blueprints and operating instructions for the system.  This manual, given to Cambridge Plating upon completion of the system, purported to show what had actually been built.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  It contained engineering drawings indicating that the static mixer had been installed in the system.  Napco also provided a control panel that depicted the static mixer as being part of the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco's employees were aware that the static mixer had not been installed.  Bob Triplett, Napco's plumbing subcontractor, testified that he was instructed not to install the static mixer at the direction of either Carl Bredfield, a Napco employee, or Bob DeBisschop, Napco's project manager on the Cambridge Plating job.  John Eason, Napco's Manager of Pollution Abatement and the person principally responsible for the design of the system, also testified that he knew the static mixer was not there, although he claimed that the static mixer was installed at first but later removed because it had a tendency to clog.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The system was installed in late 1984.  For several months after installation, the system generally met the applicable pollution limits.  A series of reports from a testing laboratory that Cambridge Plating forwarded to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (\"MWRA\") (the relevant state regulatory body) showed that from roughly March 1985 until September 1985, the system usually met the applicable discharge limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As time went on, however, the system regularly failed to meet the applicable pollution limits and Cambridge Plating complained to Napco about the problems.  Starting in early 1986, Edward Marullo, a Cambridge Plating employee responsible for running the system, called DeBisschop at Napco to complain about the poor performance.  DeBisschop told Marullo to manipulate the polymer and pH levels.  In March 1986, Laurence Tosi, Cambridge Plating's President, called DeBisschop \"yelling and screaming\" about the system's failures.  Tosi thought that Napco's equipment might be at fault, but DeBisschop allayed his concerns, saying that operator error was the likely cause of the problem.  Based on DeBisschop's assurances, Tosi took no further steps to have the system inspected for defects.  Again, in 1987, Marullo called Eason at Napco, who, like his colleague DeBisschop, told Marullo to manipulate the polymer flow and pH level.  At some point, Napco told Tosi that it would be willing to send engineers to examine the system or to train further Cambridge Plating's operators.  But there was a price tag:  Cambridge Plating had to agree to pay $1000 per day for such service.  Tosi declined.  At no time did Napco inform Cambridge Plating that the static mixer was missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, Cambridge Plating hired a series of experts to determine what was wrong.  In December 1986, it hired Patrick Hunt, a waste treatment operator for Hewlett-Packard who was also an instructor of a licensing course for wastewater treatment operators at the University of Lowell.  Hunt inspected the system, recognized \"insufficient floc formation\" as a problem, and made numerous suggestions, most of which related to operation.  Hunt did not discover that the static mixer was missing.  In May 1987, Robert Capaccio, also a wastewater treatment expert, visited Cambridge Plating but failed to detect that the static mixer was missing.  A third group of experts from Memtek, which designs and manufactures wastewater treatment systems, examined the system in September 1987 for the purpose of proposing a course of action.  They recommended a substantial overhaul of the system at a cost that Cambridge Plating considered prohibitive.  During their review, they did not notice that the static mixer was missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Cambridge Plating was trying to identify and solve the problems with the system, it was also becoming a consistent violator of the MWRA's regulations.  In December 1988 the MWRA fined Cambridge Plating $682,250 for discharging excessive levels of contaminants.  Cambridge Plating challenged the fine, which was later reduced to $128,500, but at a cost of approximately $54,000 in attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating tried to manage the system's deficiencies by rigging the system so that the wastewater would be recirculated and retreated in the system.  \"Closed looping,\" as this practice was called, gave more time for flocculation to occur.  It also slowed down production considerably.  When there was closed looping, the system had to process both the retreated wastewater and the incoming wastewater generated by production.  From 1985 to February 1989, the closed looping was accomplished by attaching flexible hoses to the system.  In February 1989, Cambridge Plating replaced the flexible hoses with hard piping to create permanent closed looping.  Cambridge Plating also shut down its zinc plating operation because, even with closed looping, the system could not remove the contaminants from that operation.  Because of its slowdown in production capacity, Cambridge Plating's business began to deteriorate.  Net sales declined from a high of approximately $6.2 million in 1985 to approximately $4.8 million in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1989 Cambridge Plating hired Peter Moleux, another expert in wastewater treatment systems.  Moleux reviewed Napco's proposal and copies of the engineering drawings.  By chance, Moleux had been given a bad photocopy of the drawings.  The portion of the drawings that depicted the static mixer did not appear on the photocopy.  He decided to look for the static mixer in the system.  He physically examined the system and inspected the area of the system where the static mixer should have been.  Because of his expertise, he noticed that the piping looked different than it should have if the static mixer had been installed.  He later confirmed that the static mixer had not been installed.  He told Cambridge Plating that the mixer was missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, on March 17, 1989, Cambridge Plating sent a letter to Napco enclosing a draft complaint \"concerning difficulties\" Cambridge Plating had experienced with Napco.  The draft complaint mentioned the missing static mixer and the letter requested an \"amicable resolution.\"   Napco ignored the letter, never agreeing to come to a meeting to seek an amicable resolution nor agreeing to fix the problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Moleux's discovery, Cambridge Plating did not order the static mixer until December 1989.  It arrived at the plant in January 1990 but was not installed until May 1990.  Installation required the plant to be shut down for one day.  Once the static mixer was installed, the system's performance improved dramatically, and Cambridge Plating was able to discontinue, for the most part, closed looping.  The static mixer cost $620.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating sued Napco on June 22, 1990 charging breach of contract (including willful repudiation of warranty), intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and violation of Chapter 93A. Napco subsequently moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted the motion, holding that Cambridge Plating's claims were time-barred.  This court reversed and remanded for trial, see Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v. Napco, Inc.  (Cambridge Plating I), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604820\"><a href=\"/opinion/604820/cambridge-plating-co-inc-v-napco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1993), holding that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Cambridge Plating could benefit from the discovery rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the case was tried to a jury in September 1994.  The district court submitted Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b) special interrogatories to the jury on the statute of limitations question, the three common law counts, and the Chapter 93A count.  The jury answered all of the interrogatories in Cambridge Plating's favor, returned a general verdict on each of the common law counts, and awarded Cambridge Plating $12,183,120.  The district court treated as advisory the jury's answers to the Rule 49(b) interrogatories on the Chapter 93A count, and, on February 7, 1995, the district court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law on the Chapter 93A count.  See Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v. NAPCO, Inc.  (Cambridge Plating II), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></span> (D.Mass.1995).  In that opinion, the district court concluded that the Chapter 93A count was timely, that Napco had violated Chapter 93A, and that Cambridge Plating was entitled to compensatory damages in the amount of $3,363,120.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court also concluded that the violation of Chapter 93A was \"willful or knowing\" and ordered a punitive award of double damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco filed post-judgment motions for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial, remittitur, and amended findings on the Chapter 93A claim.  After Cambridge Plating argued that the post-judgment motions failed to set forth with sufficient specificity the grounds for relief, the district court struck all of the motions, except the motion for remittitur.  The district court then granted a remittitur in the amount of $7,839,000 and gave Cambridge Plating the option of accepting the remittitur, thereby accepting a reduced damage award on the common law counts in the amount of $4,344,120, or submitting to a new trial.

Alternatively, it seeks a new trial due to instructional error.  It also argues that the district court should have limited the damages even more.  We turn first to the question of our scope of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Scope Of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision to strike Napco's post-judgment motions affects the scope of our review.  Napco challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show willful or intentional misconduct, seeking a judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial on the \"intentional\" counts:  intentional misrepresentation, willful repudiation of warranty and Chapter 93A.  This court will not, however, review sufficiency challenges absent a proper motion in the district court for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.  See Johnson v.

If the district court acted properly in striking the motions, the motions are nullities, and, under Johnson and Pinkham, Napco is barred from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.  We believe, however, that the district court understandably but improperly struck the post-judgment motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered judgment on February 8, 1995.  The next day, Napco moved for an extension of time for filing its memoranda in support of its post-judgment motions, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Plaintiff has prevailed on four separate and distinct legal claims.  Therefore, in order to obtain postjudgment relief, Napco must challenge all four bases for the judgment.  This will require Napco to argue several substantial legal and factual issues including, for example, the recoverability of lost profits for negligent misrepresentation, the sufficiency of the evidence of intentional misrepresentation and of repudiation of warranty, the statute of limitations (three-year and four-year), as well as issues relating to Chapter 93A and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, the district court granted the motion, giving Napco until March 1, 1995 to file the post-judgment memoranda.  On February 17, six days before the 10-day time limit for filing post-judgment motions expired, Napco filed a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) and 59.  In summary fashion, the motion outlined its subject matter and said the grounds would be set forth in the March 1 memorandum to be filed later in accord with the Court's extension.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Also on February 17, Napco filed a similar motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b) and 59 seeking either to amend the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law or to have a new trial on the Chapter 93A claim.  This motion also said that the grounds for the motion would be set forth in the March 1 memorandum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 24, 1995, one day after the ten-day period expired, Cambridge Plating moved to strike Napco's post-judgment motions, arguing that they lacked sufficient \"particularity\" under Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b)(1) and that, accordingly, no \"motion\" had been timely filed within the ten-day period prescribed by Rules 50(b), 52(b) and 59.  In granting Cambridge Plating's motion, except on the remittitur issue, the district court refused to take into consideration Napco's extension motion or any of the other surrounding circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 7(b)(1) requires that motions \"state with particularity the grounds therefor.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b)(1).  Napco's post-judgment motions are subject to the requirements of Rule 7(b)(1).  The particularity requirement, however, is to be read flexibly in \"recognition of the peculiar circumstances of the case.\"  Registration Control Sys., Inc. v. Compusystems, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553463\"><a href=\"/opinion/553463/registration-control-systems-inc-v-compusystems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 808 (Fed.Cir.1990).  This is because Rule 7 is designed \"to afford notice of the grounds and prayer of the motion to both the court and the opposing party, providing that party with a meaningful opportunity to respond and the court with enough information to process the motion correctly.\"  Id. at 807.   When a motion is challenged for lack of particularity the question is \"whether any party is prejudiced by a lack of particularity or 'whether the court can comprehend the basis for the motion and deal with it fairly.' \"  Id. at 807-08 (quoting 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 1192, at 42 (1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Napco's motion was at best sloppy practice, we believe that it was sufficiently particular when read in conjunction with the extension motion and prior filings.  Although the extension motion was not filed simultaneously with the Rule 50(b), 59 and 52(b) motions, it was filed only a week before, within the ten-day period, and was obviously closely related to the Rule 50(b) motion.  Compare Lac Du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Wisconsin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578296\"><a href=\"/opinion/578296/lac-du-flambeau-band-of-lake-superior-chippewa-indians-and-the-sokaogon/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 517 (7th Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></span> (1992).  The extension motion specified the bases of the judgment that Napco \"must challenge,\" including the sufficiency of the evidence on the intentional misrepresentation claim and the willful repudiation of warranty claim, as well as issues relating to Chapter 93A and damages.  Napco thus represented to both the court and Cambridge Plating the grounds for its post-judgment motions.  No claim is made that there was any intervening event that would have made the representations in the extension motion unreliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating makes a passing argument in its brief that it was unable to respond to, or the district court to process, Napco's motions.  If the Rule 50(b), 59 and 52(b) motions are viewed in isolation, Cambridge Plating has a point.  But the motions cannot be viewed in isolation.  In addition to the closely filed extension motion, significant briefing on the Chapter 93A issues had just been completed and Napco had earlier made quite a detailed Rule 50(a) motion, of which the Rule 50(b) motion was a \"renewal.\"   In short, the record shows that Napco was taking steps specifically to make evidentiary challenges to the verdict on all of the major issues litigated at trial.  The grounds Napco would press in its post-judgment motions were sufficiently known.  The motions under Rules 50(b), 59 and 52(b) were adequate, although barely, under the circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court premised its decision on the belief that the law prevented it from looking beyond the four corners of the motion to determine whether the motion had stated its grounds with sufficient particularity.  While understandable, such a view of Rule 7(b)(1) is, in our view, too narrow.  \"Overly technical\" evaluations of particularity are disfavored.  Wright &amp; Miller, supra, &#167; 1192, at 43.  Courts routinely take into consideration other closely filed pleadings to determine whether sufficient notice of the grounds for the motion are given and the opposing party has a fair opportunity to respond.  See Chippewa Indians, 957 F.2d at 517 (motion failing to state grounds is sufficiently particular where supporting memorandum adequately discusses the grounds);  Brown v. United States Postal Serv., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513473\"><a href=\"/opinion/513473/andrew-l-brown-v-united-states-postal-service-william-f-bolger/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span>, 887 (9th Cir.1988) (motion for reconsideration was adequate under Rule 7 even though a particular ground was omitted, where the parties had already briefed and argued the issue and no prejudice would result);  see also King v. Mordowanec, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></span>, 477 (D.R.I.1969) (where grounds for Rule 60(b) motion were stated at oral argument previous day and were discussed after filing, during in-chambers argument, motion did not run afoul of Rule 7(b)(1) particularity requirement).  Accordingly, we reach Napco's various challenges to the sufficiency (and weight) of the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Liability</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Statute Of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco first argues that none of the claims survive the statute of limitations.  Cambridge Plating filed suit on June 22, 1990.  A four-year statute of limitations governs the Chapter 93A and breach of warranty claims.  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-725 (contract for sale of goods);  Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 260, &#167; 5A (Chapter 93A).  A three-year statute of limitations governs the intentional and negligent misrepresentation claims.  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 260, &#167; 2A.  As established in Cambridge Plating I, 991 F.2d at 27, Cambridge Plating must rely on the discovery rule to prove its claims were timely filed.  The discovery rule \" 'prescribes as crucial the date when a plaintiff discovers, or any earlier date when she should reasonably have discovered, that she has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant's conduct.' \"  Id. (quoting Bowen v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2039745\"><a href=\"/opinion/2039745/bowen-v-eli-lilly-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2039745\"><a href=\"/opinion/2039745/bowen-v-eli-lilly-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 740-41 (1990)).  The discovery rule here \"turns on when the company should have known that Napco might be responsible for the water treatment system's failing performance.\"  Cambridge Plating I, 991 F.2d at 29.   The question to be resolved at trial was whether Cambridge Plating \"knew or should have known of its claims before June 22, 1987 [or June 22, 1986].\"  Id.  Napco argues that the evidence was insufficient for a jury to conclude that Cambridge Plating should not have known of its claims before the pertinent cut-off dates.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of the timeliness of the breach of warranty and Chapter 93A claims under the four-year statute is, we believe, largely answered by the admirable description of the evidence provided by the district court in light of our previous opinion in Cambridge Plating I. The evidence at trial showed that Cambridge Plating was aware that the system was complex and that the performance warranty Napco provided contained the implicit condition that the system be operated properly.  At least at first, Cambridge Plating could reasonably have believed that its own inexperience, rather than Napco's defective equipment, was to blame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, at some point, when things were no better, Cambridge Plating should have thought that something other than operator error was causing the problem.  And as Napco points out, there was evidence that such a point came for Cambridge Plating either in early 1986, when Marullo complained to Debisschop about the system, or March 1986, when Tosi \"kept yelling and screaming\" at Debisschop that the problems were due to the equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the critical question is whether Cambridge Plating reasonably relied on Napco's responses to those early 1986 inquiries that operator error, rather than equipment defect, was the cause of the trouble.  The fact that Tosi complained vociferously that the equipment was at fault is not dispositive if DeBisschop was reasonably able to convince Tosi he was wrong.  Napco had considerably superior expertise in this area.  The absence of the static mixer was not something Cambridge Plating, with its level of expertise, should have detected.  We believe that under such circumstances, when Napco gave Tosi its \"assur[ances]\" that the problem had to be with Cambridge Plating's operators, Cambridge Plating reasonably took Napco at its word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The misrepresentation claims, governed by a three-year statute, were also timely.  Cambridge Plating did not sit idle during the next twelve months.  When Napco's suggestions did not solve the problem, Cambridge Plating hired Patrick Hunt, in late 1986, to evaluate the system.  In January 1987 Hunt gave Cambridge Plating his recommendations, which suggested operational changes but not that the static mixer was either missing or not working properly.  If Hunt were unqualified to examine the system, then Cambridge Plating might have difficulty arguing that it was acting reasonably.  But Hunt was an expert in wastewater treatment systems and competent to evaluate the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Was Hunt's failure to discover that the static mixer was missing reasonable?   See Cambridge Plating I, 991 F.2d at 29-30.   We think the jury was entitled to think so.  First, the absence of the static mixer was not something that could be easily detected from a physical observation of the system.  Indeed, other experts after Hunt who looked over the system were also fooled.  Second, Napco had supplied to Cambridge Plating drawings representing that the static mixer had been installed.  According to Cambridge Plating, these drawings were \"as built\" drawings.  Napco disputes Cambridge Plating's characterization of the drawings, pointing to testimony that \"as built\" drawings, as the term is technically used, were never prepared.  Yet regardless of whether the drawings technically could be called \"as built,\" Napco admitted supplying the drawings to Cambridge Plating in the tech manual \"[t]o show what was built.\"Perhaps, given the problems with the system, the accuracy of the drawings should have been called into question at this time.  The jury was entitled to think otherwise.  The system was extremely complex and the cause of the malfunction could have been any number of problems, including, as Napco points out, problems of design.  The factfinder could reasonably conclude on this record that the probability the drawings were false was sufficiently low that questioning the accuracy of the drawings would be low on Cambridge Plating's (or Hunt's) diagnostic checklist.  The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the claims were timely.  Nor was such a finding against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Although Cambridge Plating may have had reason to know that Napco might be in breach of its warranty when the system did not perform up to snuff and Cambridge Plating had ruled out operator error, that does not mean that Cambridge Plating had reason to know that Napco had deceived it.

Thus, under Massachusetts law, the cause of action for misrepresentation did not accrue until Cambridge Plating should have known that the static mixer had not been installed.  The special interrogatory was not erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Intentional Misrepresentation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating had the burden of proving that Napco had engaged in an intentional misrepresentation.  Cambridge Plating alleged in its complaint that Napco fraudulently induced it to purchase the wastewater system by falsely promising that the system would contain a static mixer.  At trial, however, the district court did not believe that Cambridge Plating had presented sufficient evidence to show such fraudulent inducement, and did not submit that theory to the jury.  The district court, nevertheless, believed that Cambridge Plating had presented sufficient evidence to show fraudulent nondisclosure<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and, accordingly, charged the jury on that theory.  The jury subsequently found, as framed in the special interrogatories, that Napco had \"intentionally conceal[ed]\" its failure to install the static mixer \"while aware of the System's failure to meet the applicable discharge limits\" and was thus liable for intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco raises two challenges to this verdict.  First, it argues that the evidence was insufficient to show fraudulent nondisclosure.  Second, it argues that, regardless of the evidence, the intentional misrepresentation verdict was tainted by a defective jury instruction.  It requests that either judgment be entered in its favor or a new trial granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of fraudulent nondisclosure.  To set aside a jury verdict and enter a contrary verdict for Napco, we must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to Cambridge Plating, drawing all possible inferences in its favor.  See Havinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670668\"><a href=\"/opinion/670668/berend-jd-havinga-v-crowley-towing-and-transportation-company-berend/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></a></span>, 1483 (1st Cir.1994).  To set aside a verdict and remand for a new trial based on the evidence, Napco must show that the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Cambridge Plating, or would work a clear miscarriage of justice.  See id. at 1482-83.   Napco cannot meet either standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco's sufficiency challenge largely rests on a single proposition:  that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that Napco knew or believed that the static mixer was responsible for the problems with the system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  In Napco's words, \"every piece of proof bearing on the issue confirmed that Napco never believed the static mixer was necessary, and in fact, believed the mixer might impair system performance.\"  (Emphasis in original.)   But there was such evidence:  Napco designed the system to include the static mixer.  It knew that the mixer was originally included in the system to create the proper mixing of the polymer solution, without which flocculation would be hindered.  This evidence, when combined with the evidence that Napco knew the mixer had not been installed (so that the omission was not a mere oversight) and that it knew the system was not working, adequately supports the conclusion that Napco intentionally failed to tell Cambridge Plating that the static mixer was missing, knowing it was responsible for the system's problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco protests that it simply made a \"good faith (and, at worst, negligent) professional judgment that a mixer was not material to the system.\"   After all, it argues, what did it have to gain from omitting a $620 part from the system or from hiding a problem that could be inexpensively cured.  Napco relies on testimony from Triplett, Napco's subcontractor, Aliota, Napco's expert, and Eason, Napco's manager of pollution abatement.  But Triplett's testimony and Aliota's testimony do not much help Napco.  Although both Triplett and Aliota testified that the use of \"elbows,\" or pipe bends, could create the necessary turbulence in lieu of the static mixer, Napco did not show that such \"elbows\" were specifically designed into the system.  More to the point, Aliota, who was not a fact witness, did not testify as to what the people at Napco were thinking in leaving out the static mixer, and Triplett, at best, had only a \"vague recollection\" of \"some discussion that when the pumps came on they hit the two--they hit a 90 and a T, and that was enough turbulence to mix with the polymer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, unfortunately for Napco, the jury could have found Eason's testimony in a number of respects not to be credible.  His account of the events surrounding the decision to omit the static mixer conflicted somewhat with that of other Napco witnesses.  Triplett testified that the mixer was never installed, while Eason said it was installed but taken out.  Eason's testimony that the static mixer was omitted because it was \"minor\" was damaged by his admission on cross-examination that he could not find even one other component depicted on the drawings that was \"minor.\"   Napco does not point to other evidence presented to the jury (for example, contemporaneous memos showing that Napco had made a judgment that the mixer was irrelevant) that corroborates Eason's testimony.  In short, the \"professional judgment\" theory was largely a credibility question.  In light of the shaky aspects of Eason's testimony, the jury was entitled to conclude that Eason was not believable and that Triplett's \"vague recollection\" was not enough to rebut the circumstantial evidence (particularly the drawings) that Napco knew the absence of the static mixer was the problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco properly makes the point that it \"strains credulity\" to suppose that Napco would expose itself to such drastic liability over a $620 part that took one day to install.  Why Napco would do so is something of a puzzle and could raise questions about the reliability of the jury's finding that Napco intentionally concealed the absence of the mixer.  But Napco's behavior is not wholly inexplicable.  It might be explained in terms of the theory of \"agency costs\":  the aberrant conduct occurred when Napco's interests in avoiding exposure to drastic liability diverged from those of its employees.  Cf. AMPAT/Midwest, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537033\"><a href=\"/opinion/537033/ampatmidwest-inc-cross-appellee-v-illinois-tool-works-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></a></span>, 1043 (7th Cir.1990) (Posner, J.)  (seemingly irrational behavior on the part of a corporation may be explained by the \"divergence of objectives\" between the corporation and its employees).  For example, the designer Eason and the project manager DeBisschop may each have wished to avoid individual blame for the defects in the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Napco's current focus on plaintiff's proof of scienter represents a shift from its defense at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Its defense to the misrepresentation count principally focussed on whether the static mixer was in fact material to the problem.  Moreover, Napco's defense to the breach of warranty claim, which rested in large part on the assertion that it never had any idea that Cambridge Plating's system was not meeting the effluent requirements, was in considerable tension with any defense made on the misrepresentation claims that, once it heard about the problems, Napco made a judgment that the static mixer was unimportant.  Not surprisingly, then, there was little specific testimony that Napco seriously considered Cambridge Plating's complaints and then made a judgment that the static mixer was the problem.  Napco principally chose to take the position at trial that it did not know there was a problem, rather than that it thought there was a problem but the cause was something else.  Since there was competent evidence showing that Eason and DeBisschop were contacted about the problems with the system on numerous occasions, and that the system worked after the static mixer was installed, Napco was vulnerable on the intentional misrepresentation count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating needed to show intentional misrepresentation only by a preponderance of the evidence.

[the] defendant willfully concealed from the plaintiff the absence of the static mixer when it knew ... that the discharge limits were not being met and that the inclusion of the static mixer would, at least to some extent, enable the system to perform as it was intended.\"   Following this initial charge, plaintiff's counsel requested an instruction specifying that materiality was to be measured against an objective standard.  In response,the court gave the following supplemental instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>[I]n discussing the state of mind of the defendant with regard to the importance of the static mixer to the system ... the standard is objective.

Cambridge Plating protests that Napco has not preserved this argument because it failed to lodge a proper objection before the jury retired to consider its verdict.  Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, objections must \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.

Napco complained that (1) the complaint did not fairly disclose the nondisclosure theory, (2) the theory was not supported by the evidence, and (3) there was no obligation on the part of the seller to disclose.  Napco did not object that the instruction was incorrect because it failed to make clear that actual knowledge of materiality was required for liability, nor did Napco object that the instruction conflated negligent and intentional misrepresentation.  Thus, Napco failed to \"state[ ] distinctly\" the argument it makes now, i.e., that the instruction imposed an incorrect scienter requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Napco urges that colloquies occurring days before the charge satisfy Rule 51.  Without considering whether such colloquies may be used to determine compliance, the colloquies Napco directs us to do not contain any specific statement that Napco needed to have \"actual knowledge\" of the static mixer's materiality to be liable.  Napco's contention that this lack of specificity should be excused because the fraudulent nondisclosure theory was \"novel\" and came as a \"surprise\" to counsel is contrary to what the record shows.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, Napco concedes that the district court charged the jury correctly on the scienter element of intentional misrepresentation during its initial charge.  It was only after plaintiff objected to the charge, suggesting that the court make clear that materiality be viewed from an objective point of view, that the court gave the supplemental instruction.  The supplemental instruction thus created a new issue, independent of the supposed surprise over the fraudulent nondisclosure theory.  Despite this, Napco's only objections to the supplemental charge related to the charging of the fraudulent nondisclosure theory generally, not to the new ambiguity the instruction created over the scienter requirement.  On the question of scienter, Napco remained silent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a proper objection, review is for plain error.

Napco cannot show on this record that a miscarriage of justice will result if the error is not corrected.

Even if at the time of installation Napco believed that the probability was small that the static mixer would make a difference to the system's performance, the probability was large enough that it should not have been ignored once Napco learned that Cambridge Plating was having problems.  Yet even after Cambridge Plating had complained about the system's performance, Napco never seriously reconsidered its professed judgment about the static mixer.  Napco also knew all along that it had provided Cambridge Plating with inaccurate drawings.  So Napco also knew that Cambridge Plating would be handicapped in reaching its own conclusion on the matter.  Where Napco knew the system was not performing as warranted, Napco was not free to ignore the fact that Cambridge Plating might benefit from knowing that the mixer had been omitted.  Napco's silence became sufficiently \"unscrupulous\" to fall within a \"penumbra ... of [an] established concept of unfairness.\"  PMP Assoc., 321 N.E.2d at 917.

Punitive damages are awarded only for \"willful or knowing\" violations of section 2 of Chapter 93A. Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93A, &#167; 11 (providing for up to three, but not less than two, times actual damages for willful or knowing violations of section 2).  Here, the district court imposed double damages based on essentially the same finding upon which it imposed substantive liability under Chapter 93A:  that Napco failed to disclose what it knew about the static mixer while knowing that it was material to the problem.  See Cambridge Plating II, 876 F.Supp. at 346.   At first blush, this conclusion may seem sound, given the \"willful or knowing\" language of the statute.  Napco's conduct, which also amounts to intentional misrepresentation (and willful breach of warranty), clearly involves a certain level of deliberateness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But shades of culpability are supposed to matter in applying the punitive damages provision of the statute.

See Cambridge Plating II, 876 F.Supp. at 346.   It believed, however, that its findings supported the conclusion that Napco's conduct was sufficiently egregious to warrant a punitive sanction.  We do not think so.  If Napco's conduct was fraud and a willful repudiation of warranty, it was only marginally so.  Napco had reason to believe that operator error was the cause of Cambridge Plating's problems.  The system, after all, had worked for a period of time after its installation.  Indeed, Cambridge Plating itself took nearly a year and a half to install the static mixer once it found it was missing.  Napco did not stand to profit by its actions, and there was no evidence that Napco acted maliciously towards Cambridge Plating or remained silent so that it could watch Cambridge Plating go into distress.  Rather, as the district court noted, this was a case where Napco simply ignored the problem hoping that it would somehow resolve itself.  Id.;  cf. VMark Software, 642 N.E.2d at 596 (\"The inept blend of hopeful dissembling and dogged bumbling displayed by VMark does not, however, reflect the culpable state of mind required for imposition of &#167; 11's extraordinary damage penalty.\"  (internal quotation omitted)).

Tosi, Moleux and Joseph Finn, Cambridge Plating's damages expert.  Tosi testified that, in the plating business, customers insist on quick turn-around time.  He also testified that because the wastewater treatment system was not working properly Cambridge Plating had to employ closed looping, which slowed down the amount of wastewater fed through the system, consequently slowing down the plating process.  Moleux confirmed that closed looping \"required Cambridge Plating to either partially or totally shut down.\"   Additionally, Tosi testified that the zinc plating operation closed because the system was unable to remove sufficiently the contaminants.  Further, Debisschop directly linked the wastewater treatment system to a plating operation's profitability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Finn testified that until 1985, the first full year the wastewater treatment system was operational, Cambridge Plating had generally experienced an increase in sales.  He also testified that for the years following the installation of the system, Cambridge Plating's revenues decreased from approximately $6.2 million in 1985 to $4.8 million in 1989, and net income declined from approximately $284,000 in 1985 to a net loss of approximately $131,000 in 1989.

It also provided testimony from people expert in plating and in wastewater treatment that the difference in profits was due to a slowdown in production and failure to meet effluent limitations, both of which could be traced back to the malfunctioning wastewater treatment system.  Napco chose not to present an expert of its own to break the connection between the financial decline and the malfunctioning system.  Instead, Napco was content to try to poke holes in Cambridge Plating's damages testimony.  \"This [was] a risky strategy, and it failed.\"  AMPAT/Midwest, 896 F.2d at 1046 (internal citation omitted).

See Cambridge Plating II, 876 F.Supp. at 345 (\"Once Moleux informed Cambridge Plating that the System was missing a vital part .... [t]he obvious next step was to buy and install a mixer immediately.\").  Nevertheless, in its Chapter 93A decision, the district court awarded damages for both 1990 and 1991 and then discounted them.  It also did not adjust the jury award in its remittitur to take account of this failure to mitigate.  We agree with Napco that both the Chapter 93A and the remittitur rulings were in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating argues that it should be absolved for its failure to mitigate after February 1989 because there would have, in any event, been recovery time.  The recovery time, it says, was needed in order to offset the damage resulting from its new reputation as a polluter, and to get word out to customers that it could fill their needs while complying with the environmental regulations.  This is a plausible theory.  But Cambridge Plating did not provide the type or quantity of proof that Massachusetts law requires to support damages for this \"reputational\" injury sufficient to overcome its failure to mitigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating points to no evidence from customers that it would not have been able to recover business because of its reputation as a polluter.  The one customer who testified, Alfred Jacques of General Electric, did not support Cambridge Plating's reputational injury theory.  The evidence Cambridge Plating relies upon--a statement from DeBisschop agreeing that companies \"tend\" to lose business when they are found to be polluters, Tosi's testimony that Cambridge Plating became \"known as a polluter,\" and an advertisement from Cambridge Plating touting its system--provides scant support for the proposition that there was any reputational harm.  This evidence of reputational injury is also in tension with Finn's testimony that if Cambridge Plating had a working wastewater treatment system, it could have replaced its business \"almost immediately.\"   Even Cambridge Plating states in its brief that \"demand for plating and metal finishing services such as those provided by Cambridge Plating was strong throughout the late 1980s and to the time of trial.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, Cambridge Plating's theory of reputational injury is, to say the least, \"speculative.\"  Augat II, 631 N.E.2d at 998.   Cambridge Plating can find no comfort in the case law that allows for some uncertainty in proving damages in tort cases.  See, e.g., Computer Sys. Eng., Inc. v. Qantel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439207\"><a href=\"/opinion/439207/computer-systems-engineering-inc-v-qantel-corporation-computer-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.1984).  Those cases reason that some uncertainty is allowed because it has been created by the defendant's wrongful conduct.  Id.  Here, however, the uncertainty for the period following February 1989 was largely caused by Cambridge Plating's own wrongful conduct in failing to mitigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, Napco has conceded that the period through November 1989, or nine months after Cambridge Plating should have installed the static mixer, is a reasonable recovery period.  In the absence of evidence showing Cambridge Plating mitigated its damages, the outer limit for such damages on the record before the trial court was November 1989.  Cf. Augat II, 631 N.E.2d at 1000 (reducing period of lost profits to six months).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also believe that both the Chapter 93A damages and the remittitur should equally take account of Cambridge Plating's failure to mitigate.

Generally, this requires that gross profits be adjusted for SG &amp; A expenses.  In this case, however, Cambridge Plating argued that SG &amp; A expenses would not have increased as its sales increased and thus the anticipated gross profits should not be reduced by SG &amp; A expenses.  The district court accepted Cambridge Plating's argument, as do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge Plating relies on the testimony of Finn that \"lost gross profit for Cambridge Plating is the exact same number as the lost net profit for the years in question.\"   Although, as Napco points out, the consolidated financial statements from 1980 to 1985 show a general increase in both sales and SG &amp; A expenses, Finn testified that SG &amp; A expenses increased only 10%-11% as sales increased 30% for the period 1982 to 1984.  Moreover, in 1984, SG &amp; A expenses decreased slightly as sales increased.  From this evidence, Finn believed that there was \"no dependent relationship between S G and A and sales\" and that SG &amp; A expenses would not have necessarily increased as gross profits increased.  Although these inferences from the evidence are weak, they are sufficiently plausible to survive Napco's challenge on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

The importance of these reports was hotly contested.  Cambridge Plating explained away these reports by noting that the materials it plated were often different, using different concentrations and types of chemicals, and that the system could handle some jobs but not others.  Cambridge Plating also noted that its closed looping masked the inadequacies of the system, but did not solve them.

The nondisclosure theory was foreshadowed on the fifth day of trial where, in discussing the misrepresentation count, the court stated that the plaintiff's theory was that \"upon learning of the absence of the static mixer, it became defendant's duty to do two things:  first, to install it;  and secondly, to tell the plaintiff that it wasn't in.\"   On the eighth day of trial, which was a Friday, the district court asked counsel whether \"the lack of disclosure or the absence of the static mixer [could] serve as a basis of a misrepresentation and fraud,\" and asked them to think about the issue over the weekend.  On the ninth day of trial, the court announced its view that a fraudulent nondisclosure theory might be a basis for liability.  After having a chance overnight to consider the objections it would lodge against the district court's theory, Napco lodged basically the same objections it later gave to the supplemental instruction.

For example, once Cambridge Plating discovered that the static mixer was missing, its attorney wrote to Napco's president, Herbert Fishman, asking for \"an amicable resolution\" and a \"meeting\" to \"explore the prospects of such a resolution.\"   Napco ignored the letter and a meeting was never held.  Napco disparages this evidence as a \"red herring[ ]\" saying that any inference that Napco refused to meet \"misreads\" the testimony Fishman gave about the letter and that, in any event, the letter was turned over to lawyers and therefore sheds no light on whether Napco willfully repudiated its warranty.  Fishman's testimony on this point, however, is hardly helpful to Napco.  Fishman testified that he personally ignored the letter because it raised only a \"minor\" issue.  By \"minor\" he meant that there wasn't enough money involved to get his attention.  At the time, Fishman apparently had other problems with a \"dollar volume [that] was much greater than what this was here\" and \"people were supposedly handling this for [him].\"  Napco does not seriously dispute that, whatever Fishman thought about the problem, his \"people\" did nothing.  Napco's awareness of the problem, its consideration of its scope as \"minor,\" and its failure to respond, support at least to some degree an inference of willful repudiation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Because the Chapter 93A claim is predicated on conduct amounting to an intentional misrepresentation and willful breach of warranty, Napco's limitation of damages provision does not bar consequential damages on this count.

Also, the district court's lost profits award for the 93A count was $981,000 less than the lost profits awarded after the remittitur of the jury award because the court believed that the $981,000 in lost profits was an amount over which fact finders might reasonably differ.

Indeed, the declining sales following the installation of the static mixer might even suggest that the missing static mixer had nothing to do with Cambridge Plating's financial problems</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Because we believe both the district court damages award and the jury award must be adjusted in the same manner, we need not address Napco's argument that the district court erred in allowing damages on the jury award that exceeded the damages under Chapter 93A</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
