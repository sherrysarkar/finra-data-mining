When  PRIBANK  failed,  the  plaintiffs\r\n\nbrought this suit, claiming that the investment bankers marketing\r\n\nthe  PRIBANK  stock defrauded  them  by  failing to  mention  the\r\n\npossibility  that PRIBANK's securities  would be \"called\"  in the\r\n\nevent of an  interest rate adjustment.  The  investors filed this\r\n\nsuit  under sections  12(2) and  17(a) of  the Securities  Act of\r\n\n1933, 15 U.S.C.     77l,  77q, as  well as section  10(b) of  the\r\n\nSecurities Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.   78j, and Rule 10(b)(5) of the\r\n\nSecurities   and   Exchange    Commission   (\"SEC\")   promulgated\r\n\nthereunder.  The district court  dismissed all of these claims on\r\n\na motion to dismiss.  We affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          In addressing  a 12(b)(6)  motion, we  must accept  all\r\n\nwell-pleaded facts as  true and accord the  plaintiff the benefit\r\n\nof all reasonable inferences.  See LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n6 F.3d  836, 841 (1st  Cir. 1993).   The following  recitation of\r\n\nthis case's background reflects this standard.  \r\n\n          Plaintiffs  Miguel  Maldonado,  et  al.  --   important\r\n\nclients  of  Dean Witter  Reynolds,  Inc. of  Puerto  Rico (\"Dean\r\n\nWitter\")  --  received mailed  invitations  to  a  meeting at  an\r\n\nexclusive  San Juan  club where  they would  be presented  with a\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nselect investment opportunity.   At the August  30, 1993 meeting,\r\n\nRam n  Dom nguez, Senior Vice-President and Sales Manager of Dean\r\n\nWitter, made a presentation regarding the formation of PRIBANK, a\r\n\nnew corporation.   He explained PRIBANK's investment  philosophy,\r\n\nand stated  that  individual investors'  participation  would  be\r\n\nlimited  to  ten  blocks of  $350,000,  with  an additional  $1.5\r\n\nmillion coming  from  himself and  Antonio  Luis Rosado  --  Vice\r\n\nPresident  of  Santander  National Bank,  and  president-to-be of\r\n\nPRIBANK.     Each  investor  would  become  a   director  of  the\r\n\ncorporation.   According to  Dom nguez, PRIBANK  was a  virtually\r\n\nrisk-free investment  which was projected  to return 176%  of the\r\n\ninvestors' principal in only two years.  \r\n\n          PRIBANK's  strategy  was  relatively simple.    PRIBANK\r\n\nwould use  $5 million  of collateral to  open margin  accounts of\r\n\nalmost $300 million with various brokerage houses.  PRIBANK would\r\n\nbe  permitted to leverage  itself through these  brokerage houses\r\n\nfor 60 times its capital because it had the credit of Dean Witter\r\n\nto back it up and because funds provided to PRIBANK on its margin\r\n\naccounts were not allowed to  be used for the purchase of  credit\r\n\nrisk  assets.   In  other words,  PRIBANK  would be  seen  by the\r\n\nbrokerage  houses as a safe  entity because its investments would\r\n\nbe low risk and its credit with Dean Witter was trusted.\r\n\n          The money in PRIBANK's margin accounts would be used to\r\n\npurchase Real Estate Mortgage  Investment Conduits (\"REMICs\") and\r\n\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations  (\"CMOs\"), effectively making\r\n\nPRIBANK the lender for numerous home mortgages.  These REMICs and\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nCMOs would  pay interest to PRIBANK at a higher rate than PRIBANK\r\n\nwas required to  pay to the brokerage houses for the money in its\r\n\nmargin accounts.   The difference between  the low interest  rate\r\n\nPRIBANK would  be  paying and  the higher  interest rate  PRIBANK\r\n\nwould be collecting -- the \"spread\" -- would be PRIBANK's profit.\r\n\nSince PRIBANK was able to borrow approximately 60 times more than\r\n\nits collateral, a spread of only 1 percent would have resulted in\r\n\nhuge profits for PRIBANK's investors.\r\n\n          A further  property of  PRIBANK's investment  structure\r\n\nmade it unique.   PRIBANK would only  purchase investments called\r\n\n\"floaters,\"  which would be re-priced and adjusted for prevailing\r\n\ninterest rates  every thirty  days.   Every thirty days,  PRIBANK\r\n\nwould collect interest on these investments.   PRIBANK planned to\r\n\ncarefully structure  its investments so  that each month,  on the\r\n\nsame day that interest payments were due to the brokerage houses,\r\n\nPRIBANK  would   also  collect   interest  on   its  investments.\r\n\nDom nguez labelled this as \"matching.\"\r\n\n          This  would  give  PRIBANK  an  advantage  over  normal\r\n\nfinancial  institutions which purchased  floating REMICS and CMOs\r\n\nwithout  this perfect  matching.   Normal  financial institutions\r                 \r\n\nhave mismatched inventories, and have to keep reserves on hand to\r\n\naccount  for withdrawals and  to pay  obligations when  they come\r\n\ndue.  The higher interest  rates these institutions make on their\r\n\nloans barely make up for the potential interest lost on the money\r\n\nsitting in their reserves at any given time.  However, due to its\r\n\nperfect  matching, PRIBANK  would  not be  required  to keep  any\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nsignificant reserves on  hand, and could invest all  of its money\r\n\nevery month, enabling it to take  full advantage of the spread in\r\n\ninterest rates.  Therein lay the key to PRIBANK's philosophy, and\r\n\neventually to its downfall.\r\n\n          Dom nguez explained  that  PRIBANK's goal  was to  make\r\n\nmoney  based  upon the  interest  rate spread,  and  yet insulate\r\n\nitself from any changes in interest rates.  Whether rates went up\r\n\nor down, the  spread would always remain.   What Dom nguez failed\r\n\nto explain to the investors was that PRIBANK was not a risk-free,\r\n\nor even a low-risk investment.  Instead, PRIBANK would be engaged\r\n\nin highly leveraged margin trading, and, like any  margin trader,\r\n\nPRIBANK's  investments could be subject  to \"margin calls.\"  That\r\n\nis, if interest rates went up, the value of REMICs and  CMOs (and\r\n\nother loan obligations) would go down, and brokerage houses could\r\n\nrequire investors  to put up  more collateral to cover  the paper\r\n\nloss.  Margin calls do not necessarily occur on the same day that\r\n\ninvestments are  adjusted and repriced  -- at the 30-day  mark in\r\n\nPRIBANK's case --  but can occur at  any time after the  value of\r\n\nthe investments falls.  PRIBANK,  which was designed to profit by\r\n\nhaving  no reserves, would not be able to cover any margin calls.\r\n\nTherefore,  any significant hike in interest rates could bankrupt\r\n\nPRIBANK, and its investors would lose their investments.\r\n\n          This significant risk was not disclosed to investors at\r\n\nthe August 30,  1993 meeting.  Instead, investors  were told that\r\n\nfluctuating  interest rates  would pose  no  threat to  PRIBANK's\r\n\nprofitability.   The investors believed that Dom nguez and Rosado\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nhad struck upon a scheme whereby they could make huge profits for\r\n\nlittle or no risk.  They invested $350,000 each in exchange for a\r\n\n5.5% share of  PRIBANK and a  seat on the  board.  Dom nguez  and\r\n\nRosado  made commissions  on this  $3.5  million of  investments.\r\n\nPRIBANK began operations in January 1994.\r\n\n          On  February 4,  1994,  the Federal  Reserve  increased\r\n\ninterest rates  by 1/4  point.   This increase  was the first  of\r\n\nseveral increases which were to occur in future weeks.  Brokerage\r\n\nhouses soon  began to  make margin  calls.   To  meet the  margin\r\n\ncalls,  PRIBANK was  required to  sell  investments before  their\r\n\nagreed-upon settlement dates, resulting in significant penalties.\r\n\nAs one  margin call  was being  paid off, another  loan would  be\r\n\ncalled,  and PRIBANK would  scramble to sell  another investment,\r\n\nincurring  more  penalties, and  draining  PRIBANK's original  $5\r\n\nmillion collateral.\r\n\n          In  the midst of  this collapse, on  February 23, 1994,\r\n\nPRIBANK held a  meeting of the board.   At the meeting, Dom nguez\r\n\npresented a picture of a smoothly-running operation, pointing out\r\n\npromising investments that  PRIBANK was looking into  and failing\r\n\nto mention the fact that PRIBANK was already  experiencing margin\r\n\ncalls and sustaining  losses.  Soon  after this meeting,  PRIBANK\r\n\nlost its remaining assets and its stock became worthless.\r\n\n          The  present suit was brought before the District Court\r\n\nof Puerto Rico under  the Securities Act of 1933, 15  U.S.C.   77\r\n\n(the \"1933 Act\"  or \"Securities Act\"), and the  Securities Act of\r\n\n1934,  15  U.S.C.     78  (the \"1934  Act\"  or  \"Exchange  Act\").\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nPlaintiffs allege that fraudulent  statements and omissions  were\r\n\nmade  by Dom nguez  and  Rosado,  and  further  allege  vicarious\r\n\nliability  on  the part  of  Dean  Witter.   The  district  court\r\n\ndismissed all  claims  on Rule  12(b)(6)  motions.   This  appeal\r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\n          On appeal, plaintiffs make a number  of claims.  First,\r\n\nthey argue that, to the  extent that the district court converted\r\n\nany  of  the  Rule  12(b)(6) motions  into  motions  for  summary\r\n\njudgment under Rule 56(c),  plaintiffs received inadequate notice\r\n\nand opportunity  to submit  evidence.  At  issue is  both whether\r\n\nsuch  a conversion  actually occurred  and  whether a  conversion\r\n\nwould have been appropriate at that stage of the case.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  next claim that the district court erred in\r\n\nfinding that  there is no  implied private cause of  action under\r\n\nsection 17(a)  of the  1933 Act.   Plaintiffs urge this  court to\r\n\nrecognize such a cause of action.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs further  contend  that  the  district  court\r\n\nerred in  concluding that  PRIBANK stock  was privately  offered.\r\n\nThe character of  PRIBANK's offering became material  to the case\r\n\nwhen,  shortly after this complaint was  filed, the Supreme Court\r\n\ndecided Gustafson  v. Alloyd  Co., 513  U.S. 561, 577-78  (1995),\r                                           \r\n\nholding  that section  12(2)  of the  1933 Act  did not  apply to\r\n\nprivate offerings.\r\n\n          Next, plaintiffs  argue that their claim  under section\r\n\n10(b)  of the 1934  Act -- and  Rule 10b-5 of  the Securities and\r\n\nExchange  Commission  promulgated  thereunder  --  was pled  with\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nsufficient  particularity.     Specifically,  they   contest  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  ruling that they  had failed to  plead specific\r\n\nfacts which create a triable question on the issue of defendants'\r\n\n\"scienter.\"\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          Finally,  plaintiffs  claim  that  the  district  court\r\n\nabused its discretion in denying  their request for leave to file\r\n\nan amended complaint  after the district court  entered judgment.\r\n\nThe argument stems from the district court's issuance of a margin\r\n\norder which indicated that this seemingly tardy request for leave\r\n\nwould be granted.  We address these arguments in turn.\r\n\n                             ANALYSIS\r                                       ANALYSIS\r                                               \r\n\nI.  Conversion of 12(b)(6) Motions\r          I.  Conversion of 12(b)(6) Motions\r\n\n          Plaintiffs allege  that the  district court  improperly\r\n\nconverted the  series of 12(b)(6)  motions at issue  into motions\r\n\nfor  summary  judgment  pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.   P.  56(c).\r\n\nPlaintiffs argue that  such a conversion is  necessarily improper\r\n\nwhere  defendants have offered no materials outside the pleadings\r\n\nand where the court has not given express notice of its intent to\r\n\nconvert the motions.  As a matter of law, plaintiffs are correct.\r\n\nHowever,  a close reading  of the district  court opinion reveals\r\n\nthat  the  court  dismissed  these claims  based  solely  on  the\r\n\ninsufficiency of the pleadings, and we affirm on those grounds.\r\n\n          In Moody v. Town of Weymouth, 805 F.2d 30, 31 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1986), we held that  when a district court fails  to give express\r\n\nnotice  to the  parties of  its intention  to convert  a 12(b)(6)\r\n\nmotion into a motion for summary judgment, there is no reversible\r\n\nerror if the party opposing the motion (1) has received materials\r\n\noutside the pleadings,  (2) has had an opportunity  to respond to\r\n\nthem, and  (3) has  not controverted their  accuracy.   The Moody\r                                                                           \r\n\n\"exception\" to the  rule that the district court  must notify the\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nparties of  an intent to  convert motions is limited,  and unless\r\n\nthe three factors listed above are present the exception does not\r\n\napply.   See Cooperativa  de Ahorro y  Cr dito Aguada  v. Kidder,\r                                                                           \r\n\nPeabody &amp;  Co., 993 F.2d 269, 273 (1st  Cir. 1993) (in deciding a\r                        \r\n\n12(b)(6) motion,  a district  court normally  must either  ignore\r\n\nextraneous   materials  or  give   the  parties  notice   and  an\r\n\nopportunity  to respond to  the conversion to  a summary judgment\r\n\nmotion).   In the present  case, the plaintiffs filed  a detailed\r\n\npleading  with several  documentary exhibits.   Defendants  argue\r\n\nthat this fact  alone put plaintiffs on notice  that any 12(b)(6)\r\n\nmotion  could  be  converted  into  a  56(c)  motion for  summary\r\n\njudgment.   This argument  fundamentally misinterprets  Moody and\r                                                                       \r\n\ntherefore fails.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  were therefore  surprised to find  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court  had  converted  the  motions.    Throughout  its\r\n\nopinion,  the district  court used  language  consistent with  an\r\n\naward of summary judgment, ruling that \"Plaintiffs have failed to\r\n\nadduce sufficient  evidence to create a material  issue of fact.\"\r\n\nHowever, an opinion's  plain language does not  always mirror its\r\n\nplain  logic, and while a quick perusal of the opinion might lead\r\n\none  to believe  that the  district court  had applied  the wrong\r\n\nstandard  of decision, looking  past the terminology  employed by\r\n\nthe court reveals an opinion illustrating the legal insufficiency\r\n\nof the pleadings for  each claim in this suit.

In  this case,  we  do not  find sufficient  evidence of\r\n\ncongressional  intent  to  overcome  the  presumption.    As  the\r\n\ndistrict court observed, Congress explicitly provided for private\r                                                      \r\n\ncauses of action  in sections 11 and 12  of the 1933 Act.   While\r\n\nthe  fact that  other provisions  of a  complex  statutory scheme\r\n\ncreate  express remedies does  not in itself  prove that Congress\r\n\ndid not  imply a private remedy in another section, see Cannon v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUniversity of Chicago,  441 U.S. 677, 690 n.13  (1979), where the\r                               \r\n\nexplicit remedies  in the same  statute address much of  the same\r\n\nconduct  and benefit  the  same parties  as  a potential  implied\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nprivate  cause of action, the circumstances militate against that\r\n\ninference.  Furthermore, the legislative history of section 17(a)\r\n\ndoes not, on the whole, favor an implied private right of action.\r\n\nSee   Newcome,  862  F.2d  at  1103-07  (conducting  an  in-depth\r                       \r\n\nexamination  of  the  legislative  history  of  this  provision).\r\n\nTherefore,  the  district court  did  not err  in  dismissing the\r\n\nplaintiffs' claim under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.\r\n\nIII.

The district  court, ruling  that the\r\n\npleadings   established  that  PRIBANK   stock  had  been  placed\r\n\nprivately, dismissed  the 12(2)  claim.   Plaintiffs appeal  this\r                   \r\n\nruling, arguing that  their pleadings did not admit  that PRIBANK\r\n\nstock was  placed privately.   Since Gustafson was  decided after\r                                                        \r\n\ntheir complaint was filed, the plaintiffs argue that they  should\r\n\nhave  received   permission  to  amend  their   complaint,  which\r\n\ncurrently fails to explicitly address whether PRIBANK's stock was\r\n\nplaced  privately or publicly.   Therefore, the question for this\r\n\ncourt to decide is whether  the pleadings, in their current form,\r\n\nestablish that PRIBANK's stock was placed privately.\r\n\n          A placement of  stock is private if it  is offered only\r\n\nto  a few sophisticated  purchasers who each  have a relationship\r\n\nwith the issuer,  enabling them to command  access to information\r\n\nthat  would otherwise be  contained in a  registration statement.\r\n\nSee Cook v.

Each shareholder of PRIBANK bought a\r\n\n5.5%  interest in  the corporation  and  a seat  on the  board of\r\n\ndirectors.  The board  was to meet each  month, and according  to\r\n\nPRIBANK's by-laws  the board  of directors  had full  control and\r\n\ndirection of the corporation's affairs and business.\r\n\n          Section  12(2) of the 1933 Act protects those investors\r\n\nwho would  otherwise be  powerless against  fraudulent offers  of\r\n\nsecurities.  When a select group of investors are asked to become\r\n\ndirectors of a new corporation,  and have access to all documents\r\n\nrelevant to  the corporation's  formation  and investments,  they\r\n\ncannot bring suit under section 12(2)  when the corporation fails\r\n\nfor the reasons  claimed in this suit.   Let us be clear.   We do\r\n\nnot mean to suggest that a director has no remedy when  defrauded\r\n\nby  others  within  a  new  corporation,  but  only  that,  under\r\n\nGustafson, section 12(2) of the 1933 Act is not available to this\r                   \r\n\nclass of claimants.  Under these circumstances, there was no need\r\n\nto  allow  leave to  amend  the  pleadings  on  this issue.    We\r\n\ntherefore affirm  the district  court's dismissal  of this  claim\r\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6).2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Plaintiffs maintain that Dom nguez' statements could  form the\r\nbasis of section 12(2) claims in spite of the fact that  they did\r\nnot appear in  the prospectus, because section 12(2) applies more\r\nbroadly to initial  public offerings which are  exempted from SEC\r\nregistration -- in this case due to the \"intrastate\" character of\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nIV.

According to the complaint,\r\n\nalthough  both Dom nguez and Rosado were vice-presidents of large\r\n\nfinancial institutions, \"neither  one of  them had  engaged in  a\r\n\nREPO transaction  on behalf  of any bank  with assets  similar to\r\n\nthose  of PRIBANK, and  had no  manner to  assure that  what they\r\n\nrepresented  to plaintiffs  and the  other  investors was  true.\"\r\n\nGiven   10(b)'s   requirement   of  a   pleading   of   scienter,\r                                                                          \r\n\ncharacterizing  the defendants as irresponsible or \"in over their\r\n\nheads\" does not further the plaintiffs' cause. \r\n\n          The complaint is also replete with allegations based on\r\n\n\"information and  belief\" that Dom nguez and Rosado were aware of\r\n\nthe  risk  of margin  calls.   However, \"information  and belief\"\r\n\nalone is insufficient to meet 9(b)'s particularity requirement in\r\n\nthis context.   See Romani v. Shearson, Lehman,  Hutton, 929 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n875, 878 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n\n          When we examine these pleadings carefully, we find that\r\n\nthere are no specific allegations  of fact which strongly imply a\r\n\nfraudulent  intent.    At most,  the  complaint  contains general\r\n\ninferences that Dom nguez and Rosado \"must have  known\" about the\r\n\nrisks of margin calls and  the devastating effect they could have\r\n\non   PRIBANK.    Unfortunately  for  the  plaintiffs,  these  are\r\n\nprecisely the types  of inferences which this court,  on numerous\r\n\noccasions, has determined to be inadequate to withstand Rule 9(b)\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nscrutiny.

Leave to Amend the Complaint\r          V.  Leave to Amend the Complaint\r\n\n          After the district court's opinion issued in this case,\r\n\nthe plaintiffs filed  a motion for leave to  amend the pleadings.\r\n\nThe  court  denied  this  motion.    However,  before  ruling  on\r\n\ndefendants' motions to  dismiss, the district court  had issued a\r\n\nperplexing margin  order amending this case's  briefing schedule.\r\n\nAccording to  the margin  order, any  motion requesting  leave to\r\n\namend pleadings  and amended pleadings  could be  filed ten  days\r\n\nafter  the court  resolved all  \"pending pleadings.\"    While the\r\n\nmeaning  of the phrase \"pending pleadings\" is unclear, plaintiffs\r\n\nargue that the phrase referred to the pending motions to dismiss,\r\n\nand  that the  denial of  their subsequent  request for  leave to\r\n\namend was therefore an abuse of discretion.8  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  The  complaint contains additional allegations  that Dom nguez\r\nand Rosado knew that PRIBANK  was disintegrating at the same time\r\nthat they presented  a rosy picture to investors  at the February\r\nboard  meeting.    However,  these  allegations involve  activity\r\noccurring well after the original  sale of PRIBANK stock, and are\r\ntherefore  immaterial for  the  purposes of  this 10(b)  cause of\r\naction.  See Gross, 93 F.3d at 993 (citing Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1222,\r                                                         \r\nfor the proposition  that allegations of conduct  occurring after\r\nsale or exchange at  issue in 10(b) claim are irrelevant).   Even\r\nif the allegations  are true, the fact that  Dom nguez and Rosado\r\nhad discovered  PRIBANK's fatal  flaw before  the February  board\r\nmeeting is not probative of any attempt to defraud the plaintiffs\r\nmonths earlier. \r\n\n8  We note  that a motion to dismiss  is not a \"pleading\" as  the\r\nterm  is defined in  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 7.   Furthermore, the order\r\ndoes not promise to grant  any motions filed after the resolution\r                                   \r\nof \"pending pleadings,\" but instead states that such requests and\r\npleadings may be filed.  Nonetheless, we believe that plaintiffs'\r                                \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n          Looking  at the  order  itself  does  not  resolve  our\r\n\nuncertainty  about its  interpretation.    The  motion  that  was\r\n\ngranted via margin  order was five  pages long.  It  was entitled\r\n\n\"Plaintiffs' Objections and Proposed Changes to Scheduling Order\"\r\n\nand  generally consisted of very ordinary requests for extensions\r\n\nof  time.   Buried  on  the  third  page, however,  was  a  short\r\n\nparagraph containing  the vague  and  confusing language  sampled\r\n\nabove,  which could  be interpreted  as  a request  for a  highly\r\n\nunconventional  scheduling change.  When the district court judge\r\n\ngranted the  motion, he did so  by writing \"granted\" in  the left\r\n\nmargin of the first page, as is customary in district courts.  It\r\n\nis entirely  possible that the  judge was unaware of  the unusual\r\n\nand arguably  improper request  that he  was supposedly  granting\r\n\nalong  with  the  standard extensions  contained  in  the motion.\r\n\nHowever, while the motion filed by the plaintiffs was unclear, it\r\n\ncould not be fairly characterized  as deceptive.  Since no motion\r\n\nto reconsider this  margin order was filed,  and no clarification\r\n\nor amendment to the order issued from the court, we must give the\r\n\norder its reasonable construction. \r\n\n          This  court   is  asked  to   determine  the   meaning,\r\n\npropriety, and  effect of the  margin order.  Depending  upon the\r\n\ninterpretation of  the motion,  two bedrock  principles of  civil\r\n\nprocedure may conflict in this case.  On the one hand, a district\r\n\ncourt cannot allow an amended pleading where a final judgment has\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\ninterpretation  of the  order as  a  blank check  to rewrite  the\r\ncomplaint  after the  case  has been  dismissed  is not  entirely\r\nimplausible.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nbeen rendered unless that judgment  is first set aside or vacated\r\n\npursuant to Fed.

On the other hand,\r                   \r\n\nthe  district   court's  scheduling  order   purportedly  allowed\r\n\nplaintiffs just such a luxury, and, if it did, they were entitled\r\n\nto rely on that  order.

On review,\r\n\nwe cannot  hope to understand  the nuances of a  district court's\r\n\nbriefing schedule  as  completely as  the judge  who managed  the\r\n\ncase.   There  may well  have  been comments  made in  scheduling\r\n\nconferences  which  clarified  the  order.    Unfortunately,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  never raised this  issue below.   Plaintiffs' request\r\n\nfor leave  to  amend was  part of  its motion  to reconsider  the\r\n\ndismissal  of its  claims, and  it  contained no  mention of  the\r\n\nmargin  order or  plaintiffs' understanding  that  they had  been\r\n\npromised  a leave  to  amend.   This failure  to raise  the issue\r\n\nbefore the district court  is fatal to the claim on  appeal.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nVillafa e-Neriz  v. F.D.I.C., 75  F.3d 727, 734  (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                      \r\n\nWe must  be especially vigilant  in applying this rule  where the\r\n\ndispute involves an understanding reached by  the parties and the\r\n\ndistrict court during the pre-trial stages of a case.\r\n\n          In any case, we need not remand this case to allow  for\r\n\na revision of the complaint because  the  amendments  proposed by\r\n\nthe plaintiffs would be futile.  See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178\r                                                             \r\n\n(1962)  (leave to  amend  shall not  be granted  where amendments\r\n\nwould be  futile); Resolution Trust  Corp. v.

In their request for leave to amend,\r\n\nand  again before  this court,  plaintiffs allude to  the factual\r\n\nallegations  which   they  would  incorporate  into   an  amended\r\n\ncomplaint, producing  detailed documentary evidence  for support.\r\n\nNonetheless, a careful review of this material reveals that these\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\namended claims would be destined for dismissal.\r\n\n          There exists no  private right of action  under section\r\n\n17(a) of the  1933 Act,  and section  12(2) of the  Act does  not\r\n\napply  to  the  issuance of  securities  under  the circumstances\r\n\npresented by this case.  See supra Sections II &amp; III.  No further\r                                            \r\n\nfactual  allegations can save  these claims.   Furthermore, while\r\n\nthe  10(b) action  could survive  dismissal  if plaintiffs  could\r\n\nprovide more specific allegations of  fact which strongly imply a\r\n\nfraudulent  intent on  the  part  of  Dom nguez and  Rosado,  the\r\n\nproposed amendments to the complaint would not do so.  Plaintiffs\r\n\nprovide an expert's  affidavit concluding  that defendants  would\r\n\nhave  known  of the  likelihood  that their  securities  would be\r\n\nsubject  to margin calls,  and the  devastating effect  that this\r\n\nwould have on PRIBANK.  Yet,  as we have stated, the pleading  of\r\n\nscienter \"may not rest on a bare inference that a defendant 'must\r\n\nhave had' knowledge  of the facts.\"   Greenstone, 975 F.2d at  26\r                                                          \r\n\n(quoting Barker, 797 F.2d at 497).9  We conclude that the amended\r                         \r\n\n10(b) claim would not have passed 9(b) scrutiny.10\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9   Furthermore,  this affidavit,  along  with plaintiffs'  other\r\ndocumentary evidence  in support  of their request  for leave  to\r\namend, indicates that  Dom nguez and Rosado invested and lost one\r\nand a half million  dollars of their own money in  PRIBANK, which\r                                                        \r\nundermines any inference of scienter. \r\n\n10  Plaintiffs also argue  that they filed requests for  leave to\r\namend their complaint  prior to the resolution of  the motions to\r                                      \r\ndismiss.  We find that these \"motions\" were never actually filed.\r\nInstead, the plaintiffs, in other filings, merely mentioned that,\r\nat some point,  they would seek leave  to amend.  That  leave was\r\nnot sought until after the case was  dismissed.  In any case, the\r\nissue is mooted by our  finding that amending the complaint would\r\nbe futile.\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          For  the reasons stated in this  opinion, we affirm the\r                                                                 affirm\r                                                                       \r\n\njudgment of the district court.\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n",

When PRIBANK failed, the plaintiffs brought this suit, claiming that the investment bankers marketing the PRIBANK stock defrauded them by failing to mention the possibility that PRIBANK's securities would be \"called\" in the event of an interest rate adjustment.  The investors filed this suit under sections 12(2) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 77l, 77q, as well as section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j, and Rule 10(b)(5) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") promulgated thereunder.  The district court dismissed all of these claims on a motion to dismiss.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing a 12(b)(6) motion, we must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and accord the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences.  See LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841 (1st Cir.1993).  The following recitation of this case's background reflects this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs Miguel Maldonado, et al.--important clients of Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. of Puerto Rico (\"Dean Witter\")--received mailed invitations to a meeting at an exclusive San Juan club where they would be presented with a select investment opportunity.  At the August 30, 1993 meeting, Ramn Domnguez, Senior Vice-President and Sales Manager of Dean Witter, made a presentation regarding the formation of PRIBANK, a new corporation.  He explained PRIBANK's investment philosophy, and stated that individual investors' participation would be limited to ten blocks of $350,000, with an additional $1.5 million coming from himself and Antonio Luis Rosado--Vice President of Santander National Bank, and president-to-be of PRIBANK.  Each investor would become a director of the corporation.  According to Domnguez, PRIBANK was a virtually risk-free investment which was projected to return 176% of the investors' principal in only two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRIBANK's strategy was relatively simple.  PRIBANK would use $5 million of collateral to open margin accounts of almost $300 million with various brokerage houses.  PRIBANK would be permitted to leverage itself through these brokerage houses for 60 times its capital because it had the credit of Dean Witter to back it up and because funds provided to PRIBANK on its margin accounts were not allowed to be used for the purchase of credit risk assets.  In other words, PRIBANK would be seen by the brokerage houses as a safe entity because its investments would be low risk and its credit with Dean Witter was trusted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The money in PRIBANK's margin accounts would be used to purchase Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (\"REMICs\") and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (\"CMOs\"), effectively making PRIBANK the lender for numerous home mortgages.  These REMICs and CMOs would pay interest to PRIBANK at a higher rate than PRIBANK was required to pay to the brokerage houses for the money in its margin accounts.  The difference between the low interest rate PRIBANK would be paying and the higher interest rate PRIBANK would be collecting--the \"spread\"--would be PRIBANK's profit.  Since PRIBANK was able to borrow approximately 60 times more than its collateral, a spread of only 1 percent would have resulted in huge profits for PRIBANK's investors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further property of PRIBANK's investment structure made it unique.  PRIBANK would only purchase investments called \"floaters,\" which would be re-priced and adjusted for prevailing interest rates every thirty days.  Every thirty days, PRIBANK would collect interest on these investments.  PRIBANK planned to carefully structure its investments so that each month, on the same day that interest payments were due to the brokerage houses, PRIBANK would also collect interest on its investments.  Domnguez labelled this as \"matching.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would give PRIBANK an advantage over normal financial institutions which purchased floating REMICS and CMOs without this perfect matching.  Normal financial institutions have mismatched inventories, and have to keep reserves on hand to account for withdrawals and to pay obligations when they come due.  The higher interest rates these institutions make on their loans barely make up for the potential interest lost on the money sitting in their reserves at any given time.  However, due to its perfect matching, PRIBANK would not be required to keep any significant reserves on hand, and could invest all of its money every month, enabling it to take full advantage of the spread in interest rates.  Therein lay the key to PRIBANK's philosophy, and eventually to its downfall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Domnguez explained that PRIBANK's goal was to make money based upon the interest rate spread, and yet insulate itself from any changes in interest rates.  Whether rates went up or down, the spread would always remain.  What Domnguez failed to explain to the investors was that PRIBANK was not a risk-free, or even a low-risk investment.  Instead, PRIBANK would be engaged in highly leveraged margin trading, and, like any margin trader, PRIBANK's investments could be subject to \"margin calls.\"   That is, if interest rates went up, the value of REMICs and CMOs (and other loan obligations) would go down, and brokerage houses could require investors to put up more collateral to cover the paper loss.  Margin calls do not necessarily occur on the same day that investments are adjusted and repriced--at the 30-day mark in PRIBANK's case--but can occur at any time after the value of the investments falls.  PRIBANK, which was designed to profit by having no reserves, would not be able to cover any margin calls.  Therefore, any significant hike in interest rates could bankrupt PRIBANK, and its investors would lose their investments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This significant risk was not disclosed to investors at the August 30, 1993 meeting.  Instead, investors were told that fluctuating interest rates would pose no threat to PRIBANK's profitability.  The investors believed that Domnguez and Rosado had struck upon a scheme whereby they could make huge profits for little or no risk.  They invested $350,000 each in exchange for a 5.5% share of PRIBANK and a seat on the board.  Domnguez and Rosado made commissions on this $3.5 million of investments.  PRIBANK began operations in January 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1994, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 1/4 point.  This increase was the first of several increases which were to occur in future weeks.  Brokerage houses soon began to make margin calls.  To meet the margin calls, PRIBANK was required to sell investments before their agreed-upon settlement dates, resulting in significant penalties.  As one margin call was being paid off, another loan would be called, and PRIBANK would scramble to sell another investment, incurring more penalties, and draining PRIBANK's original $5 million collateral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the midst of this collapse, on February 23, 1994, PRIBANK held a meeting of the board.  At the meeting, Domnguez presented a picture of a smoothly-running operation, pointing out promising investments that PRIBANK was looking into and failing to mention the fact that PRIBANK was already experiencing margin calls and sustaining losses.  Soon after this meeting, PRIBANK lost its remaining assets and its stock became worthless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present suit was brought before the District Court of Puerto Rico under the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77a (the \"1933 Act\" or \"Securities Act\"), and the Securities Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78a (the \"1934 Act\" or \"Exchange Act\").  Plaintiffs allege that fraudulent statements and omissions were made by Domnguez and Rosado, and further allege vicarious liability on the part of Dean Witter.  The district court dismissed all claims on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs make a number of claims.  First, they argue that, to the extent that the district court converted any of the Rule 12(b)(6) motions into motions for summary judgment under Rule 56(c), plaintiffs received inadequate notice and opportunity to submit evidence.  At issue is both whether such a conversion actually occurred and whether a conversion would have been appropriate at that stage of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next claim that the district court erred in finding that there is no implied private cause of action under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.  Plaintiffs urge this court to recognize such a cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs further contend that the district court erred in concluding that PRIBANK stock was privately offered.  The character of PRIBANK's offering became material to the case when, shortly after this complaint was filed, the Supreme Court decided Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 577-78, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 1070-71, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995), holding that section 12(2) of the 1933 Act did not apply to private offerings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, plaintiffs argue that their claim under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act--and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder--was pled with sufficient particularity.  Specifically, they contest the district court's ruling that they had failed to plead specific facts which create a triable question on the issue of defendants' \"scienter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying their request for leave to file an amended complaint after the district court entered judgment.  The argument stems from the district court's issuance of a margin order which indicated that this seemingly tardy request for leave would be granted.  We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p>I. Conversion of 12(b)(6) Motions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that the district court improperly converted the series of 12(b)(6) motions at issue into motions for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Plaintiffs argue that such a conversion is necessarily improper where defendants have offered no materials outside the pleadings and where the court has not given express notice of its intent to convert the motions.  As a matter of law, plaintiffs are correct.  However, a close reading of the district court opinion reveals that the court dismissed these claims based solely on the insufficiency of the pleadings, and we affirm on those grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Moody v. Town of Weymouth, 805 F.2d 30, 31 (1st Cir.1986), we held that when a district court fails to give express notice to the parties of its intention to convert a 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment, there is no reversible error if the party opposing the motion (1) has received materials outside the pleadings, (2) has had an opportunity to respond to them, and (3) has not controverted their accuracy.  The Moody \"exception\" to the rule that the district court must notify the parties of an intent to convert motions is limited, and unless the three factors listed above are present the exception does not apply.  See Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito Aguada v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., 993 F.2d 269, 273 (1st Cir.1993) (in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion, a district court normally must either ignore extraneous materials or give the parties notice and an opportunity to respond to the conversion to a summary judgment motion).  In the present case, the plaintiffs filed a detailed pleading with several documentary exhibits.  Defendants argue that this fact alone put plaintiffs on notice that any 12(b)(6) motion could be converted into a 56(c) motion for summary judgment.  This argument fundamentally misinterprets Moody and therefore fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs were therefore surprised to find that the district court had converted the motions.  Throughout its opinion, the district court used language consistent with an award of summary judgment, ruling that \"Plaintiffs have failed to adduce sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact.\"   However, an opinion's plain language does not always mirror its plain logic, and while a quick perusal of the opinion might lead one to believe that the district court had applied the wrong standard of decision, looking past the terminology employed by the court reveals an opinion illustrating the legal insufficiency of the pleadings for each claim in this suit.  See Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, F.S.B., 958 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1992) (the determination of whether a district court has converted a 12(b)(6) motion is \"functional rather than mechanical\").  On that basis, we affirm the standard of decision actually employed by the district court, and we now examine each of the district court's rulings regarding the insufficiency of the pleadings in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed one of the plaintiffs' claims after concluding that there was no implied private cause of action under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Section 17 of the 1933 Act provides that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>It shall be unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by the use of the mails, directly or indirectly--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>(2) to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>(3) to engage in any transaction, practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 77q.  Courts and law enforcement agencies have the authority to enforce section 17(a) of the 1933 Act via injunction and criminal prosecution.  However, for years circuit courts have struggled with the question of whether an implied private right of action to enforce section 17(a) also exists.  The Supreme Court has never answered the question.  See Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299, 304 n. 9, 105 S.Ct. 2622, 2625 n. 9, 86 L.Ed.2d 215 (1985).  Until today, neither had this court.  See Cleary v. Perfectune, Inc., 700 F.2d 774, 779 (1st Cir.1983)(declining to reach this question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue has caused confusion because, while neither the language nor the history of section 17(a) clearly indicates a congressional intent to create a private right of action, see Newcome v. Esrey, 862 F.2d 1099, 1103-07 (4th Cir.1988), section 10(b) of the 1934 Act--with substantially similar language--has always been interpreted to provide for a private right of action.  See Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 385-87, 103 S.Ct. 683, 688-90, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983) (expressly interpreting section 10(b)'s private right of action as consistent with securities laws' \"broad remedial purposes\").  While some courts did not find the requisite congressional intent to infer a private right of action from section 17(a), see Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 574-76, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2488-89, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979) (legislative intent is the primary factor to consider when addressing whether a private right of action exists), other circuits found no meaningful distinction between section 17(a) and section 10(b).  Compare Daniel v. Teamsters, 561 F.2d 1223, 1244-46 (7th Cir.1977) (holding that a private right of action exists), and SEC v.

Thus, while the implied cause of action under 10(b) would expose only the deceitful to private causes of action, an implied cause of action under 17(a) would impose such liability on merely negligent wrongdoers.  Furthermore, the Court had ruled four years earlier that a judicially created cause of action, such as the one implied under section 10(b), could not be extended to actions premised on negligent wrongdoing.  See Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 210, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1389, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aaron and Ernst highlighted for courts a significant distinction between implying private causes of action under the two sections.  While the 10(b) implied cause of action has continued to enjoy unanimous recognition and the imprimatur of a unanimous Supreme Court in Huddleston, the 17(a) cause of action has been held up to renewed scrutiny.  In recent years, every circuit to have addressed the issue has refused to recognize a private right of action under section 17(a), including four circuits which originally had held otherwise.  See Finkel v. Stratton Corp., 962 F.2d 169, 174-75 (2d Cir.1992) (noting that Kirshner v. United States, 603 F.2d 234 (2d Cir.1978), had been overruled);  Newcome v. Esrey, 862 F.2d 1099, 1101-07 (4th Cir.1988) (overruling Newman v. Prior, 518 F.2d 97 (4th Cir.1975));  Stephenson v.

We now come to the same conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether an implied private right of action exists in a statute, we look to congressional intent, see Touche Ross, 442 U.S. at 574-76, 99 S.Ct. at 2488-89, keeping in mind that there is a strong presumption against such inferences.  See Sterling Suffolk Racecourse v. Burrillville Racing, 989 F.2d 1266, 1268 (1st Cir.1993).  In this case, we do not find sufficient evidence of congressional intent to overcome the presumption.  As the district court observed, Congress explicitly provided for private causes of action in sections 11 and 12 of the 1933 Act.  While the fact that other provisions of a complex statutory scheme create express remedies does not in itself prove that Congress did not imply a private remedy in another section, see Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 690 n. 13, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1954 n. 13, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), where the explicit remedies in the same statute address much of the same conduct and benefit the same parties as a potential implied private cause of action, the circumstances militate against that inference.  Furthermore, the legislative history of section 17(a) does not, on the whole, favor an implied private right of action.  See Newcome, 862 F.2d at 1103-07 (conducting an in-depth examination of the legislative history of this provision).  Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing the plaintiffs' claim under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also brought suit under section 12(2) of the Securities Act.  This provision establishes civil liability for any person who uses fraudulent means to sell a security.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  However, after the complaint was filed in this case, the Supreme Court conclusively decided that section 12(2) applies exclusively to \"initial public offerings.\"   See Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 577-78, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 1070-71, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995).  The district court, ruling that the pleadings established that PRIBANK stock had been placed privately, dismissed the 12(2) claim.  Plaintiffs appeal this ruling, arguing that their pleadings did not admit that PRIBANK stock was placed privately.  Since Gustafson was decided after their complaint was filed, the plaintiffs argue that they should have received permission to amend their complaint, which currently fails to explicitly address whether PRIBANK's stock was placed privately or publicly.  Therefore, the question for this court to decide is whether the pleadings, in their current form, establish that PRIBANK's stock was placed privately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A placement of stock is private if it is offered only to a few sophisticated purchasers who each have a relationship with the issuer, enabling them to command access to information that would otherwise be contained in a registration statement.  See Cook v. Avien, Inc., 573 F.2d 685, 691 (1st Cir.1978).  \"The determination of whether an offer is not public has not been relegated to a simple numerical test.\"   See Van Dyke v. Coburn Enters., Inc., 873 F.2d 1094 (8th Cir.1989) (citing SEC v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 125, 73 S.Ct. 981, 984-85, 97 L.Ed. 1494 (1953)).  Instead, courts are required to weigh the facts of each case carefully to assess whether the offerees need to be protected under the 1933 Act.  See Ralston Purina, 346 U.S. at 127, 73 S.Ct. at 985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, twelve invitations were sent to Dean Witter clients.  Domnguez had personally managed accounts in the past for each of them.  The plaintiffs were not merely asked passively to invest in an existing entity, but to partner in starting a new corporation.  Each shareholder of PRIBANK bought a 5.5% interest in the corporation and a seat on the board of directors.  The board was to meet each month, and according to PRIBANK's by-laws the board of directors had full control and direction of the corporation's affairs and business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act protects those investors who would otherwise be powerless against fraudulent offers of securities.  When a select group of investors are asked to become directors of a new corporation, and have access to all documents relevant to the corporation's formation and investments, they cannot bring suit under section 12(2) when the corporation fails for the reasons claimed in this suit.  Let us be clear.  We do not mean to suggest that a director has no remedy when defrauded by others within a new corporation, but only that, under Gustafson, section 12(2) of the 1933 Act is not available to this class of claimants.  Under these circumstances, there was no need to allow leave to amend the pleadings on this issue.  We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of this claim under Rule 12(b)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>IV.

Plaintiffs allege that Domnguez and Rosado understood and concealed the risks of margin calls on the PRIBANK investments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has been clear and consistent in holding that, under section 10(b), plaintiffs must plead specific facts giving rise to a \"strong inference\" of fraudulent intent.  See Greenstone v. Cambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  \"Courts have uniformly held inadequate a complaint's general averment of the defendant's 'knowledge' of material falsity unless the complaint also sets forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that defendant knew that a statement was false or misleading.\"  Id. Applying this standard to plaintiffs' complaint, the district court dismissed the claim for failure to plead scienter with sufficient particularity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This court has been 'especially rigorous' in applying Rule 9(b) in securities fraud actions 'to minimize the chance that a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim will bring a suit and conduct extensive discovery in the hopes of obtaining an increased settlement, rather than in the hopes that the process will reveal relevant evidence.' \"  Shaw v. Digital Equipment Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1223 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Romani v. Shearson, Lehman, Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir.1991)).  However, in examining a complaint for the requisite particularity in allegations of fraud, we are required to apply a delicate standard.  While Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) proscribes the pleading of \"fraud by hindsight,\" we also cannot expect plaintiffs to plead \"fraud with complete insight\" before discovery is complete.  Id. at 1225.   We therefore look carefully for specific allegations of fact giving rise to a \"strong inference\" of fraudulent intent, see Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 25, keeping in mind that the pleading of scienter \"may not rest on a bare inference that a defendant 'must have had' knowledge of the facts.\"  Id. at 26 (quoting Barker v. Henderson, Franklin, Starnes &amp; Holt, 797 F.2d 490, 497 (7th Cir.1986)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' brief argues that Domnguez and Rosado were \"persons highly knowledgeable and with much expertise in the field of securities and investments of the type purchased by PRIBANK.\"   However, the complaint dismissed by the district court paints a somewhat different picture.  According to the complaint, although both Domnguez and Rosado were vice-presidents of large financial institutions, \"neither one of them had engaged in a REPO transaction on behalf of any bank with assets similar to those of PRIBANK, and had no manner to assure that what they represented to plaintiffs and the other investors was true.\"   Given 10(b)'s requirement of a pleading of scienter, characterizing the defendants as irresponsible or \"in over their heads\" does not further the plaintiffs' cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint is also replete with allegations based on \"information and belief\" that Domnguez and Rosado were aware of the risk of margin calls.  However, \"information and belief\" alone is insufficient to meet 9(b)'s particularity requirement in this context.  See Romani v. Shearson, Lehman, Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we examine these pleadings carefully, we find that there are no specific allegations of fact which strongly imply a fraudulent intent.  At most, the complaint contains general inferences that Domnguez and Rosado \"must have known\" about the risks of margin calls and the devastating effect they could have on PRIBANK.  Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, these are precisely the types of inferences which this court, on numerous occasions, has determined to be inadequate to withstand Rule 9(b) scrutiny.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1223;  Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, 24 F.3d 357, 367 (1st Cir.1994);  Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26;  Romani, 929 F.2d at 878.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Leave to Amend the Complaint</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court's opinion issued in this case, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the pleadings.  The court denied this motion.  However, before ruling on defendants' motions to dismiss, the district court had issued a perplexing margin order amending this case's briefing schedule.  According to the margin order, any motion requesting leave to amend pleadings and amended pleadings could be filed ten days after the court resolved all \"pending pleadings.\"   While the meaning of the phrase \"pending pleadings\" is unclear, plaintiffs argue that the phrase referred to the pending motions to dismiss, and that the denial of their subsequent request for leave to amend was therefore an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking at the order itself does not resolve our uncertainty about its interpretation.  The motion that was granted via margin order was five pages long.  It was entitled \"Plaintiffs' Objections and Proposed Changes to Scheduling Order\" and generally consisted of very ordinary requests for extensions of time.  Buried on the third page, however, was a short paragraph containing the vague and confusing language sampled above, which could be interpreted as a request for a highly unconventional scheduling change.  When the district court judge granted the motion, he did so by writing \"granted\" in the left margin of the first page, as is customary in district courts.  It is entirely possible that the judge was unaware of the unusual and arguably improper request that he was supposedly granting along with the standard extensions contained in the motion.  However, while the motion filed by the plaintiffs was unclear, it could not be fairly characterized as deceptive.  Since no motion to reconsider this margin order was filed, and no clarification or amendment to the order issued from the court, we must give the order its reasonable construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court is asked to determine the meaning, propriety, and effect of the margin order.  Depending upon the interpretation of the motion, two bedrock principles of civil procedure may conflict in this case.  On the one hand, a district court cannot allow an amended pleading where a final judgment has been rendered unless that judgment is first set aside or vacated pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 or 60.  See Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez, 22 F.3d 384, 389 (1st Cir.1994).  On the other hand, the district court's scheduling order purportedly allowed plaintiffs just such a luxury, and, if it did, they were entitled to rely on that order.  See Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29-30 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[W]hen a court charts a procedural route, lawyers and litigants are entitled to rely on it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we are keenly interested in the district court's interpretation of its own order.  On review, we cannot hope to understand the nuances of a district court's briefing schedule as completely as the judge who managed the case.  There may well have been comments made in scheduling conferences which clarified the order.  Unfortunately, the plaintiffs never raised this issue below.  Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend was part of its motion to reconsider the dismissal of its claims, and it contained no mention of the margin order or plaintiffs' understanding that they had been promised a leave to amend.  This failure to raise the issue before the district court is fatal to the claim on appeal.  See Villafane-Neriz v. F.D.I.C., 75 F.3d 727, 734 (1st Cir.1996).  We must be especially vigilant in applying this rule where the dispute involves an understanding reached by the parties and the district court during the pre-trial stages of a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, we need not remand this case to allow for a revision of the complaint because the amendments proposed by the plaintiffs would be futile.  See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (leave to amend shall not be granted where amendments would be futile);  Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir.1994) (same).  In their request for leave to amend, and again before this court, plaintiffs allude to the factual allegations which they would incorporate into an amended complaint, producing detailed documentary evidence for support.  Nonetheless, a careful review of this material reveals that these amended claims would be destined for dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There exists no private right of action under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, and section 12(2) of the Act does not apply to the issuance of securities under the circumstances presented by this case.  See supra Sections II &amp; III.  No further factual allegations can save these claims.  Furthermore, while the 10(b) action could survive dismissal if plaintiffs could provide more specific allegations of fact which strongly imply a fraudulent intent on the part of Domnguez and Rosado, the proposed amendments to the complaint would not do so.  Plaintiffs provide an expert's affidavit concluding that defendants would have known of the likelihood that their securities would be subject to margin calls, and the devastating effect that this would have on PRIBANK.  Yet, as we have stated, the pleading of scienter \"may not rest on a bare inference that a defendant 'must have had' knowledge of the facts.\"  Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26 (quoting Barker, 797 F.2d at 497).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  We conclude that the amended 10(b) claim would not have passed 9(b) scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77l(a)(2):</p>\n        <p>Any person who ... offers or sells a security ... by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails, by means of a prospectus or oral communication, which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (the purchaser not knowing of such untruth or omission), and who shall not sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of such untruth or omission, shall be liable ... to the person purchasing such security from him, who may sue either at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the consideration paid for such security with interest thereon, upon the tender of such security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs maintain that Domnguez' statements could form the basis of section 12(2) claims in spite of the fact that they did not appear in the prospectus, because section 12(2) applies more broadly to initial public offerings which are exempted from SEC registration--in this case due to the \"intrastate\" character of PRIBANK's offering.

However, these allegations involve activity occurring well after the original sale of PRIBANK stock, and are therefore immaterial for the purposes of this 10(b) cause of action.  See Gross, 93 F.3d at 993 (citing Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1222, for the proposition that allegations of conduct occurring after sale or exchange at issue in 10(b) claim are irrelevant).  Even if the allegations are true, the fact that Domnguez and Rosado had discovered PRIBANK's fatal flaw before the February board meeting is not probative of any attempt to defraud the plaintiffs months earlier</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We note that a motion to dismiss is not a \"pleading\" as the term is defined in Fed.R.Civ.P. 7.  Furthermore, the order does not promise to grant any motions filed after the resolution of \"pending pleadings,\" but instead states that such requests and pleadings may be filed.   Nonetheless, we believe that plaintiffs' interpretation of the order as a blank check to rewrite the complaint after the case has been dismissed is not entirely implausible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, this affidavit, along with plaintiffs' other documentary evidence in support of their request for leave to amend, indicates that Domnguez and Rosado invested and lost one and a half million dollars of their own money in PRIBANK, which undermines any inference of scienter</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also argue that they filed requests for leave to amend their complaint prior to the resolution of the motions to dismiss.  We find that these \"motions\" were never actually filed.  Instead, the plaintiffs, in other filings, merely mentioned that, at some point, they would seek leave to amend.  That leave was not sought until after the case was dismissed.  In any case, the issue is mooted by our finding that amending the complaint would be futile</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

When PRIBANK failed, the plaintiffs brought this suit, claiming that the investment bankers marketing the PRIBANK stock defrauded them by failing to mention the possibility that PRIBANK's securities would be \"called\" in the event of an interest rate adjustment.

See LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 841 (1st Cir.1993).  The following recitation of this case's background reflects this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs Miguel Maldonado, et al.--important clients of Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. of Puerto Rico (\"Dean Witter\")--received mailed invitations to a meeting at an exclusive San Juan club where they would be presented with a select investment opportunity.  At the August 30, 1993 meeting, Ramn Domnguez, Senior Vice-President and Sales Manager of Dean Witter, made a presentation regarding the formation of PRIBANK, a new corporation.  He explained PRIBANK's investment philosophy, and stated that individual investors' participation would be limited to ten blocks of $350,000, with an additional $1.5 million coming from himself and Antonio Luis Rosado--Vice President of Santander National Bank, and president-to-be of PRIBANK.  Each investor would become a director of the corporation.  According to Domnguez, PRIBANK was a virtually risk-free investment which was projected to return 176% of the investors' principal in only two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRIBANK's strategy was relatively simple.  PRIBANK would use $5 million of collateral to open margin accounts of almost $300 million with various brokerage houses.  PRIBANK would be permitted to leverage itself through these brokerage houses for 60 times its capital because it had the credit of Dean Witter to back it up and because funds provided to PRIBANK on its margin accounts were not allowed to be used for the purchase of credit risk assets.  In other words, PRIBANK would be seen by the brokerage houses as a safe entity because its investments would be low risk and its credit with Dean Witter was trusted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The money in PRIBANK's margin accounts would be used to purchase Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (\"REMICs\") and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (\"CMOs\"), effectively making PRIBANK the lender for numerous home mortgages.  These REMICs and CMOs would pay interest to PRIBANK at a higher rate than PRIBANK was required to pay to the brokerage houses for the money in its margin accounts.  The difference between the low interest rate PRIBANK would be paying and the higher interest rate PRIBANK would be collecting--the \"spread\"--would be PRIBANK's profit.  Since PRIBANK was able to borrow approximately 60 times more than its collateral, a spread of only 1 percent would have resulted in huge profits for PRIBANK's investors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further property of PRIBANK's investment structure made it unique.  PRIBANK would only purchase investments called \"floaters,\" which would be re-priced and adjusted for prevailing interest rates every thirty days.  Every thirty days, PRIBANK would collect interest on these investments.  PRIBANK planned to carefully structure its investments so that each month, on the same day that interest payments were due to the brokerage houses, PRIBANK would also collect interest on its investments.  Domnguez labelled this as \"matching.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would give PRIBANK an advantage over normal financial institutions which purchased floating REMICS and CMOs without this perfect matching.  Normal financial institutions have mismatched inventories, and have to keep reserves on hand to account for withdrawals and to pay obligations when they come due.  The higher interest rates these institutions make on their loans barely make up for the potential interest lost on the money sitting in their reserves at any given time.  However, due to its perfect matching, PRIBANK would not be required to keep any significant reserves on hand, and could invest all of its money every month, enabling it to take full advantage of the spread in interest rates.  Therein lay the key to PRIBANK's philosophy, and eventually to its downfall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Domnguez explained that PRIBANK's goal was to make money based upon the interest rate spread, and yet insulate itself from any changes in interest rates.  Whether rates went up or down, the spread would always remain.  What Domnguez failed to explain to the investors was that PRIBANK was not a risk-free, or even a low-risk investment.  Instead, PRIBANK would be engaged in highly leveraged margin trading, and, like any margin trader, PRIBANK's investments could be subject to \"margin calls.\"   That is, if interest rates went up, the value of REMICs and CMOs (and other loan obligations) would go down, and brokerage houses could require investors to put up more collateral to cover the paper loss.  Margin calls do not necessarily occur on the same day that investments are adjusted and repriced--at the 30-day mark in PRIBANK's case--but can occur at any time after the value of the investments falls.  PRIBANK, which was designed to profit by having no reserves, would not be able to cover any margin calls.  Therefore, any significant hike in interest rates could bankrupt PRIBANK, and its investors would lose their investments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This significant risk was not disclosed to investors at the August 30, 1993 meeting.  Instead, investors were told that fluctuating interest rates would pose no threat to PRIBANK's profitability.  The investors believed that Domnguez and Rosado had struck upon a scheme whereby they could make huge profits for little or no risk.  They invested $350,000 each in exchange for a 5.5% share of PRIBANK and a seat on the board.  Domnguez and Rosado made commissions on this $3.5 million of investments.  PRIBANK began operations in January 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1994, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 1/4 point.  This increase was the first of several increases which were to occur in future weeks.  Brokerage houses soon began to make margin calls.  To meet the margin calls, PRIBANK was required to sell investments before their agreed-upon settlement dates, resulting in significant penalties.  As one margin call was being paid off, another loan would be called, and PRIBANK would scramble to sell another investment, incurring more penalties, and draining PRIBANK's original $5 million collateral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the midst of this collapse, on February 23, 1994, PRIBANK held a meeting of the board.  At the meeting, Domnguez presented a picture of a smoothly-running operation, pointing out promising investments that PRIBANK was looking into and failing to mention the fact that PRIBANK was already experiencing margin calls and sustaining losses.  Soon after this meeting, PRIBANK lost its remaining assets and its stock became worthless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present suit was brought before the District Court of Puerto Rico under the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77a (the \"1933 Act\" or \"Securities Act\"), and the Securities Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78a (the \"1934 Act\" or \"Exchange Act\").  Plaintiffs allege that fraudulent statements and omissions were made by Domnguez and Rosado, and further allege vicarious liability on the part of Dean Witter.  The district court dismissed all claims on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs make a number of claims.  First, they argue that, to the extent that the district court converted any of the Rule 12(b)(6) motions into motions for summary judgment under Rule 56(c), plaintiffs received inadequate notice and opportunity to submit evidence.  At issue is both whether such a conversion actually occurred and whether a conversion would have been appropriate at that stage of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next claim that the district court erred in finding that there is no implied private cause of action under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.  Plaintiffs urge this court to recognize such a cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs further contend that the district court erred in concluding that PRIBANK stock was privately offered.  The character of PRIBANK's offering became material to the case when, shortly after this complaint was filed, the Supreme Court decided Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117902\"><a href=\"/opinion/117902/gustafson-v-alloyd-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 577-78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117902\"><a href=\"/opinion/117902/gustafson-v-alloyd-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1995), holding that section 12(2) of the 1933 Act did not apply to private offerings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, plaintiffs argue that their claim under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act--and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder--was pled with sufficient particularity.  Specifically, they contest the district court's ruling that they had failed to plead specific facts which create a triable question on the issue of defendants' \"scienter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying their request for leave to file an amended complaint after the district court entered judgment.  The argument stems from the district court's issuance of a margin order which indicated that this seemingly tardy request for leave would be granted.  We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p>I. Conversion of 12(b)(6) Motions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that the district court improperly converted the series of 12(b)(6) motions at issue into motions for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Plaintiffs argue that such a conversion is necessarily improper where defendants have offered no materials outside the pleadings and where the court has not given express notice of its intent to convert the motions.  As a matter of law, plaintiffs are correct.  However, a close reading of the district court opinion reveals that the court dismissed these claims based solely on the insufficiency of the pleadings, and we affirm on those grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Moody v. Town of Weymouth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479206\"><a href=\"/opinion/479206/richard-m-moody-v-town-of-weymouth/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1986), we held that when a district court fails to give express notice to the parties of its intention to convert a 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment, there is no reversible error if the party opposing the motion (1) has received materials outside the pleadings, (2) has had an opportunity to respond to them, and (3) has not controverted their accuracy.  The Moody \"exception\" to the rule that the district court must notify the parties of an intent to convert motions is limited, and unless the three factors listed above are present the exception does not apply.  See Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito Aguada v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606661\"><a href=\"/opinion/606661/cooperativa-de-ahorro-y-credito-aguada-v-kidder-peabody-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 273 (1st Cir.1993) (in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion, a district court normally must either ignore extraneous materials or give the parties notice and an opportunity to respond to the conversion to a summary judgment motion).  In the present case, the plaintiffs filed a detailed pleading with several documentary exhibits.  Defendants argue that this fact alone put plaintiffs on notice that any 12(b)(6) motion could be converted into a 56(c) motion for summary judgment.  This argument fundamentally misinterprets Moody and therefore fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs were therefore surprised to find that the district court had converted the motions.  Throughout its opinion, the district court used language consistent with an award of summary judgment, ruling that \"Plaintiffs have failed to adduce sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact.\"   However, an opinion's plain language does not always mirror its plain logic, and while a quick perusal of the opinion might lead one to believe that the district court had applied the wrong standard of decision, looking past the terminology employed by the court reveals an opinion illustrating the legal insufficiency of the pleadings for each claim in this suit.  See Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, F.S.B., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578672\"><a href=\"/opinion/578672/garita-hotel-limited-partnership-etc-v-ponce-federal-bank-fsb/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1992) (the determination of whether a district court has converted a 12(b)(6) motion is \"functional rather than mechanical\").  On that basis, we affirm the standard of decision actually employed by the district court, and we now examine each of the district court's rulings regarding the insufficiency of the pleadings in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed one of the plaintiffs' claims after concluding that there was no implied private cause of action under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.

Courts and law enforcement agencies have the authority to enforce section 17(a) of the 1933 Act via injunction and criminal prosecution.  However, for years circuit courts have struggled with the question of whether an implied private right of action to enforce section 17(a) also exists.  The Supreme Court has never answered the question.  See Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v.

We now come to the same conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether an implied private right of action exists in a statute, we look to congressional intent, see Touche Ross, 442 U.S. at 574-76, 99 S.Ct. at 2488-89, keeping in mind that there is a strong presumption against such inferences.  See Sterling Suffolk Racecourse v. Burrillville Racing, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603770\"><a href=\"/opinion/603770/sterling-suffolk-racecourse-limited-partnership-v-burrillville-racing/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span>, 1268 (1st Cir.1993).  In this case, we do not find sufficient evidence of congressional intent to overcome the presumption.  As the district court observed, Congress explicitly provided for private causes of action in sections 11 and 12 of the 1933 Act.  While the fact that other provisions of a complex statutory scheme create express remedies does not in itself prove that Congress did not imply a private remedy in another section, see Cannon v. University of Chicago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110077\"><a href=\"/opinion/110077/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 690 n. 13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110077\"><a href=\"/opinion/110077/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span> (1979), where the explicit remedies in the same statute address much of the same conduct and benefit the same parties as a potential implied private cause of action, the circumstances militate against that inference.  Furthermore, the legislative history of section 17(a) does not, on the whole, favor an implied private right of action.  See Newcome, 862 F.2d at 1103-07 (conducting an in-depth examination of the legislative history of this provision).  Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing the plaintiffs' claim under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Plaintiffs appeal this ruling, arguing that their pleadings did not admit that PRIBANK stock was placed privately.  Since Gustafson was decided after their complaint was filed, the plaintiffs argue that they should have received permission to amend their complaint, which currently fails to explicitly address whether PRIBANK's stock was placed privately or publicly.  Therefore, the question for this court to decide is whether the pleadings, in their current form, establish that PRIBANK's stock was placed privately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A placement of stock is private if it is offered only to a few sophisticated purchasers who each have a relationship with the issuer, enabling them to command access to information that would otherwise be contained in a registration statement.

Domnguez had personally managed accounts in the past for each of them.  The plaintiffs were not merely asked passively to invest in an existing entity, but to partner in starting a new corporation.  Each shareholder of PRIBANK bought a 5.5% interest in the corporation and a seat on the board of directors.  The board was to meet each month, and according to PRIBANK's by-laws the board of directors had full control and direction of the corporation's affairs and business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act protects those investors who would otherwise be powerless against fraudulent offers of securities.  When a select group of investors are asked to become directors of a new corporation, and have access to all documents relevant to the corporation's formation and investments, they cannot bring suit under section 12(2) when the corporation fails for the reasons claimed in this suit.  Let us be clear.  We do not mean to suggest that a director has no remedy when defrauded by others within a new corporation, but only that, under Gustafson, section 12(2) of the 1933 Act is not available to this class of claimants.  Under these circumstances, there was no need to allow leave to amend the pleadings on this issue.

However, in examining a complaint for the requisite particularity in allegations of fraud, we are required to apply a delicate standard.

According to the complaint, although both Domnguez and Rosado were vice-presidents of large financial institutions, \"neither one of them had engaged in a REPO transaction on behalf of any bank with assets similar to those of PRIBANK, and had no manner to assure that what they represented to plaintiffs and the other investors was true.\"   Given 10(b)'s requirement of a pleading of scienter, characterizing the defendants as irresponsible or \"in over their heads\" does not further the plaintiffs' cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint is also replete with allegations based on \"information and belief\" that Domnguez and Rosado were aware of the risk of margin calls.

Shearson, Lehman, Hutton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558579\"><a href=\"/opinion/558579/richard-romani-v-shearson-lehman-hutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span>, 878 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we examine these pleadings carefully, we find that there are no specific allegations of fact which strongly imply a fraudulent intent.  At most, the complaint contains general inferences that Domnguez and Rosado \"must have known\" about the risks of margin calls and the devastating effect they could have on PRIBANK.  Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, these are precisely the types of inferences which this court, on numerous occasions, has determined to be inadequate to withstand Rule 9(b) scrutiny.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1223;  Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195389\"><a href=\"/opinion/195389/serabian-v-amoskeag-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 367 (1st Cir.1994);  Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26;  Romani, 929 F.2d at 878.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Leave to Amend the Complaint</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court's opinion issued in this case, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the pleadings.  The court denied this motion.  However, before ruling on defendants' motions to dismiss, the district court had issued a perplexing margin order amending this case's briefing schedule.  According to the margin order, any motion requesting leave to amend pleadings and amended pleadings could be filed ten days after the court resolved all \"pending pleadings.\"   While the meaning of the phrase \"pending pleadings\" is unclear, plaintiffs argue that the phrase referred to the pending motions to dismiss, and that the denial of their subsequent request for leave to amend was therefore an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking at the order itself does not resolve our uncertainty about its interpretation.  The motion that was granted via margin order was five pages long.  It was entitled \"Plaintiffs' Objections and Proposed Changes to Scheduling Order\" and generally consisted of very ordinary requests for extensions of time.  Buried on the third page, however, was a short paragraph containing the vague and confusing language sampled above, which could be interpreted as a request for a highly unconventional scheduling change.  When the district court judge granted the motion, he did so by writing \"granted\" in the left margin of the first page, as is customary in district courts.  It is entirely possible that the judge was unaware of the unusual and arguably improper request that he was supposedly granting along with the standard extensions contained in the motion.  However, while the motion filed by the plaintiffs was unclear, it could not be fairly characterized as deceptive.  Since no motion to reconsider this margin order was filed, and no clarification or amendment to the order issued from the court, we must give the order its reasonable construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court is asked to determine the meaning, propriety, and effect of the margin order.  Depending upon the interpretation of the motion, two bedrock principles of civil procedure may conflict in this case.  On the one hand, a district court cannot allow an amended pleading where a final judgment has been rendered unless that judgment is first set aside or vacated pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 or 60.  See Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195330\"><a href=\"/opinion/195330/acevedo-villalobos-v-hon-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 389 (1st Cir.1994).  On the other hand, the district court's scheduling order purportedly allowed plaintiffs just such a luxury, and, if it did, they were entitled to rely on that order.  See Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196881\"><a href=\"/opinion/196881/berkovitz-v-home-box-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29-30 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[W]hen a court charts a procedural route, lawyers and litigants are entitled to rely on it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we are keenly interested in the district court's interpretation of its own order.  On review, we cannot hope to understand the nuances of a district court's briefing schedule as completely as the judge who managed the case.  There may well have been comments made in scheduling conferences which clarified the order.  Unfortunately, the plaintiffs never raised this issue below.  Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend was part of its motion to reconsider the dismissal of its claims, and it contained no mention of the margin order or plaintiffs' understanding that they had been promised a leave to amend.  This failure to raise the issue before the district court is fatal to the claim on appeal.  See Villafane-Neriz v. F.D.I.C., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712177\"><a href=\"/opinion/712177/miguel-villafane-neriz-insurance-commissioner-of-puerto-rico-v-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 734 (1st Cir.1996).  We must be especially vigilant in applying this rule where the dispute involves an understanding reached by the parties and the district court during the pre-trial stages of a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, we need not remand this case to allow for a revision of the complaint because the amendments proposed by the plaintiffs would be futile.  See Foman v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In their request for leave to amend, and again before this court, plaintiffs allude to the factual allegations which they would incorporate into an amended complaint, producing detailed documentary evidence for support.  Nonetheless, a careful review of this material reveals that these amended claims would be destined for dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There exists no private right of action under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, and section 12(2) of the Act does not apply to the issuance of securities under the circumstances presented by this case.  See supra Sections II &amp; III.  No further factual allegations can save these claims.  Furthermore, while the 10(b) action could survive dismissal if plaintiffs could provide more specific allegations of fact which strongly imply a fraudulent intent on the part of Domnguez and Rosado, the proposed amendments to the complaint would not do so.  Plaintiffs provide an expert's affidavit concluding that defendants would have known of the likelihood that their securities would be subject to margin calls, and the devastating effect that this would have on PRIBANK.  Yet, as we have stated, the pleading of scienter \"may not rest on a bare inference that a defendant 'must have had' knowledge of the facts.\"  Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26 (quoting Barker, 797 F.2d at 497).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  We conclude that the amended 10(b) claim would not have passed 9(b) scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77l(a)(2):</p>\n        <p>Any person who ... offers or sells a security ... by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails, by means of a prospectus or oral communication, which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (the purchaser not knowing of such untruth or omission), and who shall not sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of such untruth or omission, shall be liable ... to the person purchasing such security from him, who may sue either at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the consideration paid for such security with interest thereon, upon the tender of such security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs maintain that Domnguez' statements could form the basis of section 12(2) claims in spite of the fact that they did not appear in the prospectus, because section 12(2) applies more broadly to initial public offerings which are exempted from SEC registration--in this case due to the \"intrastate\" character of PRIBANK's offering.

This Act implemented a \"heightened\" pleading standard under federal securities law which requires that factual allegations be of sufficient particularity to give rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1).  Although the Reform Act does not retroactively apply to this case, we do not interpret the new standard to differ from that which this court has historically applied.  See Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 22</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs urge this court to adopt a new means for testing whether scienter has been properly pled in 10(b) claims.  According to plaintiffs, the Second Circuit's \"motive and opportunity\" test properly screens out those claims which lack the requisite specificity to proceed with discovery.  See, e.g., Chill v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729940\"><a href=\"/opinion/729940/daniel-chill-paul-kay-giza-schectman-mayer-ballas-douglas-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 267 (2d Cir.1996) (determining whether defendants had the motive and opportunity to commit fraud);  Shields v.

Cir.1994) (same).  It is unclear whether this test is compatible with this circuit's \"especially rigorous\" application of Rule 9(b) in the securities fraud context.  In any case, this court has had the opportunity to develop a framework for analyzing the sufficiency of pleadings in cases similar to the present one, and we respectfully decline the invitation to review or adopt Second Circuit case law on this issue.  Cf. Bruce G. Vanyo, Lloyd Winawer &amp; David Priebe, The Pleading Standard of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PLI Corp. Law &amp; Practice Course Handbook Series, Sept. 1997, 71-81, available in Westlaw at 1015 PLI/Corp. 71 (chronicling how Congress expressly rejected the Second Circuit's \"motive and opportunity\" test for pleading scienter in the Reform Act because it was incompatible with the Act's heightened pleading requirements)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The complaint contains additional allegations that Domnguez and Rosado knew that PRIBANK was disintegrating at the same time that they presented a rosy picture to investors at the February board meeting.  However, these allegations involve activity occurring well after the original sale of PRIBANK stock, and are therefore immaterial for the purposes of this 10(b) cause of action.  See Gross, 93 F.3d at 993 (citing Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1222, for the proposition that allegations of conduct occurring after sale or exchange at issue in 10(b) claim are irrelevant).  Even if the allegations are true, the fact that Domnguez and Rosado had discovered PRIBANK's fatal flaw before the February board meeting is not probative of any attempt to defraud the plaintiffs months earlier</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We note that a motion to dismiss is not a \"pleading\" as the term is defined in Fed.R.Civ.P. 7.  Furthermore, the order does not promise to grant any motions filed after the resolution of \"pending pleadings,\" but instead states that such requests and pleadings may be filed.   Nonetheless, we believe that plaintiffs' interpretation of the order as a blank check to rewrite the complaint after the case has been dismissed is not entirely implausible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, this affidavit, along with plaintiffs' other documentary evidence in support of their request for leave to amend, indicates that Domnguez and Rosado invested and lost one and a half million dollars of their own money in PRIBANK, which undermines any inference of scienter</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also argue that they filed requests for leave to amend their complaint prior to the resolution of the motions to dismiss.  We find that these \"motions\" were never actually filed.  Instead, the plaintiffs, in other filings, merely mentioned that, at some point, they would seek leave to amend.  That leave was not sought until after the case was dismissed.  In any case, the issue is mooted by our finding that amending the complaint would be futile</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
