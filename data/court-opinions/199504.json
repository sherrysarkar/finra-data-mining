Following his resignation as an employee of\n\nState Street Bank & Trust Company (\"SSB\"), plaintiff-appellant\n\nKeith D. Washington filed three consecutive                   pro se lawsuits\n\nagainst SSB and other defendants attempting to right various\n\nwrongs he believes he suffered both during his employment at SSB\n\nand in connection with his termination and subsequent attempt to\n\nget benefits.        Taken together, Washington's complaints allege\n\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nand the Americans With Disabilities Act, breach of fiduciary\n\nduty and wrongful denial of benefits, defamation, conspiracy to\n\ndeprive     him     of     his   civil    rights,     wrongful      termination,\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, interference with\n\ncontractual        relations,     obstruction        of   justice,    vicarious\n\nliability,        gross     negligence,        retaliation,   and    breach    of\n\ncontract.     The instant pro se appeals stem from the first and\n\nthird lawsuits.          For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n    Appeal No. 00-2201 arises from the first lawsuit and is from\n\nthe denial of a second motion for relief pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b).            The underlying lawsuit alleged,           inter alia,\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race and mental disability.                    The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of SSB on the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fground that these claims are time-barred.             In his post-judgment\n\nmotion, Washington came forward with new factual information\n\nabout the chain of events leading to his resignation which, he\n\nsuggests, alters the analysis as to the triggering event for the\n\nrunning of the statute of limitations.            The motion is premised\n\non   Rule   60(b)(1)    (excusable    neglect),      Rule   60(b)(2)   (newly\n\ndiscovered evidence), and Rule 60(b)(3) (fraud).\n\n      Our review is limited to the denial of the Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion, not the underlying judgment, and is solely for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     See Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nThe district court properly concluded that Washington failed to\n\npresent     grounds    for   relief   under   Rule    60(b)(1)   (excusable\n\nneglect).     Putting aside any question as to whether the new\n\ninformation would have made a difference if timely presented,\n\nWashington failed to provide sufficient excuse for the delay.\n\nThere is no suggestion that the information was unknown to him.\n\nRather, Washington makes reference to his lack of litigating\n\nexperience, the fact that certain documents were not readily\n\navailable due to his move from the Northeast to Atlanta, and his\n\nmental difficulties.         However, the move to Atlanta occurred long\n\nbefore the initiation of the lawsuit, and the limitations issue\n\nhad already been litigated, once before, in proceedings before\n\nthe Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fEqual Employment Opportunity Commission.           Washington's alleged\n\nmental difficulties did not otherwise interfere with his ability\n\nto provide factual detail.\n\n    It is even plainer that Washington failed to present grounds\n\nfor relief under Rule 60(b)(2) (newly discovered evidence) or\n\nRule 60(b)(3) (fraud).       A motion for relief from judgment based\n\non newly discovered evidence requires proof, inter alia, that\n\nthe evidence could not by due diligence have been discovered\n\nearlier.    Mitchell v. United States, 141 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).     To prevail on a Rule 60(b)(3) motion a movant must\n\ndemonstrate that alleged misrepresentations prevented him from\n\nfully and fairly presenting his case.            Perez-Perez v. Popular\n\nLeasing    Rental,   Inc.,   993   F.2d   281,    286   (1st    Cir.   1993).\n\nMisrepresentations can have this effect only when a party did\n\nnot have knowledge of the alleged inaccuracies.                Ojeda-Toro v.\n\nRivera-Mendez, 853 F.2d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 1988).            In the instant\n\ncase, Washington's prior knowledge           defeats his attempt to\n\ninvoke either (b)(2) or (b)(3).\n\n    Appeal No. 00-2202 is from the dismissal of Washington's\n\nclaims in the third lawsuit on the grounds of res judicata or\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\nWith the exception of Washington's breach of contract claim, we\n\naffirm essentially for the reasons stated by the district court\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fin its memorandum and order dated August 8, 2000.                        Contrary to\n\nWashington's         suggestion,   a    federal      court      judgment     has   res\n\njudicata effect as soon as it is issued notwithstanding the\n\npossibility or even pendency of an appeal.                      See 18 James Wm.\n\nMoore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 131.30[2][c][ii], at\n\n131-97 to -98 (3d ed. 1999).              In any event, our resolution of\n\nAppeal No. 00-2201 forecloses any further argument that the\n\njudgment   in    the     first   suit     should     not   be    given     preclusive\n\neffect.\n\n    As for Washington's breach of contract claim in his third\n\ncomplaint, it is, perhaps, a close question as to whether the\n\ndistrict court properly dismissed this claim in its entirety\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).                    We agree that Washington's\n\nallegations      that     SSB    failed      to    provide      him   an   executive\n\nseverance package \"consistent with what other senior executive\n\nwere afforded\" is inadequate pleading of a contract claim.                         The\n\nclaim is not bolstered by references to an executive agreement\n\napplying in the event of a change in control of the corporation.\n\nThere   was     no    such   change     in    control.          However,    arguably\n\nWashington's         allegations    that      he    was    denied     compensation\n\n\"required\" by SSB's guidelines, coupled with latter allegations\n\nthat an employee handbook establishes contractual rights to a\n\ncertain minimum salary, are sufficient to survive the Rule\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f12(b)(6) hurdle.1\n\n     We need not decide the issue since we think that the claim\n\nis precluded.       This court has adopted a transactional approach\n\nto determining whether causes of action are sufficiently related\n\nto support a res judicata defense.             See Massachusetts Sch. of\n\nLaw at Andover, Inc. v. American Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).     We consider such factors as whether the facts are\n\nrelated in time, space, origin, or motivation; whether they form\n\na convenient trial unit; and whether their treatment as a unit\n\nconforms to the parties' expectations.                Id.      In the first\n\nlawsuit, Washington alleged that SSB discriminated against him\n\non   the    basis   of   race   by   failing    to   provide    appropriate\n\ncompensation.       The breach of contract claim seeks recovery for\n\nthe same failure, and the difference is a mere difference in\n\ntheory of liability.       Accordingly, the doctrine of res judicata\n\napplies.2     Cf. Brzostowski v. Laidlaw Waste Systems, Inc., 49\n\nF.3d 337 (7th Cir. 1995) (concluding that res judicata barred\n\nemployee's discrimination suit arising from the same events as\n\nprior breach of contract suit).\n\n\n     1\n     We express no opinion as to whether the employee handbook\ndoes, indeed, create any contractual rights.\n     2We note that the judgment in the second suit arguably\nreserved the breach of contract of claim for later litigation.\nHowever, the same cannot be said of the judgment in the first\nsuit, a judgment which was handed down later in time.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -8-\n\f",

In any event, our resolution of\n\nAppeal No. 00-2201 forecloses any further argument that the\n\njudgment   in    the     first   suit     should     not   be    given     preclusive\n\neffect.\n\n    As for Washington's breach of contract claim in his third\n\ncomplaint, it is, perhaps, a close question as to whether the\n\ndistrict court properly dismissed this claim in its entirety\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).                    We agree that Washington's\n\nallegations      that     SSB    failed      to    provide      him   an   executive\n\nseverance package \"consistent with what other senior executive\n\nwere afforded\" is inadequate pleading of a contract claim.                         The\n\nclaim is not bolstered by references to an executive agreement\n\napplying in the event of a change in control of the corporation.\n\nThere   was     no    such   change     in    control.          However,    arguably\n\nWashington's         allegations    that      he    was    denied     compensation\n\n\"required\" by SSB's guidelines, coupled with latter allegations\n\nthat an employee handbook establishes contractual rights to a\n\ncertain minimum salary, are sufficient to survive the Rule\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f12(b)(6) hurdle.1\n\n     We need not decide the issue since we think that the claim\n\nis precluded.       This court has adopted a transactional approach\n\nto determining whether causes of action are sufficiently related\n\nto support a res judicata defense.             See Massachusetts Sch. of\n\nLaw at Andover, Inc. v. American Bar Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).     We consider such factors as whether the facts are\n\nrelated in time, space, origin, or motivation; whether they form\n\na convenient trial unit; and whether their treatment as a unit\n\nconforms to the parties' expectations.                Id.      In the first\n\nlawsuit, Washington alleged that SSB discriminated against him\n\non   the    basis   of   race   by   failing    to   provide    appropriate\n\ncompensation.       The breach of contract claim seeks recovery for\n\nthe same failure, and the difference is a mere difference in\n\ntheory of liability.       Accordingly, the doctrine of res judicata\n\napplies.2     Cf. Brzostowski v.
