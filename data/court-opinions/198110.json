Addamax Corporation brought a\r\nfederal antitrust suit against Open Software Foundation (\"OSF\"),\r\nHewlett-Packard Company and Digital Equipment Corporation.  After\r\na bench trial limited to the issues of causation and damages, the\r\ndistrict court found that antitrust violations, even if they were\r\nassumed to have occurred, were not a material cause of Addamax's\r\nfailure in the line of business at issue.  Addamax now appeals and\r\nwe affirm.\r\nWe begin with a statement of those background facts that\r\nare more or less undisputed.  Addamax was created by Dr. Peter A.\r\nAlsberg in 1986 and, in 1987, began to focus on developing security\r\nsoftware for Unix operating systems.  Unix is a very popular\r\noperating system for larger computers, and security software is a\r\ncomponent that can be used with the operating system to restrict\r\noutside access to sensitive information and to restrict a\r\nparticular user to information consistent with that user's security\r\nclassification.\r\nDuring this period, the National Computer Security\r\nCenter, a division of the federal government's National Security\r\nAgency, rated security software, giving ratings (ranging from the\r\nmost to the least secure) of A, B-3, B-2, B-1, C-2, C-1 and D. \r\nAddamax decided to produce B-1 software for Unix operating systems,\r\na level of security demanded primarily by government users.  During\r\nthe years 1988-89, Addamax did develop B-1 security software for at\r\nleast two different versions of Unix.\r\nWhile Addamax was trying to produce its security\r\nsoftware, a different struggle was developing between AT&amp;T--the\r\ninventor of Unix--and a number of major computer manufacturers. \r\nAlthough originally Unix had been freely licensed by AT&amp;T, it\r\nappears that in the late 1980s AT&amp;T began restricting its licenses\r\nin the face of various software modifications being introduced by\r\nindividual licensees; and at the same time, AT&amp;T began to develop\r\na close working relationship with Sun Microsystems, a major\r\nmicroprocessor manufacturer.  Other hardware manufacturers\r\nprofessed to fear that AT&amp;T was trying to establish a single\r\ndominant version of Unix, intending to exclude the proprietary Unix\r\nvariations from the market.\r\nAccordingly, in May 1988, a number of important computer\r\nmanufacturers--including defendants Hewlett-Packard and Digital\r\nEquipment Corp.--formed the Open Software Foundation as a non-\r\nprofit joint research and development venture.  OSF registered\r\nunder the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, 15 U.S.C. \r\n4301, although that status has no direct importance for the issues\r\nbefore us.  At least one of OSF's  professed objectives was to\r\ndevelop an alternative Unix operating system, denominated OSF-1, as\r\na competitor to the Unix system being developed jointly by AT&amp;T and\r\nSun Microsystems.\r\nIn 1989, while OSF-1 was still being developed, OSF\r\ndecided that it should include security software at the B-1 level. \r\nAt that time, only three companies--AT&amp;T, Addamax and SecureWare,\r\nInc.--were producing security software for the Unix system.  On\r\nNovember 1, 1989, OSF sent a \"request for technology\" to Addamax\r\nand SecureWare, soliciting bids for a B-1 security component for\r\nthe new OSF-1 system.  Bids were submitted on November 27, 1989,\r\nand OSF selected SecureWare on December 22, 1989.  There is some\r\nindication that the Addamax security software was more\r\nsophisticated--one witness agreed that the contrast was between a\r\nCadillac and a Chevette--but the Addamax price may also have\r\nappeared more substantial. In any event, OSF-1 itself was never a\r\nvery successful product.\r\nAddamax continued to sell its own B-1 software for some\r\nperiod after losing the bid.  Nothing prevented OSF \"sponsors\" (the \r\nfounding members of OSF) or \"members\" (a great many other\r\ncompanies) from  using Addamax security software for their own\r\nprograms; and OSF sponsors and members were not the only potential\r\nbuyers of Addamax's program.  However, by 1991, Addamax began to\r\nphase out its B-1 security software, turning away new buyers so\r\nthat it could devote its resources to the development of a new\r\nsecurity software product, in which it appears that the company was\r\nsuccessful.\r\nIn April 1991, Addamax filed a complaint in the district\r\ncourt against OSF, Hewlett-Packard and Digital, alleging various\r\nviolations of federal  and state antitrust law.  As later amended,\r\nthe complaint charged the defendants, together with other companies\r\nassociated with OSF, with horizontal price fixing, boycott, and\r\notherwise unlawful joint venture behavior in violation of the\r\nSherman and the Clayton Acts, 15 U.S.C.  1-2, 18.  A central\r\ntheme, although not the only one, was that  the defendants had\r\nconspired to force down the price for security software below the\r\nfree-market level and otherwise to limit or impair the ability of\r\nAddamax to compete as a supplier of security software.\r\nConsiderable discovery was conducted, and in due course\r\nthe defendants moved for summary judgment.  In a thoughtful\r\ndecision in May 1995, the district judge dismissed Addamax's per se\r\nclaims on the ground that the alleged conduct of the defendants did\r\nnot fit within the narrow categories for which per se treatment was\r\nappropriate; but the court declined to dismiss Addamax's rule of\r\nreason claims, saying that the factual issues involving market\r\npower and anticompetitive effect were unsuitable for disposition on\r\nsummary judgment.  Addamax Corporation v. Open Software Foundation,\r\nInc., 888 F. Supp. 274 (D. Mass. 1995).\r\nThereafter, the parties entered into a stipulation that\r\nthe damage phase of the case would be tried first, on a jury waived\r\nbasis, to determine \"whether the defendants' conduct was a material\r\ncause of injury in fact to the plaintiff and, if so, the amount of\r\ndamages.\"  The stipulation further provided:\r\nSolely for purposes of this stipulation, the\r\nCourt will assume that the defendants' conduct\r\nas alleged in the Amended Complaint and\r\ndescribed in the non-damages portions of the\r\nexpert reports of Drs. Comanor and Howe\r\noccurred and violates the federal and state\r\nlaw accounts.  However, the Court will not\r\nassume, but will hear and take evidence on,\r\nwhether there was injury in fact to the\r\nplaintiff as a result of that conduct and, if\r\nso, the amount of damages, which is the\r\nsubject of this phase of the trial.\r\n\nTrial was conducted over 12 days between November 18 and\r\nDecember 16, 1996.  Addamax presented as live witnesses Dr.\r\nAlsberg, three experts, and a single Addamax customer.  The\r\ndefendants did not present live witnesses but did cross-examine\r\nextensively and relied on documentary submissions and deposition\r\ntestimony.\r\nIn May 1997, the district court issued a decision\r\nconcluding that the defendants' conduct was \"not a material cause\"\r\nof Addamax's losses.  Addamax Corporation v. Open Software\r\nFoundation, Inc., 964 F. Supp. 549, 555 (D. Mass 1997).  The court\r\nfound that the B-1 software market was a highly risky business,\r\nthat Addamax's belatedly-offered product was \"too expensive and too\r\ncomplex, and . . . actually exceeded B-1 requirements.\"  Id. at\r\n553.  The court said that Addamax faced severe competition from\r\nAT&amp;T in the B-1 market and that SecureWare's product was \"a cheaper\r\nand simpler\" one.  Id.  Accordingly, the court held on the merits\r\nthat Addamax was not entitled to any damages.\r\nAddamax has now appealed and argues what in substance are\r\nthree different points:  that the district court erred in its\r\nfactual determination that defendants' conduct was not a material\r\ncause of Addamax's losses in the B-1 security software market; that \r\nthe stipulation, pertinent case law or both required the district\r\ncourt to find that the defendants' conduct had caused damage to\r\nAddamax; and that the court erred in dismissing the per se claims\r\nagainst the defendants.  Because the legal issues set the frame for\r\nthe factual ones, it is more convenient to take these claims in\r\nreverse order.\r\n1.  As we explained in an earlier case, per se rules\r\nunder section 1 of the Sherman Act have left only a couple of\r\n\"serious candidates\" for per se treatment: these include price or\r\noutput fixing agreements (horizontal market division agreements are\r\nof essentially the same character) and \"certain group boycotts or \r\nconcerted refusals to deal.\"  U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v.\r\nHealthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 593 (1st Cir. 1993).  Since those\r\nwords were written, the categories have been narrowed even further\r\nby the Supreme Court's decision to overrule Albrecht v. The Herald\r\nCo., 390 U.S. 145 (1968) and thereby to exclude from per se\r\ntreatment vertical maximum resale price fixing agreements.  State\r\nOil Co. v. Khan, 118 S. Ct. 275 (1997).\r\nWhere a plaintiff proves conduct that falls within a per\r\nse category, nothing more is needed for liability; the defendants'\r\npower, illicit purpose and anticompetitive effect are all said to\r\nbe irrelevant.  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S.\r\n150 (1940).  But courts have been very careful to confine per se\r\ntreatment to conduct of the type that is almost always actually or\r\npotentially anticompetitive and has no redeeming benefits (e.g.,\r\nreduced costs, increased competition) worthy of being weighed\r\nagainst the negative effects.  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia\r\nBroadcasting System, 441 U.S. 1 (1979).  Per se offenses remain\r\nvery important--they include horizontal price fixing--but only for\r\nconduct that fits squarely within the \"ever narrowing per se\r\nniche.\"  U.S. Healthcare, 986 F.2d at 593.\r\nJoint venture enterprises like OFC, unless they amount to\r\ncomplete shams, cf. Palmer v. BRG  of Georgia, 498 U.S. 46 (1990),\r\nare rarely susceptible to per se treatment.  Where the venture is\r\nproducing a new product--here, the OFC-1 software package--there is\r\npatently a potential for a productive contribution to the economy,\r\nand conduct that is strictly ancillary to this productive effort\r\n(e.g., the joint venture's decision as to the price at which it\r\nwill purchase inputs) is evaluated under the rule of reason.  This\r\nis so even if we accept, pursuant to the stipulation, the arguendopremise that OSF and those connected with it represented a large\r\nportion of the market for purchasing B-1 security software and\r\nrepresented a large portion of some kind of output market for\r\nintegrated Unix software programs.\r\nAddamax points to fragments of evidence that, assuming a\r\nfull context were established, might or might not suggest that OSF\r\nwas an aggressive response to the AT&amp;T Sun venture and that\r\nHewlett-Packard had a secret agenda to favor SecureWare over\r\nAddamax (for reasons that are never made quite clear), regardless\r\nof whether Addamax offered a superior product.  None of the\r\nevidence pointed to by Addamax suggests that OSF-1 was other than\r\na legitimate, if ultimately unsuccessful, product; and there is\r\nnothing to suggest that the ancillary decisions--what inputs to\r\npurchase, at what price, and from whom--were not legitimately\r\nrelated to this effort.  In this context, flinging around terms\r\nlike \"cartel\" and \"boycott\" do not convert a rule of reason claim\r\ninto a per se one.\r\n2.  On the other hand, neither is a joint venture \"per\r\nse\" legal.  Any joint venture, especially one that involves\r\ncompetitors, tends to be susceptible to attack under section 1's\r\nrule of reason--on the theory that the operations of the joint\r\nventure represent collaboration of the separate entities that own\r\nor control it.  How far this theory can be pressed in the case of\r\na truly integrated enterprise, whose \"owners\" were no more than\r\nstockholders, is a matter we need not pursue; we will assume here\r\nthat the OSF joint venture, or some aspect of it, could be\r\ncondemned under section 1 if the balance of harms and benefits\r\ntipped in favor of harms; questions of power and motive are\r\nprimarily clues to such effects.\r\nAt this point, Addamax's most straightforward claim would\r\nbe that OSF's concentration of purchasing power in the supposed\r\n\"market\" for acquiring B-1 security software was so great that it\r\nimposed a significant risk of forcing prices below competitive\r\nlevels, and that those risks outweighed any benefit from the\r\nventure or, more plausibly, that the venture could achieve those\r\nbenefits in a less restrictive fashion, i.e., without creating a\r\nsubstantial threat of monopsony pricing.  Whether or not this\r\ntheory could be proved, we are here assuming liability arguendo. \r\nThe question remains whether Addamax established--either as a\r\nmatter of law or based on the evidence--some causal connection\r\nbetween this assumed violation by defendants and Addamax's failure\r\nin the B-1 security software business.\r\nAddamax first argues that the stipulation required the\r\ndistrict court to find that the assumed violation was a material\r\ncause of injury to Addamax.  Addamax's reading is contrary both to\r\nthe explicit language of the stipulation and to its evident\r\npurpose.  The stipulation said that the first phase of the bench\r\ntrial was to determine \"whether\" defendants' conduct was \"a\r\nmaterial cause of injury in fact\" to Addamax (and, if so, the\r\namount of damages), assuming arguendo that a violation of law had\r\noccurred.  Pointedly, the stipulation went on to emphasize that\r\nalthough the existence of a violation was to be assumed, the court\r\n\"will not assume, but will hear and take evidence on,\" the question\r\nwhether there was \"injury in fact to the plaintiff as a result of\"\r\nthe attributed conduct. \r\nCertainly both Addamax's complaint and its experts\r\nasserted that the alleged conduct has caused injury, but this was\r\nnot part of the facts to be assumed arguendo.  The stipulation did\r\nnot assume the truth of the complaint, but only that defendants had\r\nengaged in the \"conduct\" alleged in the complaint.  Under the\r\nstipulation, the reports of Addamax's experts were assumed to be\r\ntrue only in describing the conduct and not its consequences; that\r\nis made clear by the reference in the stipulation to assuming the\r\ntruth of the \"non damages portions of the expert reports.\"\r\nAddamax's more interesting argument is its claim that the\r\ncase law, and the economic theory that underlies it, require a\r\nconclusion that the conduct assumed arguendo to comprise a\r\nviolation must have caused injury to Addamax.  The broadest version\r\nof this proposition is Addamax's claim that under the rule of\r\nreason, conduct is condemned only because it has an anticompetitive\r\neffect.  Therefore, Addamax argues, there must have been some\r\ninjury to it, and the only question that remains is to calculate\r\nthe amount of damages.\r\nA more specific version of the argument, also advanced,\r\nis that in this very case the complaint's straightforward charge is\r\nthat the defendants engaged in an agreement that had the effect of\r\nreducing price for B-1 security systems and since Addamax was a\r\nprovider of B-1 security programs, it necessarily was injured by a\r\nreduction in price.  An alternative version is Addamax's claim that\r\nthe joint venturers were engaged in suppressing demand for their\r\nown output--Unix programs like OSF-1 embodying B-1 software--and\r\nthis in turn reduced the demand, and presumably therefore price,\r\nvolume or both, for suppliers of the input.\r\nIt is technically an overstatement to say that actual\r\nanticompetitive impact is a requirement of liability in a rule-of-\r\nreason case.  True, as a practical matter, most courts would be\r\nunlikely to condemn an otherwise legitimate joint venture absent\r\nsome showing of anticompetitive effect.  But in principle, a\r\nsufficiently high risk of an anticompetitive effect, coupled with\r\nmarginal benefits (or none at all that could not be achieved\r\nthrough an easily available less restrictive alternative) might\r\njustify condemnation under the rule of reason.\r\nBut all this is beside the point.  Even if we assume that\r\nthe OSF purchasing consortium was capable of exercising monopsony\r\npower directly or through coordination of its sponsor\\members'\r\nactions, it does not follow that Addamax was a victim or that the\r\nalleged below-market price offered by the consortium materially\r\naffected Addamax.  The only formal purchase by OSF involving\r\nAddamax was based on the November 1989 request for technology, in\r\nwhich SecureWare was the successful supplier.  If below market\r\nprice was paid, SecureWare, and not Addamax, was directly injured.\r\nTo be sure, Addamax claims that its sales opportunities\r\nwere indirectly curtailed.  While the OSF sponsors and members were\r\nfree to purchase B-1 security programs from anyone they wanted on\r\nan individual basis, Addamax claims that winning the OSF-1 sale\r\nwould have amounted to a valuable OSF endorsement, spurring other\r\nsales.  But it is hard to see this loss as a consequence of\r\nmonopsony pricing.  In all events, Addamax's claim of secondary\r\ninjury reduces itself to an issue of fact--not an issue that can be\r\ntaken as resolved by stipulation or case law.\r\n3.  As a preface to its factual claims, Addamax asserts\r\nthat the district court's decision recognizes a \"defense\" of\r\nmismanagement.  A plaintiff's mismanagement is not a bar to\r\nrecovery where an antitrust violation is a material cause of\r\ninjury.  Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d at\r\n14 n.21.  But mismanagement is certainly relevant to the factual\r\nquestion whether the antitrust violation had such an effect or\r\nwhether the plaintiff is entirely the cause of its own failure. \r\nArgus Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 801 F.2d 38, 42-45 (2d Cir. 1986).\r\nWe turn then to the question whether the district court\r\nerred in its factual determination that Addamax's inability to \r\nsucceed in its efforts to sell its B-1 security program for Unix\r\nmore widely was materially caused by the defendants' conduct.  On\r\nthis issue, Addamax bore the burden of proof at trial.  Irvin\r\nIndustries, Inc. v. Goodyear Aerospace Corp., 974 F.2d 241, 244 (2d\r\nCir. 1992).  On appeal, the district court's findings and ultimate\r\nconclusion of fact are entitled to stand unless found to be clearly\r\nerroneous.  La Esperanza De P.R., Inc. v. Perez Y Cia. De Puerto\r\nRico, Inc., 124 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nAddamax is mistaken in its suggestion that the district\r\ncourt misunderstood the legal standard for causation: quite unlike\r\nHaverhill Gazette Co. v. Union Leader Corp., 333 F.2d 798 (1st Cir.\r\n1964), the district judge properly asked whether the defendants'\r\nassumed conduct had been a substantial or material cause of the\r\nlosses claimed by Addamax.  Although we there cautioned against an\r\nunduly rigid view of causation in computing damages once injury had\r\nbeen established, id. at 808 n.16, nothing in the opinion relieved\r\nthe plaintiff from making the statutory showing (fully satisfied in\r\nHaverhill) that the violation had caused at least some injury to\r\nthe plaintiff's business or property. 15 U.S.C.  15.\r\nHere, the district court was presented with two competing\r\nversions of reality.  Addamax's witnesses took the view that\r\nAddamax developed a superior B-1 product and its failure to succeed\r\nresulted from defendants' mechanizations which forced down the\r\nprice of the product to sub-competitive levels and suppressed\r\noutput for Unix software incorporating B-1 security programs.  In\r\nsome places, Addamax describes itself as the target, and elsewhere\r\nas the accidental victim, of a larger conspiracy directed against\r\nAT&amp;T.\r\nThe defense version, which the district court adopted,\r\nwas derived from defense depositions, cross-examination of the\r\nplaintiffs' experts and numerous documents.  In this view, Addamax\r\nengaged in risky entry into a market dominated by AT&amp;T, an\r\nestablished supplier of B-1 security software for Unix; the Addamax\r\nsystem was oversophisticated, expensive, arrived late, and never\r\nreceived the  important certification from NSA's National Computer\r\nSecurity Center.  And, in a market characterized by ever-changing\r\ndemands, AT&amp;T's promised development of a follow-on B-2 system \r\nmade the market for B-1 security software for Unix inherently risky\r\nand in some measure transitional.  There is nothing inherently\r\nimplausible about either version; everything depends on the\r\nevidence.\r\nIn fairness to Addamax, the factual analysis in its brief\r\nrepresents exactly the kind of detailed critique of the evidence\r\nthat fairly presents the question whether the district judge's\r\nfindings are adequately supported by the record.  Addamax\r\nidentifies specific findings with which it disagrees, cites to\r\nrecord evidence it thinks was misconstrued, furnishes citations to\r\nthe record for propositions it advances, points to counterveiling\r\nevidence that says the district judge ignored and misinterpreted. \r\nIn this respect, the brief deserves to be taken seriously, and we\r\nhave done so.\r\nBut while in a few instances the district court may have\r\nmisinterpreted an exhibit or ignored some fact that softens or\r\nqualifies the inference it draws, Addamax's own critique is filled\r\nwith one-sided versions of events and refusals to confront evidence\r\nin support of the district court's findings.  What emerges from our\r\nown review of the record is that the district court had evidence to\r\nsupport each of its key findings: that the business was a risky\r\none; that Addamax entered late, with a high-priced, overbuilt and\r\nuncertified product; that AT&amp;T and SecureWare, in different ways,\r\nposed major problems for Addamax; that many of Addamax's problems,\r\nincluding losses of customers, had begun before the OSF selection\r\nof SecureWare; and that changes in market conditions proved to be\r\nadverse to Addamax.\r\nFurther, the evidence is largely derived from Addamax\r\nitself, including the deposition and trial testimony of Dr. \r\nAlsberg.  The risky nature of Addamax's venture was stressed in its\r\ndisclosures to investors, and the delays and cost overruns\r\nconcerning its B-1 product emerge from its own records; it was\r\nAddamax that expressed concern with competition from AT&amp;T and\r\nespecially its ability to offer a smooth transition to its own\r\npromised B-2 offering; and the defection of existing and\r\nprospective customers to AT&amp;T, apparently before OSF-1, can be\r\ntraced through Addamax records.  The district court did not commit\r\n\"clear error\" in finding the facts in favor of defendants.\r\nAddamax attacks the district court's findings as\r\ninadequate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).  By this, it means not that\r\nthe explicit findings were wrong (it argues this elsewhere) but\r\nthat the findings are either not sufficiently detailed or did not\r\naffirmatively find specific facts helpful to Addamax or did not\r\naddress evidence that favored Addamax where there was evidence both\r\nways.  But the district court was not required to make findings on\r\nevery detail, was not required to discuss all of the evidence that\r\nsupports each of the findings made, and was not required to respond\r\nindividually to  each evidentiary or factual contention made by the\r\nlosing side.  Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Mills Co., 15 F.3d\r\n1222, 1228 (1st Cir. 1994); Applewood Landscape &amp; Nursery Co. v.\r\nHollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1503-04 (1st Cir. 1989).  \r\nThere is no mechanical rule for determining the exact\r\nlevel of findings required by Rule 52(a).  In this instance, the\r\ndistrict court made explicit intermediate findings (e.g.,\r\ncompetition from AT&amp;T, the strengths and weaknesses of Addamax's\r\nproduct) making clear the bases for its ultimate finding on\r\ncausation; and, with the help of counsel, it has been relatively\r\neasy to discern the evidence underlying these key findings.  The\r\ndistrict court could have written a 200-page decision on this case,\r\nbut the far more compact assessment it made was entirely adequate\r\nunder Rule 52(a).\r\nAffirmed.\n",

After a bench trial limited to the issues of causation and damages, the district court found that antitrust violations, even if they were assumed to have occurred, were not a material cause of Addamax's failure in the line of business at issue.  Addamax now appeals and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a statement of those background facts that are more or less undisputed.  Addamax was created by Dr. Peter A. Alsberg in 1986 and, in 1987, began to focus on developing security software for Unix operating systems.  Unix is a very popular operating system for larger computers, and security software is a component that can be used with the operating system to restrict outside access to sensitive information and to restrict a particular user to information consistent with that user's security classification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, the National Computer Security Center, a division of the federal government's National Security Agency, rated security software, giving ratings (ranging from the most to the least secure) of A, B-3, B-2, B-1, C-2, C-1 and D. Addamax decided to produce B-1 software for Unix operating systems, a level of security demanded primarily by government users.  During the years 1988-89, Addamax did develop B-1 security software for at least two different versions of Unix.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Addamax was trying to produce its security software, a different struggle was developing between AT &amp; T--the inventor of Unix--and a number of major computer manufacturers.  Although originally Unix had been freely licensed by AT &amp; T, it appears that in the late 1980s AT &amp; T began restricting its licenses in the face of various software modifications being introduced by individual licensees;  and at the same time, AT &amp; T began to develop a close working relationship with Sun Microsystems, a major microprocessor manufacturer.  Other hardware manufacturers professed to fear that AT &amp; T was trying to establish a single dominant version of Unix, intending to exclude the proprietary Unix variations from the market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, in May 1988, a number of important computer manufacturers--including defendants Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment Corp.--formed the Open Software Foundation as a non-profit joint research and development venture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  OSF registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 4301, although that status has no direct importance for the issues before us.  At least one of OSF's professed objectives was to develop an alternative Unix operating system, denominated OSF-1, as a competitor to the Unix system being developed jointly by AT &amp; T and Sun Microsystems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, while OSF-1 was still being developed, OSF decided that it should include security software at the B-1 level.  At that time, only three companies--AT &amp; T, Addamax and SecureWare, Inc.--were producing security software for the Unix system.  On November 1, 1989, OSF sent a \"request for technology\" to Addamax and SecureWare, soliciting bids for a B-1 security component for the new OSF-1 system.  Bids were submitted on November 27, 1989, and OSF selected SecureWare on December 22, 1989.  There is some indication that the Addamax security software was more sophisticated--one witness agreed that the contrast was between a Cadillac and a Chevette--but the Addamax price may also have appeared more substantial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In any event, OSF-1 itself was never a very successful product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax continued to sell its own B-1 software for some period after losing the bid.  Nothing prevented OSF \"sponsors\" (the founding members of OSF) or \"members\" (a great many other companies) from using Addamax security software for their own programs;  and OSF sponsors and members were not the only potential buyers of Addamax's program.  However, by 1991, Addamax began to phase out its B-1 security software, turning away new buyers so that it could devote its resources to the development of a new security software product, in which it appears that the company was successful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1991, Addamax filed a complaint in the district court against OSF, Hewlett-Packard and Digital, alleging various violations of federal and state antitrust law.  As later amended, the complaint charged the defendants, together with other companies associated with OSF, with horizontal price fixing, boycott, and otherwise unlawful joint venture behavior in violation of the Sherman and the Clayton Acts, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1-2, 18.  A central theme, although not the only one, was that the defendants had conspired to force down the price for security software below the free-market level and otherwise to limit or impair the ability of Addamax to compete as a supplier of security software.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considerable discovery was conducted, and in due course the defendants moved for summary judgment.  In a thoughtful decision in May 1995, the district judge dismissed Addamax's per se claims on the ground that the alleged conduct of the defendants did not fit within the narrow categories for which per se treatment was appropriate;  but the court declined to dismiss Addamax's rule of reason claims, saying that the factual issues involving market power and anticompetitive effect were unsuitable for disposition on summary judgment.  Addamax Corporation v. Open Software Foundation, Inc., 888 F.Supp. 274 (D.Mass.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the parties entered into a stipulation that the damage phase of the case would be tried first, on a jury waived basis, to determine \"whether the defendants' conduct was a material cause of injury in fact to the plaintiff and, if so, the amount of damages.\"   The stipulation further provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Solely for purposes of this stipulation, the Court will assume that the defendants' conduct as alleged in the Amended Complaint and described in the non-damages portions of the expert reports of Drs. Comanor and Howe occurred and violates the federal and state law accounts.  However, the Court will not assume, but will hear and take evidence on, whether there was injury in fact to the plaintiff as a result of that conduct and, if so, the amount of damages, which is the subject of this phase of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial was conducted over 12 days between November 18 and December 16, 1996.  Addamax presented as live witnesses Dr. Alsberg, three experts, and a single Addamax customer.  The defendants did not present live witnesses but did cross-examine extensively and relied on documentary submissions and deposition testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1997, the district court issued a decision concluding that the defendants' conduct was \"not a material cause\" of Addamax's losses.  Addamax Corporation v. Open Software Foundation, Inc., 964 F.Supp. 549, 555 (D.Mass.1997).  The court found that the B-1 software market was a highly risky business, that Addamax's belatedly-offered product was \"too expensive and too complex, and ... actually exceeded B-1 requirements.\"  Id. at 553.   The court said that Addamax faced severe competition from AT &amp; T in the B-1 market and that SecureWare's product was \"a cheaper and simpler\" one.  Id. Accordingly, the court held on the merits that Addamax was not entitled to any damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax has now appealed and argues what in substance are three different points:  that the district court erred in its factual determination that defendants' conduct was not a material cause of Addamax's losses in the B-1 security software market;  that the stipulation, pertinent case law or both required the district court to find that the defendants' conduct had caused damage to Addamax;  and that the court erred in dismissing the per se claims against the defendants.  Because the legal issues set the frame for the factual ones, it is more convenient to take these claims in reverse order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. As we explained in an earlier case, per se rules under section 1 of the Sherman Act have left only a couple of \"serious candidates\" for per se treatment:  these include price or output fixing agreements (horizontal market division agreements are of essentially the same character) and \"certain group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal.\"  U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Healthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 593 (1st Cir.1993).  Since those words were written, the categories have been narrowed even further by the Supreme Court's decision to overrule Albrecht v. The Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 869, 19 L.Ed.2d 998 (1968) and thereby to exclude from per se treatment vertical maximum resale price fixing agreements.  State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a plaintiff proves conduct that falls within a per se category, nothing more is needed for liability;  the defendants' power, illicit purpose and anticompetitive effect are all said to be irrelevant.  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940).  But courts have been very careful to confine per se treatment to conduct of the type that is almost always actually or potentially anticompetitive and has no redeeming benefits (e.g., reduced costs, increased competition) worthy of being weighed against the negative effects.  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 441 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 1551, 60 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979).  Per se offenses remain very important--they include horizontal price fixing--but only for conduct that fits squarely within the \"ever narrowing per se niche.\"  U.S. Healthcare, 986 F.2d at 593.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joint venture enterprises like OFC, unless they amount to complete shams, cf.  Palmer v. BRG of Georgia, 498 U.S. 46, 111 S.Ct. 401, 112 L.Ed.2d 349 (1990), are rarely susceptible to per se treatment.  Where the venture is producing a new product--here, the OFC-1 software package--there is patently a potential for a productive contribution to the economy, and conduct that is strictly ancillary to this productive effort (e.g., the joint venture's decision as to the price at which it will purchase inputs) is evaluated under the rule of reason.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This is so even if we accept, pursuant to the stipulation, the arguendo premise that OSF and those connected with it represented a large portion of the market for purchasing B-1 security software and represented a large portion of some kind of output market for integrated Unix software programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax points to fragments of evidence that, assuming a full context were established, might or might not suggest that OSF was an aggressive response to the AT &amp; T Sun venture and that Hewlett-Packard had a secret agenda to favor SecureWare over Addamax (for reasons that are never made quite clear), regardless of whether Addamax offered a superior product.  None of the evidence pointed to by Addamax suggests that OSF-1 was other than a legitimate, if ultimately unsuccessful, product;  and there is nothing to suggest that the ancillary decisions--what inputs to purchase, at what price, and from whom--were not legitimately related to this effort.  In this context, flinging around terms like \"cartel\" and \"boycott\" do not convert a rule of reason claim into a per se one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. On the other hand, neither is a joint venture \"per se\" legal.  Any joint venture, especially one that involves competitors, tends to be susceptible to attack under section 1's rule of reason--on the theory that the operations of the joint venture represent collaboration of the separate entities that own or control it.  How far this theory can be pressed in the case of a truly integrated enterprise, whose \"owners\" were no more than stockholders, is a matter we need not pursue;  we will assume here that the OSF joint venture, or some aspect of it, could be condemned under section 1 if the balance of harms and benefits tipped in favor of harms;  questions of power and motive are primarily clues to such effects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Addamax's most straightforward claim would be that OSF's concentration of purchasing power in the supposed \"market\" for acquiring B-1 security software was so great that it imposed a significant risk of forcing prices below competitive levels, and that those risks outweighed any benefit from the venture or, more plausibly, that the venture could achieve those benefits in a less restrictive fashion, i.e., without creating a substantial threat of monopsony pricing.  Whether or not this theory could be proved, we are here assuming liability arguendo.   The question remains whether Addamax established--either as a matter of law or based on the evidence--some causal connection between this assumed violation by defendants and Addamax's failure in the B-1 security software business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax first argues that the stipulation required the district court to find that the assumed violation was a material cause of injury to Addamax.  Addamax's reading is contrary both to the explicit language of the stipulation and to its evident purpose.  The stipulation said that the first phase of the bench trial was to determine \"whether\" defendants' conduct was \"a material cause of injury in fact\" to Addamax (and, if so, the amount of damages), assuming arguendo that a violation of law had occurred.  Pointedly, the stipulation went on to emphasize that although the existence of a violation was to be assumed, the court \"will not assume, but will hear and take evidence on,\" the question whether there was \"injury in fact to the plaintiff as a result of\" the attributed conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly both Addamax's complaint and its experts asserted that the alleged conduct has caused injury, but this was not part of the facts to be assumed arguendo.   The stipulation did not assume the truth of the complaint, but only that defendants had engaged in the \"conduct\" alleged in the complaint.  Under the stipulation, the reports of Addamax's experts were assumed to be true only in describing the conduct and not its consequences;  that is made clear by the reference in the stipulation to assuming the truth of the \"non damages portions of the expert reports.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax's more interesting argument is its claim that the case law, and the economic theory that underlies it, require a conclusion that the conduct assumed arguendo to comprise a violation must have caused injury to Addamax.  The broadest version of this proposition is Addamax's claim that under the rule of reason, conduct is condemned only because it has an anticompetitive effect.  Therefore, Addamax argues, there must have been some injury to it, and the only question that remains is to calculate the amount of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A more specific version of the argument, also advanced, is that in this very case the complaint's straightforward charge is that the defendants engaged in an agreement that had the effect of reducing price for B-1 security systems and since Addamax was a provider of B-1 security programs, it necessarily was injured by a reduction in price.  An alternative version is Addamax's claim that the joint venturers were engaged in suppressing demand for their own output--Unix programs like OSF-1 embodying B-1 software--and this in turn reduced the demand, and presumably therefore price, volume or both, for suppliers of the input.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is technically an overstatement to say that actual anticompetitive impact is a requirement of liability in a rule-of-reason case.  True, as a practical matter, most courts would be unlikely to condemn an otherwise legitimate joint venture absent some showing of anticompetitive effect.  But in principle, a sufficiently high risk of an anticompetitive effect, coupled with marginal benefits (or none at all that could not be achieved through an easily available less restrictive alternative) might justify condemnation under the rule of reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But all this is beside the point.  Even if we assume that the OSF purchasing consortium was capable of exercising monopsony power directly or through coordination of its sponsor/members' actions, it does not follow that Addamax was a victim or that the alleged below-market price offered by the consortium materially affected Addamax.  The only formal purchase by OSF involving Addamax was based on the November 1989 request for technology, in which SecureWare was the successful supplier.  If below market price was paid, SecureWare, and not Addamax, was directly injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Addamax claims that its sales opportunities were indirectly curtailed.  While the OSF sponsors and members were free to purchase B-1 security programs from anyone they wanted on an individual basis, Addamax claims that winning the OSF-1 sale would have amounted to a valuable OSF endorsement, spurring other sales.  But it is hard to see this loss as a consequence of monopsony pricing.  In all events, Addamax's claim of secondary injury reduces itself to an issue of fact--not an issue that can be taken as resolved by stipulation or case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. As a preface to its factual claims, Addamax asserts that the district court's decision recognizes a \"defense\" of mismanagement.  A plaintiff's mismanagement is not a bar to recovery where an antitrust violation is a material cause of injury.  Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d at 14 n. 21.  But mismanagement is certainly relevant to the factual question whether the antitrust violation had such an effect or whether the plaintiff is entirely the cause of its own failure.  Argus Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 801 F.2d 38, 42-45 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to the question whether the district court erred in its factual determination that Addamax's inability to succeed in its efforts to sell its B-1 security program for Unix more widely was materially caused by the defendants' conduct.  On this issue, Addamax bore the burden of proof at trial.  Irvin Industries, Inc. v. Goodyear Aerospace Corp., 974 F.2d 241, 244 (2d Cir.1992).  On appeal, the district court's findings and ultimate conclusion of fact are entitled to stand unless found to be clearly erroneous.  La Esperanza De P.R., Inc. v. Perez Y Cia.  De Puerto Rico, Inc., 124 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax is mistaken in its suggestion that the district court misunderstood the legal standard for causation:  quite unlike Haverhill Gazette Co. v. Union Leader Corp., 333 F.2d 798 (1st Cir.1964), the district judge properly asked whether the defendants' assumed conduct had been a substantial or material cause of the losses claimed by Addamax.  Although we there cautioned against an unduly rigid view of causation in computing damages once injury had been established, id. at 808 n. 16, nothing in the opinion relieved the plaintiff from making the statutory showing (fully satisfied in Haverhill ) that the violation had caused at least some injury to the plaintiff's business or property.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court was presented with two competing versions of reality.  Addamax's witnesses took the view that Addamax developed a superior B-1 product and its failure to succeed resulted from defendants' machinations which forced down the price of the product to sub-competitive levels and suppressed output for Unix software incorporating B-1 security programs.  In some places, Addamax describes itself as the target, and elsewhere as the accidental victim, of a larger conspiracy directed against AT &amp; T.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense version, which the district court adopted, was derived from defense depositions, cross-examination of the plaintiffs' experts and numerous documents.  In this view, Addamax engaged in risky entry into a market dominated by AT &amp; T, an established supplier of B-1 security software for Unix;  the Addamax system was oversophisticated, expensive, arrived late, and never received the important certification from NSA's National Computer Security Center.  And, in a market characterized by ever-changing demands, AT &amp; T's promised development of a follow-on B-2 system made the market for B-1 security software for Unix inherently risky and in some measure transitional.  There is nothing inherently implausible about either version;  everything depends on the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness to Addamax, the factual analysis in its brief represents exactly the kind of detailed critique of the evidence that fairly presents the question whether the district judge's findings are adequately supported by the record.  Addamax identifies specific findings with which it disagrees, cites to record evidence it thinks was misconstrued, furnishes citations to the record for propositions it advances, points to counterveiling evidence that it says the district judge ignored and misinterpreted.  In this respect, the brief deserves to be taken seriously, and we have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while in a few instances the district court may have misinterpreted an exhibit or ignored some fact that softens or qualifies the inference it draws, Addamax's own critique is filled with one-sided versions of events and refusals to confront evidence in support of the district court's findings.  What emerges from our own review of the record is that the district court had evidence to support each of its key findings:  that the business was a risky one;  that Addamax entered late, with a high-priced, overbuilt and uncertified product;  that AT &amp; T and SecureWare, in different ways, posed major problems for Addamax;  that many of Addamax's problems, including losses of customers, had begun before the OSF selection of SecureWare;  and that changes in market conditions proved to be adverse to Addamax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the evidence is largely derived from Addamax itself, including the deposition and trial testimony of Dr. Alsberg.  The risky nature of Addamax's venture was stressed in its disclosures to investors, and the delays and cost overruns concerning its B-1 product emerge from its own records;  it was Addamax that expressed concern with competition from AT &amp; T and especially its ability to offer a smooth transition to its own promised B-2 offering;  and the defection of existing and prospective customers to AT &amp; T, apparently before OSF-1, can be traced through Addamax records.  The district court did not commit \"clear error\" in finding the facts in favor of defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax attacks the district court's findings as inadequate under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).  By this, it means not that the explicit findings were wrong (it argues this elsewhere) but that the findings are either not sufficiently detailed or did not affirmatively find specific facts helpful to Addamax or did not address evidence that favored Addamax where there was evidence both ways.  But the district court was not required to make findings on every detail, was not required to discuss all of the evidence that supports each of the findings made, and was not required to respond individually to each evidentiary or factual contention made by the losing side.

After a bench trial limited to the issues of causation and damages, the district court found that antitrust violations, even if they were assumed to have occurred, were not a material cause of Addamax's failure in the line of business at issue.  Addamax now appeals and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a statement of those background facts that are more or less undisputed.  Addamax was created by Dr. Peter A. Alsberg in 1986 and, in 1987, began to focus on developing security software for Unix operating systems.  Unix is a very popular operating system for larger computers, and security software is a component that can be used with the operating system to restrict outside access to sensitive information and to restrict a particular user to information consistent with that user's security classification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, the National Computer Security Center, a division of the federal government's National Security Agency, rated security software, giving ratings (ranging from the most to the least secure) of A, B-3, B-2, B-1, C-2, C-1 and D. Addamax decided to produce B-1 software for Unix operating systems, a level of security demanded primarily by government users.  During the years 1988-89, Addamax did develop B-1 security software for at least two different versions of Unix.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Addamax was trying to produce its security software, a different struggle was developing between AT &amp; T--the inventor of Unix--and a number of major computer manufacturers.  Although originally Unix had been freely licensed by AT &amp; T, it appears that in the late 1980s AT &amp; T began restricting its licenses in the face of various software modifications being introduced by individual licensees;  and at the same time, AT &amp; T began to develop a close working relationship with Sun Microsystems, a major microprocessor manufacturer.  Other hardware manufacturers professed to fear that AT &amp; T was trying to establish a single dominant version of Unix, intending to exclude the proprietary Unix variations from the market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, in May 1988, a number of important computer manufacturers--including defendants Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment Corp.--formed the Open Software Foundation as a non-profit joint research and development venture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  OSF registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 4301, although that status has no direct importance for the issues before us.  At least one of OSF's professed objectives was to develop an alternative Unix operating system, denominated OSF-1, as a competitor to the Unix system being developed jointly by AT &amp; T and Sun Microsystems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, while OSF-1 was still being developed, OSF decided that it should include security software at the B-1 level.  At that time, only three companies--AT &amp; T, Addamax and SecureWare, Inc.--were producing security software for the Unix system.  On November 1, 1989, OSF sent a \"request for technology\" to Addamax and SecureWare, soliciting bids for a B-1 security component for the new OSF-1 system.  Bids were submitted on November 27, 1989, and OSF selected SecureWare on December 22, 1989.  There is some indication that the Addamax security software was more sophisticated--one witness agreed that the contrast was between a Cadillac and a Chevette--but the Addamax price may also have appeared more substantial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In any event, OSF-1 itself was never a very successful product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax continued to sell its own B-1 software for some period after losing the bid.  Nothing prevented OSF \"sponsors\" (the founding members of OSF) or \"members\" (a great many other companies) from using Addamax security software for their own programs;  and OSF sponsors and members were not the only potential buyers of Addamax's program.  However, by 1991, Addamax began to phase out its B-1 security software, turning away new buyers so that it could devote its resources to the development of a new security software product, in which it appears that the company was successful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1991, Addamax filed a complaint in the district court against OSF, Hewlett-Packard and Digital, alleging various violations of federal and state antitrust law.  As later amended, the complaint charged the defendants, together with other companies associated with OSF, with horizontal price fixing, boycott, and otherwise unlawful joint venture behavior in violation of the Sherman and the Clayton Acts, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1-2, 18.  A central theme, although not the only one, was that the defendants had conspired to force down the price for security software below the free-market level and otherwise to limit or impair the ability of Addamax to compete as a supplier of security software.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considerable discovery was conducted, and in due course the defendants moved for summary judgment.  In a thoughtful decision in May 1995, the district judge dismissed Addamax's per se claims on the ground that the alleged conduct of the defendants did not fit within the narrow categories for which per se treatment was appropriate;  but the court declined to dismiss Addamax's rule of reason claims, saying that the factual issues involving market power and anticompetitive effect were unsuitable for disposition on summary judgment.

Addamax presented as live witnesses Dr. Alsberg, three experts, and a single Addamax customer.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></span>, 555 (D.Mass.1997).  The court found that the B-1 software market was a highly risky business, that Addamax's belatedly-offered product was \"too expensive and too complex, and ... actually exceeded B-1 requirements.\"  Id. at 553.   The court said that Addamax faced severe competition from AT &amp; T in the B-1 market and that SecureWare's product was \"a cheaper and simpler\" one.  Id. Accordingly, the court held on the merits that Addamax was not entitled to any damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax has now appealed and argues what in substance are three different points:  that the district court erred in its factual determination that defendants' conduct was not a material cause of Addamax's losses in the B-1 security software market;  that the stipulation, pertinent case law or both required the district court to find that the defendants' conduct had caused damage to Addamax;  and that the court erred in dismissing the per se claims against the defendants.  Because the legal issues set the frame for the factual ones, it is more convenient to take these claims in reverse order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. As we explained in an earlier case, per se rules under section 1 of the Sherman Act have left only a couple of \"serious candidates\" for per se treatment:  these include price or output fixing agreements (horizontal market division agreements are of essentially the same character) and \"certain group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal.\"  U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v.

Where the venture is producing a new product--here, the OFC-1 software package--there is patently a potential for a productive contribution to the economy, and conduct that is strictly ancillary to this productive effort (e.g., the joint venture's decision as to the price at which it will purchase inputs) is evaluated under the rule of reason.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This is so even if we accept, pursuant to the stipulation, the arguendo premise that OSF and those connected with it represented a large portion of the market for purchasing B-1 security software and represented a large portion of some kind of output market for integrated Unix software programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax points to fragments of evidence that, assuming a full context were established, might or might not suggest that OSF was an aggressive response to the AT &amp; T Sun venture and that Hewlett-Packard had a secret agenda to favor SecureWare over Addamax (for reasons that are never made quite clear), regardless of whether Addamax offered a superior product.  None of the evidence pointed to by Addamax suggests that OSF-1 was other than a legitimate, if ultimately unsuccessful, product;  and there is nothing to suggest that the ancillary decisions--what inputs to purchase, at what price, and from whom--were not legitimately related to this effort.  In this context, flinging around terms like \"cartel\" and \"boycott\" do not convert a rule of reason claim into a per se one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. On the other hand, neither is a joint venture \"per se\" legal.  Any joint venture, especially one that involves competitors, tends to be susceptible to attack under section 1's rule of reason--on the theory that the operations of the joint venture represent collaboration of the separate entities that own or control it.  How far this theory can be pressed in the case of a truly integrated enterprise, whose \"owners\" were no more than stockholders, is a matter we need not pursue;  we will assume here that the OSF joint venture, or some aspect of it, could be condemned under section 1 if the balance of harms and benefits tipped in favor of harms;  questions of power and motive are primarily clues to such effects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Addamax's most straightforward claim would be that OSF's concentration of purchasing power in the supposed \"market\" for acquiring B-1 security software was so great that it imposed a significant risk of forcing prices below competitive levels, and that those risks outweighed any benefit from the venture or, more plausibly, that the venture could achieve those benefits in a less restrictive fashion, i.e., without creating a substantial threat of monopsony pricing.  Whether or not this theory could be proved, we are here assuming liability arguendo.   The question remains whether Addamax established--either as a matter of law or based on the evidence--some causal connection between this assumed violation by defendants and Addamax's failure in the B-1 security software business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax first argues that the stipulation required the district court to find that the assumed violation was a material cause of injury to Addamax.  Addamax's reading is contrary both to the explicit language of the stipulation and to its evident purpose.  The stipulation said that the first phase of the bench trial was to determine \"whether\" defendants' conduct was \"a material cause of injury in fact\" to Addamax (and, if so, the amount of damages), assuming arguendo that a violation of law had occurred.  Pointedly, the stipulation went on to emphasize that although the existence of a violation was to be assumed, the court \"will not assume, but will hear and take evidence on,\" the question whether there was \"injury in fact to the plaintiff as a result of\" the attributed conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly both Addamax's complaint and its experts asserted that the alleged conduct has caused injury, but this was not part of the facts to be assumed arguendo.   The stipulation did not assume the truth of the complaint, but only that defendants had engaged in the \"conduct\" alleged in the complaint.  Under the stipulation, the reports of Addamax's experts were assumed to be true only in describing the conduct and not its consequences;  that is made clear by the reference in the stipulation to assuming the truth of the \"non damages portions of the expert reports.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax's more interesting argument is its claim that the case law, and the economic theory that underlies it, require a conclusion that the conduct assumed arguendo to comprise a violation must have caused injury to Addamax.  The broadest version of this proposition is Addamax's claim that under the rule of reason, conduct is condemned only because it has an anticompetitive effect.  Therefore, Addamax argues, there must have been some injury to it, and the only question that remains is to calculate the amount of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A more specific version of the argument, also advanced, is that in this very case the complaint's straightforward charge is that the defendants engaged in an agreement that had the effect of reducing price for B-1 security systems and since Addamax was a provider of B-1 security programs, it necessarily was injured by a reduction in price.  An alternative version is Addamax's claim that the joint venturers were engaged in suppressing demand for their own output--Unix programs like OSF-1 embodying B-1 software--and this in turn reduced the demand, and presumably therefore price, volume or both, for suppliers of the input.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is technically an overstatement to say that actual anticompetitive impact is a requirement of liability in a rule-of-reason case.  True, as a practical matter, most courts would be unlikely to condemn an otherwise legitimate joint venture absent some showing of anticompetitive effect.  But in principle, a sufficiently high risk of an anticompetitive effect, coupled with marginal benefits (or none at all that could not be achieved through an easily available less restrictive alternative) might justify condemnation under the rule of reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But all this is beside the point.  Even if we assume that the OSF purchasing consortium was capable of exercising monopsony power directly or through coordination of its sponsor/members' actions, it does not follow that Addamax was a victim or that the alleged below-market price offered by the consortium materially affected Addamax.  The only formal purchase by OSF involving Addamax was based on the November 1989 request for technology, in which SecureWare was the successful supplier.  If below market price was paid, SecureWare, and not Addamax, was directly injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Addamax claims that its sales opportunities were indirectly curtailed.  While the OSF sponsors and members were free to purchase B-1 security programs from anyone they wanted on an individual basis, Addamax claims that winning the OSF-1 sale would have amounted to a valuable OSF endorsement, spurring other sales.  But it is hard to see this loss as a consequence of monopsony pricing.  In all events, Addamax's claim of secondary injury reduces itself to an issue of fact--not an issue that can be taken as resolved by stipulation or case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. As a preface to its factual claims, Addamax asserts that the district court's decision recognizes a \"defense\" of mismanagement.  A plaintiff's mismanagement is not a bar to recovery where an antitrust violation is a material cause of injury.  Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d at 14 n. 21.  But mismanagement is certainly relevant to the factual question whether the antitrust violation had such an effect or whether the plaintiff is entirely the cause of its own failure.  Argus Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476329\"><a href=\"/opinion/476329/argus-incorporated-and-interphoto-corporation-v-eastman-kodak-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 42-45 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to the question whether the district court erred in its factual determination that Addamax's inability to succeed in its efforts to sell its B-1 security program for Unix more widely was materially caused by the defendants' conduct.  On this issue, Addamax bore the burden of proof at trial.  Irvin Industries, Inc. v. Goodyear Aerospace Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590216\"><a href=\"/opinion/590216/irvin-industries-inc-v-goodyear-aerospace-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 244 (2d Cir.1992).  On appeal, the district court's findings and ultimate conclusion of fact are entitled to stand unless found to be clearly erroneous.  La Esperanza De P.R., Inc. v. Perez Y Cia.  De Puerto Rico, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197506\"><a href=\"/opinion/197506/perez-y-cia-v-la-esperanza/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax is mistaken in its suggestion that the district court misunderstood the legal standard for causation:  quite unlike Haverhill Gazette Co. v. Union Leader Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"264836\"><a href=\"/opinion/264836/the-haverhill-gazette-company-v-union-leader-corporation-union-leader/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1964), the district judge properly asked whether the defendants' assumed conduct had been a substantial or material cause of the losses claimed by Addamax.  Although we there cautioned against an unduly rigid view of causation in computing damages once injury had been established, id. at 808 n. 16, nothing in the opinion relieved the plaintiff from making the statutory showing (fully satisfied in Haverhill ) that the violation had caused at least some injury to the plaintiff's business or property.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court was presented with two competing versions of reality.  Addamax's witnesses took the view that Addamax developed a superior B-1 product and its failure to succeed resulted from defendants' machinations which forced down the price of the product to sub-competitive levels and suppressed output for Unix software incorporating B-1 security programs.  In some places, Addamax describes itself as the target, and elsewhere as the accidental victim, of a larger conspiracy directed against AT &amp; T.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense version, which the district court adopted, was derived from defense depositions, cross-examination of the plaintiffs' experts and numerous documents.  In this view, Addamax engaged in risky entry into a market dominated by AT &amp; T, an established supplier of B-1 security software for Unix;  the Addamax system was oversophisticated, expensive, arrived late, and never received the important certification from NSA's National Computer Security Center.  And, in a market characterized by ever-changing demands, AT &amp; T's promised development of a follow-on B-2 system made the market for B-1 security software for Unix inherently risky and in some measure transitional.  There is nothing inherently implausible about either version;  everything depends on the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness to Addamax, the factual analysis in its brief represents exactly the kind of detailed critique of the evidence that fairly presents the question whether the district judge's findings are adequately supported by the record.  Addamax identifies specific findings with which it disagrees, cites to record evidence it thinks was misconstrued, furnishes citations to the record for propositions it advances, points to counterveiling evidence that it says the district judge ignored and misinterpreted.  In this respect, the brief deserves to be taken seriously, and we have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while in a few instances the district court may have misinterpreted an exhibit or ignored some fact that softens or qualifies the inference it draws, Addamax's own critique is filled with one-sided versions of events and refusals to confront evidence in support of the district court's findings.  What emerges from our own review of the record is that the district court had evidence to support each of its key findings:  that the business was a risky one;  that Addamax entered late, with a high-priced, overbuilt and uncertified product;  that AT &amp; T and SecureWare, in different ways, posed major problems for Addamax;  that many of Addamax's problems, including losses of customers, had begun before the OSF selection of SecureWare;  and that changes in market conditions proved to be adverse to Addamax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the evidence is largely derived from Addamax itself, including the deposition and trial testimony of Dr. Alsberg.  The risky nature of Addamax's venture was stressed in its disclosures to investors, and the delays and cost overruns concerning its B-1 product emerge from its own records;  it was Addamax that expressed concern with competition from AT &amp; T and especially its ability to offer a smooth transition to its own promised B-2 offering;  and the defection of existing and prospective customers to AT &amp; T, apparently before OSF-1, can be traced through Addamax records.  The district court did not commit \"clear error\" in finding the facts in favor of defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addamax attacks the district court's findings as inadequate under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).  By this, it means not that the explicit findings were wrong (it argues this elsewhere) but that the findings are either not sufficiently detailed or did not affirmatively find specific facts helpful to Addamax or did not address evidence that favored Addamax where there was evidence both ways.  But the district court was not required to make findings on every detail, was not required to discuss all of the evidence that supports each of the findings made, and was not required to respond individually to each evidentiary or factual contention made by the losing side.  Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195201\"><a href=\"/opinion/195201/knapp-v-sylvania-shoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span>, 1228 (1st Cir.1994);  Applewood Landscape &amp; Nursery Co. v. Hollingsworth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529277\"><a href=\"/opinion/529277/applewood-landscape-nursery-co-inc-v-wayne-b-hollingsworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span>, 1503-04 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no mechanical rule for determining the exact level of findings required by Rule 52(a).  In this instance, the district court made explicit intermediate findings (e.g., competition from AT &amp; T, the strengths and weaknesses of Addamax's product) making clear the bases for its ultimate finding on causation;  and, with the help of counsel, it has been relatively easy to discern the evidence underlying these key findings.  The district court could have written a 200-page decision on this case, but the far more compact assessment it made was entirely adequate under Rule 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because such software products emerge through test versions and then successive upgrades, it is difficult to pinpoint from the testimony precisely when the \"product\" was on the market.
