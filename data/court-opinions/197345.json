Pursuant to a written plea agreement,\r                                \r\n\ndefendant John J.

Patti was\r\n\nadvised by  the Court, in plain and  understandable terms, of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1An appellant faces a \"high hurdle\" when he seeks to set\r               1\r\naside a guilty plea for the first time on appeal, although\r\nthe contours of the burden are \"somewhat cloudy.\"   Noriega-\r                                                                        \r\nMillan, -- F.3d ---, 1997 WL 151202 *6 n.4 (citations\r                  \r\nomitted).  We need not reach that issue here. \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthe  elements of the offense.   True, in  addition to telling\r\n\nPatti \r\n\nthat  he  was charged  with  conspiring to  use  a particular\r\n\n\"counterfeit\"  card,   the  court   also  defined  the   term\r\n\n\"unauthorized\"   card.     \"Unauthorized\"  has   a  different\r\n\nstatutory  meaning  from  \"counterfeit,\"   see  18  U.S.C.   \r                                                          \r\n\n1029(e)(2)(3),  and  use   of  an   \"unauthorized\"  card   is\r\n\ncriminalized in a  separate subsection  of the law.   See  18\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.C.    1029(a)(2).  The  two subsections  carry  different\r\n\nmaximum penalties, but the crime to which Patti actually pled\r\n\nguilty -- conspiracy to commit another offense, see 18 U.S.C.\r                                                               \r\n\n  371 --  carries a maximum  five-year penalty regardless  of\r\n\nwhether the object offense is defined in subsection (a)(1) or\r\n\nin subsection (a)(2) of 18 U.S.C.   1029.  \r\n\n          The  \"totality\" of  the  hearing  record,  however,\r\n\nreveals no misunderstanding as to the charge.   United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

The  elements of the  crime\r                  \r\n\nwere reiterated at the  hearing by the government prosecutor,\r\n\nwhose  offer  of  proof  emphasized that  the  card  fit  the\r\n\ndefinition  of  \"counterfeit\" because  it had  been altered.2\r                                                                        2\r\n\nThe  definition of a  \"counterfeit access  device,\" expressly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2The name, account number and bank imprinted on the face\r               2\r\nof  the card did not match the information encoded on the\r\ncard's magnetic stripe. \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nincluding  any  component that  is  \"counterfeit, fictitious,\r\n\naltered,  or forged,\" was fully set forth in the written plea\r\n\nagreement.   Patti  signed the  agreement, and  certified his\r\n\nunderstanding of its terms.  \r\n\n          Under oath at the plea  hearing, Patti said that he\r\n\nunderstood the charge, his attorney said that he had reviewed\r\n\neach paragraph of  the indictment and the plea agreement with\r\n\nPatti, and Patti swore  that he was fully satisfied  with his\r\n\nattorney's  representation  and advice.    Any  error in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  explanation  thus  was  harmless.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Even if, as Patti\r                \r\n\nnow   belatedly claims,  he personally  did not  understand a\r\n\nlegal nuance,  an informed plea based  on competent counsel's\r\n\nadvice3  is acceptable  in  the circumstances  of this  case.\r                  3\r\n\nAllard v. Helgemoe, 572  F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n439  U.S. 858 (1978); see  also Nelson v.

Noriega-Millan, -- F.3d --, 1997 WL 151202 *6\r                                          \r\nn.3.  We caution, however, that ordinarily a defendant will\r\nnot be heard, even in a collateral proceeding, to controvert\r\nhis own sworn Rule 11 statements.  See United States v. Butt,\r                                                                        \r\n731 F.2d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 1984).\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nknow  that   the  card   specified  in  the   indictment  was\r\n\ncounterfeit.    The  record  reflects,  however,  that  Patti\r\n\nadmitted to  the probation  officer that  when he  joined the\r\n\nconspiracy he knew its breadth.  He knew it was a \"complete,\"\r\n\non-going,  \"stolen   credit  card   scam,\"  replete  with   a\r\n\ndesignated  \"fence.\"  Indeed, six credit  cards, all of which\r\n\nwere once valid, but subsequently traded, sold, or stolen and\r\n\nreprogrammed, were  found in  Patti's rented automobile.   He\r\n\nadmitted  knowing  that  he had  no  right  to  use the  card\r\n\nspecified  in the  indictment, and  assumed it  was \"stolen.\"\r\n\nThe only ignorance  he claimed was of the fact  that the card\r\n\nwas \"all rigmaroled like . . . they say.\" \r\n\n          True,   a  \"conspiracy   to  commit   a  particular\r\n\nsubstantive offense cannot exist  without at least the degree\r\n\nof  criminal  intent necessary  for  the  substantive offense\r\n\nitself.\"  Ingram v.  United States, 360 U.S. 672  (1959); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso  Piper, 35 F.3d  at 614  (explaining that  a conspirator\r                       \r\n\nmust  have  intended  both to  agree  and  to  effectuate the\r\n\ncommission of the substantive  offense).  We need  not decide\r\n\nhere,  however,  how  much  technological  knowledge  may  be\r\n\nimputed to a conspirator who  has admittedly conspired to use\r\n\nan illicit access device. \r\n\n          The hearing  record  reflects a  factual basis  for\r\n\ndoubting the reliability  of Patti's self-professed ignorance\r\n\nthat  the  card  was  altered,  and  a  rational  reason  for\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncalculating  that his own interests would be best served by a\r\n\nguilty  plea.   See  North Carolina  v.  Alford, 400  U.S. 25\r                                                           \r\n\n(1970). An  informed and  calculated plea based  on competent\r\n\ncounsel's advice about the wisdom of pleading guilty or going\r\n\nto trial is all that is required.  Allard, 572 F.2d at 6.    \r                                                     \r\n\n          As to Patti's remaining challenges to the sentence:\r\n\n          (1)   We  see  no \"clear  error\"  in  the  district\r\n\ncourt's decision  to  increase Patti's  guideline  sentencing\r\n\nrange by two levels  for \"more than minimal planning,\"  under\r\n\nUSSG     2F1.1(b)(2).   Ample  record  evidence supports  the\r\n\ncourt's  finding that Patti's participation in the conspiracy\r\n\nwas not a \"spur of the moment\" crime, but the product of more\r\n\nthan minimal  planning.  United States v.  Gregorio, 956 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n341, 343 (1st  Cir. 1992).  In addition to  Patti's two known\r\n\nuses of the counterfeit card on the day he was  arrested, the\r\n\nother  five illicit cards were  found concealed in the panels\r\n\nof an automobile which he had rented  two weeks earlier.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUSSG   1B1.1 comment (n.1(f)).\r\n\n          (2)  There is also no support for Patti's argument,\r\n\nraised for the first time on appeal, that the enhancement for\r\n\n\"more  than  minimal  planning\"  somehow  violated  the  plea\r\n\nagreement or Patti's understanding of the plea agreement, and\r\n\nrequired the court  to sua sponte offer  Patti an opportunity\r                                             \r\n\nto withdraw his guilty plea.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          The plea agreement  expressly was  made subject  to\r\n\nFed. R. Crim. P.  11(e)(1)(B), and the Sentencing Guidelines.\r\n\nBefore  entering his  guilty  plea, Patti  was  unequivocally\r\n\ninformed  by  the court  that he  would  not be  permitted to\r\n\nwithdraw the plea except in one  circumstance.  \"If I do  not\r\n\naccept the [$2,000 fraud loss] stipulation, Mr. Patti, I will\r\n\nallow you to withdraw your plea of guilty if you choose to do\r\n\nso,  however, you will not  be allowed to  withdraw your plea\r\n\nfor any other reason; do you understand?\"  Patti said that he\r\n\nunderstood.              Accordingly,  the  judgment  of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n",
