This appeal  summons our review\r                    SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nof a jury verdict that awarded certain life insurance proceeds to\r\n\nthe  decedent's quondam companion rather than  to a family trust.\r\n\nUpon close perscrutation  of the record, the parties' briefs, and\r\n\nthe applicable law, we discern no error.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We  start with a neutral account of the facts that were\r\n\nbefore the jury.   The  decedent, Robert M.  Colasanto, made  his\r\n\nmark as a successful  business executive.  In September  of 1982,\r\n\nColasanto met Stephen  A. Farley.   A relationship developed  and\r\n\nthe  two men  began cohabiting  in San  Diego, California.   They\r\n\nlived initially in  a rented  dwelling and later  in a  luxurious\r\n\nhome that Colasanto  purchased.  During this time frame Colasanto\r\n\nfounded a  health-care organization, Community Care Network, Inc.\r\n\n(CCN),  which became  hugely successful.   Colasanto  enjoyed the\r\n\nfruits of his  good fortune including,  inter alia, a  beneficial\r                                                            \r\n\ninterest under a  group life  insurance policy owned  by CCN  and\r\n\nissued by  Life Insurance Company  of North America  (LINA) which\r\n\nafforded him a $140,000 death benefit.\r\n\n          Colasanto's  world  changed in  1989  when a  physician\r\n\ndiagnosed  him as HIV-positive.  By 1992, he had contracted AIDS.\r\n\nYearning  for his  native  New  England,  he  bought  a  home  in\r\n\nMassachusetts.  Colasanto and Farley  took up residence there  in\r\n\nthe spring of 1993.\r\n\n          As   Colasanto's  health  deteriorated,  so,  too,  his\r\n\nrelationship with  Farley.    The  two  men  began  discussing  a\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nproperty  settlement  in mid-1993.    Despite  the assistance  of\r\n\nretained  counsel, they were unable to agree on terms.  According\r\n\nto Farley, however, the parties reached an informal  agreement on\r\n\nor about December 3,  1993.  Under that accord,  Colasanto was to\r\n\ntransfer ownership of five life insurance policies (including the\r\n\nLINA group life policy) to Farley.\r\n\n          On December 10, Colasanto completed and executed a form\r\n\nentitled \"Application  for Conversion  of Group or  Employee Life\r\n\nInsurance\"  (the conversion  application) with  the intention  of\r\n\nconverting his  coverage under the group policy  to an individual\r\n\npolicy.   Line  10(c)  of the  conversion  application bears  the\r\n\ninscription  \"Pay  Death Benefit  to,\"  followed  by three  blank\r\n\nlines.    Underneath  the  first blank  line  these  instructions\r\n\nappear:  \"Print Full Name of Beneficiary and State Relationship.\"\r\n\nOn  the left-hand side of  this line Colasanto  typed \"Stephen A.\r\n\nFarley.\"  He left a blank space  in the middle of the line and on\r\n\nthe right-hand side he  typed \"Executor.\"1  On the  following two\r\n\nlines Colasanto  added \"Issue  policy with  Mr. Farley  as owner.\r\n\nSee  enclosed letter.\"  The  letter, signed by  Colasanto, bore a\r\n\ncaption indicating that it was being transmitted \"RE:  CONVERSION\r\n\nOF GROUP COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE   SPECIFICATION OF OWNER\r\n\nOF INDIVIDUAL POLICY  WHICH IS ISSUED.\"   The body of the  letter\r\n\nmade explicit reference to  the conversion application and stated\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The parties  agree that  on December 10,  1993, Colasanto's\r\nwill nominated Farley as his executor.  Colasanto made a new will\r\nbefore he  died.  Farley was  not named as executor  then and was\r\nnot  appointed executor  of  Colasanto's estate  upon Colasanto's\r\ndemise.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nin relevant part:\r\n\n               Please  note that  I am  requesting that\r\n          the individual policy be issued such that the\r\n          owner is as follows:\r\n          Stephen A. Farley\r\n          10448 Russel Road\r\n          La Mesa, CA 91941 D.O.B. 2-21-49\r\n\n               Mr. Farley is currently  the beneficiary\r\n          of the group coverage.   If he needs to  fill\r\n          out another beneficiary form, please  send it\r\n          to him since  that will be  his right as  the\r\n          policy owner.\r\n\n               The premium statement(s) should  be sent\r\n          to Mr. Farley at the above address.\r\n\n          Colasanto  transmitted  the conversion  application and\r\n\nletter  to LINA.   He sent forms  and letters to  four other life\r\n\ninsurers on the same date.  Each letter instructed the carrier to\r\n\ntransfer ownership of the  affected policy to Farley.  In each of\r\n\nthe  five instances Colasanto  contemporaneously furnished Farley\r\n\nwith signed  copies of  the conversion application  or assignment\r\n\nform,  the  cover letter,  and  a certified  mail  return receipt\r\n\nrequest  in Colasanto's  handwriting asking  that the  receipt be\r\n\nforwarded to Farley.2\r\n\n          Farley  returned  to California  on  December  22.   On\r\n\nJanuary 19, 1994, Colasanto sent a premium payment to LINA on the\r\n\npolicy  in question and accompanied it  with a letter reiterating\r\n\n\"that the individual policy should be issued to Stephen A. Farley\r\n\nas owner.\"   Colasanto added:  \"If a separate form is required to\r\n\nchange  owner,  then  please  send  the  form.    Future  premium\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Upon  Colasanto's death,  Farley  apparently collected  the\r\nproceeds of the  other four  policies without incident.   In  any\r\nevent, none of those policies are implicated here.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nstatements should be sent to Mr. Farley as owner.\"  LINA sent the\r\n\nindividual policy to Colasanto in  early February together with a\r\n\nletter admonishing  that if Colasanto wished  to designate Farley\r\n\nas owner, he should  execute an assignment form and  return it to\r\n\nLINA.  Despite the fact that LINA enclosed a blank form with this\r\n\nletter, Colasanto never signed it.\r\n\n          Later that month, Farley  returned to Massachusetts.  A\r\n\nreconciliation ensued.3   Colasanto  repaired to  California with\r\n\nFarley, only to return to  Massachusetts alone following a bitter\r\n\nquarrel  that  took place  on  March  7, 1994.    The next  month\r\n\nColasanto  executed  a  change-of-beneficiary  form  in which  he\r\n\npurported  to  designate  one   of  his  brothers,  Valentino  T.\r\n\nColasanto,  in his capacity as Trustee of the Robert M. Colasanto\r\n\nRevocable  Trust,   as  the  beneficiary  of   the  LINA  policy.\r\n\nColasanto died on June 17, 1994.\r\n\n          Both Farley and  the Trustee laid  claim to the  policy\r\n\nproceeds.   The Trustee won the  race to the courthouse steps and\r\n\nfiled suit  against LINA  in a  Rhode Island state  court.   LINA\r\n\nremoved the case  to federal  district court, 28  U.S.C.    1441,\r\n\nciting the existence of original jurisdiction arising out of both\r\n\ndiversity  and  interpleader, see  28  U.S.C.     1332(a),  1335,\r                                           \r\n\nimpleaded  Farley, and  deposited the  face value  of  the policy\r\n\n($140,000)  into  the  registry  of  the  district  court.    See\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3During  this  period Farley  took  possession  of both  the\r\nsubject  policy  and  the blank  assignment  form.   The  parties\r\ndisagree about  how this occurred.   The appellant  contends that\r\nFarley filched the papers; Farley claims that Colasanto gave them\r\nto him.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ngenerally   Fed.  R.   Civ.  P.   22  (discussing   mechanics  of\r                   \r\n\ninterpleader actions).\r\n\n          LINA's  departure from  the  fray left  Farley and  the\r\n\nTrustee locked in mortal combat.  After considerable skirmishing,\r\n\nthe case  was tried and the  jury returned a verdict  in Farley's\r\n\nfavor.    The  district  court thereafter  denied  the  Trustee's\r\n\nmotions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) (judgment as a matter of law)\r\n\nand Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a) (new trial).  This appeal followed.\r\n\n          The Trustee  presses several  points in support  of his\r\n\nposition.    We have  considered them  all,  but address  in this\r\n\nopinion only those contentions that  have arguable merit and that\r\n\nare necessary to a resolution of this appeal.\r\n\nII.  OWNERSHIP OF THE POLICY\r          II.  OWNERSHIP OF THE POLICY\r\n\n          The appellant's  flagship claim  is that no  reasonable\r\n\njuror could conclude that  Colasanto transferred ownership of the\r\n\nsubject policy to  Farley, and the  lower court therefore  should\r\n\nhave granted  the motion for judgment  as a matter of  law.4  The\r\n\nstandard  of review referable to a trial court's refusal to order\r\n\njudgment  as a  matter of  law is  set in cement.   The  court of\r\n\nappeals  undertakes  plenary  review,   see  Gibson  v.  City  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nCranston, 37 F.3d 731,  735 (1st Cir. 1994), and  \"examine[s] the\r                  \r\n\nevidence  and the inferences reasonably  to be drawn therefrom in\r\n\nthe light most favorable to  the nonmovant,\" Wagenmann v.  Adams,\r                                                                          \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Transfer  of  ownership  is  a  critical  datum  since,  if\r\nColasanto remained the  owner of  the policy on  April 21,  1994,\r\nthen his  execution and delivery of  a change-of-beneficiary form\r\non that date would  have been effective, and the  policy proceeds\r\nwould be payable to the successor beneficiary (the Trustee).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n829 F.2d 196, 200  (1st Cir. 1987).   In so doing the court  \"may\r\n\nnot  consider  credibility  of witnesses,  resolve  conflicts  in\r\n\ntestimony,  or  evaluate  the  weight  of  the  evidence.\"    Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nOverriding a jury verdict  is warranted only if the  evidence \"is\r\n\nso one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for\r\n\nreasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\"  Gibson, 37\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 735.\r\n\n                                A\r                                          A\r\n\n          The gist  of the Trustee's argument  is that Colasanto,\r\n\nalthough taking  an initial  step  to transfer  ownership of  the\r\n\npolicy to Farley, never effectuated  that change according to the\r\n\nterms of the policy.   Thus, no  reasonable jury could find  that\r\n\nColasanto  substantially  complied   with  the  explicit   policy\r\n\nrequirements necessary to anoint Farley as the owner.\r\n\n          This argument misses the mark.  It is predicated on the\r\n\ncommon law doctrine of substantial compliance.  The parties agree\r\n\nthat   the   substantive  law   of  Massachusetts   governs  this\r\n\ncontroversy,  and, according to  the appellant, the Massachusetts\r\n\ncases suggest that,  if a  policy specifies the  manner in  which\r\n\ntransfers  are to be made, the failure of literal compliance with\r\n\nthe policy requirements will  be excused only if the  insured did\r\n\neverything  that he  could do  to comply  with  those provisions.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Acacia Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Feinberg, 318 Mass.  246,\r                                                          \r\n\n250,  61  N.E.2d 122,  124 (1945)  (stating  that \"it  is  of the\r\n\nessence of substantial compliance that the insured must have done\r\n\nall  in his  power  to  effect  the  change,  leaving  only  some\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nministerial  act  on  the  part  of  the  insurer  necessary   to\r\n\nconsummate it\"); Resnek v.  Mutual Life Ins. Co., 286  Mass. 305,\r                                                          \r\n\n309, 190 N.E. 603, 604-05 (1934) (similar).\r\n\n          Building  on  this  base,  the appellant  points  to  a\r\n\nprovision in the LINA policy that states:  \"Changes [of ownership\r\n\nor  beneficiary]  must  be   requested  in  writing  on  a   form\r\n\nsatisfactory  to  us  and  sent to  our  Administrative  Office.\"\r\n\nBecause this condition could have been,  but was not, met   after\r\n\nall, the carrier sent  Colasanto a blank assignment form,  and he\r\n\neasily could have completed it and mailed it back   the appellant\r\n\ninsists  that there  was no  substantial compliance,  and, hence,\r\n\nthat  the attempted change of ownership was ineffectual.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat  309-10 (indicating that if the insured  is put on notice that\r\n\nhe has  not done all in his power to comply with the requirements\r\n\nfor changing a beneficiary,  as by the insurer's rejection  of an\r\n\nimproperly  completed  form, and  the insured  does not  take the\r\n\nsuggested remedial action,  there is no substantial  compliance).\r\n\nEven though  Colasanto explicitly  designated Farley as  owner on\r\n\nthe conversion  application, reaffirmed that  designation in  the\r\n\ncover  letter, and  wrote a  subsequent epistle  reiterating that\r\n\nFarley owned the policy,  the appellant asseverates that Farley's\r\n\nclaim of ownership fails  because Colasanto never transmitted the\r\n\nassignment form to LINA.  The appellant then tries to hoist  this\r\n\nasseveration by its bootstraps, noting that LINA never recognized\r\n\na transfer of  policy ownership  to Farley,  instead sending  the\r\n\npolicy to Colasanto and accepting the change-of-beneficiary  form\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthat he subsequently submitted.\r\n\n          There  are  two visible  flaws  in  the fabric  of  the\r\n\nappellant's thesis.  In the first place, we do not think that the\r\n\ndoctrine of substantial compliance  applies to this case.   It is\r\n\ngenerally  held  in  Massachusetts  that  the  provisions  of  an\r\n\ninsurance policy which stipulate  what formalities must attend an\r\n\nassignment  are for  the  benefit of  the  insurer, not  for  the\r\n\nbenefit of others.  See Abbruzise v. Sposata, 306 Mass. 151, 153-\r                                                      \r\n\n54, 27 N.E.2d  722, 723-24  (1940); Goldman v.

When, as now, the insurer is\r\n\nno longer a  combatant, and the  dispute over  the validity of  a\r\n\ntransfer  is limited to the  assignor and the  assignee (or those\r\n\nclaiming  under them),  the  assignor is  precluded from  relying\r\n\nmechanically on the formalities built  into the policy to  defeat\r\n\nthe transfer.  See  Abbruzise, 306 Mass. at 153-54;  Goldman, 287\r                                                                      \r\n\nMass. at 397; Herman v. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins.

In other  words,  the\r                   \r\n\nassignment, though not in compliance with the policy, nonetheless\r\n\nmay be binding  as between the  assignor and assignee as  long as\r\n\nthe evidence of the act and  the intent is sufficient to  confirm\r\n\nthe assignment's validity.\r\n\n          The second flaw in the appellant's thesis is that, even\r\n\nif the substantial compliance  doctrine retains some relevance in\r\n\na contest over life insurance proceeds between parties other than\r\n\nthe insurer,  an argument  premised on substantial  compliance in\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nthis  case  overlooks  the  obvious.    If  an  insurance  policy\r\n\nregulates  the form  of an  assignment and  the insured  complies\r\n\nliterally  with those  terms,  the assignment  is valid,  and the\r                   \r\n\nquestion of substantial compliance is immaterial.\r\n\n          Here,  the policy provides  not one, but  two, means of\r\n\nchanging  the ownership.    It stipulates:    \"The Owner  (\"you,\"\r\n\n\"your\")  is  the  Insured  unless  otherwise  designated  in  the\r                                                                           \r\n\napplication or  unless changed  as provided under  the Change  of\r                     \r\n\nOwnership or Beneficiary provision [i.e., by use of an assignment\r\n\nform].\"    (Emphasis  supplied).    The  jacket  of  the   policy\r\n\nreiterates  this duality:    \"The Owner  (\"you,\"  \"your\") is  the\r\n\ninsured  unless another  person  is named  in the  application or\r                                                                        \r\n\nlater becomes the  Owner as  allowed by the  policy.\"   (Emphasis\r\n\nsupplied).  Thus, while Colasanto could have effected the desired\r\n\nchange of ownership by  returning the assignment form to  LINA as\r\n\ninstructed,  we see no reason why he  could not also have done so\r\n\nin  the application.  Since the policy appears explicitly to have\r                             \r\n\ngiven the  policyholder that option,  we think that  a reasonable\r\n\njury could have decided the point on the basis that Colasanto had\r\n\nchosen this manner  of switching the policy's  ownership and that\r\n\nthe resultant designation was valid and binding.\r\n\n          A group policy  and an individual  policy that is  spun\r\n\noff from it ordinarily are  deemed a single, continuing  contract\r\n\nof  insurance.  See Binkley  v. Manufacturers Life  Ins. Co., 471\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 889, 891  (10th Cir.),  cert. denied, 414  U.S. 877  (1973);\r                                                   \r\n\nBrindis v.

Until  Colasanto  retired, his\r\n\nemployer  owned the group policy.  There was no individual policy\r\n\n(and, hence,  no individual owner) until  Colasanto exercised his\r\n\nright of conversion.   In all  probability, then, the  conversion\r\n\napplication  is an application  within the purview  of the quoted\r\n\npolicy language    we hesitate  only because LINA is  not a party\r\n\nhere, and  it cannot be heard  on the topic in  this proceeding  \r\n\nand  in any event,  the appellant concedes  that it is  such.  He\r\n\nmaintains, however,  that the  application could  not be  used to\r\n\ndictate ownership  because there  was no line  or place on  it to\r\n\nspell out the nature of the change.\r\n\n          We reject  this argument.  An  insurance company cannot\r\n\nconfer a prerogative upon the insured in the policy covenants and\r\n\nthen surreptitiously take it away by omitting any reference to it\r\n\non  the forms that the company prints to implement the covenants.\r\n\nHere, the policy told Colasanto that he could designate the owner\r\n\nof  a  converted   policy  by  naming  that  individual   in  the\r\n\napplication, and  he did  so.   At the very  least, a  reasonable\r\n\njury, faced with this concatenation of circumstances, had a right\r\n\nto  conclude  that  the  policy  allowed  Colasanto  to  use  the\r\n\nconversion application as a vehicle to bring about  the ownership\r\n\narrangement that he preferred.  On that basis, the designation of\r\n\nownership contained  in the  application complied  literally with\r\n\nthe terms of the policy.\r\n\n                                B\r                                          B\r\n\n          The appellant  advances a second  theory that  involves\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nsubstantial compliance.  He  asserts that, under Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n56(d),5 the  district court's  order denying his  pretrial motion\r\n\nfor summary judgment  precluded presentation  of the  substantial\r\n\ncompliance issue at trial.  The court's order stated:\r\n\n          Although  there does  not  appear to  be  any\r                                                                 \r\n          dispute  that Robert  M. Colasanto  failed to\r                                                                 \r\n          execute and deliver  the documents  necessary\r                                                                 \r\n          to  transfer  ownership  of  the   policy  in\r                                                                 \r\n          question   to  Stephen  Farley,  there  is  a\r                                                  \r\n          genuine  issue  of  fact   regarding  whether\r\n          Robert Colasanto ever agreed to  make Stephen\r\n          Farley  an   irrevocable  beneficiary  and/or\r\n          owner  of such  policy  and whether  adequate\r\n          consideration   was   given   for  any   such\r\n          agreement.\r\n\n(Emphasis supplied).\r\n\n          The  appellant interprets  the underscored  language as\r\n\nestablishing   as  a  matter  of   law  that  Colasanto  had  not\r\n\nsubstantially complied  with  the requirements  for  transferring\r\n\nownership of the policy to Farley.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5The rule provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n          If on motion under  this rule judgment is not\r\n          rendered upon  the whole case or  for all the\r\n          relief asked  and a  trial is  necessary, the\r\n          court  at  the  hearing  of  the  motion,  by\r\n          examining  the  pleadings  and  the  evidence\r\n          before it and by interrogating counsel, shall\r\n          if practicable ascertain what  material facts\r\n          exist  without  substantial  controversy  and\r\n          what material facts are actually and  in good\r\n          faith  controverted.

P. 56(d).\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\n          The  appellant's  contention is  vulnerable  on several\r\n\ngrounds.    We  mention  two  of  them.    First,  the  issue  of\r\n\nsubstantial  compliance  is  a  red  herring,  as  LINA   is  not\r\n\nchallenging  Farley's status  and the  case turns,  in  the final\r\n\nanalysis, on Colasanto's discerned intent.  See supra Part II(A).\r                                                               \r\n\nSecond,   the   Rule  56(d)   approach   is   little  more   than\r\n\nstultification by tactical semantics.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          Although the  appellant is correct in  noting that Rule\r\n\n56(d) empowers a  court to specify  (and set to  one side)  facts\r\n\nthat are without  substantial controversy, the rule  nevertheless\r\n\n\"permits  the court  to retain  full power  to make  one complete\r\n\nadjudication  on all  aspects of  the case  when the  proper time\r\n\narrives.\"  10A Charles  Alan Wright et al., Federal  Practice and\r\n\nProcedure    2737 (2d  ed. 1983).   Here,  it is  disingenuous to\r\n\nsuggest that the court relinquished this power.  Fairly read, the\r\n\nunderscored language simply acknowledges  the lack of any dispute\r\n\nas to whether the  assignment form was executed and  delivered to\r\n\nLINA.  To say, as the appellant would have it, that the statement\r\n\ndecides  the compliance question as a matter of law would require\r\n\nus  both to torture the  district court's words  and overlook its\r\n\nmanifest intention.  We refuse to do so.\r\n\nIII.  THE BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION\r          III.  THE BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION\r\n\n          The  appellant's fallback  position  is  that, even  if\r\n\nColasanto transferred ownership of the policy to Farley, it still\r\n\nmust  be found as a matter of  law that Farley, as an individual,\r\n\nis  not entitled to the policy proceeds.  This reasoning rests on\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nline 10(c) of the conversion application, which solicits the full\r\n\nname of the beneficiary and the beneficiary's relationship to the\r\n\ninsured.  In response  Colasanto typed:  \"Stephen Farley         \r\n\nExecutor.\"    The  appellant posits  that  the  use  of the  word\r\n\n\"executor\"  in  this  context   designates  a  fiduciary  as  the\r\n\nbeneficiary and,  therefore, Colasanto's executor    not Farley  \r\n\nis entitled to the avails of the policy.\r\n\n          The principal  authority on which the  appellant relies\r\n\nis  Faircloth v. Northwestern Nat'l  Life Ins. Co.,  799 F. Supp.\r                                                            \r\n\n815 (S.D. Ohio 1992).  In Faircloth, the insured wrote \"Faircloth\r                                             \r\n\nJames H. Administrator\" on the line in the application that asked\r\n\nfor the name of the beneficiary.  The court ruled  as a matter of\r\n\nlaw that the policy  proceeds went to the named beneficiary to be\r\n\nadministered for  the benefit of the estate, and not to him as an\r\n\nindividual.   See id. at  817.  The  appellant reads Faircloth to\r                                                                        \r\n\nstand  for  the proposition  that whenever  a fiduciary  label is\r\n\nfound in close proximity to a beneficiary's name, the beneficiary\r\n\ndesignation must be construed as running to the actual fiduciary,\r\n\nnot  to the  individual  named.   If  Faircloth stands  for  this\r                                                         \r\n\nproposition    a matter on which we take no view   it contradicts\r\n\nbasic  tenets of  Massachusetts contract  interpretation,  and we\r\n\nmust therefore disregard it.\r\n\n          Massachusetts law holds that, if an ambiguity exists in\r\n\ncontract documents, its  ultimate resolution almost always  turns\r\n\non  the parties'  intent.   See Smart  v. Gillette  Co. Long-Term\r                                                                           \r\n\nDisability  Plan, 70 F.3d 173, 178 (1st Cir. 1995); Massachusetts\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nMun.

In such a situation, the intent of\r\n\nthe  contracting parties  is  a matter  to  be discerned  by  the\r\n\nfactfinder  from the circumstances  surrounding the ambiguity and\r\n\nfrom  such reasonable inferences as may be available.  See Smart,\r                                                                          \r\n\n70 F.3d at 178.\r\n\n          These rules  apply to  insurance documents in  the same\r\n\nway  as they apply in  other contractual settings.   See Falmouth\r                                                                           \r\n\nNat'l Bank v. Ticor Tile Ins.

For instance, two analogous\r\n\nMassachusetts cases indicate that,  when the insured, called upon\r\n\nby  the   insurer  to  designate   a  beneficiary  by   name  and\r\n\nrelationship,  complies  by  using  a descriptive  term  such  as\r\n\n\"wife,\"  it  is up  to the  factfinder  to determine  whether the\r\n\ninsured   meant  the   particular  person   named,  or,   in  the\r\n\nalternative,  a person fitting the description on the date of the\r\n\ninsured's death.   See,  e.g., Strachan v.  Prudential Life  Ins.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 321  Mass. 507,  509, 73  N.E.2d 840, 843  (1947); Brogi  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBrogi, 211 Mass. 512, 514, 98 N.E. 573, 573 (1912).6\r               \r\n\n          Of  course,  it  can  be argued  that  the  appellation\r\n\n\"executor\" is more \"legalistic\" than the term \"wife,\"  and merits\r\n\ndifferent treatment.   We agree that the beneficiary's burden may\r\n\nbe  heavier when a fiduciary  designation is in  play, but, here,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Interestingly,  both  cases   determined  that  the   named\r\nindividual  should  take,  though  neither of  them  was  legally\r\nmarried to  the insured at the  time of the latter's  death.

However,  merely inserting  the  word \"executor\"  in  a\r\n\nchange  of beneficiary  form  that requests  the policyholder  to\r\n\nstate  the  relationship  between  the  beneficiary  and  himself\r\n\npresents presumptively  a materially weaker case  for holding the\r\n\ngift to be taken in a fiduciary capacity than leaving property by\r\n\nwill to  a donee who  is a fiduciary and  is so described  in the\r\n\ndispositive clause.  See Slavik, 46 Ark. App. at 76.  In sum, the\r                                         \r\n\nnaked fact  that the beneficiary's relationship to the insured is\r\n\ndesignated  in  the  policy  documents  by a  legal  term  (e.g.,\r\n\n\"executor\") does not compel a finding of a fiduciary disposition;\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nthe  matter still  comes down  to a  question of  the declarant's\r\n\nintent.\r\n\n          Applying the principles  gleaned from  these cases,  we\r\n\ndescry  no  error  here.    It  is  plain  as  a  pikestaff  that\r\n\nColasanto's  use of the word \"executor\" in response to line 10(c)\r\n\ncreates an  ambiguity.  Given the suggestive spacing that appears\r\n\non  the  completed  form  and  the delicate  nature  of  Farley's\r\n\nrelationship  to Colasanto   a relationship that, in a homophobic\r\n\nsociety, he might wish to describe with some tact    the response\r\n\ncan  plausibly be  construed  as  using  the  word  in  a  purely\r\n\ndescriptive sense.  To  be sure, it can be argued  that Colasanto\r\n\nused the word  to indicate the legal status  of the beneficiary  \r\n\nbut  this possibility means no more than  that the word, taken in\r\n\ncontext, is ambiguous.  See Fashion House, Inc.  v. K mart Corp.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n892  F.2d  1076,  1083 (1st  Cir.  1989)  (\"Contract  language is\r\n\nusually  considered  ambiguous .  . .  where the  phraseology can\r\n\nsupport reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the\r\n\nwords  employed  and  obligations  undertaken.\").   Because  such\r\n\nambiguities must  be resolved according to  the insured's intent,\r\n\nit  follows  that  the  district court  properly  submitted  this\r\n\nquestion to the jury.\r\n\n          Taking the next step, the jury's finding that Colasanto\r\n\nintended the term \"executor\" to describe Farley as an individual,\r\n\nnot  as a fiduciary, is amply supported.   Since Farley was named\r\n\nas  the  executor of  Colasanto's  estate at  the  time Colasanto\r\n\ncompleted   the  conversion  application,   the  description  was\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\naccurate.  Here, moreover,  Colasanto originally had named Farley\r\n\nas the beneficiary of the  group life policy.  While it  is true,\r\n\nas  the appellant  suggests,  that a  term  such as  \"friend\"  or\r\n\n\"companion\"  might  have   described  Farley's  relationship   to\r\n\nColasanto  more fittingly, that  is the stuff  of jury arguments,\r\n\nnot of  appellate review    and  the jury had  a right  to assess\r\n\nColasanto's word choice with  knowledge that emotionally  charged\r\n\nphrases may have  been painful to contemplate because  a ten-year\r\n\nrelationship was on the rocks.  Finally, it is telling (or so the\r\n\njurors could have thought) that Colasanto never once referred  to\r\n\nFarley  as a  fiduciary or  in a  fiduciary status  in subsequent\r\n\ncorrespondence or conversations anent the policy.\r\n\n          We need not paint the lily.  On this scumbled record, a\r\n\nrational jury could have inferred    as this jury did    that the\r\n\nword  \"executor\"  was  meant  only  to  describe  the  particular\r\n\nindividual whom the insured  intended to name as  the beneficiary\r\n\nof the  policy, and not  to portend a  disposition to  Farley qua\r                                                                           \r\n\nfiduciary.\r\n\nIV.  THE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\r          IV.  THE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\r\n\n          The appellant  tells us that  the trial court  erred in\r\n\ndenying his motion for a new  trial.  Appellate review of  orders\r\n\nrefusing new trials is tightly circumscribed.  We ordinarily will\r\n\nnot disturb such a  ruling if a  reasonable basis exists for  the\r\n\njury's  verdict.   See Wagenmann,  829 F.2d  at 200-01.   Phrased\r                                          \r\n\nanother way, we will  not intervene unless we ascertain  that the\r\n\noutcome  is \"against the clear  weight of the  evidence such that\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nupholding the  verdict will result in a  miscarriage of justice.\"\r\n\nPutnam Resources v. Pateman,  958 F.2d 448, 459 (1st  Cir. 1992).\r                                     \r\n\nThis is not such a case.\r\n\n          We need not tarry.   The motion for a  new trial hinged\r\n\nlargely  on the two issues  previously discussed    the change of\r\n\nownership and the identity  of the beneficiary.  We  have already\r\n\nexplained that the jury had enough evidence on these questions to\r\n\nsupport a  verdict in Farley's  favor.   See supra Parts  II(A) &amp;\r                                                            \r\n\nIII.  We add here only that,  on both issues, the totality of the\r\n\nevidence does not suggest either that justice miscarried or  that\r\n\nthe  trial  court's  refusal   to  overturn  the  jury's  verdict\r\n\nconstituted an  abuse of discretion.   Consequently, the district\r\n\ncourt did not  err in  denying the appellant's  new trial  motion\r\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a).  See Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n37 F.3d 712, 717 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\nV.  THE EVIDENTIARY QUESTION\r          V.  THE EVIDENTIARY QUESTION\r\n\n          The appellant contends  that the trial court  blundered\r\n\nin refusing to admit into evidence portions of letters written by\r\n\nColasanto  to Farley  on  March  17,  1994  and  April  1,  1994,\r\n\nrespectively.  As a starting point, the appellant claims that the\r\n\nproffered statements were admissible  under Fed. R. Evid. 803(3).\r\n\nWe do not agree.\r\n\n          Evidence  Rule   803(3)   removes  from   the   hearsay\r\n\nprohibition statements that  exhibit a declarant's \"then-existing\r\n\nstate of mind.\"  But, this exception is not to  be construed as a\r\n\nsweeping  endorsement  of  all  state-of-mind evidence.    To  be\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nadmissible  under  this  exception, a  declaration,  among  other\r\n\nthings, must  \"mirror a state of mind, which, in light of all the\r\n\ncircumstances, including proximity in time,  is reasonably likely\r\n\nto have been the  same condition existing at the  material time.\"\r\n\n2 John  W. Strong, McCormick  on Evidence    274 (4th  ed. 1992).\r\n\nBecause disputes over  whether particular statements  come within\r\n\nthe state-of-mind exception are  fact-sensitive, the trial  court\r\n\nis  in the best  position to resolve  them.  As is  true of other\r\n\nrulings  admitting or  excluding  evidence,  appellate review  is\r\n\nsolely  for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Blinzler v. Marriott\r                                                                           \r\n\nInt'l., Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                      \r\n\n          Here,   the  appellant   argues   that  the   proffered\r\n\nstatements reflect  Colasanto's intent,  as early as  February of\r\n\n1994,  not to transfer the  converted policy to  Farley, and that\r\n\nthey therefore rebut Farley's claim that Colasanto had a donative\r\n\nintent.  The  district court excluded  the correspondence on  the\r\n\nground  that it did not relate to Colasanto's intent in February,\r\n\nbut only to his intent at or about the time he wrote the letters.\r\n\nWe detect no misuse of the court's wide discretion.\r\n\n          On Farley's  version of  the case, Colasanto  evinced a\r\n\ndonative intent vis- -vis the LINA policy in December of 1993, in\r\n\nJanuary 1994, and again in early February  of that year.  Between\r\n\nthe last of  these incidents and the first  of the letters (which\r\n\nbore a date of March 17,  1994), a bitter fight between the long-\r\n\ntime  companions  ensued.    That imbroglio,  for  all  practical\r\n\npurposes,  eradicated any  vestige  of an  amicable relationship.\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nAlthough  the  subsequent  letters  clearly  reflect  Colasanto's\r\n\nanimosity  toward   Farley  on  March  17   and  thereafter,  the\r\n\nsignificant  intervening events     the quarrel  and the  ensuing\r\n\nbreakup      could   reasonably   be  thought   to  disrupt   the\r\n\ncontemporaneity required by Evidence Rule  803(3).  Thus, we  are\r\n\nunable to find that  the district court abused its  discretion by\r\n\nexcluding the proffered state-of-mind evidence.\r\n\n          In  a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the appellant\r\n\nargues, in  the alternative, that  the evidence was  proper under\r\n\nFed.  R.  Evid.  804(b)(5).    That  catchall  rule  permits  the\r\n\nintroduction  of hearsay evidence,  not otherwise  admissible, as\r\n\nlong  as the  declarant  is unavailable,  the evidence  possesses\r\n\n\"circumstantial  guarantees  of trustworthiness,\"  and  the trial\r\n\ncourt finds that the evidence (i) is offered  to prove a material\r\n\nfacet, (ii) is more  probative on the point than  other available\r\n\nevidence, and (iii) the interests of justice will be served.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed.  R. Evid.  804(b)(5); see  also  United States  v. Panzardi-\r                                                                           \r\n\nLespier, 918  F.2d 313,  316 (1st  Cir. 1990).   A trial  court's\r                 \r\n\ndeterminations under  Evidence Rule 804(b)(5)  are reviewed under\r\n\nan abuse of discretion standard.  See Cook v. United  States, 904\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 107, 111 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          The preconditions for deployment  of Rule 804(b)(5) are\r\n\nformidable,  and  the  appellant  cannot  satisfy  them  in  this\r\n\ninstance.   For  example,  the  district  court  found  that  the\r\n\nstatements lacked satisfactory assurances of trustworthiness.  In\r\n\nlight  of  the  disputatious  course  of  events  that  had  been\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nunfolding for months, leading to the retention of counsel by both\r\n\nFarley  and Colasanto  and  then to  the  acrimonious quarrel  in\r\n\nCalifornia, we cannot fault  the district court's conclusion that\r\n\nthe statements were  suspect because litigation  was in the  wind\r\n\nwhen they were made.7\r\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r          VI.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go  no further.   For aught  that appears,  the\r\n\ncase was fairly tried and the lower court appropriately permitted\r\n\nthe jury's verdict to stand.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7To emphasize the  point, we  note that the  April 1  letter\r\nshows on its face that Colasanto contemporaneously sent a copy to\r\nhis attorney.\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n",

Upon close perscrutation of the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable law, we discern no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with a neutral account of the facts that were before the jury.  The decedent, Robert M. Colasanto, made his mark as a successful business executive.  In September of 1982, Colasanto met Stephen A. Farley.  A relationship developed and the two men began cohabiting in San Diego, California.  They lived initially in a rented dwelling and later in a luxurious home that Colasanto purchased.  During this time frame Colasanto founded a health-care organization, Community Care Network, Inc.  (CCN), which became hugely successful.  Colasanto enjoyed the fruits of his good fortune including, inter alia, a beneficial interest under a group life insurance policy owned by CCN and issued by Life Insurance Company of North America (LINA) which afforded him a $140,000 death benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colasanto's world changed in 1989 when a physician diagnosed him as HIV-positive.  By 1992, he had contracted AIDS.  Yearning for his native New England, he bought a home in Massachusetts.  Colasanto and Farley took up residence there in the spring of 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Colasanto's health deteriorated, so, too, his relationship with Farley.  The two men began discussing a property settlement in mid-1993.  Despite the assistance of retained counsel, they were unable to agree on terms.  According to Farley, however, the parties reached an informal agreement on or about December 3, 1993.  Under that accord, Colasanto was to transfer ownership of five life insurance policies (including the LINA group life policy) to Farley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, Colasanto completed and executed a form entitled \"Application for Conversion of Group or Employee Life Insurance\" (the conversion application) with the intention of converting his coverage under the group policy to an individual policy.  Line 10(c) of the conversion application bears the inscription \"Pay Death Benefit to,\" followed by three blank lines.  Underneath the first blank line these instructions appear:  \"Print Full Name of Beneficiary and State Relationship.\"   On the left-hand side of this line Colasanto typed \"Stephen A. Farley.\"   He left a blank space in the middle of the line and on the right-hand side he typed \"Executor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On the following two lines Colasanto added \"Issue policy with Mr. Farley as owner.  See enclosed letter.\"   The letter, signed by Colasanto, bore a caption indicating that it was being transmitted \"RE:  CONVERSION OF GROUP COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE--SPECIFICATION OF OWNER OF INDIVIDUAL POLICY WHICH IS ISSUED.\"   The body of the letter made explicit reference to the conversion application and stated in relevant part:Please note that I am requesting that the individual policy be issued such that the owner is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Stephen A. Farley</p>\n    <p>10448 Russel Road</p>\n    <p>La Mesa, CA 91941 D.O.B. 2-21-49</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Farley is currently the beneficiary of the group coverage.  If he needs to fill out another beneficiary form, please send it to him since that will be his right as the policy owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premium statement(s) should be sent to Mr. Farley at the above address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colasanto transmitted the conversion application and letter to LINA.  He sent forms and letters to four other life insurers on the same date.  Each letter instructed the carrier to transfer ownership of the affected policy to Farley.  In each of the five instances Colasanto contemporaneously furnished Farley with signed copies of the conversion application or assignment form, the cover letter, and a certified mail return receipt request in Colasanto's handwriting asking that the receipt be forwarded to Farley.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Farley returned to California on December 22.  On January 19, 1994, Colasanto sent a premium payment to LINA on the policy in question and accompanied it with a letter reiterating \"that the individual policy should be issued to Stephen A. Farley as owner.\"   Colasanto added:  \"If a separate form is required to change owner, then please send the form.  Future premium statements should be sent to Mr. Farley as owner.\"   LINA sent the individual policy to Colasanto in early February together with a letter admonishing that if Colasanto wished to designate Farley as owner, he should execute an assignment form and return it to LINA.  Despite the fact that LINA enclosed a blank form with this letter, Colasanto never signed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, Farley returned to Massachusetts.  A reconciliation ensued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Colasanto returned to California with Farley, only to return to Massachusetts alone following a bitter quarrel that took place on March 7, 1994.  The next month Colasanto executed a change-of-beneficiary form in which he purported to designate one of his brothers, Valentino T. Colasanto, in his capacity as Trustee of the Robert M. Colasanto Revocable Trust, as the beneficiary of the LINA policy.  Colasanto died on June 17, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Farley and the Trustee laid claim to the policy proceeds.  The Trustee won the race to the courthouse steps and filed suit against LINA in a Rhode Island state court.  LINA removed the case to federal district court, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441, citing the existence of original jurisdiction arising out of both diversity and interpleader, see 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1332(a), 1335, impleaded Farley, and deposited the face value of the policy ($140,000) into the registry of the district court.  See generally Fed.R.Civ.P. 22 (discussing mechanics of interpleader actions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LINA's departure from the fray left Farley and the Trustee locked in mortal combat.  After considerable skirmishing, the case was tried and the jury returned a verdict in Farley's favor.  The district court thereafter denied the Trustee's motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) (judgment as a matter of law) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a) (new trial).  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trustee presses several points in support of his position.  We have considered them all, but address in this opinion only those contentions that have arguable merit and that are necessary to a resolution of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. OWNERSHIP OF THE POLICY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's flagship claim is that no reasonable juror could conclude that Colasanto transferred ownership of the subject policy to Farley, and the lower court therefore should have granted the motion for judgment as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The standard of review referable to a trial court's refusal to order judgment as a matter of law is set in cement.  The court of appeals undertakes plenary review, see Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1994), and \"examine[s] the evidence and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,\" Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987).  In so doing the court \"may not consider credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Id.  Overriding a jury verdict is warranted only if the evidence \"is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\"  Gibson, 37 F.3d at 735.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The gist of the Trustee's argument is that Colasanto, although taking an initial step to transfer ownership of the policy to Farley, never effectuated that change according to the terms of the policy.  Thus, no reasonable jury could find that Colasanto substantially complied with the explicit policy requirements necessary to anoint Farley as the owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument misses the mark.  It is predicated on the common law doctrine of substantial compliance.  The parties agree that the substantive law of Massachusetts governs this controversy, and, according to the appellant, the Massachusetts cases suggest that, if a policy specifies the manner in which transfers are to be made, the failure of literal compliance with the policy requirements will be excused only if the insured did everything that he could do to comply with those provisions.  See, e.g., Acacia Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Feinberg, 318 Mass. 246, 250, 61 N.E.2d 122, 124 (1945) (stating that \"it is of the essence of substantial compliance that the insured must have done all in his power to effect the change, leaving only some ministerial act on the part of the insurer necessary to consummate it\");  Resnek v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 286 Mass. 305, 309, 190 N.E. 603, 604-05 (1934) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Building on this base, the appellant points to a provision in the LINA policy that states:  \"Changes [of ownership or beneficiary] must be requested in writing on a form satisfactory to us and sent to our Administrative Office.\"   Because this condition could have been, but was not, met--after all, the carrier sent Colasanto a blank assignment form, and he easily could have completed it and mailed it back--the appellant insists that there was no substantial compliance, and, hence, that the attempted change of ownership was ineffectual.  See id. at 309-10, 190 N.E. 603 (indicating that if the insured is put on notice that he has not done all in his power to comply with the requirements for changing a beneficiary, as by the insurer's rejection of an improperly completed form, and the insured does not take the suggested remedial action, there is no substantial compliance).  Even though Colasanto explicitly designated Farley as owner on the conversion application, reaffirmed that designation in the cover letter, and wrote a subsequent epistle reiterating that Farley owned the policy, the appellant asseverates that Farley's claim of ownership fails because Colasanto never transmitted the assignment form to LINA.  The appellant then tries to hoist this asseveration by its bootstraps, noting that LINA never recognized a transfer of policy ownership to Farley, instead sending the policy to Colasanto and accepting the change-of-beneficiary form that he subsequently submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two visible flaws in the fabric of the appellant's thesis.  In the first place, we do not think that the doctrine of substantial compliance applies to this case.  It is generally held in Massachusetts that the provisions of an insurance policy which stipulate what formalities must attend an assignment are for the benefit of the insurer, not for the benefit of others.  See Abbruzise v. Sposata, 306 Mass. 151, 153-54, 27 N.E.2d 722, 723-24 (1940);  Goldman v. Moses, 287 Mass. 393, 397, 191 N.E. 873, 874 (1934).  When, as now, the insurer is no longer a combatant, and the dispute over the validity of a transfer is limited to the assignor and the assignee (or those claiming under them), the assignor is precluded from relying mechanically on the formalities built into the policy to defeat the transfer.  See Abbruzise, 306 Mass. at 153-54, 27 N.E.2d 722;  Goldman, 287 Mass. at 397, 191 N.E. 873;  Herman v. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co., 218 Mass. 181, 185, 105 N.E. 450, 451 (1914);  Merrill v. New Eng.  Mut. Life Ins. Co., 103 Mass. 245, 252 (1869).  In other words, the assignment, though not in compliance with the policy, nonetheless may be binding as between the assignor and assignee as long as the evidence of the act and the intent is sufficient to confirm the assignment's validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second flaw in the appellant's thesis is that, even if the substantial compliance doctrine retains some relevance in a contest over life insurance proceeds between parties other than the insurer, an argument premised on substantial compliance in this case overlooks the obvious.  If an insurance policy regulates the form of an assignment and the insured complies literally with those terms, the assignment is valid, and the question of substantial compliance is immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the policy provides not one, but two, means of changing the ownership.  It stipulates:  \"The Owner ('you,' 'your') is the Insured unless otherwise designated in the application or unless changed as provided under the Change of Ownership or Beneficiary provision [i.e., by use of an assignment form].\"  (Emphasis supplied).  The jacket of the policy reiterates this duality:  \"The Owner ('you,' 'your') is the insured unless another person is named in the application or later becomes the Owner as allowed by the policy.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  Thus, while Colasanto could have effected the desired change of ownership by returning the assignment form to LINA as instructed, we see no reason why he could not also have done so in the application.   Since the policy appears explicitly to have given the policyholder that option, we think that a reasonable jury could have decided the point on the basis that Colasanto had chosen this manner of switching the policy's ownership and that the resultant designation was valid and binding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A group policy and an individual policy that is spun off from it ordinarily are deemed a single, continuing contract of insurance.  See Binkley v. Manufacturers Life Ins. Co., 471 F.2d 889, 891 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 877, 94 S.Ct. 130, 38 L.Ed.2d 122 (1973);  Brindis v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 29 Mass.App.Ct. 368, 369-70, 560 N.E.2d 722, 723 (1990).  Until Colasanto retired, his employer owned the group policy.  There was no individual policy (and, hence, no individual owner) until Colasanto exercised his right of conversion.  In all probability, then, the conversion application is an application within the purview of the quoted policy language--we hesitate only because LINA is not a party here, and it cannot be heard on the topic in this proceeding--and in any event, the appellant concedes that it is such.  He maintains, however, that the application could not be used to dictate ownership because there was no line or place on it to spell out the nature of the change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument.  An insurance company cannot confer a prerogative upon the insured in the policy covenants and then surreptitiously take it away by omitting any reference to it on the forms that the company prints to implement the covenants.  Here, the policy told Colasanto that he could designate the owner of a converted policy by naming that individual in the application, and he did so.  At the very least, a reasonable jury, faced with this concatenation of circumstances, had a right to conclude that the policy allowed Colasanto to use the conversion application as a vehicle to bring about the ownership arrangement that he preferred.  On that basis, the designation of ownership contained in the application complied literally with the terms of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant advances a second theory that involves substantial compliance.  He asserts that, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the district court's order denying his pretrial motion for summary judgment precluded presentation of the substantial compliance issue at trial.  The court's order stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Although there does not appear to be any dispute that Robert M. Colasanto failed to execute and deliver the documents necessary to transfer ownership of the policy in question to Stephen Farley, there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Robert Colasanto ever agreed to make Stephen Farley an irrevocable beneficiary and/or owner of such policy and whether adequate consideration was given for any such agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant interprets the underscored language as establishing as a matter of law that Colasanto had not substantially complied with the requirements for transferring ownership of the policy to Farley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's contention is vulnerable on several grounds.  We mention two of them.  First, the issue of substantial compliance is a red herring, as LINA is not challenging Farley's status and the case turns, in the final analysis, on Colasanto's discerned intent.  See supra Part II(A).  Second, the Rule 56(d) approach is little more than stultification by tactical semantics.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellant is correct in noting that Rule 56(d) empowers a court to specify (and set to one side) facts that are without substantial controversy, the rule nevertheless \"permits the court to retain full power to make one complete adjudication on all aspects of the case when the proper time arrives.\"   10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2737 (2d ed. 1983).  Here, it is disingenuous to suggest that the court relinquished this power.  Fairly read, the underscored language simply acknowledges the lack of any dispute as to whether the assignment form was executed and delivered to LINA.  To say, as the appellant would have it, that the statement decides the compliance question as a matter of law would require us both to torture the district court's words and overlook its manifest intention.  We refuse to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback position is that, even if Colasanto transferred ownership of the policy to Farley, it still must be found as a matter of law that Farley, as an individual, is not entitled to the policy proceeds.  This reasoning rests on line 10(c) of the conversion application, which solicits the full name of the beneficiary and the beneficiary's relationship to the insured.  In response Colasanto typed:  \"Stephen Farley Executor.\"   The appellant posits that the use of the word \"executor\" in this context designates a fiduciary as the beneficiary and, therefore, Colasanto's executor--not Farley--is entitled to the avails of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal authority on which the appellant relies is Faircloth v. Northwestern Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 799 F.Supp. 815 (S.D.Ohio 1992).  In Faircloth, the insured wrote \"Faircloth James H. Administrator\" on the line in the application that asked for the name of the beneficiary.  The court ruled as a matter of law that the policy proceeds went to the named beneficiary to be administered for the benefit of the estate, and not to him as an individual.  See id. at 817.   The appellant reads Faircloth to stand for the proposition that whenever a fiduciary label is found in close proximity to a beneficiary's name, the beneficiary designation must be construed as running to the actual fiduciary, not to the individual named.  If Faircloth stands for this proposition--a matter on which we take no view--it contradicts basic tenets of Massachusetts contract interpretation, and we must therefore disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law holds that, if an ambiguity exists in contract documents, its ultimate resolution almost always turns on the parties' intent.  See Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability Plan, 70 F.3d 173, 178 (1st Cir.1995);  Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Town of Danvers, 411 Mass. 39, 45, 577 N.E.2d 283, 288 (1991).  In such a situation, the intent of the contracting parties is a matter to be discerned by the factfinder from the circumstances surrounding the ambiguity and from such reasonable inferences as may be available.  See Smart, 70 F.3d at 178.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rules apply to insurance documents in the same way as they apply in other contractual settings.  See Falmouth Nat'l Bank v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 920 F.2d 1058, 1061 (1st Cir.1990) (applying Massachusetts law).  For instance, two analogous Massachusetts cases indicate that, when the insured, called upon by the insurer to designate a beneficiary by name and relationship, complies by using a descriptive term such as \"wife,\" it is up to the factfinder to determine whether the insured meant the particular person named, or, in the alternative, a person fitting the description on the date of the insured's death.  See, e.g., Strachan v. Prudential Ins. Co., 321 Mass. 507, 509, 73 N.E.2d 840, 843 (1947);  Brogi v. Brogi, 211 Mass. 512, 514, 98 N.E. 573, 573 (1912).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, it can be argued that the appellation \"executor\" is more \"legalistic\" than the term \"wife,\" and merits different treatment.  We agree that the beneficiary's burden may be heavier when a fiduciary designation is in play, but, here, the end result is the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, courts construe beneficiary designations made in connection with insurance policies according to the rules applicable to the construction of wills.  See 5 George J. Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law &#167; 28:7 (2d ed. 1984).  \"The cardinal rule in the interpretation of a will is the ascertainment of the testator's intent from an examination of the language employed by him construed in the light of the circumstances known to him at the time he executed the will, and his intent, when determined, must be given effect unless contrary to some rule of law.\"  Magill v. Magill, 317 Mass. 89, 92, 56 N.E.2d 892, 894 (1944).  Thus, a testamentary gift will vest in a beneficiary qua fiduciary absent a plain manifestation of the testator's intent to accomplish a different result.  See Slavik v. Estate of Slavik, 46 Ark.App. 74, 76, 880 S.W.2d 524, 526 (1994) (en banc);  Baker v. Wright, 257 Ala. 697, 703, 60 So.2d 825, 830 (1952).  However, merely inserting the word \"executor\" in a change of beneficiary form that requests the policyholder to state the relationship between the beneficiary and himself presents presumptively a materially weaker case for holding the gift to be taken in a fiduciary capacity than leaving property by will to a donee who is a fiduciary and is so described in the dispositive clause.  See Slavik, 46 Ark.App. at 76, 880 S.W.2d 524.   In sum, the naked fact that the beneficiary's relationship to the insured is designated in the policy documents by a legal term (e.g., \"executor\") does not compel a finding of a fiduciary disposition;  the matter still comes down to a question of the declarant's intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the principles gleaned from these cases, we descry no error here.  It is plain as a pikestaff that Colasanto's use of the word \"executor\" in response to line 10(c) creates an ambiguity.  Given the suggestive spacing that appears on the completed form and the delicate nature of Farley's relationship to Colasanto--a relationship that, in a homophobic society, he might wish to describe with some tact--the response can plausibly be construed as using the word in a purely descriptive sense.  To be sure, it can be argued that Colasanto used the word to indicate the legal status of the beneficiary--but this possibility means no more than that the word, taken in context, is ambiguous.  See Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir.1989) (\"Contract language is usually considered ambiguous ... where the phraseology can support reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.\").  Because such ambiguities must be resolved according to the insured's intent, it follows that the district court properly submitted this question to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the next step, the jury's finding that Colasanto intended the term \"executor\" to describe Farley as an individual, not as a fiduciary, is amply supported.  Since Farley was named as the executor of Colasanto's estate at the time Colasanto completed the conversion application, the description was accurate.  Here, moreover, Colasanto originally had named Farley as the beneficiary of the group life policy.  While it is true, as the appellant suggests, that a term such as \"friend\" or \"companion\" might have described Farley's relationship to Colasanto more fittingly, that is the stuff of jury arguments, not of appellate review--and the jury had a right to assess Colasanto's word choice with knowledge that emotionally charged phrases may have been painful to contemplate because a ten-year relationship was on the rocks.  Finally, it is telling (or so the jurors could have thought) that Colasanto never once referred to Farley as a fiduciary or in a fiduciary status in subsequent correspondence or conversations anent the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not paint the lily.  On this scumbled record, a rational jury could have inferred--as this jury did--that the word \"executor\" was meant only to describe the particular individual whom the insured intended to name as the beneficiary of the policy, and not to portend a disposition to Farley qua fiduciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tells us that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial.  Appellate review of orders refusing new trials is tightly circumscribed.  We ordinarily will not disturb such a ruling if a reasonable basis exists for the jury's verdict.  See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200-01.   Phrased another way, we will not intervene unless we ascertain that the outcome is \"against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.\"  Putnam Resources v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 459 (1st Cir.1992).  This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.  The motion for a new trial hinged largely on the two issues previously discussed--the change of ownership and the identity of the beneficiary.  We have already explained that the jury had enough evidence on these questions to support a verdict in Farley's favor.  See supra Parts II(A) &amp; III.  We add here only that, on both issues, the totality of the evidence does not suggest either that justice miscarried or that the trial court's refusal to overturn the jury's verdict constituted an abuse of discretion.  Consequently, the district court did not err in denying the appellant's new trial motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a).  See Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 717 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE EVIDENTIARY QUESTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that the trial court blundered in refusing to admit into evidence portions of letters written by Colasanto to Farley on March 17, 1994 and April 1, 1994, respectively.  As a starting point, the appellant claims that the proffered statements were admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 803(3).  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence Rule 803(3) removes from the hearsay prohibition statements that exhibit a declarant's \"then-existing state of mind.\"   But, this exception is not to be construed as a sweeping endorsement of all state-of-mind evidence.  To be admissible under this exception, a declaration, among other things, must \"mirror a state of mind, which, in light of all the circumstances, including proximity in time, is reasonably likely to have been the same condition existing at the material time.\"   2 John W. Strong, McCormick on Evidence &#167; 274 (4th ed. 1992).  Because disputes over whether particular statements come within the state-of-mind exception are fact-sensitive, the trial court is in the best position to resolve them.  As is true of other rulings admitting or excluding evidence, appellate review is solely for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l., Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellant argues that the proffered statements reflect Colasanto's intent, as early as February of 1994, not to transfer the converted policy to Farley, and that they therefore rebut Farley's claim that Colasanto had a donative intent.  The district court excluded the correspondence on the ground that it did not relate to Colasanto's intent in February, but only to his intent at or about the time he wrote the letters.  We detect no misuse of the court's wide discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Farley's version of the case, Colasanto evinced a donative intent vis-a-vis the LINA policy in December of 1993, in January 1994, and again in early February of that year.  Between the last of these incidents and the first of the letters (which bore a date of March 17, 1994), a bitter fight between the long-time companions ensued.  That imbroglio, for all practical purposes, eradicated any vestige of an amicable relationship.  Although the subsequent letters clearly reflect Colasanto's animosity toward Farley on March 17 and thereafter, the significant intervening events--the quarrel and the ensuing breakup--could reasonably be thought to disrupt the contemporaneity required by Evidence Rule 803(3).  Thus, we are unable to find that the district court abused its discretion by excluding the proffered state-of-mind evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the appellant argues, in the alternative, that the evidence was proper under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5).  That catchall rule permits the introduction of hearsay evidence, not otherwise admissible, as long as the declarant is unavailable, the evidence possesses \"circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,\" and the trial court finds that the evidence (i) is offered to prove a material facet, (ii) is more probative on the point than other available evidence, and (iii) the interests of justice will be served.  See Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5);  see also United States v. Panzardi-Lespier, 918 F.2d 313, 316 (1st Cir.1990).  A trial court's determinations under Evidence Rule 804(b)(5) are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  See Cook v. United States, 904 F.2d 107, 111 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preconditions for deployment of Rule 804(b)(5) are formidable, and the appellant cannot satisfy them in this instance.  For example, the district court found that the statements lacked satisfactory assurances of trustworthiness.  In light of the disputatious course of events that had been unfolding for months, leading to the retention of counsel by both Farley and Colasanto and then to the acrimonious quarrel in California, we cannot fault the district court's conclusion that the statements were suspect because litigation was in the wind when they were made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For aught that appears, the case was fairly tried and the lower court appropriately permitted the jury's verdict to stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties agree that on December 10, 1993, Colasanto's will nominated Farley as his executor.

Upon close perscrutation of the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable law, we discern no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with a neutral account of the facts that were before the jury.  The decedent, Robert M. Colasanto, made his mark as a successful business executive.  In September of 1982, Colasanto met Stephen A. Farley.  A relationship developed and the two men began cohabiting in San Diego, California.  They lived initially in a rented dwelling and later in a luxurious home that Colasanto purchased.  During this time frame Colasanto founded a health-care organization, Community Care Network, Inc.  (CCN), which became hugely successful.  Colasanto enjoyed the fruits of his good fortune including, inter alia, a beneficial interest under a group life insurance policy owned by CCN and issued by Life Insurance Company of North America (LINA) which afforded him a $140,000 death benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colasanto's world changed in 1989 when a physician diagnosed him as HIV-positive.  By 1992, he had contracted AIDS.  Yearning for his native New England, he bought a home in Massachusetts.  Colasanto and Farley took up residence there in the spring of 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Colasanto's health deteriorated, so, too, his relationship with Farley.  The two men began discussing a property settlement in mid-1993.  Despite the assistance of retained counsel, they were unable to agree on terms.  According to Farley, however, the parties reached an informal agreement on or about December 3, 1993.  Under that accord, Colasanto was to transfer ownership of five life insurance policies (including the LINA group life policy) to Farley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, Colasanto completed and executed a form entitled \"Application for Conversion of Group or Employee Life Insurance\" (the conversion application) with the intention of converting his coverage under the group policy to an individual policy.  Line 10(c) of the conversion application bears the inscription \"Pay Death Benefit to,\" followed by three blank lines.  Underneath the first blank line these instructions appear:  \"Print Full Name of Beneficiary and State Relationship.\"   On the left-hand side of this line Colasanto typed \"Stephen A. Farley.\"   He left a blank space in the middle of the line and on the right-hand side he typed \"Executor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On the following two lines Colasanto added \"Issue policy with Mr. Farley as owner.  See enclosed letter.\"   The letter, signed by Colasanto, bore a caption indicating that it was being transmitted \"RE:  CONVERSION OF GROUP COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE--SPECIFICATION OF OWNER OF INDIVIDUAL POLICY WHICH IS ISSUED.\"   The body of the letter made explicit reference to the conversion application and stated in relevant part:Please note that I am requesting that the individual policy be issued such that the owner is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Stephen A. Farley</p>\n    <p>10448 Russel Road</p>\n    <p>La Mesa, CA 91941 D.O.B. 2-21-49</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Farley is currently the beneficiary of the group coverage.  If he needs to fill out another beneficiary form, please send it to him since that will be his right as the policy owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premium statement(s) should be sent to Mr. Farley at the above address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colasanto transmitted the conversion application and letter to LINA.  He sent forms and letters to four other life insurers on the same date.  Each letter instructed the carrier to transfer ownership of the affected policy to Farley.  In each of the five instances Colasanto contemporaneously furnished Farley with signed copies of the conversion application or assignment form, the cover letter, and a certified mail return receipt request in Colasanto's handwriting asking that the receipt be forwarded to Farley.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Farley returned to California on December 22.  On January 19, 1994, Colasanto sent a premium payment to LINA on the policy in question and accompanied it with a letter reiterating \"that the individual policy should be issued to Stephen A. Farley as owner.\"   Colasanto added:  \"If a separate form is required to change owner, then please send the form.  Future premium statements should be sent to Mr. Farley as owner.\"   LINA sent the individual policy to Colasanto in early February together with a letter admonishing that if Colasanto wished to designate Farley as owner, he should execute an assignment form and return it to LINA.  Despite the fact that LINA enclosed a blank form with this letter, Colasanto never signed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, Farley returned to Massachusetts.  A reconciliation ensued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Colasanto returned to California with Farley, only to return to Massachusetts alone following a bitter quarrel that took place on March 7, 1994.  The next month Colasanto executed a change-of-beneficiary form in which he purported to designate one of his brothers, Valentino T. Colasanto, in his capacity as Trustee of the Robert M. Colasanto Revocable Trust, as the beneficiary of the LINA policy.  Colasanto died on June 17, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Farley and the Trustee laid claim to the policy proceeds.  The Trustee won the race to the courthouse steps and filed suit against LINA in a Rhode Island state court.  LINA removed the case to federal district court, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441, citing the existence of original jurisdiction arising out of both diversity and interpleader, see 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1332(a), 1335, impleaded Farley, and deposited the face value of the policy ($140,000) into the registry of the district court.  See generally Fed.R.Civ.P. 22 (discussing mechanics of interpleader actions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LINA's departure from the fray left Farley and the Trustee locked in mortal combat.  After considerable skirmishing, the case was tried and the jury returned a verdict in Farley's favor.  The district court thereafter denied the Trustee's motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) (judgment as a matter of law) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a) (new trial).  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trustee presses several points in support of his position.  We have considered them all, but address in this opinion only those contentions that have arguable merit and that are necessary to a resolution of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. OWNERSHIP OF THE POLICY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's flagship claim is that no reasonable juror could conclude that Colasanto transferred ownership of the subject policy to Farley, and the lower court therefore should have granted the motion for judgment as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The standard of review referable to a trial court's refusal to order judgment as a matter of law is set in cement.  The court of appeals undertakes plenary review, see Gibson v. City of Cranston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195652\"><a href=\"/opinion/195652/gibson-v-city-of-cranston/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 735 (1st Cir.1994), and \"examine[s] the evidence and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,\" Wagenmann v. Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 200 (1st Cir.1987).  In so doing the court \"may not consider credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Id.  Overriding a jury verdict is warranted only if the evidence \"is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\"  Gibson, 37 F.3d at 735.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The gist of the Trustee's argument is that Colasanto, although taking an initial step to transfer ownership of the policy to Farley, never effectuated that change according to the terms of the policy.  Thus, no reasonable jury could find that Colasanto substantially complied with the explicit policy requirements necessary to anoint Farley as the owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument misses the mark.  It is predicated on the common law doctrine of substantial compliance.  The parties agree that the substantive law of Massachusetts governs this controversy, and, according to the appellant, the Massachusetts cases suggest that, if a policy specifies the manner in which transfers are to be made, the failure of literal compliance with the policy requirements will be excused only if the insured did everything that he could do to comply with those provisions.  See, e.g., Acacia Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Feinberg, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></span>, 250, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></span>, 124 (1945) (stating that \"it is of the essence of substantial compliance that the insured must have done all in his power to effect the change, leaving only some ministerial act on the part of the insurer necessary to consummate it\");  Resnek v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span>, 309, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></span>, 604-05 (1934) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Building on this base, the appellant points to a provision in the LINA policy that states:  \"Changes [of ownership or beneficiary] must be requested in writing on a form satisfactory to us and sent to our Administrative Office.\"   Because this condition could have been, but was not, met--after all, the carrier sent Colasanto a blank assignment form, and he easily could have completed it and mailed it back--the appellant insists that there was no substantial compliance, and, hence, that the attempted change of ownership was ineffectual.  See id. at 309-10, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></span> (indicating that if the insured is put on notice that he has not done all in his power to comply with the requirements for changing a beneficiary, as by the insurer's rejection of an improperly completed form, and the insured does not take the suggested remedial action, there is no substantial compliance).  Even though Colasanto explicitly designated Farley as owner on the conversion application, reaffirmed that designation in the cover letter, and wrote a subsequent epistle reiterating that Farley owned the policy, the appellant asseverates that Farley's claim of ownership fails because Colasanto never transmitted the assignment form to LINA.  The appellant then tries to hoist this asseveration by its bootstraps, noting that LINA never recognized a transfer of policy ownership to Farley, instead sending the policy to Colasanto and accepting the change-of-beneficiary form that he subsequently submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two visible flaws in the fabric of the appellant's thesis.  In the first place, we do not think that the doctrine of substantial compliance applies to this case.  It is generally held in Massachusetts that the provisions of an insurance policy which stipulate what formalities must attend an assignment are for the benefit of the insurer, not for the benefit of others.  See Abbruzise v. Sposata, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></span>, 153-54, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></span>, 723-24 (1940);  Goldman v. Moses, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span>, 397, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></span>, 874 (1934).  When, as now, the insurer is no longer a combatant, and the dispute over the validity of a transfer is limited to the assignor and the assignee (or those claiming under them), the assignor is precluded from relying mechanically on the formalities built into the policy to defeat the transfer.  See Abbruzise, 306 Mass. at 153-54, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></span>;  Goldman, 287 Mass. at 397, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></span>;  Herman v. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span>, 185, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></span>, 451 (1914);  Merrill v. New Eng.  Mut. Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span>, 252 (1869).  In other words, the assignment, though not in compliance with the policy, nonetheless may be binding as between the assignor and assignee as long as the evidence of the act and the intent is sufficient to confirm the assignment's validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second flaw in the appellant's thesis is that, even if the substantial compliance doctrine retains some relevance in a contest over life insurance proceeds between parties other than the insurer, an argument premised on substantial compliance in this case overlooks the obvious.  If an insurance policy regulates the form of an assignment and the insured complies literally with those terms, the assignment is valid, and the question of substantial compliance is immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the policy provides not one, but two, means of changing the ownership.  It stipulates:  \"The Owner ('you,' 'your') is the Insured unless otherwise designated in the application or unless changed as provided under the Change of Ownership or Beneficiary provision [i.e., by use of an assignment form].\"  (Emphasis supplied).  The jacket of the policy reiterates this duality:  \"The Owner ('you,' 'your') is the insured unless another person is named in the application or later becomes the Owner as allowed by the policy.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  Thus, while Colasanto could have effected the desired change of ownership by returning the assignment form to LINA as instructed, we see no reason why he could not also have done so in the application.   Since the policy appears explicitly to have given the policyholder that option, we think that a reasonable jury could have decided the point on the basis that Colasanto had chosen this manner of switching the policy's ownership and that the resultant designation was valid and binding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A group policy and an individual policy that is spun off from it ordinarily are deemed a single, continuing contract of insurance.  See Binkley v. Manufacturers Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"307709\"><a href=\"/opinion/307709/joyce-i-binkley-v-manufacturers-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span>, 891 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Until Colasanto retired, his employer owned the group policy.  There was no individual policy (and, hence, no individual owner) until Colasanto exercised his right of conversion.  In all probability, then, the conversion application is an application within the purview of the quoted policy language--we hesitate only because LINA is not a party here, and it cannot be heard on the topic in this proceeding--and in any event, the appellant concedes that it is such.  He maintains, however, that the application could not be used to dictate ownership because there was no line or place on it to spell out the nature of the change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument.  An insurance company cannot confer a prerogative upon the insured in the policy covenants and then surreptitiously take it away by omitting any reference to it on the forms that the company prints to implement the covenants.  Here, the policy told Colasanto that he could designate the owner of a converted policy by naming that individual in the application, and he did so.  At the very least, a reasonable jury, faced with this concatenation of circumstances, had a right to conclude that the policy allowed Colasanto to use the conversion application as a vehicle to bring about the ownership arrangement that he preferred.  On that basis, the designation of ownership contained in the application complied literally with the terms of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant advances a second theory that involves substantial compliance.  He asserts that, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the district court's order denying his pretrial motion for summary judgment precluded presentation of the substantial compliance issue at trial.  The court's order stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Although there does not appear to be any dispute that Robert M. Colasanto failed to execute and deliver the documents necessary to transfer ownership of the policy in question to Stephen Farley, there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Robert Colasanto ever agreed to make Stephen Farley an irrevocable beneficiary and/or owner of such policy and whether adequate consideration was given for any such agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant interprets the underscored language as establishing as a matter of law that Colasanto had not substantially complied with the requirements for transferring ownership of the policy to Farley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's contention is vulnerable on several grounds.  We mention two of them.  First, the issue of substantial compliance is a red herring, as LINA is not challenging Farley's status and the case turns, in the final analysis, on Colasanto's discerned intent.  See supra Part II(A).  Second, the Rule 56(d) approach is little more than stultification by tactical semantics.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellant is correct in noting that Rule 56(d) empowers a court to specify (and set to one side) facts that are without substantial controversy, the rule nevertheless \"permits the court to retain full power to make one complete adjudication on all aspects of the case when the proper time arrives.\"   10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2737 (2d ed. 1983).  Here, it is disingenuous to suggest that the court relinquished this power.  Fairly read, the underscored language simply acknowledges the lack of any dispute as to whether the assignment form was executed and delivered to LINA.  To say, as the appellant would have it, that the statement decides the compliance question as a matter of law would require us both to torture the district court's words and overlook its manifest intention.  We refuse to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback position is that, even if Colasanto transferred ownership of the policy to Farley, it still must be found as a matter of law that Farley, as an individual, is not entitled to the policy proceeds.  This reasoning rests on line 10(c) of the conversion application, which solicits the full name of the beneficiary and the beneficiary's relationship to the insured.  In response Colasanto typed:  \"Stephen Farley Executor.\"   The appellant posits that the use of the word \"executor\" in this context designates a fiduciary as the beneficiary and, therefore, Colasanto's executor--not Farley--is entitled to the avails of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal authority on which the appellant relies is Faircloth v. Northwestern Nat'l Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379125\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379125/faircloth-v-northwestern-nat-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span> (S.D.Ohio 1992).  In Faircloth, the insured wrote \"Faircloth James H. Administrator\" on the line in the application that asked for the name of the beneficiary.  The court ruled as a matter of law that the policy proceeds went to the named beneficiary to be administered for the benefit of the estate, and not to him as an individual.  See id. at 817.   The appellant reads Faircloth to stand for the proposition that whenever a fiduciary label is found in close proximity to a beneficiary's name, the beneficiary designation must be construed as running to the actual fiduciary, not to the individual named.  If Faircloth stands for this proposition--a matter on which we take no view--it contradicts basic tenets of Massachusetts contract interpretation, and we must therefore disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law holds that, if an ambiguity exists in contract documents, its ultimate resolution almost always turns on the parties' intent.  See Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability Plan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196424\"><a href=\"/opinion/196424/smart-v-the-gillette-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span>, 178 (1st Cir.1995);  Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Town of Danvers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127304\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127304/massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric-v-danvers/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127304\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127304/massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric-v-danvers/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span>, 288 (1991).  In such a situation, the intent of the contracting parties is a matter to be discerned by the factfinder from the circumstances surrounding the ambiguity and from such reasonable inferences as may be available.  See Smart, 70 F.3d at 178.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rules apply to insurance documents in the same way as they apply in other contractual settings.  See Falmouth Nat'l Bank v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552771\"><a href=\"/opinion/552771/the-falmouth-national-bank-v-ticor-title-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1061 (1st Cir.1990) (applying Massachusetts law).  For instance, two analogous Massachusetts cases indicate that, when the insured, called upon by the insurer to designate a beneficiary by name and relationship, complies by using a descriptive term such as \"wife,\" it is up to the factfinder to determine whether the insured meant the particular person named, or, in the alternative, a person fitting the description on the date of the insured's death.  See, e.g., Strachan v. Prudential Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></span>, 509, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></span>, 843 (1947);  Brogi v. Brogi, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></span>, 514, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></span>, 573 (1912).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, it can be argued that the appellation \"executor\" is more \"legalistic\" than the term \"wife,\" and merits different treatment.  We agree that the beneficiary's burden may be heavier when a fiduciary designation is in play, but, here, the end result is the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, courts construe beneficiary designations made in connection with insurance policies according to the rules applicable to the construction of wills.  See 5 George J. Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law &#167; 28:7 (2d ed. 1984).  \"The cardinal rule in the interpretation of a will is the ascertainment of the testator's intent from an examination of the language employed by him construed in the light of the circumstances known to him at the time he executed the will, and his intent, when determined, must be given effect unless contrary to some rule of law.\"  Magill v. Magill, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 92, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></span>, 894 (1944).  Thus, a testamentary gift will vest in a beneficiary qua fiduciary absent a plain manifestation of the testator's intent to accomplish a different result.  See Slavik v. Estate of Slavik, 46 Ark.App. 74, 76, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span>, 526 (1994) (en banc);  Baker v. Wright, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></span>, 703, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></span>, 830 (1952).  However, merely inserting the word \"executor\" in a change of beneficiary form that requests the policyholder to state the relationship between the beneficiary and himself presents presumptively a materially weaker case for holding the gift to be taken in a fiduciary capacity than leaving property by will to a donee who is a fiduciary and is so described in the dispositive clause.  See Slavik, 46 Ark.App. at 76, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span>.   In sum, the naked fact that the beneficiary's relationship to the insured is designated in the policy documents by a legal term (e.g., \"executor\") does not compel a finding of a fiduciary disposition;  the matter still comes down to a question of the declarant's intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the principles gleaned from these cases, we descry no error here.  It is plain as a pikestaff that Colasanto's use of the word \"executor\" in response to line 10(c) creates an ambiguity.  Given the suggestive spacing that appears on the completed form and the delicate nature of Farley's relationship to Colasanto--a relationship that, in a homophobic society, he might wish to describe with some tact--the response can plausibly be construed as using the word in a purely descriptive sense.  To be sure, it can be argued that Colasanto used the word to indicate the legal status of the beneficiary--but this possibility means no more than that the word, taken in context, is ambiguous.  See Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534521\"><a href=\"/opinion/534521/fashion-house-inc-v-k-mart-corporation-fashion-house-inc-v-k-mart/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span>, 1083 (1st Cir.1989) (\"Contract language is usually considered ambiguous ... where the phraseology can support reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.\").  Because such ambiguities must be resolved according to the insured's intent, it follows that the district court properly submitted this question to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the next step, the jury's finding that Colasanto intended the term \"executor\" to describe Farley as an individual, not as a fiduciary, is amply supported.  Since Farley was named as the executor of Colasanto's estate at the time Colasanto completed the conversion application, the description was accurate.  Here, moreover, Colasanto originally had named Farley as the beneficiary of the group life policy.  While it is true, as the appellant suggests, that a term such as \"friend\" or \"companion\" might have described Farley's relationship to Colasanto more fittingly, that is the stuff of jury arguments, not of appellate review--and the jury had a right to assess Colasanto's word choice with knowledge that emotionally charged phrases may have been painful to contemplate because a ten-year relationship was on the rocks.  Finally, it is telling (or so the jurors could have thought) that Colasanto never once referred to Farley as a fiduciary or in a fiduciary status in subsequent correspondence or conversations anent the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not paint the lily.  On this scumbled record, a rational jury could have inferred--as this jury did--that the word \"executor\" was meant only to describe the particular individual whom the insured intended to name as the beneficiary of the policy, and not to portend a disposition to Farley qua fiduciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tells us that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial.  Appellate review of orders refusing new trials is tightly circumscribed.  We ordinarily will not disturb such a ruling if a reasonable basis exists for the jury's verdict.  See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200-01.   Phrased another way, we will not intervene unless we ascertain that the outcome is \"against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.\"  Putnam Resources v. Pateman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579198\"><a href=\"/opinion/579198/putnam-resources-v-ronald-m-pateman-ronald-m-pateman-v-frenkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 459 (1st Cir.1992).  This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.  The motion for a new trial hinged largely on the two issues previously discussed--the change of ownership and the identity of the beneficiary.  We have already explained that the jury had enough evidence on these questions to support a verdict in Farley's favor.  See supra Parts II(A) &amp; III.  We add here only that, on both issues, the totality of the evidence does not suggest either that justice miscarried or that the trial court's refusal to overturn the jury's verdict constituted an abuse of discretion.  Consequently, the district court did not err in denying the appellant's new trial motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a).  See Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679955\"><a href=\"/opinion/679955/jose-l-sanchez-v-puerto-rico-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 717 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE EVIDENTIARY QUESTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that the trial court blundered in refusing to admit into evidence portions of letters written by Colasanto to Farley on March 17, 1994 and April 1, 1994, respectively.  As a starting point, the appellant claims that the proffered statements were admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 803(3).  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence Rule 803(3) removes from the hearsay prohibition statements that exhibit a declarant's \"then-existing state of mind.\"   But, this exception is not to be construed as a sweeping endorsement of all state-of-mind evidence.  To be admissible under this exception, a declaration, among other things, must \"mirror a state of mind, which, in light of all the circumstances, including proximity in time, is reasonably likely to have been the same condition existing at the material time.\"   2 John W. Strong, McCormick on Evidence &#167; 274 (4th ed. 1992).  Because disputes over whether particular statements come within the state-of-mind exception are fact-sensitive, the trial court is in the best position to resolve them.  As is true of other rulings admitting or excluding evidence, appellate review is solely for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196700\"><a href=\"/opinion/196700/blinzler-v-marriott-intl/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1158 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellant argues that the proffered statements reflect Colasanto's intent, as early as February of 1994, not to transfer the converted policy to Farley, and that they therefore rebut Farley's claim that Colasanto had a donative intent.  The district court excluded the correspondence on the ground that it did not relate to Colasanto's intent in February, but only to his intent at or about the time he wrote the letters.  We detect no misuse of the court's wide discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Farley's version of the case, Colasanto evinced a donative intent vis-a-vis the LINA policy in December of 1993, in January 1994, and again in early February of that year.  Between the last of these incidents and the first of the letters (which bore a date of March 17, 1994), a bitter fight between the long-time companions ensued.  That imbroglio, for all practical purposes, eradicated any vestige of an amicable relationship.  Although the subsequent letters clearly reflect Colasanto's animosity toward Farley on March 17 and thereafter, the significant intervening events--the quarrel and the ensuing breakup--could reasonably be thought to disrupt the contemporaneity required by Evidence Rule 803(3).  Thus, we are unable to find that the district court abused its discretion by excluding the proffered state-of-mind evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the appellant argues, in the alternative, that the evidence was proper under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5).  That catchall rule permits the introduction of hearsay evidence, not otherwise admissible, as long as the declarant is unavailable, the evidence possesses \"circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,\" and the trial court finds that the evidence (i) is offered to prove a material facet, (ii) is more probative on the point than other available evidence, and (iii) the interests of justice will be served.  See Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5);  see also United States v. Panzardi-Lespier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551283\"><a href=\"/opinion/551283/united-states-v-santiago-panzardi-lespier-aka-chago/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 316 (1st Cir.1990).  A trial court's determinations under Evidence Rule 804(b)(5) are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  See Cook v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542296\"><a href=\"/opinion/542296/sheila-g-cook-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preconditions for deployment of Rule 804(b)(5) are formidable, and the appellant cannot satisfy them in this instance.  For example, the district court found that the statements lacked satisfactory assurances of trustworthiness.  In light of the disputatious course of events that had been unfolding for months, leading to the retention of counsel by both Farley and Colasanto and then to the acrimonious quarrel in California, we cannot fault the district court's conclusion that the statements were suspect because litigation was in the wind when they were made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For aught that appears, the case was fairly tried and the lower court appropriately permitted the jury's verdict to stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties agree that on December 10, 1993, Colasanto's will nominated Farley as his executor.
