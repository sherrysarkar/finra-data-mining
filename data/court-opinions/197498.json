Defendant-appellant Anthony J.\r\n\nRizzo appeals the thirty-seven month sentence that the district\r\n\ncourt imposed upon him after he pleaded guilty to several\r\n\ncounts involving possessing, negotiating, and uttering\r\n\ncounterfeit securities in violation of 18 U.S.C. SS 371, 513.\r\n\nFinding no merit to Rizzo's arguments, we affirm. \r\n\n                            Facts\r\n\n          We consider the facts as set forth in \"the\r\n\npresentence report, the sentencing transcript[,] and various\r\n\nother materials before the district court.\"  United States v.\r\n\nGill, 99 F.3d 484, 485 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n          The counterfeit scheme in which Rizzo was involved\r\n\nwas designed to operate as follows: Rizzo supplied counterfeit\r\n\nchecks to Ronald A. Moore, who forwarded them to Joseph\r\n\nSavarese. The checks were made payable to Savarese's business,\r\n\nThermal Shield of New England (\"Thermal Shield\"). Savarese was\r\n\nto deposit the counterfeit checks in his business' bank\r\n\naccounts and then withdraw the funds after the checks had\r\n\ncleared. Rizzo, Moore, and Savarese were to share in the\r\n\nillegal proceeds from the counterfeit checks. \r\n\n          During the course of the scheme in 1992, Rizzo\r\n\nprovided Savarese with five checks that were fraudulent\r\n\nreproductions of actual corporate checks. Moore operated as\r\n\nthe middleman between Rizzo and Savarese for the first three\r\n\nchecks; Rizzo dealt directly with Savarese for the final two\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nchecks. The companies whose checks had been counterfeited\r\n\nneither issued these checks nor authorized the disbursement of\r\n\nany funds to Thermal Shield.\r\n\n          In April 1992, Rizzo, Moore, and Savarese conducted\r\n\ntheir first illegal transaction. Moore gave Savarese a\r\n\n$160,00.00 counterfeit check that Rizzo had provided him\r\n\nlisting Thermal Shield as payee and Hasbro, Inc. as payor.\r\n\nSavarese then deposited the counterfeit check into the Thermal\r\n\nShield account at the Winthrop, Massachusetts branch of New\r\n\nWorld Bank and delivered the deposit slip to Moore. After the\r\n\ncheck cleared, Savarese withdrew the $160,000.00 proceeds from\r\n\nthe check. There being little honor among the dishonest, it\r\n\nwas not until Moore made threatening statements to Savarese on\r\n\nseveral occasions that he provided Moore with approximately\r\n\n$40,000.00 of the illicit proceeds to be shared with Rizzo as\r\n\ntheir portion of the illegal booty.\r\n\n          Prior to the Hasbro check transaction, for reasons\r\n\nnot entirely clear in the record, Savarese had contacted agents\r\n\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigations (\"FBI\") concerning the\r\n\ncounterfeit check scheme. The FBI agents instructed Savarese\r\n\nthat under no circumstances was he to become involved with the\r\n\nHasbro check. Savarese did not follow these instructions, and\r\n\nthe FBI agents subsequently discovered Savarese's participation\r\n\nin negotiating the first counterfeit check. Following the\r\n\nHasbro check transaction, Savarese began cooperating with the\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nFBI in connection with the Bureau's investigation of the\r\n\ncounterfeit check scheme. During this time, the FBI, with the\r\n\nknowledge of Savarese and the assistance of security officials\r\n\nat the Bank of Boston, established a \"shell\" account in the\r\n\nname of Thermal Shield at the Bank of Boston.\r\n\n          Emboldened by their success with the Hasbro check,\r\n\nRizzo, Moore, and Savarese agreed to negotiate additional\r\n\ncounterfeit checks drawn on unsuspecting corporations. On June\r\n\n2, 1992, Moore gave Savarese two counterfeit checks from Rizzo;\r\n\none in the amount of $47,750.00 naming New Wave Transport\r\n\n(U.S.A.) as payor and one in the amount of $47,785.00 naming\r\n\nThe American Experience West Corp. as payor. Savarese\r\n\ndeposited the checks in the Thermal Shield account at the Bank\r\n\nof Boston and delivered the deposit slip to Moore. On June 9,\r\n\n1992, upon Moore's urging, Savarese visited the Bank of Boston\r\n\nin an effort to withdraw the funds from the two counterfeit\r\n\nchecks. By previous arrangement between the FBI and the Bank\r\n\nof Boston, the teller furnished Savarese with a letter stating\r\n\nthat his account was closed.\r\n\n          On July 1, 1992, Savarese met directly with Rizzo.\r\n\nDuring one conversation, Rizzo told Savarese that they would\r\n\n\"do two more.\" Several days later, Rizzo gave Savarese two new\r\n\ncounterfeit checks, one in the amount of $9300.00 naming the\r\n\nGreat Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, Inc. as payor and one\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nin the amount of $9,275.00 naming Waldbaum, Inc. as payor. The\r\n\nconspirators never negotiated either of these two checks.\r\n\n                    Procedural Background\r\n\n          On December 14, 1995, a federal grand jury returned\r\n\na three-count superseding indictment alleging that Rizzo\r\n\nengaged in a counterfeit check scheme. The indictment stated\r\n\nthat Rizzo illegally conspired with co-defendant Ronald A.\r\n\nMoore and others to obtain cash through the negotiation of\r\n\ncounterfeit corporate securities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. S\r\n\n371. The indictment further alleged two counts of uttering and\r\n\npossessing counterfeited securities of a corporation, in\r\n\ncontravention of 18 U.S.C. S 513.\r\n\n          On May 10, 1996, Rizzo entered a plea of guilty to\r\n\nall three counts. Following Rizzo's plea, the United States\r\n\nProbation Officer prepared a Presentence Report, which\r\n\nrecommended an adjusted offense level of sixteen for Rizzo's\r\n\nparticipation in the counterfeit check scheme. The base\r\n\noffense level under U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1 was six and the Report\r\n\nsuggested several enhancements. First, the Report recommended\r\n\nan eight-level increase because the intended loss from the\r\n\nscheme exceeded $200,000.00.  See U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)(I).\r\n\nThe Presentence Report calculated the amount of loss under\r\n\n1.  On December 14, 1993, Savarese was convicted and sentenced\r\nto sixty-three months imprisonment. Savarese's conviction and\r\nsentence reflected his involvement in the negotiation of the\r\nHasbro check. \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G. S 2F1.1 by using the actual loss of $160,000.00 from\r\n\nthe Hasbro check and adding the intended loss of $113,950.00,\r\n\nrepresenting the total of the four other checks involved in the\r\n\nscheme. The next suggested enhancement entailed a two-level\r\n\nincrease, which reflected the fact that the offense involved\r\n\nmore than minimal planning.   See U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(2)(A).\r\n\nFinally, the Presentence Report recommended a three-level\r\n\nincrease because Rizzo committed the offense while awaiting\r\n\nsentencing on a 1992 federal conviction. \r                                                    See U.S.S.G. S 2J1.7.\r\n\nThe Presentence Report recommended reducing the resulting\r\n\noffense level of nineteen to sixteen because Rizzo demonstrated\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility. See U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(a),(b)(2).\r\n\n          The Presentence Report computed Rizzo's criminal\r\n\nhistory category as a IV. This computation included Rizzo's\r\n\n1992 federal conviction for negotiating counterfeit checks and\r\n\nusing stolen credit cards and false identification, for which\r\n\nhe had been sentenced to thirty-three months' imprisonment on\r\n\nSeptember 17, 1992. Rizzo completed the sentence on February\r\n\n3, 1995, at which time he began a period of supervised release.\r\n\nRizzo's criminal history computation also reflected a 1989\r\n\nconviction in Charlestown District Court for possession of a\r\n\nfirearm without proper identification.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Rizzo filed numerous objections to the Presentence\r\n\nReport. Of importance for purposes of this appeal,     Rizzo\r\n\nargued for a downward departure, asserting that his case fell\r\n\noutside the heartland of the Guidelines because he was unable\r\n\nto request concurrent federal sentences due to the fact that\r\n\nthe thirty-three month sentence imposed in September 1992 had\r\n\nbeen discharged by the time he was indicted in this case. In\r\n\nsupport of this assertion, Rizzo advanced two arguments:\r\n\nfirst, he contended that the government purposefully delayed\r\n\nthe indictment in the instant case until after he completed his\r\n\nthirty-three month sentence for his 1992 conviction in order to\r\n\ncircumvent U.S.S.G. S 5G1.3(c); second, he claimed that the\r\n\ngovernment was aware of the instant counterfeit check offenses\r\n\nwhen he was sentenced in September 1992 for his prior crimes,\r\n\nbut improperly failed to inform the district court of the new\r\n\noffenses at the 1992 sentencing so that the sentencing judge\r\n\ncould consider them as relevant conduct. According to Rizzo,\r\n\nif the government properly had informed the court of the\r\n\nrelevant conduct involving this case, the court then \"would\r\n\nhave combined the two cases.\" If the court had combined the\r\n\ntwo cases, this process would have \"result[ed] in a level 20\r\n\n2.  Rizzo lodged a total of nine objections to the Presentence\r\nReport. We discuss only those arguments which bear upon the\r\nsubject matter of this appeal.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nfor the combined cases.\" A level twenty carries a sentencing\r\n\nrange of thirty-seven to forty-six months, which is at least\r\n\ntwenty-four and potentially thirty-three months shorter than\r\n\nthe total of seventy months Rizzo received on the two separate\r\n\nindictments.\r\n\n          Also of importance for purposes of this appeal, Rizzo\r\n\ninsisted that he should not have been subject to an eight-level\r\n\nincrease reflecting the intended loss. According to Rizzo, the\r\n\n$273,950.00 of counterfeit checks involved in the scheme were\r\n\n\"generated through a government sting operation,\" and, thus,\r\n\n\"no loss was capable of occurring as a matter of law.\"\r\n\n          On July 19, 1996, following an hour-long sentencing\r\n\nhearing at which Rizzo voiced his objections to the Presentence\r\n\nReport, the district court (Gorton, J.) accepted the\r\n\nrecommendations contained in the Report and declined to depart\r\n\ndownward from the suggested adjusted offense level of sixteen.\r\n\nThe district court sentenced Rizzo to thirty-seven months'\r\n\nimprisonment and three years of supervised release. Thirty-\r\n\nthree months of the imprisonment term were to run concurrently\r\n\n3.  Given our disposition of this appeal, we need not recite\r\nthe process Rizzo set forth to arrive at a total offense level\r\nof twenty.\r\n\n4.  An offense level of sixteen permits the sentencing judge to\r\nsentence the defendant to a period of incarceration ranging\r\nfrom thirty-three months to forty-one months. The sentence\r\nthat Judge Gorton imposed in this case (thirty-seven months)\r\nthus falls precisely in the middle of the possible\r\nincarceration terms Rizzo faced at sentencing.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\non counts one, two, and three, and four months of the term were\r\n\nto run consecutively, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. S 3147.     The\r\n\ndistrict court also ordered Rizzo to pay $12,500 in\r\n\nrestitution.\r\n\n                     Standard of Review\r\n\n          \"[O]ur review of the legal conclusions and factual\r\n\ndeterminations underlying the district court's departure\r\n\ndecision [is] . . . conducted under a unitary abuse-of-\r\n\ndiscretion standard.\" United States\r                                                v. \r                                                   Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 580\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996). \"Abuse of discretion review necessarily\r\n\n'includes review to determine that the [district court's\r\n\nexercise of] discretion was not guided by erroneous legal\r\n\nconclusions.'\" Id. (quoting \r                                        Koon v. \r                                                United States\r                                                             , 116 S. Ct.\r\n\n2035, 2045 (1996)). When the issue is whether or not the\r\n\ndistrict court believed it had authority to depart, we have\r\n\nheld that \"[w]hat the district court thought was the scope of\r\n\nits authority [to depart from the guidelines] is perhaps a\r\n\nquestion of fact, but it is one that we must answer ourselves,\r\n\nby reviewing the sentencing transcript. Whether the district\r\n\ncourt's belief was mistaken is plainly a legal question that we\r\n\n5.  18 U.S.C. S 3147 concerns \"person[s] convicted of an\r\noffense committed while released pursuant to this chapter,\" and\r\nprovides that \"[a] term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to\r\nthis section shall be consecutive to any other sentence of\r\nimprisonment.\" As noted above, at the time Rizzo committed the\r\ncrimes underlying this appeal, he was on release awaiting\r\nsentencing for his 1992 conviction. \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nreview de novo.\"  United States v.

First, he contends that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred when it denied his request for a downward\r\n\ndeparture pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 5K2.0\r                                                  and U.S.S.G. S 5G1.3(c)\r\n\n6.  U.S.S.G. S 5K2.0 provides in pertinent part: \"Under 18\r\nU.S.C. S 3553(b) the sentencing court may impose a sentence\r\noutside the range established by the applicable guideline, if\r\nthe court finds 'that there exists an aggravating or mitigating\r\ncircumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken\r\ninto consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating\r\nthe guidelines that should result in a sentence different from\r\nthat described.'\"\r\n\n7.  U.S.S.G. S 5G1.3(c) states: \"(Policy Statement) In any\r\nother case, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed\r\nto run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively\r\nto the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\nbecause \"the record in the instant case fails to reveal whether\r\n\nthe court understood that the present case fell outside of the\r\n\nguideline's heartland and that it had the discretion to depart\r\n\ndownward.\" Second, Rizzo insists that the district court\r\n\narrived at an incorrect adjusted offense level because it\r\n\nmisapplied U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1     in calculating the loss\r\n\nattributable to him. We address Rizzo's arguments in turn.\r\n\nA.  Downward Departure\r\n\n          As we previously have stated, \"a criminal defendant\r\n\ncannot ground an appeal on the sentencing court's discretionary\r\n\ndecision not to depart below the GSR. . . . [A]ppellate\r\n\njurisdiction[, however,] may attach if it appears that the\r\n\nfailure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken\r\n\nimpression that it lacked the legal authority to deviate from\r\n\nreasonable punishment of the instant offense.\" Rizzo bases\r\nmuch of his argument on a snippet of commentary to this section\r\nstating \"[d]eparture would be warranted when independent\r\nprosecutions produce anomalous results that circumvent or\r\ndefeat the intent of the guidelines.\" This commentary,\r\nhowever, was deleted from the Guidelines in 1989. Because\r\nRizzo was sentenced in 1996, the November 1995 Guidelines apply\r\nto this case. See \r                              United States\r                                            v. \r                                              DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1254\r\nn.26 (1st Cir. 1996), cert.  denied, 117 S.

S 2F1.1(b)(1) concerns increases to the base\r\noffense level of six applicable to offenses involving fraud or\r\ndeceit and necessitates increases to this base offense level\r\ndepending on the amount of loss resulting from the fraud or\r\ndeceit. \r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\nthe guideline range.\"  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462,\r\n\n473 (1st Cir. 1994). Rizzo asserts both that the district\r\n\ncourt believed that it lacked the legal authority to depart and\r\n\nthat the court's belief was mistaken. The record reveals\r\n\nlittle to buttress his assertion that the district court\r\n\nbelieved it lacked authority to depart downward. To support\r\n\nhis assertion that the district court was mistaken, Rizzo\r\n\ncontends that a court may depart downward pursuant to U.S.S.G.\r\n\nS 5G1.3(c) and U.S.S.G. S 5K2.0 when the government delays an\r\n\nindictment until after a defendant completes a previous federal\r\n\nsentence or when the government \"had full knowledge of the\r\n\nfacts and circumstances related to the instant case prior to\r\n\nthe sentencing in that previous case\" but failed to apprise the\r\n\ncourt of such facts and circumstances.\r\n\n9.  Specifically, Rizzo points to the following question that\r\nthe district court asked during the sentencing hearing as\r\nevidence that the court believed it lacked authority to depart:\r\n\"Do you have any law, statutory or otherwise in this regard,\r\nthat requires the government to call such relevant conduct to\r\nthe attention of the sentencing court?\" Rizzo's counsel then\r\ndirected the court to a section of the commentary to U.S.S.G.\r\nS 5G1.3 that was deleted in 1989: \"[A] departure would be\r\nwarranted when independent prosecutions produce anomalous\r\nresults that circumvent or defeat the intent of the\r\nguidelines.\"  See supra note 7. The court then responded by\r\nquestioning Rizzo's counsel about this commentary: \"It ought\r\nto be in the guideline manual, shouldn't it?\" The court\r\nultimately denied Rizzo's request for a downward departure,\r\nstating: \"To the extent that this is in support of a motion\r\nfor a downward departure, that motion is denied.\" From this\r\ninterchange, Rizzo concludes that the district court did not\r\nthink that it possessed the authority to depart downward. \r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\n          \"We are obliged to review a trial court's actions as\r\n\nthey are made manifest in the record.\"      United  \r                                                               States v.\r\n\nTavano, 12 F.3d 301, 304 (1st Cir. 1993); \r                                                     see \r                                                         United States\r                                                                       v.\r\n\nMorrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"When determining\r\n\nwhether the sentencing court merely refused to exercise its\r\n\ndiscretionary power to depart, we consider the totality of the\r\n\nrecord and the sentencing court's actions as reflected\r\n\ntherein.\"). The record in this case does not support Rizzo's\r\n\nclaim that the district court believed it lacked authority to\r\n\ndepart downward.\r\n\n          Rizzo, both in his objections to the Presentence\r\n\nReport and during his sentencing hearing, clearly enunciated\r\n\nhis position that his case fell outside the heartland of the\r\n\nguidelines and thus warranted a downward departure pursuant to\r\n\nU.S.S.G. S 5K2.0 and U.S.S.G. S 5G1.3. During the sentencing\r\n\nhearing, for instance, Rizzo's counsel explained that \"[a]ll of\r\n\nthis is, even the reference to . . . 5G.3 is in reference to a\r\n\ndownward departure. . . . And, again, I think, because of the\r\n\nfacts, it does take it out of the heartland of the guidelines.\"\r\n\n During the course of the sentencing hearing, the district\r\n\ncourt questioned Rizzo's counsel concerning this argument. The\r\n\ncourt repeatedly manifested its understanding of Rizzo's\r\n\nargument, initially stating: \"you argue that under Sections\r\n\n5G1.3 and 5G1.2, pertaining to the sentencing on multiple\r\n\ncounts of conviction, that the present offense should run\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\nconcurrently with Mr. Rizzo's prior offense. Is that basically\r\n\nit?\" Later in the discussion, the court asked Rizzo's counsel,\r\n\n\"Do you have any law, statutory or otherwise, that will guide\r\n\nthe Court in this regard, that requires the government to call\r\n\nsuch relevant conduct to the attention of the sentencing\r\n\ncourt?\" After Rizzo's counsel presented his argument and the\r\n\ndistrict court subjected him to questioning, the government\r\n\nresponded to Rizzo's argument at length during the sentencing\r\n\nhearing. After listening to both parties on the subject of a\r\n\ndownward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 5K2.0 and U.S.S.G. S\r\n\n5G1.3, the district court ruled: \"To the extent that that is\r\n\nin support of a motion for a downward departure, that motion is\r\n\ndenied.\"\r\n\n          \"[I]f a district court desired to depart but thought\r\n\nthis course forbidden by explicit guideline language, one would\r\n\nexpect the court to cast its refusal in these terms.\"  United\r\n\nStates v. DeCosta, 37 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1994);  see  United\r\n\nStates v.  Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 565 (1st Cir. 1996)\r\n\n(indicating that if the record is ambiguous concerning the\r\n\ndistrict court's awareness of its discretion to depart\r\n\ndownward, \"that ambiguity, without more, would not be enough to\r\n\nmake the district court's refusal to depart appealable\"). In\r\n\nthis case, unlike in     DeCosta, the district court made\r\n\nabsolutely no remark that could be construed to indicate that\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                         14\r\r\n\nit thought it lacked the authority under the guidelines to\r\n\ndepart downward.\r\n\n          [W]e have suggested that a sentencing\r\n          court state, where appropriate, \"that it\r\n          has considered the mitigating factors\r\n          urged but does not find them sufficiently\r\n          unusual to warrant a departure in the case\r\n          at hand.\" If a sentencing court neglects\r\n          to use such language, however, the\r\n          sentencing decision is not necessarily\r\n          ripe for remand or review.     Sentencing\r\n          courts \r                             have \r                                  had \r                                       abundant \r                                                opportunity \r                                                             to\r\n          become \r                            experienced with the Guidelines and\r\n          familiar  \r                               with  \r                                     their  \r                                            authority  \r                                                       to  \r                                                           make\r\n          discretionary decisions regarding whether\r\n          to depart.\r\n\nMorrison, 46 F.3d at 132 (internal citations and footnote\r\n\nomitted) (emphasis added) (quoting (\r                                               DeCosta, 37 F.3d at 8). As\r\n\nin \r              Morrison, \"viewed in harmony with its context, the [district\r\n\ncourt's decision not to] depart[] reflects no misapprehension\r\n\non the part of the district court as to its departure power,\r\n\nbut simply its decision not to exercise that power in the\r\n\npresent case.\"  Id. at 132-33; see United \r                                                      States v.

While we do not believe the record supports Rizzo's\r\ncontention that the district court did not understand that it\r\nhad authority to depart downward in this case, we note that the\r\ndistrict court could have avoided much trouble in this case if\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\n          Because we find that the record contains no evidence\r\n\nthat the district court believed it lacked authority to depart\r\n\ndownward in this case, we pause only briefly to address Rizzo's\r\n\narguments supporting his plea for such a departure. Initially,\r\n\nwe note that with respect to his contention that U.S.S.G. S\r\n\n5G1.3 provided authority for the district court to depart\r\n\ndownward, S 5G1.3 applies only to \"undischarged terms of\r\n\nimprisonment.\" See \r                               United States\r                                             v. \r                                               McHan, 101 F.3d 1027, 1040\r\n\n(4th Cir. 1996),  cert. denied, No. 96-8994, 1997 WL 275967\r\n\n(June 16, 1997); \r                            Prewitt v. \r                                       United States\r                                                    , 83 F.3d 812, 817-18\r\n\n(7th Cir. 1996). In this case, Rizzo had discharged the\r\n\nthirty-three month term of imprisonment resulting from his 1992\r\n\nconvictions prior to being sentenced for his 1995 federal\r\n\nindictment.\r\n\n          Similarly, Rizzo's argument that the government\r\n\nimproperly delayed indicting Rizzo until he served his thirty-\r\n\nthree month term of imprisonment for the 1992 convictions is\r\n\nunavailing in light of \r                                  United States\r                                                v. \r                                                   Saldana, 109 F.3d 100,\r\n\n104 (1st Cir. 1997). In \r                                   Saldana, a federal grand jury indicted\r\n\nthe appellant following his release after serving twenty months\r\n\nof a thirty-month state sentence. The federal grand jury\r\n\nit had heeded the suggestions of  DeCosta and Morrison.   See\r\nDeCosta, 37 F.3d at 8 (suggesting that the \"district court\r\nsay--where this is the case--that it has considered the\r\nmitigating factors urged but does not find them sufficiently\r\nunusual to warrant a departure in the case at hand\"); \r                                                                Morrison,\r\n46 F.3d at 132 (same). \r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nindicted the appellant based on conduct that occurred\r\n\napproximately two years previously, prior to his conviction and\r\n\nsentencing in the state case. The district court sentenced the\r\n\nappellant to seventy months' imprisonment.  See id. at 102.\r\n\n          The appellant claimed, inter alia, that \"if he had\r\n\nbeen charged with the federal offense while still serving his\r\n\nstate sentence, the federal sentence would, under U.S.S.G. S\r\n\n5G1.3(c), have been set to run concurrently with the state\r\n\nsentence.\"  Id. In    Saldana, we reasoned that \"deliberate\r\n\ntampering to increase a sentence would be a concern, but the\r\n\nordinary accidents of acceleration or delay are part of the\r\n\nfabric of criminal proceedings.\"    Id. at 104. Affirming\r\n\nappellant's sentence, we held that \"in the present case, the\r\n\ndelay was neither extreme nor implicitly sinister.\"  Id. \r\n\n          As in Saldana, nothing in the record indicates that\r\n\nthe delay in this case was sinister. Rizzo indicated that he\r\n\npossessed no evidence concerning the government's motive in\r\n\nwaiting to indict him until 1995. During the sentencing\r\n\nhearing, in fact, Rizzo's counsel conceded \"I'm not pointing\r\n\nthe finger at the government in terms of its conduct.\"\r\n\nFurthermore, in light of the precedent in this circuit, we do\r\n\nnot believe that the delay in this case was \"extreme.\"    See\r\n\nSaldana, 109 F.3d at 102-04 (involving two-year delay); \r                                                                   United\r\n\nStates v. \r                     McCoy, 977 F.2d 706, 711 (1st Cir. 1992) (finding no\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\ndue process violation in case of three and one-half year delay\r\n\nbetween conduct at issue and return of federal indictment).\r\n\n          Rizzo's contention that the government knew of the\r\n\nfacts of the offenses underlying this appeal at the time of his\r\n\n1992 sentencing and improperly withheld this information from\r\n\nthe sentencing court also is unpersuasive. We previously have\r\n\nexplained:\r\n\n          Undercover operations comprise a valuable,\r\n          and generally lawful, weapon in the\r\n          government's ar[senal]. Thus, courts\r\n          should proceed with caution in staking out\r\n          rules that will hinder government agents\r\n          who seek lawfully to set such ruses in\r\n          motion. \"Despite the fact that undercover\r\n          operations by their nature involve\r\n          elements of furtiveness, duplicity, and\r\n          manipulation, we have never held that such\r\n          initiatives are per  se unfair. To the\r\n          contrary, we think that the Executive\r\n          Branch is free,  within \r                                              broad \r                                                    limits, to\r\n          set such snares for unwary criminals.\"\r\n\nUnited  \r                   States v.

Given\r\n\nthe wide latitude we afford the government in conducting sting\r\n\noperations, \"the burden of showing sentencing factor\r\n\nmanipulation [necessarily] rests with the defendant.

Particularly in light of Rizzo's failure to provide an\r\nadequate explanation, we agree with the government that Rizzo's\r\nnon-disclosure argument essentially constitutes an accusation\r\nof sentencing factor manipulation on the part of the\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\n25 F.3d at 31-32 (internal citations omitted);    see  United\r\n\nStates v.

During Rizzo's\r\n\nsentencing hearing, his counsel explicitly stated that he did\r\n\nnot have evidence concerning the government's motive in\r\n\nprotecting the information pertaining to Rizzo's \"relevant\r\n\nconduct\" during the 1992 sentencing. At one point, Rizzo's\r\n\ncounsel admitted: \"I can't probe into the minds of the\r\n\ngovernment at the time.\" Later in the hearing, Rizzo's counsel\r\n\nexplained: \"[W]e can't speculate about whatever the reasons\r\n\nwere for the government not raising it at that time.\" \r\n\n          Rizzo also failed to direct the district court (and\r\n\nnow fails to point this court) to any authority requiring the\r\n\ngovernment to \"call such relevant conduct to the attention of\r\n\nthe sentencing court.\" For its part, the government explained\r\n\nthat it did not reveal Rizzo's \"relevant conduct\" to the 1992\r\n\ngovernment.

See \r                                                   Gibbens, 25 F.3d at 31\r\n\n(crediting government's explanation that it \"was hoping, based\r\n\non appellant's allusions to a supposed business partner, to\r\n\nland a bigger fish\"). We thus find that the district court did\r\n\nnot commit an abuse of discretion in refusing to depart\r\n\ndownward on the grounds that the government somehow manipulated\r\n\nRizzo's 1992 sentence; Rizzo simply failed to carry his burden\r\n\nof proof with respect to his allegation of sentencing factor\r\n\nmanipulation.  See id. at 32; Montoya, 62 F.3d at 4.\r\n\nB.  Loss Calculation\r\n\n          The district court sentenced Rizzo based on the total\r\n\n$273,950.00 value of the five counterfeit checks given to\r\n\nSavarese in 1992. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(B)(1)(I), the\r\n\ndistrict court increased Rizzo's base offense level of six by\r\n\neight levels because the loss involved in the scheme fell\r\n\nbetween $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.\r\n\n          Rizzo objected to the eight-level increase both in\r\n\nhis objections to the Presentence Report and during his\r\n\nsentencing hearing. Rizzo argued that the $273,950.00 was\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\ngenerated through a government sting operation. Distorting the\r\n\nrecord, Rizzo asserted that \"all the checks were deposited into\r\n\nthe government's shell corporation . . . . Therefore, Mr.\r\n\nRizzo's guidelines should not be increased by 2F1.1(b)(1) as no\r\n\nloss was capable of occurring as a matter of law.\" Perhaps\r\n\nrecognizing the flaw in his earlier assertion, on appeal Rizzo\r\n\nalters his argument slightly, insisting that he \"should only\r\n\nhave been responsible for at most $160,000 under S 2F1.1 since\r\n\nthe other amounts were incapable of being lost and/or had not\r\n\nbeen completed as a substantive offense.\" Because a loss\r\n\ncalculation of $160,000.00 necessitates a seven-level increase\r\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)(H), rather than an eight-\r\n\nlevel increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)(I), Rizzo\r\n\nmaintained that his \"total offense level should have been 15\r\n\ninstead of 16.\"\r\n\n          Rizzo rests his argument that actual rather than\r\n\nintended loss represents the appropriate calculation for\r\n\npurposes of U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1) on two cases, \r                                                            United States\r\n\nv. \r              Galbraith, 20 F.3d 1054 (10th Cir.), \r                                                   cert. \r                                                         denied, 513 U.S.\r\n\n889 (1994), and United \r                                   States v. Watkins, 994 F.2d 1192 (6th\r\n\nCir. 1992). In     Galbraith, the appellant contended that\r\n\n\"because his offense was committed in response to an undercover\r\n\nsting operation structured so there was no possibility of loss\r\n\nto a victim, the intended or probable loss was zero.\"\r\n\nGalbraith, 20 F.3d at 1059. Reasoning that \"[b]ecause this was\r\n\n                            -21-\r                                         21\r\r\n\nan undercover sting operation which was structured to sell\r\n\nstock to a pension fund that did not exist, defendant could not\r\n\nhave occasioned any loss even if the scheme had been\r\n\ncompleted,\" the Tenth Circuit ruled that the applicable loss\r\n\ncalculation for purposes of U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1) was zero.\r\n\nId. \r\n\n          The Galbraith court's rationale is inapplicable to\r\n\nthis case. Unlike the fictitious victim in    Galbraith, the\r\n\nintended victims of Rizzo's counterfeit check scheme were\r\n\nactual corporations. Moreover, the fact that the conspirators\r\n\nmanaged to deposit the first check and then to withdraw the\r\n\nentire $160,000.00 demonstrates that Rizzo could have\r\n\n\"occasioned\" a loss \"if the scheme had been completed\" with\r\n\nrespect to the remaining four checks. If, for instance,\r\n\nSavarese again had determined to flout the FBI's instructions,\r\n\nit appears that the conspirators could have successfully\r\n\nnegotiated the other checks totaling $113,950.00.\r\n\n          As with \r                             Galbraith, we find \r                                                Watkins' treatment of the\r\n\nappropriate loss calculation under U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)\r\n\nunpersuasive in the context of Rizzo's appeal. In \r                                                             Watkins, the\r\n\nSixth Circuit enunciated three factors that must be present for\r\n\nan amount of loss to be relevant under U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1:\r\n\n\"First, as application note 7 instructs, the defendant must\r\n\nhave intended the loss. Second, it must have been possible for\r\n\nthe defendant to cause the loss. Third, the defendant must\r\n\n                            -22-\r                                         22\r\r\n\nhave completed or been about to complete but for interruption,\r\n\nall of the acts necessary to bring about the loss.\"  Watkins,\r\n\n994 F.2d at 1196. Contrary to Rizzo, we believe that these\r\n\nthree factors were satisfied in this case. First, as Rizzo\r\n\nadmits, he intended the $273,950.00 loss. Second, the\r\n\nconspirators' success with the $160,000.00 check demonstrates\r\n\nthat it was possible for the defendant to cause the loss.\r\n\nThird, Rizzo provided Savarese with five checks totalling\r\n\n$273,950.00 and urged him to deposit these checks and then to\r\n\nremove the funds from the Thermal Shield account, thus\r\n\n\"complet[ing] . . . but for interruption, all of the acts\r\n\nnecessary to bring about the loss.\" We therefore find that\r\n\neven if the Watkins factors were dispositive of this appeal,\r\n\nthe circumstances of this case were such that $273,950.00, not\r\n\n$160,000.00, would represent the proper figure for purposes of\r\n\ncalculating loss pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1).\r\n\n          Because Watkins does not guide our analysis of this\r\n\nissue, we add a few words about our interpretation of U.S.S.G.\r\n\nS 2F1.1(b)(1). Application Note 7 to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1 states\r\n\nin pertinent part: \"Consistent with the provisions of S 2X1.1\r\n\n(Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that\r\n\nthe defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this\r\n\nfigure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.\" In\r\n\nthis case, Rizzo admits that he intended to inflict $273,950.00\r\n\nof loss. According to Application Note 7, therefore,\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\n$273,950.00 represents the appropriate amount for purposes of\r\n\ncalculating loss under U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1 in this case.\r\n\n          In United \r                                States v.  Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425, 428-29\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), furthermore, we addressed the issue of\r\n\nintended loss in the context of U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1. The \r                                                                 Egemonye\r\n\nappellant was charged with conspiracy and other offenses\r\n\nrelating to the possession and use of stolen credit cards. \r                                                                      See\r\n\nid. at 426. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)(H), the\r\n\ndistrict court computed the loss at $242,950.00, \"representing\r\n\nthe aggregate credit limit of the 51 credit cards purchased .\r\n\n. . in the four transactions,\" despite the fact that the\r\n\nappellant never inflicted any actual loss with many of the\r\n\nstolen credit cards that he purchased.  Id. at 426-27. As in\r\n\nthe instant case, the appellant was sentenced within the\r\n\nguidelines range to thirty-seven months' imprisonment. \r                                                                  See \r                                                                      id.\r\n\nat 427. Rejecting the appellant's argument that the district\r\n\ncourt's loss calculation based on the limits of all of the\r\n\ncredit cards was \"unrealistic,\" we concluded that on the\r\n\n\"record the use of the aggregate card limits as a measure of\r\n\nintended and potential loss was [not] clearly erroneous.\" Id.\r\n\nat 429. We explained that \"[w]here there is good evidence of\r\n\nactual intent and some prospect of success, we do not think\r\n\nthat a court needs to engage in more refined forecasts of just\r\n\nhow successful the scheme was likely to be.\"  Id.\r\n\n                            -24-\r                                         24\r\r\n\n          Given the evidence of Rizzo's intent and the prospect\r\n\nof future success manifested by his initial success with the\r\n\n$160,000.00 check, we do not find that the district court's use\r\n\nof the $273,950.00 figure for purposes of calculating loss\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1) was clearly erroneous. \r                                                               See \r                                                                   United\r\n\nStates v.

Moore, who forwarded them to Joseph\r\n\nSavarese. The checks were made payable to Savarese's business,\r\n\nThermal Shield of New England (\"Thermal Shield\"). Savarese was\r\n\nto deposit the counterfeit checks in his business' bank\r\n\naccounts and then withdraw the funds after the checks had\r\n\ncleared. Rizzo, Moore, and Savarese were to share in the\r\n\nillegal proceeds from the counterfeit checks. \r\n\n          During the course of the scheme in 1992, Rizzo\r\n\nprovided Savarese with five checks that were fraudulent\r\n\nreproductions of actual corporate checks. Moore operated as\r\n\nthe middleman between Rizzo and Savarese for the first three\r\n\nchecks; Rizzo dealt directly with Savarese for the final two\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nchecks. The companies whose checks had been counterfeited\r\n\nneither issued these checks nor authorized the disbursement of\r\n\nany funds to Thermal Shield.\r\n\n          In April 1992, Rizzo, Moore, and Savarese conducted\r\n\ntheir first illegal transaction. Moore gave Savarese a\r\n\n$160,00.00 counterfeit check that Rizzo had provided him\r\n\nlisting Thermal Shield as payee and Hasbro, Inc. as payor.\r\n\nSavarese then deposited the counterfeit check into the Thermal\r\n\nShield account at the Winthrop, Massachusetts branch of New\r\n\nWorld Bank and delivered the deposit slip to Moore. After the\r\n\ncheck cleared, Savarese withdrew the $160,000.00 proceeds from\r\n\nthe check. There being little honor among the dishonest, it\r\n\nwas not until Moore made threatening statements to Savarese on\r\n\nseveral occasions that he provided Moore with approximately\r\n\n$40,000.00 of the illicit proceeds to be shared with Rizzo as\r\n\ntheir portion of the illegal booty.\r\n\n          Prior to the Hasbro check transaction, for reasons\r\n\nnot entirely clear in the record, Savarese had contacted agents\r\n\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigations (\"FBI\") concerning the\r\n\ncounterfeit check scheme. The FBI agents instructed Savarese\r\n\nthat under no circumstances was he to become involved with the\r\n\nHasbro check. Savarese did not follow these instructions, and\r\n\nthe FBI agents subsequently discovered Savarese's participation\r\n\nin negotiating the first counterfeit check. Following the\r\n\nHasbro check transaction, Savarese began cooperating with the\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nFBI in connection with the Bureau's investigation of the\r\n\ncounterfeit check scheme. During this time, the FBI, with the\r\n\nknowledge of Savarese and the assistance of security officials\r\n\nat the Bank of Boston, established a \"shell\" account in the\r\n\nname of Thermal Shield at the Bank of Boston.\r\n\n          Emboldened by their success with the Hasbro check,\r\n\nRizzo, Moore, and Savarese agreed to negotiate additional\r\n\ncounterfeit checks drawn on unsuspecting corporations. On June\r\n\n2, 1992, Moore gave Savarese two counterfeit checks from Rizzo;\r\n\none in the amount of $47,750.00 naming New Wave Transport\r\n\n(U.S.A.) as payor and one in the amount of $47,785.00 naming\r\n\nThe American Experience West Corp. as payor. Savarese\r\n\ndeposited the checks in the Thermal Shield account at the Bank\r\n\nof Boston and delivered the deposit slip to Moore. On June 9,\r\n\n1992, upon Moore's urging, Savarese visited the Bank of Boston\r\n\nin an effort to withdraw the funds from the two counterfeit\r\n\nchecks. By previous arrangement between the FBI and the Bank\r\n\nof Boston, the teller furnished Savarese with a letter stating\r\n\nthat his account was closed.\r\n\n          On July 1, 1992, Savarese met directly with Rizzo.\r\n\nDuring one conversation, Rizzo told Savarese that they would\r\n\n\"do two more.\" Several days later, Rizzo gave Savarese two new\r\n\ncounterfeit checks, one in the amount of $9300.00 naming the\r\n\nGreat Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, Inc. as payor and one\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nin the amount of $9,275.00 naming Waldbaum, Inc. as payor. The\r\n\nconspirators never negotiated either of these two checks.\r\n\n                    Procedural Background\r\n\n          On December 14, 1995, a federal grand jury returned\r\n\na three-count superseding indictment alleging that Rizzo\r\n\nengaged in a counterfeit check scheme. The indictment stated\r\n\nthat Rizzo illegally conspired with co-defendant Ronald A.\r\n\nMoore and others to obtain cash through the negotiation of\r\n\ncounterfeit corporate securities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. S\r\n\n371. The indictment further alleged two counts of uttering and\r\n\npossessing counterfeited securities of a corporation, in\r\n\ncontravention of 18 U.S.C. S 513.\r\n\n          On May 10, 1996, Rizzo entered a plea of guilty to\r\n\nall three counts. Following Rizzo's plea, the United States\r\n\nProbation Officer prepared a Presentence Report, which\r\n\nrecommended an adjusted offense level of sixteen for Rizzo's\r\n\nparticipation in the counterfeit check scheme. The base\r\n\noffense level under U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1 was six and the Report\r\n\nsuggested several enhancements. First, the Report recommended\r\n\nan eight-level increase because the intended loss from the\r\n\nscheme exceeded $200,000.00.  See U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)(I).\r\n\nThe Presentence Report calculated the amount of loss under\r\n\n1.  On December 14, 1993, Savarese was convicted and sentenced\r\nto sixty-three months imprisonment. Savarese's conviction and\r\nsentence reflected his involvement in the negotiation of the\r\nHasbro check. \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G. S 2F1.1 by using the actual loss of $160,000.00 from\r\n\nthe Hasbro check and adding the intended loss of $113,950.00,\r\n\nrepresenting the total of the four other checks involved in the\r\n\nscheme. The next suggested enhancement entailed a two-level\r\n\nincrease, which reflected the fact that the offense involved\r\n\nmore than minimal planning.   See U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(2)(A).\r\n\nFinally, the Presentence Report recommended a three-level\r\n\nincrease because Rizzo committed the offense while awaiting\r\n\nsentencing on a 1992 federal conviction. \r                                                    See U.S.S.G. S 2J1.7.\r\n\nThe Presentence Report recommended reducing the resulting\r\n\noffense level of nineteen to sixteen because Rizzo demonstrated\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility. See U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(a),(b)(2).\r\n\n          The Presentence Report computed Rizzo's criminal\r\n\nhistory category as a IV. This computation included Rizzo's\r\n\n1992 federal conviction for negotiating counterfeit checks and\r\n\nusing stolen credit cards and false identification, for which\r\n\nhe had been sentenced to thirty-three months' imprisonment on\r\n\nSeptember 17, 1992. Rizzo completed the sentence on February\r\n\n3, 1995, at which time he began a period of supervised release.\r\n\nRizzo's criminal history computation also reflected a 1989\r\n\nconviction in Charlestown District Court for possession of a\r\n\nfirearm without proper identification.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Rizzo filed numerous objections to the Presentence\r\n\nReport. Of importance for purposes of this appeal,     Rizzo\r\n\nargued for a downward departure, asserting that his case fell\r\n\noutside the heartland of the Guidelines because he was unable\r\n\nto request concurrent federal sentences due to the fact that\r\n\nthe thirty-three month sentence imposed in September 1992 had\r\n\nbeen discharged by the time he was indicted in this case. In\r\n\nsupport of this assertion, Rizzo advanced two arguments:\r\n\nfirst, he contended that the government purposefully delayed\r\n\nthe indictment in the instant case until after he completed his\r\n\nthirty-three month sentence for his 1992 conviction in order to\r\n\ncircumvent U.S.S.G. S 5G1.3(c); second, he claimed that the\r\n\ngovernment was aware of the instant counterfeit check offenses\r\n\nwhen he was sentenced in September 1992 for his prior crimes,\r\n\nbut improperly failed to inform the district court of the new\r\n\noffenses at the 1992 sentencing so that the sentencing judge\r\n\ncould consider them as relevant conduct. According to Rizzo,\r\n\nif the government properly had informed the court of the\r\n\nrelevant conduct involving this case, the court then \"would\r\n\nhave combined the two cases.\" If the court had combined the\r\n\ntwo cases, this process would have \"result[ed] in a level 20\r\n\n2.  Rizzo lodged a total of nine objections to the Presentence\r\nReport. We discuss only those arguments which bear upon the\r\nsubject matter of this appeal.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nfor the combined cases.\" A level twenty carries a sentencing\r\n\nrange of thirty-seven to forty-six months, which is at least\r\n\ntwenty-four and potentially thirty-three months shorter than\r\n\nthe total of seventy months Rizzo received on the two separate\r\n\nindictments.\r\n\n          Also of importance for purposes of this appeal, Rizzo\r\n\ninsisted that he should not have been subject to an eight-level\r\n\nincrease reflecting the intended loss. According to Rizzo, the\r\n\n$273,950.00 of counterfeit checks involved in the scheme were\r\n\n\"generated through a government sting operation,\" and, thus,\r\n\n\"no loss was capable of occurring as a matter of law.\"\r\n\n          On July 19, 1996, following an hour-long sentencing\r\n\nhearing at which Rizzo voiced his objections to the Presentence\r\n\nReport, the district court (Gorton, J.) accepted the\r\n\nrecommendations contained in the Report and declined to depart\r\n\ndownward from the suggested adjusted offense level of sixteen.\r\n\nThe district court sentenced Rizzo to thirty-seven months'\r\n\nimprisonment and three years of supervised release. Thirty-\r\n\nthree months of the imprisonment term were to run concurrently\r\n\n3.  Given our disposition of this appeal, we need not recite\r\nthe process Rizzo set forth to arrive at a total offense level\r\nof twenty.\r\n\n4.  An offense level of sixteen permits the sentencing judge to\r\nsentence the defendant to a period of incarceration ranging\r\nfrom thirty-three months to forty-one months. The sentence\r\nthat Judge Gorton imposed in this case (thirty-seven months)\r\nthus falls precisely in the middle of the possible\r\nincarceration terms Rizzo faced at sentencing.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\non counts one, two, and three, and four months of the term were\r\n\nto run consecutively, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. S 3147.

First, he contends that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred when it denied his request for a downward\r\n\ndeparture pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 5K2.0\r                                                  and U.S.S.G. S 5G1.3(c)\r\n\n6.  U.S.S.G. S 5K2.0 provides in pertinent part: \"Under 18\r\nU.S.C. S 3553(b) the sentencing court may impose a sentence\r\noutside the range established by the applicable guideline, if\r\nthe court finds 'that there exists an aggravating or mitigating\r\ncircumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken\r\ninto consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating\r\nthe guidelines that should result in a sentence different from\r\nthat described.'\"\r\n\n7.  U.S.S.G. S 5G1.3(c) states: \"(Policy Statement) In any\r\nother case, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed\r\nto run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively\r\nto the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\nbecause \"the record in the instant case fails to reveal whether\r\n\nthe court understood that the present case fell outside of the\r\n\nguideline's heartland and that it had the discretion to depart\r\n\ndownward.\" Second, Rizzo insists that the district court\r\n\narrived at an incorrect adjusted offense level because it\r\n\nmisapplied U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1     in calculating the loss\r\n\nattributable to him. We address Rizzo's arguments in turn.\r\n\nA.  Downward Departure\r\n\n          As we previously have stated, \"a criminal defendant\r\n\ncannot ground an appeal on the sentencing court's discretionary\r\n\ndecision not to depart below the GSR. . . . [A]ppellate\r\n\njurisdiction[, however,] may attach if it appears that the\r\n\nfailure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken\r\n\nimpression that it lacked the legal authority to deviate from\r\n\nreasonable punishment of the instant offense.\" Rizzo bases\r\nmuch of his argument on a snippet of commentary to this section\r\nstating \"[d]eparture would be warranted when independent\r\nprosecutions produce anomalous results that circumvent or\r\ndefeat the intent of the guidelines.\" This commentary,\r\nhowever, was deleted from the Guidelines in 1989.

Rizzo asserts both that the district\r\n\ncourt believed that it lacked the legal authority to depart and\r\n\nthat the court's belief was mistaken. The record reveals\r\n\nlittle to buttress his assertion that the district court\r\n\nbelieved it lacked authority to depart downward. To support\r\n\nhis assertion that the district court was mistaken, Rizzo\r\n\ncontends that a court may depart downward pursuant to U.S.S.G.\r\n\nS 5G1.3(c) and U.S.S.G. S 5K2.0 when the government delays an\r\n\nindictment until after a defendant completes a previous federal\r\n\nsentence or when the government \"had full knowledge of the\r\n\nfacts and circumstances related to the instant case prior to\r\n\nthe sentencing in that previous case\" but failed to apprise the\r\n\ncourt of such facts and circumstances.\r\n\n9.  Specifically, Rizzo points to the following question that\r\nthe district court asked during the sentencing hearing as\r\nevidence that the court believed it lacked authority to depart:\r\n\"Do you have any law, statutory or otherwise in this regard,\r\nthat requires the government to call such relevant conduct to\r\nthe attention of the sentencing court?\" Rizzo's counsel then\r\ndirected the court to a section of the commentary to U.S.S.G.\r\nS 5G1.3 that was deleted in 1989: \"[A] departure would be\r\nwarranted when independent prosecutions produce anomalous\r\nresults that circumvent or defeat the intent of the\r\nguidelines.\"  See supra note 7. The court then responded by\r\nquestioning Rizzo's counsel about this commentary: \"It ought\r\nto be in the guideline manual, shouldn't it?\" The court\r\nultimately denied Rizzo's request for a downward departure,\r\nstating: \"To the extent that this is in support of a motion\r\nfor a downward departure, that motion is denied.\" From this\r\ninterchange, Rizzo concludes that the district court did not\r\nthink that it possessed the authority to depart downward. \r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\n          \"We are obliged to review a trial court's actions as\r\n\nthey are made manifest in the record.\"      United  \r                                                               States v.\r\n\nTavano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195113\"><a href=\"/opinion/195113/united-states-v-tavano/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304 (1st Cir. 1993); \r                                                     see \r                                                         United States\r                                                                       v.\r\n\nMorrison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195889\"><a href=\"/opinion/195889/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"When determining\r\n\nwhether the sentencing court merely refused to exercise its\r\n\ndiscretionary power to depart, we consider the totality of the\r\n\nrecord and the sentencing court's actions as reflected\r\n\ntherein.\"). The record in this case does not support Rizzo's\r\n\nclaim that the district court believed it lacked authority to\r\n\ndepart downward.\r\n\n          Rizzo, both in his objections to the Presentence\r\n\nReport and during his sentencing hearing, clearly enunciated\r\n\nhis position that his case fell outside the heartland of the\r\n\nguidelines and thus warranted a downward departure pursuant to\r\n\nU.S.S.G. S 5K2.0 and U.S.S.G. S 5G1.3. During the sentencing\r\n\nhearing, for instance, Rizzo's counsel explained that \"[a]ll of\r\n\nthis is, even the reference to . . . 5G.3 is in reference to a\r\n\ndownward departure. . . . And, again, I think, because of the\r\n\nfacts, it does take it out of the heartland of the guidelines.\"\r\n\n During the course of the sentencing hearing, the district\r\n\ncourt questioned Rizzo's counsel concerning this argument. The\r\n\ncourt repeatedly manifested its understanding of Rizzo's\r\n\nargument, initially stating: \"you argue that under Sections\r\n\n5G1.3 and 5G1.2, pertaining to the sentencing on multiple\r\n\ncounts of conviction, that the present offense should run\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\nconcurrently with Mr. Rizzo's prior offense. Is that basically\r\n\nit?\" Later in the discussion, the court asked Rizzo's counsel,\r\n\n\"Do you have any law, statutory or otherwise, that will guide\r\n\nthe Court in this regard, that requires the government to call\r\n\nsuch relevant conduct to the attention of the sentencing\r\n\ncourt?\" After Rizzo's counsel presented his argument and the\r\n\ndistrict court subjected him to questioning, the government\r\n\nresponded to Rizzo's argument at length during the sentencing\r\n\nhearing. After listening to both parties on the subject of a\r\n\ndownward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 5K2.0 and U.S.S.G. S\r\n\n5G1.3, the district court ruled: \"To the extent that that is\r\n\nin support of a motion for a downward departure, that motion is\r\n\ndenied.\"\r\n\n          \"[I]f a district court desired to depart but thought\r\n\nthis course forbidden by explicit guideline language, one would\r\n\nexpect the court to cast its refusal in these terms.\"  United\r\n\nStates v.

In\r\n\nthis case, unlike in     DeCosta, the district court made\r\n\nabsolutely no remark that could be construed to indicate that\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                         14\r\r\n\nit thought it lacked the authority under the guidelines to\r\n\ndepart downward.\r\n\n          [W]e have suggested that a sentencing\r\n          court state, where appropriate, \"that it\r\n          has considered the mitigating factors\r\n          urged but does not find them sufficiently\r\n          unusual to warrant a departure in the case\r\n          at hand.\" If a sentencing court neglects\r\n          to use such language, however, the\r\n          sentencing decision is not necessarily\r\n          ripe for remand or review.

In \r                                   Saldana, a federal grand jury indicted\r\n\nthe appellant following his release after serving twenty months\r\n\nof a thirty-month state sentence. The federal grand jury\r\n\nit had heeded the suggestions of  DeCosta and Morrison.   See\r\nDeCosta, 37 F.3d at 8 (suggesting that the \"district court\r\nsay--where this is the case--that it has considered the\r\nmitigating factors urged but does not find them sufficiently\r\nunusual to warrant a departure in the case at hand\"); \r                                                                Morrison,\r\n46 F.3d at 132 (same). \r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nindicted the appellant based on conduct that occurred\r\n\napproximately two years previously, prior to his conviction and\r\n\nsentencing in the state case. The district court sentenced the\r\n\nappellant to seventy months' imprisonment.  See id. at 102.\r\n\n          The appellant claimed, inter alia, that \"if he had\r\n\nbeen charged with the federal offense while still serving his\r\n\nstate sentence, the federal sentence would, under U.S.S.G. S\r\n\n5G1.3(c), have been set to run concurrently with the state\r\n\nsentence.\"  Id. In    Saldana, we reasoned that \"deliberate\r\n\ntampering to increase a sentence would be a concern, but the\r\n\nordinary accidents of acceleration or delay are part of the\r\n\nfabric of criminal proceedings.\"    Id. at 104. Affirming\r\n\nappellant's sentence, we held that \"in the present case, the\r\n\ndelay was neither extreme nor implicitly sinister.\"  Id. \r\n\n          As in Saldana, nothing in the record indicates that\r\n\nthe delay in this case was sinister. Rizzo indicated that he\r\n\npossessed no evidence concerning the government's motive in\r\n\nwaiting to indict him until 1995. During the sentencing\r\n\nhearing, in fact, Rizzo's counsel conceded \"I'm not pointing\r\n\nthe finger at the government in terms of its conduct.\"\r\n\nFurthermore, in light of the precedent in this circuit, we do\r\n\nnot believe that the delay in this case was \"extreme.\"    See\r\n\nSaldana, 109 F.3d at 102-04 (involving two-year delay); \r                                                                   United\r\n\nStates v. \r                     McCoy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593173\"><a href=\"/opinion/593173/united-states-v-james-w-mccoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711 (1st Cir. 1992) (finding no\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\ndue process violation in case of three and one-half year delay\r\n\nbetween conduct at issue and return of federal indictment).\r\n\n          Rizzo's contention that the government knew of the\r\n\nfacts of the offenses underlying this appeal at the time of his\r\n\n1992 sentencing and improperly withheld this information from\r\n\nthe sentencing court also is unpersuasive.

We thus find that the district court did\r\n\nnot commit an abuse of discretion in refusing to depart\r\n\ndownward on the grounds that the government somehow manipulated\r\n\nRizzo's 1992 sentence; Rizzo simply failed to carry his burden\r\n\nof proof with respect to his allegation of sentencing factor\r\n\nmanipulation.  See id. at 32; Montoya, 62 F.3d at 4.\r\n\nB.  Loss Calculation\r\n\n          The district court sentenced Rizzo based on the total\r\n\n$273,950.00 value of the five counterfeit checks given to\r\n\nSavarese in 1992. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(B)(1)(I), the\r\n\ndistrict court increased Rizzo's base offense level of six by\r\n\neight levels because the loss involved in the scheme fell\r\n\nbetween $200,000.00 and $350,000.00.\r\n\n          Rizzo objected to the eight-level increase both in\r\n\nhis objections to the Presentence Report and during his\r\n\nsentencing hearing. Rizzo argued that the $273,950.00 was\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\ngenerated through a government sting operation. Distorting the\r\n\nrecord, Rizzo asserted that \"all the checks were deposited into\r\n\nthe government's shell corporation . . . . Therefore, Mr.\r\n\nRizzo's guidelines should not be increased by 2F1.1(b)(1) as no\r\n\nloss was capable of occurring as a matter of law.\" Perhaps\r\n\nrecognizing the flaw in his earlier assertion, on appeal Rizzo\r\n\nalters his argument slightly, insisting that he \"should only\r\n\nhave been responsible for at most $160,000 under S 2F1.1 since\r\n\nthe other amounts were incapable of being lost and/or had not\r\n\nbeen completed as a substantive offense.\" Because a loss\r\n\ncalculation of $160,000.00 necessitates a seven-level increase\r\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)(H), rather than an eight-\r\n\nlevel increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)(I), Rizzo\r\n\nmaintained that his \"total offense level should have been 15\r\n\ninstead of 16.\"\r\n\n          Rizzo rests his argument that actual rather than\r\n\nintended loss represents the appropriate calculation for\r\n\npurposes of U.S.S.G.

S 2F1.1(b)(1) was zero.\r\n\nId. \r\n\n          The Galbraith court's rationale is inapplicable to\r\n\nthis case. Unlike the fictitious victim in    Galbraith, the\r\n\nintended victims of Rizzo's counterfeit check scheme were\r\n\nactual corporations. Moreover, the fact that the conspirators\r\n\nmanaged to deposit the first check and then to withdraw the\r\n\nentire $160,000.00 demonstrates that Rizzo could have\r\n\n\"occasioned\" a loss \"if the scheme had been completed\" with\r\n\nrespect to the remaining four checks. If, for instance,\r\n\nSavarese again had determined to flout the FBI's instructions,\r\n\nit appears that the conspirators could have successfully\r\n\nnegotiated the other checks totaling $113,950.00.\r\n\n          As with \r                             Galbraith, we find \r                                                Watkins' treatment of the\r\n\nappropriate loss calculation under U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)\r\n\nunpersuasive in the context of Rizzo's appeal. In \r                                                             Watkins, the\r\n\nSixth Circuit enunciated three factors that must be present for\r\n\nan amount of loss to be relevant under U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1:\r\n\n\"First, as application note 7 instructs, the defendant must\r\n\nhave intended the loss. Second, it must have been possible for\r\n\nthe defendant to cause the loss. Third, the defendant must\r\n\n                            -22-\r                                         22\r\r\n\nhave completed or been about to complete but for interruption,\r\n\nall of the acts necessary to bring about the loss.\"  Watkins,\r\n\n994 F.2d at 1196. Contrary to Rizzo, we believe that these\r\n\nthree factors were satisfied in this case. First, as Rizzo\r\n\nadmits, he intended the $273,950.00 loss. Second, the\r\n\nconspirators' success with the $160,000.00 check demonstrates\r\n\nthat it was possible for the defendant to cause the loss.\r\n\nThird, Rizzo provided Savarese with five checks totalling\r\n\n$273,950.00 and urged him to deposit these checks and then to\r\n\nremove the funds from the Thermal Shield account, thus\r\n\n\"complet[ing] . . . but for interruption, all of the acts\r\n\nnecessary to bring about the loss.\" We therefore find that\r\n\neven if the Watkins factors were dispositive of this appeal,\r\n\nthe circumstances of this case were such that $273,950.00, not\r\n\n$160,000.00, would represent the proper figure for purposes of\r\n\ncalculating loss pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1).\r\n\n          Because Watkins does not guide our analysis of this\r\n\nissue, we add a few words about our interpretation of U.S.S.G.\r\n\nS 2F1.1(b)(1). Application Note 7 to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1 states\r\n\nin pertinent part: \"Consistent with the provisions of S 2X1.1\r\n\n(Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that\r\n\nthe defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this\r\n\nfigure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.\" In\r\n\nthis case, Rizzo admits that he intended to inflict $273,950.00\r\n\nof loss. According to Application Note 7, therefore,\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\n$273,950.00 represents the appropriate amount for purposes of\r\n\ncalculating loss under U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1 in this case.\r\n\n          In United \r                                States v.  Egemonye, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196220\"><a href=\"/opinion/196220/united-states-v-egemonye/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428-29\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), furthermore, we addressed the issue of\r\n\nintended loss in the context of U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1. The \r                                                                 Egemonye\r\n\nappellant was charged with conspiracy and other offenses\r\n\nrelating to the possession and use of stolen credit cards. \r                                                                      See\r\n\nid. at 426. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1)(H), the\r\n\ndistrict court computed the loss at $242,950.00, \"representing\r\n\nthe aggregate credit limit of the 51 credit cards purchased .\r\n\n. . in the four transactions,\" despite the fact that the\r\n\nappellant never inflicted any actual loss with many of the\r\n\nstolen credit cards that he purchased.  Id. at 426-27. As in\r\n\nthe instant case, the appellant was sentenced within the\r\n\nguidelines range to thirty-seven months' imprisonment. \r                                                                  See \r                                                                      id.\r\n\nat 427. Rejecting the appellant's argument that the district\r\n\ncourt's loss calculation based on the limits of all of the\r\n\ncredit cards was \"unrealistic,\" we concluded that on the\r\n\n\"record the use of the aggregate card limits as a measure of\r\n\nintended and potential loss was [not] clearly erroneous.\" Id.\r\n\nat 429. We explained that \"[w]here there is good evidence of\r\n\nactual intent and some prospect of success, we do not think\r\n\nthat a court needs to engage in more refined forecasts of just\r\n\nhow successful the scheme was likely to be.\"  Id.\r\n\n                            -24-\r                                         24\r\r\n\n          Given the evidence of Rizzo's intent and the prospect\r\n\nof future success manifested by his initial success with the\r\n\n$160,000.00 check, we do not find that the district court's use\r\n\nof the $273,950.00 figure for purposes of calculating loss\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G. S 2F1.1(b)(1) was clearly erroneous. \r                                                               See \r                                                                   United\r\n\nStates v.
