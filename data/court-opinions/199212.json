Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     George J. West for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Mary E.\nRogers, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\fDecember 27, 2000\n\f               Per Curiam.    Appellant Donald G. Smith claims that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by denying his discovery\n\nrequests for information relating to possible sentencing-factor\n\nmanipulation       and    improper       investigative   techniques    by     the\n\ngovernment.       Smith argues that the information he sought might\n\nhave enabled him to demonstrate an entitlement to a downward\n\ndeparture.       Cf. United States v. Coleman, 188 F.3d 354 (6th Cir.\n\n1998) (en banc).         As Smith failed to make the threshold showing\n\nrequired for the requested relief, we affirm the district court\n\nruling.\n\n               Essentially,      Smith    contended   that   since    there    is\n\nnothing in his background which would have suggested that he be\n\ntargeted for a federal drug investigation, he was entitled to\n\ndiscover whether he and certain other persons, as to whose\n\ninvestigations and arrests he likewise sought discovery, may\n\nhave been singled out by the government, either as members of\n\nminority groups (Smith identifies himself as a black person) or\n\nsimply    as    targets    for    sentencing-factor      manipulation.        The\n\ndistrict court ruled that the predicate showing attempted by\n\nSmith was premised upon mere surmise and conjecture.                 We review\n\nfor clear error.          United States v. Montoya, 62 F.3d 1, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n               The claim that Smith and others may have been targeted,\n\n\n                                           3\n\feither   for     selective     prosecution     or    sentencing-factor\n\nmanipulation,    by   reason   of   their   race,   is   unsupported   by\n\nanything remotely approaching the requisite “clear evidence”\n\nneeded to rebut the applicable presumption that the government\n\nacted without discriminatory purpose.        See Reno v. American-Arab\n\nAnti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 489-90 (1999).          Nor has\n\nSmith demonstrated that similarly situated persons were not\n\nprosecuted.     Consequently, the rigorous threshold standard for\n\nobtaining the intrusive discovery relief here requested was\n\nnever met.     United States v. Magana, 127 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    4\n\f",
