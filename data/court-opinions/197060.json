In this  diversity case, Curtis\r                                       \r\n\nand  Judy Cleveland appeal from the district court's grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment  in favor  of Hasbro,  Inc.   The Clevelands\r\n\nsued Hasbro for negligence and loss of consortium based  upon\r\n\nan injury  that Curtis Cleveland suffered  while loading toys\r\n\nonto  his  truck  at   Hasbro's  plant  in  East  Longmeadow,\r\n\nMassachusetts.  The district court ruled, as a matter of law,\r\n\nthat Hasbro had  never assumed  a duty of  care owing to  the\r\n\nClevelands.     Our  review  is  plenary,  and  we  take  the\r\n\nallegations  of  facts in  the  light most  favorable  to the\r\n\nClevelands.  See  Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 29 F.3d  3, 4\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n     In September 1991, Curtis was a truck driver employed by\r\n\nV.K. Putnam  Trucking, Inc. (\"Putnam\") of  Belgrade, Montana.\r\n\nAll  of the loads that Putnam contracted to haul were \"driver\r\n\nassist\" loads, meaning  that the truck driver rather than the\r\n\nshipper was  responsible for  loading cargo.   Putnam drivers\r\n\nwere  provided  with  a stipend  for  the  purpose  of hiring\r\n\n\"lumpers\"  to assist  in this  process.   At his  option, the\r\n\ndriver could load himself and pocket the stipend.\r\n\n     In early September, Curtis was offered the Hasbro job by\r\n\nthe  Putnam dispatcher  and  told  that  it would  be  driver\r\n\nassist.   On September 6, Curtis and Judy arrived at Hasbro's\r\n\nEast  Longmeadow  plant to  pick up  a  shipment of  toys for\r\n\ndelivery  to a purchaser in Oregon.  Curtis claims that prior\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nto  arriving at Hasbro, he  spoke by telephone  with a Hasbro\r\n\nemployee  who  assured him  that  the  company would  provide\r\n\n\"lumpers\"  or other  personnel  to load  the  cargo into  his\r\n\ntruck.   Curtis says that without this assurance he would not\r\n\nhave accepted the job.\r\n\n     When the  Clevelands arrived at  Hasbro to  pick up  the\r\n\nload, they were  told that no Hasbro employees were available\r\n\nto assist in loading  the truck.  Curtis then decided to load\r\n\nthe truck himself with help from his wife.  Hasbro provided a\r\n\nmanual pallet jack to  the Clevelands for use in  loading the\r\n\ncargo  pallets onto the truck, but declined to make available\r\n\na more expensive electric jack that was also on the premises.\r\n\n     After several  hours of  loading, Curtis  had difficulty\r\n\nmoving an  especially heavy pallet  up an inclined  ramp into\r\n\nhis truck.  Starting with the pallet-laden jack at a distance\r\n\nfrom the truck, Curtis gave the jack a long running push from\r\n\ninside  the warehouse toward the  interior of his  truck.  He\r\n\ngot the load into the truck;  but he then lost control of the\r\n\njack, and  as it slid back  out, he jumped aboard  it and was\r\n\nultimately  thrown  between  two  other  pallets,  sustaining\r\n\ninjuries.   The Clevelands  then completed loading  the truck\r\n\nand drove the truck back to Oregon.\r\n\n     The  Clevelands brought  suit in  the district  court in\r\n\nAugust  1994,  alleging that  Hasbro  had  been negligent  in\r\n\nfailing  to provide personnel to  load the truck  and that it\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nwas  also  negligent in  other respects,  such as  failing to\r\n\npermit the Clevelands to use the electric jack and failing to\r\n\nprovide medical assistance to Cleveland following his injury.\r\n\nAfter  discovery,  in  June  1995 Hasbro  moved  for  summary\r\n\njudgment.   The district  court granted Hasbro's  motion (and\r\n\ndenied the  Clevelands' cross-motion)  on November  29, 1995.\r\n\nThe Clevelands now appeal.\r\n\n     On  appeal,  the Clevelands  advance  three  theories of\r\n\nliability: first,  that  Hasbro, by  its  employee's  alleged\r\n\nstatement, assumed  a duty to provide  assistance in loading;\r\n\nsecond,  that Hasbro had breached its general duty of care as\r\n\na landowner; and third, that the employee's alleged statement\r\n\nconstituted  negligent misrepresentation  under Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw.   Hasbro  says that  this third  theory has  been waived\r\n\nbecause not pressed in  the district court, but it  turns out\r\n\nto make no difference.\r\n\n     The Clevelands'  first negligence claim  rests upon  the\r\n\npremise   that  the  statement  allegedly  made  by  Hasbro's\r\n\nemployee  gave rise to a duty of  care on Hasbro's part; they\r\n\nthen  argue  that  the  failure  of  Hasbro  to  provide  the\r\n\nassistance was a breach of this duty and a proximate cause of\r\n\nCurtis'  injuries.    The   district  court  found  that  the\r\n\nstatement  by  Hasbro's  agent,  assuming it  was  made,  was\r\n\ninsufficient  to   give  rise  to   a  duty  of   care  under\r\n\nMassachusetts law.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     It is by  no means  clear that  Massachusetts law  would\r\n\nimpose on Hasbro a general duty of care based on the isolated\r\n\nstatement of the Hasbro employee.   Most of the Massachusetts\r\n\ncases,  some recognizing  and others rejecting  a voluntarily\r\n\nassumed duty of care, concern activities that the \"volunteer\"\r\n\nundertook  and  then  performed  in  an  allegedly  negligent\r\n\nmanner.1 Here, when  Curtis arrived at the plant, Hasbro made\r\n\nquite  clear that it was  not going to  provide assistance at\r\n\nall,  although it did  allow Curtis  to make  use of  an idle\r\n\njack.\r\n\n     Nor  are  the  Clevelands'  other   theories  especially\r\n\npromising.    A landowner  does have  a  duty of  care toward\r\n\ninvitees  (e.g.,  to  furnish  a safe  premise),  Mounsey  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nEllard, 363 Mass. 693, 707  (1973), but the Clevelands' claim\r                  \r\n\nto  assistance in loading a truck,  customarily loaded by the\r\n\ndriver,  probably stretches this  duty beyond  its accustomed\r\n\nbounds.  As for negligent misrepresentation, see, e.g., Danca\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Taunton Savings  Bank, 385  Mass. 1,  8 (1982),  there is\r                                     \r\n\nlittle  proof  that the  employee  was negligent  as  well as\r\n\nmistaken.\r\n\n     But we  think that the  duty of care  issue need not  be\r\n\nresolved in order to  affirm the district court.   Rather, we\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1See, e.g., Somerset Savings  Bank v. Chicago Title Ins.\r                                                                         \r\nCo., 420 Mass. 422 (1995) (alleged failure of title insurance\r               \r\ncompany to exercise due care in search of plaintiff's title);\r\nMullins v. Pine  Manor College, 389 Mass. 47  (1983) (failure\r                                          \r\nof college to provide adequate campus security).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nwill assume that on occasion a mere representation of intent-\r\n\n-although  neither negligent nor  couched as a promise--might\r\n\nlead  a victim to alter his position in reliance or otherwise\r\n\ngive  rise to duties that  would not otherwise  exist.  There\r\n\nexist  a brace  of  theories that  respond  to such  problems\r\n\nincluding,  in  addition   to  negligent   misrepresentation,\r\n\ninvoked by Cleveland, various forms of estoppel.  \r\n\n     Nevertheless, we think that  this case must be affirmed,\r\n\nbecause, in  light of Curtis' own  carelessness, a reasonable\r\n\njury  could not  under  Massachusetts law  properly return  a\r\n\nverdict for the Clevelands in this  case.  We are entitled to\r\n\naffirm  on any  dispositive ground,  Levy v.  Federal Deposit\r                                                                         \r\n\nIns. Co., 7 F.3d 1054,  1056 (1st Cir. 1993), since  it makes\r                    \r\n\nno  sense to  send a  case back  to district  court when  the\r\n\nresult is foreordained.   Two different doctrines converge on\r\n\nour result.\r\n\n     Under Massachusetts  law, as elsewhere,  a defendant  is\r\n\nliable only if the wrongdoing was the \"proximate\"--as well as\r\n\nthe \"but  for\" cause  of the  harm in  question.  Peckham  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nContinental  Casualty Ins.

The rubric is  used to\r\n\ndraw a legal  line somewhere, along  the chain of  causation,\r\n\nbetween the more immediate  and foreseeable consequences of a\r\n\nwrong  and those that are more remote, unlikely or partly the\r\n\nproduct of  intervening forces.  Young  v. Atlantic Richfield\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nCo.,  400  Mass. 837,  842  (1987);  Restatement (Second)  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nTorts,    440, 442 (1965).\r                 \r\n\n     Assuming that  a Hasbro  employee made the  statement to\r\n\nCurtis,  it might  be  reasonable to  anticipate that  Curtis\r\n\ncould find himself  at the  plant unable to  load the  truck,\r\n\nresulting in delay and  additional expense (e.g., charges for\r                                                            \r\n\ndelayed  delivery,  inability  to   carry  out  other  jobs).\r\n\nPerhaps it might be reasonable to assume that, in the absence\r\n\nof  expected help,  Curtis would  incur added expense  to get\r\n\nlabor or would even attempt to load the truck himself.\r\n\n     But to describe the  injury itself as proximately caused\r\n\nby the  Hasbro statement or  resulting lack of  help requires\r\n\nmore.   It  requires that it  be reasonably  foreseeable that\r\n\nCurtis  would  then attempt  to load  the  truck in  a highly\r\n\nnegligent  manner.     By his  own  admission, Curtis  ran an\r                                                                      \r\n\nextremely  heavy load  resting on  a jacked-up  pallet  up an\r\n\ninclined ramp into  his truck.   He  knew that  the load  was\r\n\nunusually heavy and difficult to maneuver slowly; that is why\r\n\nhe attempted the  running start.   It is  hard to explain  so\r\n\nrisky a course in the face of a known hazard.\r\n\n     But even if we  assume dubitante that Curtis' negligence\r                                                 \r\n\nwas  foreseeable  enough  to  satisfy   the  requirements  of\r\n\nproximate cause,  compare Restatement, supra,    443, cmt. c,\r                                                        \r\n\nthe Clevelands are still barred from recovery.  Massachusetts\r\n\nhas  eliminated  contributory negligence  as  a defense  but,\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nunder  its  comparative  negligence  doctrine,  it  does  bar\r\n\nrecovery where  the victim's  negligence exceeds that  of the\r\n\nwrongdoer.  Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 231,   85.  That is plainly so\r\n\nin this case.\r\n\n     It is  doubtful that  the Clevelands have  proffered any\r\n\nsubstantial proof of negligence by Hasbro.  The  statement of\r\n\nits employee, if made  at all, was  mistaken but there is  no\r\n\nindication of fault.  For all we know, Hasbro does often have\r\n\nlumpers available and the employee's prediction may have been\r\n\nperfectly  reasonable.   Plaintiffs,  although they  claim to\r\n\nhave  charged \"negligent misrepresentation,\"  have pointed to\r\n\nno evidence at all of negligence on the part of the employee.\r\n\n     But assuming  arguendo that a rational  jury might still\r                                       \r\n\nbe  entitled to infer some measure of fault, there is nothing\r\n\nwhatever  to suggest that Hasbro's fault  comes even close to\r\n\nthat of Curtis.   Curtis' negligence  is patent, serious  and\r\n\nbeyond reasonable dispute; Hasbro has  at most made a  garden\r\n\nvariety  administrative error,  weakly inferable at  best and\r\n\n(by any  test of  foreseeability) only remotely  connected to\r\n\nCurtis' own injury.  Bluntly put, Curtis injured himself.\r\n\n     Matters of proximate cause and comparative fault are, as\r\n\na  general rule, for the  jury; but the  settled exception to\r\n\nthe general rule  applies when a reasonable  jury could reach\r\n\nonly one result.  This is such a case and, without suggesting\r\n\nthat the  district  court  was wrong  in  its  broader  legal\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nholding,  we  think  that   our  own  ruling  on  comparative\r\n\nnegligence offers a firm and narrow basis for the result.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n",

At his option, the driver could load himself and pocket the stipend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early September, Curtis was offered the Hasbro job by the Putnam dispatcher and told that it would be driver assist.  On September 6, Curtis and Judy arrived at Hasbro's East Longmeadow plant to pick up a shipment of toys for delivery to a purchaser in Oregon.  Curtis claims that prior to arriving at Hasbro, he spoke by telephone with a Hasbro employee who assured him that the company would provide \"lumpers\" or other personnel to load the cargo into his truck.  Curtis says that without this assurance he would not have accepted the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the Clevelands arrived at Hasbro to pick up the load, they were told that no Hasbro employees were available to assist in loading the truck.  Curtis then decided to load the truck himself with help from his wife.  Hasbro provided a manual pallet jack to the Clevelands for use in loading the cargo pallets onto the truck, but declined to make available a more expensive electric jack that was also on the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several hours of loading, Curtis had difficulty moving an especially heavy pallet up an inclined ramp into his truck.  Starting with the pallet-laden jack at a distance from the truck, Curtis gave the jack a long running push from inside the warehouse toward the interior of his truck.  He got the load into the truck;  but he then lost control of the jack, and as it slid back out, he jumped aboard it and was ultimately thrown between two other pallets, sustaining injuries.  The Clevelands then completed loading the truck and drove the truck back to Oregon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clevelands brought suit in the district court in August 1994, alleging that Hasbro had been negligent in failing to provide personnel to load the truck and that it was also negligent in other respects, such as failing to permit the Clevelands to use the electric jack and failing to provide medical assistance to Cleveland following his injury.  After discovery, in June 1995 Hasbro moved for summary judgment.  The district court granted Hasbro's motion (and denied the Clevelands' cross-motion) on November 29, 1995.  The Clevelands now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Clevelands advance three theories of liability:  first, that Hasbro, by its employee's alleged statement, assumed a duty to provide assistance in loading;  second, that Hasbro had breached its general duty of care as a landowner;  and third, that the employee's alleged statement constituted negligent misrepresentation under Massachusetts law.  Hasbro says that this third theory has been waived because not pressed in the district court, but it turns out to make no difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clevelands' first negligence claim rests upon the premise that the statement allegedly made by Hasbro's employee gave rise to a duty of care on Hasbro's part;  they then argue that the failure of Hasbro to provide the assistance was a breach of this duty and a proximate cause of Curtis' injuries.  The district court found that the statement by Hasbro's agent, assuming it was made, was insufficient to give rise to a duty of care under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by no means clear that Massachusetts law would impose on Hasbro a general duty of care based on the isolated statement of the Hasbro employee.  Most of the Massachusetts cases, some recognizing and others rejecting a voluntarily assumed duty of care, concern activities that the \"volunteer\" undertook and then performed in an allegedly negligent manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Here, when Curtis arrived at the plant, Hasbro made quite clear that it was not going to provide assistance at all, although it did allow Curtis to make use of an idle jack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are the Clevelands' other theories especially promising.  A landowner does have a duty of care toward invitees (e.g., to furnish a safe premise),  Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973), but the Clevelands' claim to assistance in loading a truck, customarily loaded by the driver, probably stretches this duty beyond its accustomed bounds.  As for negligent misrepresentation,  see, e.g., Danca v. Taunton Savings Bank, 385 Mass. 1, 8 (1982), there is little proof that the employee was negligent as well as mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we think that the duty of care issue need not be resolved in order to affirm the district court.  Rather, we will assume that on occasion a mere representation of intent--although neither negligent nor couched as a promise--might lead a victim to alter his position in reliance or otherwise give rise to duties that would not otherwise exist.  There exist a brace of theories that respond to such problems including, in addition to negligent misrepresentation, invoked by Cleveland, various forms of estoppel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we think that this case must be affirmed, because, in light of Curtis' own carelessness, a reasonable jury could not under Massachusetts law properly return a verdict for the Clevelands in this case.  We are entitled to affirm on any dispositive ground,  Levy v. Federal Deposit Ins. Co., 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993), since it makes no sense to send a case back to district court when the result is foreordained.  Two different doctrines converge on our result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, as elsewhere, a defendant is liable only if the wrongdoing was the \"proximate\"--as well as the \"but for\" cause of the harm in question.   Peckham v. Continental Casualty Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 830, 836 (1st Cir.1990) (applying Massachusetts law).  The rubric is used to draw a legal line somewhere, along the chain of causation, between the more immediate and foreseeable consequences of a wrong and those that are more remote, unlikely or partly the product of intervening forces.   Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 400 Mass. 837, 842 (1987);  Restatement (Second) of Torts, &#167;&#167; 440, 442 (1965).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that a Hasbro employee made the statement to Curtis, it might be reasonable to anticipate that Curtis could find himself at the plant unable to load the truck, resulting in delay and additional expense (e.g., charges for delayed delivery, inability to carry out other jobs).  Perhaps it might be reasonable to assume that, in the absence of expected help, Curtis would incur added expense to get labor or would even attempt to load the truck himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But to describe the injury itself as proximately caused by the Hasbro statement or resulting lack of help requires more.  It requires that it be reasonably foreseeable that Curtis would then attempt to load the truck in a highly negligent manner.  By his own admission, Curtis ran an extremely heavy load resting on a jacked-up pallet up an inclined ramp into his truck.  He knew that the load was unusually heavy and difficult to maneuver slowly;  that is why he attempted the running start.  It is hard to explain so risky a course in the face of a known hazard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if we assume dubitante that Curtis' negligence was foreseeable enough to satisfy the requirements of proximate cause, compare Restatement, supra, &#167; 443, cmt. c, the Clevelands are still barred from recovery.  Massachusetts has eliminated contributory negligence as a defense but, under its comparative negligence doctrine, it does bar recovery where the victim's negligence exceeds that of the wrongdoer.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 231, &#167; 85.  That is plainly so in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is doubtful that the Clevelands have proffered any substantial proof of negligence by Hasbro.  The statement of its employee, if made at all, was mistaken but there is no indication of fault.  For all we know, Hasbro does often have lumpers available and the employee's prediction may have been perfectly reasonable.  Plaintiffs, although they claim to have charged \"negligent misrepresentation,\" have pointed to no evidence at all of negligence on the part of the employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But assuming arguendo that a rational jury might still be entitled to infer some measure of fault, there is nothing whatever to suggest that Hasbro's fault comes even close to that of Curtis.  Curtis' negligence is patent, serious and beyond reasonable dispute;  Hasbro has at most made a garden variety administrative error, weakly inferable at best and (by any test of foreseeability) only remotely connected to Curtis' own injury.  Bluntly put, Curtis injured himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matters of proximate cause and comparative fault are, as a general rule, for the jury;  but the settled exception to the general rule applies when a reasonable jury could reach only one result.  This is such a case and, without suggesting that the district court was wrong in its broader legal holding, we think that our own ruling on comparative negligence offers a firm and narrow basis for the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., Somerset Savings Bank v.

The Clevelands sued Hasbro for negligence and loss of consortium based upon an injury that Curtis Cleveland suffered while loading toys onto his truck at Hasbro's plant in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts.  The district court ruled, as a matter of law, that Hasbro had never assumed a duty of care owing to the Clevelands.  Our review is plenary, and we take the allegations of facts in the light most favorable to the Clevelands.   See Guzman-Rivera v.
