Appellant Carol Conto\n\nchallenges the summary judgment rulings which led the district\n\ncourt to dismiss her gender and age discrimination claims, as\n\nwell       as   her   sexual    harassment      claim,   against   her    former\n\nemployer, the Concord Hospital (\"the Hospital\"), see 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 621 (Age Discrimination in Employment Act) (\"ADEA\"); 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e (\"Title VII\").           See Conto v. Concord Hosp., Inc., No.\n\n99-166, 2000 WL 1513798 (D.N.H. Sept. 27, 2000).1\n\n                We summarily affirm the district court judgment which\n\ndismissed the gender and age discrimination claims.2               See Jackson\n\nv. United States, 156 F.3d 230, 232 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that\n\nwhere       district    court    issues       “comprehensive,    well-reasoned\n\ndecision,” we may affirm with little or no elaboration).                       Once\n\nthe    Hospital       articulated   a   nondiscriminatory       basis    for   its\n\ndischarge decision, the burden shifted to Conto to prove (at the\n\nvery least) that the reason assigned for her discharge was\n\n\n       1\n     We review summary judgment rulings de novo, after assessing\nthe competent evidence and attendant reasonable inferences in\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Straughn\nv. Delta Airlines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 2000).\n       2\n      Although the record is unclear regarding the timeliness of\nthe discrimination charge filed with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), the Hospital did not raise this\nissue below. Consequently, like the district court, we assume\narguendo that Conto duly exhausted her administrative remedies.\nSee O’Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 725 n.3 (1st\nCir. 2000) (noting that exhaustion of administrative remedies is\nnot a jurisdictional issue, but one which may be waived).\n\n                                          2\n\fpretextual.   See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23,\n\n33-34 (1st Cir. 2000).     The Hospital asserted that Conto was\n\ndischarged due to the fact that she failed, following repeated\n\nwarnings, to perform duties essential to her role as a hospital\n\nsecurity officer.3   As Conto acknowledges these deficiencies and\n\noffered no evidence of pretext on the part of the Hospital, her\n\nage and gender discrimination claims are not actionable.      See\n\nWilliams v. Raytheon Co., 220 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2000).4\n\n         The sexual harassment claim fares no better.         The\n\ndetermination as to whether the Hospital subjected Conto to a\n\nhostile work environment necessarily entailed a fact-specific\n\nassessment of all the attendant circumstances.    See supra note\n\n1; Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).     Yet\n\nthe appellate brief submitted by Conto fails to cite to any\n\n\n    3The Hospital states, inter alia, that Conto repeatedly\nfailed either to report or record vital hospital-security\ninformation, to patrol the daycare center, to observe the no-\nsmoking policy, and to respond in proper fashion to a fire\nalarm.\n    4Conto further contends, to no avail, that despite her\nfailure to prove pretext she adduced other weighty evidence that\nthe Hospital discriminated, such as general remarks by her\nsuperiors and coworkers regarding her age and gender. As Conto\nconcedes, however, remarks by her superiors — that the Hospital\n“wanted her fired” — were not only age-and-gender neutral, but\nplainly based on her poor job performance reports.           See\nStraughn,   250   F.3d   at    36.      Moreover,   remarks   by\nnondecisionmakers generally are not probative of an employer’s\nintent. See Laurin v. Providence Hosp., 150 F.3d 52, 58 (1st\nCir. 1996).\n\n                                3\n\frecord fact material to this factual inquiry.               Instead, Conto\n\ngenerally invites our attention to all the documents submitted\n\nin evidence before the district court.5\n\n            Not   surprisingly,    the   Federal    Rules    of   Appellate\n\nProcedure require that appellants, rather than the courts of\n\nappeals,    ferret    out    and   articulate      the   record    evidence\n\nconsidered material to each legal theory advanced on appeal.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Candelaria-Silva, 162 F.3d 698, 707-\n\n08   (1st    Cir.    1998)    (finding    \"waiver\"       where    appellant\n\n\"request[ed] that we conduct 'a reading of the entire record\n\nwith care,'\" yet failed to spell out pertinent facts in brief);\n\nsee also Michelson v. Digital Fin. Servs., 167 F.3d 715, 719-20\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (observing that counsel are not permitted to\n\n“leav[e] the [appellate] court to do counsel’s work”) (citations\n\nomitted).     As the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure are\n\nsufficiently central to our judicial management responsibilities\n\nto warrant substantial compliance, rather than discretionary\n\ndisregard at the convenience of counsel, Conto's fact-dependent\n\nhostile work environment claim must be deemed waived.\n\n            In all events, however, Conto failed to generate any\n\n\n     5\n     For instance, referencing more than eighty pages of\ndeposition testimony, Conto casually suggests: \"Because of the\nmultiplicity of the incidents which are recounted in those\npages, no specific page reference is given but attention is\ndirected to all those pages.” Brief for Appellant at 8-9.\n\n                                    4\n\fgenuine issue of material fact relating to her hostile work\n\nenvironment claim.      She assertedly witnessed male coworkers\n\nuttering sexually-charged profanities and making obscene bodily\n\ngestures to nurses (or to one another), but never to her.            She\n\nalso states that security department workers repeatedly posed\n\npersonal    questions       regarding     her   celibacy,     romantic\n\nrelationships, and marriage plans.6\n\n           It   was   for   Conto   to   demonstrate   that   (1)   “the\n\nharassment [she experienced during the final four days of her\n\nemployment],7 was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the\n\n\n    6 Conto states that, at unspecified times, male coworkers\nsubjected her to unwanted physical touching, such as slapping\nher buttocks.   The district court initially held that these\nincidents generated a triable issue, assuming arguendo that the\nincidents occurred during the final four days of her employment\n(hence were not time-barred), see infra note 7, then partially\ndenied summary judgment to the Hospital on Conto’s sexual\nharassment claim. Thereafter, however, Conto requested that the\ndistrict court grant the Hospital summary judgment on her entire\nharassment claim, so as to enable entry of an immediately\nappealable final judgment. To that end, she expressly conceded\nthat these physical-touching allegations “more than likely would\nresult [at trial] in a directed verdict for defendant.” Given\nher strategic concession, she may not now revisit these\nallegations on appeal.\n    7 Although her claim was subject to the 180-day EEOC filing\nrequirement, see supra note 2, Conto deferred filing her EEOC\ncharge for 176 days.    Thus, she concedes that only her final\nfour days on the job are material to her appeal. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-5(e)(1); Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am.,\n101 F.3d 218, 221-22 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Provencher v. CVS\nPharmacy, 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing Sabree v.\nUnited Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners, 921 F.2d 396, 401 (1st\nCir. 1990)).\n\n                                    5\n\fconditions of [her] employment,” Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, 145\n\nF.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir. 1998), and (2) that the work environment\n\nwas \"both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a\n\nreasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that\n\n[Conto] in fact did perceive to be so,\"                   Faragher v. City of\n\nBoca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 787 (1998).                 As previously noted,\n\n\"whether         an   environment   is   'hostile'   or    'abusive'   can     be\n\ndetermined only by looking at all the circumstances . . .\n\ninclud[ing] the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its\n\nseverity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,\n\nor a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably\n\ninterferes with an employee's work performance.\"                   Harris, 510\n\nU.S. at 23 (emphasis added).\n\n                 Given the evidentiary record before us, we cannot say\n\nthat       the   Rule   56   evidence    submitted   by    Conto   generated    a\n\ntrialworthy hostile work environment claim under the multi-\n\nfactor test announced in            Harris, supra.        First, the greatly\n\nabbreviated four-day period, during which the Hospital's conduct\n\nremained actionable, substantially undermined Conto’s contention\n\nthat the Hospital's conduct was either sufficiently frequent8 or\n\n\n       8\n     Cf. id. at 23-24 (noting that claimants experienced\nrepeated, unwanted physical touching and demeaning comments for\nover five years); O’Rourke, 235 F.3d at 728 (two years); White\nv. New Hampshire Dep’t of Corrections, 221 F.3d 254, 260 (1st\nCir. 2000) (five months).\n\n                                          6\n\fsevere.9   Second, however insensitive, the inquiries regarding\n\nConto’s personal life were neither \"physically threatening [n]or\n\nhumiliating, [but at most] mere offensive utterance[s].\"               Id.10\n\nFinally, Conto has not demonstrated on appeal that any conduct\n\nto which she was subjected during the actionable four-day period\n\n“unreasonably interfered” with her work performance.            Id.\n\n           Finally,    although     Conto    waived   her   hostile    work\n\nenvironment claim on appeal, its dismissal on the merits would\n\nbe warranted as well, since the             totality of the particular\n\ncircumstances   extant     during   the     actionable   four-day     period\n\npreceding her discharge could not, as a matter of law, have\n\ngenerated a trialworthy issue on the hostile work environment\n\nclaim.\n\n           Affirmed.

Thereafter, however, Conto requested that the  district court grant the Hospital summary judgment on her entire  harassment claim, so as to enable entry of an immediately  appealable final judgment.  To that end, she expressly conceded  that these physical-touching allegations \"more than likely would  result [at trial] in a directed verdict for defendant.\"  Given  her strategic concession, she may not now revisit these  allegations on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although her claim was subject to the 180-day EEOC filing  requirement, see supra note 2, Conto deferred filing her EEOC  charge for 176 days.

Once  the Hospital articulated a nondiscriminatory basis for its  discharge decision, the burden shifted to Conto to prove (at the  very least) that the reason assigned for her discharge was  pretextual.  See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span>,  33-34 (1st Cir. 2000).  The Hospital asserted that Conto was  discharged due to the fact that she failed, following repeated  warnings, to perform duties essential to her role as a hospital  security officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As Conto acknowledges these deficiencies and  offered no evidence of pretext on the part of the Hospital, her  age and gender discrimination claims are not actionable.  See Williams v. Raytheon Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199010\"><a href=\"/opinion/199010/williams-v-raytheon/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sexual harassment claim fares no better.  The  determination as to whether the Hospital subjected Conto to a  hostile work environment necessarily entailed a fact-specific  assessment of all the attendant circumstances.  See supra note  1; Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1993).  Yet  the appellate brief submitted by Conto fails to cite to any  record fact material to this factual inquiry.  Instead, Conto  generally invites our attention to all the documents submitted  in evidence before the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, the Federal Rules of Appellate  Procedure require that appellants, rather than the courts of  appeals, ferret out and articulate the record evidence  considered material to each legal theory advanced on appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Candelaria-Silva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198241\"><a href=\"/opinion/198241/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 707-08 (1st Cir. 1998) (finding \"waiver\" where appellant  \"request[ed] that we conduct 'a reading of the entire record with care,'\" yet failed to spell out pertinent facts in brief); see also Michelson v. Digital Fin. Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198328\"><a href=\"/opinion/198328/michelson-v-digital-financial/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 719-20  (1st Cir. 1999) (observing that counsel are not permitted to  \"leav[e] the [appellate] court to do counsel's work\") (citations  omitted).  As the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure are  sufficiently central to our judicial management responsibilities  to warrant substantial compliance, rather than discretionary  disregard at the convenience of counsel, Conto's fact-dependent  hostile work environment claim must be deemed waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, however, Conto failed to generate any  genuine issue of material fact relating to her hostile work  environment claim.  She assertedly witnessed male coworkers  uttering sexually-charged profanities and making obscene bodily  gestures to nurses (or to one another), but never to her.  She  also states that security department workers repeatedly posed  personal questions regarding her celibacy, romantic  relationships, and marriage plans.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was for Conto to demonstrate that (1) \"the  harassment [she experienced during the final four days of her  employment],<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the  conditions of [her] employment,\" Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754633\"><a href=\"/opinion/754633/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1569-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45393-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1998), and (2) that the work environment  was \"both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a  reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that  [Conto] in fact did perceive to be so,\"  Faragher v. City of  Boca Raton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 787 (1998).  As previously noted,  \"whether an environment is 'hostile' or 'abusive' can be  determined only by looking at all the circumstances . . .  includ[ing] the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its  severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,  or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably  interferes with an employee's work performance.\"  Harris, 510  U.S. at 23 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the evidentiary record before us, we cannot say  that the Rule 56 evidence submitted by Conto generated a  trial worthy hostile work environment claim under the multi-factor test announced in Harris, supra.  First, the greatly  abbreviated four-day period, during which the Hospital's conduct  remained actionable, substantially undermined Conto's contention  that the Hospital's conduct was either sufficiently frequent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> or  severe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Second, however insensitive, the inquiries regarding  Conto's personal life were neither \"physically threatening [n]or  humiliating, [but at most] mere offensive utterance[s].\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Finally, Conto has not demonstrated on appeal that any conduct  to which she was subjected during the actionable four-day period  \"unreasonably interfered\" with her work performance.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although Conto waived her hostile work  environment claim on appeal, its dismissal on the merits would  be warranted as well, since the totality of the particular circumstances extant during the actionable four-day period  preceding her discharge could not, as a matter of law, have  generated a trial worthy issue on the hostile work environment  claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.  Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We review summary judgment rulings de novo, after assessing  the competent evidence and attendant reasonable inferences in  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See Straughn v. Delta Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span>, 33 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although the record is unclear regarding the timeliness of  the discrimination charge filed with the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), the Hospital did not raise this  issue below.  Consequently, like the district court, we assume arguendo that Conto duly exhausted her administrative remedies. See O'Rourke v. City of Providence, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></span>, 725 n.3 (1st  Cir. 2000) (noting that exhaustion of administrative remedies is  not a jurisdictional issue, but one which may be waived).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Hospital states, inter alia, that Conto repeatedly  failed either to report or record vital hospital-security  information, to patrol the daycare center, to observe the no-smoking policy, and to respond in proper fashion to a fire  alarm.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Conto further contends, to no avail, that despite her  failure to prove pretext she adduced other weighty evidence that  the Hospital discriminated, such as general remarks by her  superiors and coworkers regarding her age and gender.  As Conto  concedes, however, remarks by her superiors -- that the Hospital  \"wanted her fired\" -- were not only age-and-gender neutral, but  plainly based on her poor job performance reports.  See Straughn, 250 F.3d at 36.  Moreover, remarks by  nondecisionmakers generally are not probative of an employer's  intent.  See Laurin v.
