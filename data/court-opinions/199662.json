Ana Matos brought this action to recover\n\nfor the death of her husband, Joaquim Matos, who drowned after\n\nfalling off the F/V Lutador, a commercial fishing vessel owned\n\nby defendant Silva Fishing Corporation.      Joaquim Matos was a\n\nmate aboard the vessel.    The captain was Jose Silva, president\n\nof Silva Fishing.\n\n          Early on the morning of October 10, 1997, Joaquim Matos\n\nnoticed that some wires attached to the vessel's trawl doors\n\nwere tangled.   The doors, located in the aft of the vessel, are\n\nused to keep the fishing net open while it is dragged through\n\nthe water.   Matos informed Silva, who took over the controls of\n\nthe vessel and a winch used to operate the doors.       With the\n\nassistance of Silva and two other crewmembers, Matos was able to\n\nuntangle the wires, but the starboard-side door got caught on a\n\nchain.   Matos signaled Silva to raise and lower the doors with\n\nthe winch, but this effort did not free the door from the chain.\n\n          On his own initiative, Matos placed one foot on the\n\nrailing of the vessel and one foot on the starboard side door,\n\nwhich was partially submerged in the water.    Using a hammer he\n\npounded the chain trying to loosen it from the door.   Silva, who\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fwas at the front of the vessel at the time, yelled at Matos to\n\nget off the door and back into the boat because he feared Matos\n\nmight get hurt, but Matos either did not hear him or simply\n\nignored the order.         As Matos was hammering, the door suddenly\n\ndropped and he fell into the water.\n\n             A crewmember threw an unattached life ring into the\n\nwater, but it landed 20 feet from Matos and Matos did not try to\n\nswim toward it.         Silva turned the vessel toward Matos, coming\n\nwithin four feet of him.            A deckhand threw Matos another life\n\nring which landed one or two feet from him, but again Matos was\n\nunresponsive.      Before the deckhand could jump into the water,\n\nMatos submerged and disappeared, only seven minutes after he\n\nfell off the vessel.\n\n             Ana Matos contended at trial that Silva Fishing was\n\nnegligent under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. ยง 688 (1994), in\n\nfailing to provide her husband a safe workplace and in failing\n\nto conduct a proper rescue operation once he fell overboard and\n\nthat   the     vessel   was   unseaworthy       in   several   respects   under\n\ngeneral maritime law.           In a special verdict, the jury found\n\ninter alia that the defendant, Silva Fishing, was not negligent,\n\nand    that,    although      the   F/V    Lutador    was   unseaworthy,    its\n\nunseaworthiness was not a proximate cause of Matos' death.                   It\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\falso found that Matos' own negligence was a 95 percent cause of\n\nhis death.\n\n          On appeal, Matos challenges the jury instructions that\n\nwere given and the qualifications of Silva Fishing's expert.             We\n\nreject her claims for reasons explained below.         Because most of\n\nAna Matos' arguments parallel those that we recently considered\n\nand rejected in Hopkins v. Jordan Marine, Inc., 1st Cir., No. 01-\n\n1027, Oct. 29, 2001, we rely primarily upon our discussion in\n\nthat case.        Matos     first   argues     that the district court\n\neffectively allowed assumption of the risk as a defense when it\n\ntold the jury that \"[a] seaman, when he enters upon his calling,\n\nmust assume the unavoidable risks of his occupation\" and may not\n\nrecover for \"the normal hazards of his business.\"               It is true\n\nthat assumption of the risk is not a bar to recovery, either for\n\nunseaworthiness or under the Jones Act, see Hopkins, slip op. at\n\n4; but the now disgarded doctrine does not forbid use of the\n\nwords \"assume\" or \"risk.\"\n\n          Rather, as Hopkins explains, assumption of the risk was\n\na doctrine that precluded a plaintiff from recovering, even\n\nwhere   the   owner   was   shown   to    be   negligent   or    the   ship\n\nunseaworthy, because the plaintiff had known of the action or\n\ncondition and \"assumed the risk\" by continuing to work.            No such\n\ninstruction was given here.     The complained of instruction, read\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fin full, merely said that there was no liability if no one was\n\nat   fault   and        the    accident      was    simply     one    of   those   normal\n\nincidents of life at sea.1\n\n             Matos        also     complains         that      the    instruction        on\n\ncontributory negligence contained error and that the charge on\n\nnegligence        did    not     sufficiently         stress    the     extent     of    the\n\nobligation.        But the charge on negligence gave the substance of\n\nwhat Matos says should have been included.                       And given the jury\n\nfinding that unseaworthiness did not cause the harm (which\n\ndisposed     of    one        claim)   and    the    finding     that      there   was   no\n\nnegligence        (which       disposed      of     the   other),     the    95    percent\n\nallocation of blame to Joaquim Matos was beside the point.\n\n             In a final criticism of the instructions, Ana Matos\n\nsays that the court erred in telling the jury that an act or\n\nomission is the cause of an injury or death if the harms would\n\nnot have happened \"but for\" the act or omission.                            The argument\n\nis that the jury may have been misled into thinking, wrongly,\n\nsee Hopkins, slip op. at 7, that the defendant's act or omission\n\nhad to be the sole cause.                    However, the district court twice\n\n\n\n      1\n      The instruction reads (emphasis added): \"A seaman, when he\nenters upon his calling, must assume the unavoidable risks of\nhis occupation, as all persons must, and no person may recover\nfor injuries resulting from unavoidable risks. If the seaman is\ninjured or killed without the fault of anyone else, but part of\nthe normal hazards of his business, he may not recover.\"\n\n                                              -5-\n\ftold the jury explicitly that it was enough if the defendant's\n\nnegligence (in one case) or act or omission (in the other)\n\n\"played any part, no matter how small,\" in bringing about the\n\ninjury.2\n\n           Finally, Ana Matos says that the district judge abused\n\nher discretion in allowing Silva Fishing's expert to testify.\n\nThe main objection is that although a former Coast Guard officer\n\nand long a marine surveyor and accident investigator, the expert\n\nhad never served in a commercial fishing operation.   This is not\n\nonly the same objection, but also the same expert who testified\n\nin Hopkins; and our decision in Hopkins applies equally in this\n\ncase.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n     In its instruction, the district court told the jury that\nproximate cause existed if an act or omission \"played any part,\nno matter how small, in bringing about or actually causing the\ninjury.\"\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
