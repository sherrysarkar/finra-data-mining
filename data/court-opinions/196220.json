London Egemonye was indicted in\r                                      \r\n\n1993 under  a multi-count indictment charging  him and others\r\n\nwith conspiracy and other offenses relating to the possession\r\n\nand  use  of  other people's  credit  cards.    18 U.S.C.    \r\n\n1029(a)(2)(trafficking,    fraud    and   use),    1029(a)(3)\r\n\n(possession with intent to defraud), 1029(b)(2) (conspiracy).\r\n\nOn June  10,  1994,  Egemonye entered  guilty  pleas  to  all\r\n\ncounts,  and he now appeals from his sentence arguing that it\r\n\nis flawed  by  the government's  manipulation  of  sentencing\r\n\nfactors and by an improper computation of loss.\r\n\n     Because  there  was  no   trial,  we  derive  the  facts\r\n\nprimarily from the recitations at  the plea hearing, from the\r\n\npresentence report,  and from  submissions at  the sentencing\r\n\nhearing.  United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 192-93 (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir.  1992).     The  case arose  out  of  a sting  operation\r\n\nconducted  by a joint  federal-state task force investigating\r\n\ncredit card and other financial fraud in  Massachusetts.  The\r\n\ncritical events took place in January and February 1993.\r\n\n     Robert  Leslie,  who was  cooperating  with authorities,\r\n\nintroduced Egemonye  to an undercover state  trooper known to\r\n\nboth  only as \"Kathy.\"   On January 21,  1993, Kathy supplied\r\n\nEgemonye  with two  BayBank MasterCard  credit cards  and one\r\n\nBayBank Visa  credit card with  an aggregate credit  limit of\r\n\n$7,450  for all  three  cards.   Egemonye then  created false\r\n\ndriver's  licenses  in the  credit-card  names, each  license\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nbearing  Leslie's  photograph,  and  drove  Leslie  to  three\r\n\ndifferent banks to obtain cash advances of $6,900.  \r\n\n     Egemonye purchased four more  credit cards from Kathy on\r\n\nJanuary 29, 1993,  and four more  on February 2,  1993.   The\r\n\naggregate limits  on the cards  in the two  transactions were\r\n\n$21,000  and   $14,000,  respectively.    In   between  these\r\n\ntransactions,  several  of  the  cards were  used  to  obtain\r\n\nadvances  from   banks,  and  Egemonye  and   others  in  the\r\n\nconspiracy engineered  deposits  of some  stolen checks  into\r\n\naccounts  of individual  card holders  to boost  the depleted\r\n\ncredit available for those cards.\r\n\n     Until the fourth transaction,  Kathy made the \"sales\" in\r\n\nexchange for a share of  the proceeds, but on February  5 she\r\n\nproposed that  she be paid  a flat  $200 per card.   Egemonye\r\n\nsaid, \"I'm not going  to buy one card for two  hundred. . . .\r\n\nIt has to be like ten.\"  On February 10,  Kathy told Egemonye\r\n\nthat she expected to receive a number of cards that day, that\r\n\nEgemonye should bring $2,000 for 10 cards, and that she would\r\n\n\"front\" (finance) any additional cards and accept payment for\r\n\nthem later.   Egemonye agreed, subject to his  examination of\r\n\nthe cards.\r\n\n     When Kathy  and Egemonye met later that  day, Kathy said\r\n\nthat  she had a bag full  of cards and asked Egemonye whether\r\n\nhe knew  of another buyer  if he did not  want them all.   He\r\n\nsaid, \"I  probably can  handle them,\"  and proceeded to  give\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nKathy $2,000 down, and a promise of $6,000 more later, for 40\r\n\nHousehold  Bank  Visa and  MasterCard  credit  cards with  an\r\n\naggregate  limit   of  $200,000.     Egemonye  was   arrested\r\n\nimmediately thereafter, followed  by the indictment  and plea\r\n\nalready described.\r\n\n     At  sentencing, the  district court  increased the  base\r\n\noffense  level of 6 by 8 additional levels because the \"loss\"\r\n\nattributed  by  the  court  to Egemonye  was  over  $200,000.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2F1.1(a), (b)(1)(H).  The court computed the loss\r\n\nat $242,950,  representing the aggregate credit  limit of the\r\n\n51   credit  cards   purchased   from  Kathy   in  the   four\r\n\ntransactions.  The  offense level was then  adjusted in other\r\n\nrespects,  not here  in dispute,  and Egemonye  was sentenced\r\n\nwithin the guideline range to 37 months' imprisonment.\r\n\n     1. On appeal, Egemonye's first claim is directed  at the\r\n\n40  cards supplied to him in the final transaction.  Egemonye\r\n\ncontends  that   including  these   40  cards  in   the  loss\r\n\ncalculation condones \"blatant sentencing  factor manipulation\r\n\nengaged in by the investigating agents\" and is a violation of\r\n\nconstitutional due process.   He relies on several decisions,\r\n\nincluding United  States v. Connell,  960 F.2d 191,  196 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1992).\r\n\n     We have recently had occasion to discuss Connell and the\r                                                                 \r\n\nother  decisions   in  this  circuit   that  have   addressed\r\n\nsentencing  factor manipulation.   United States  v. Montoya,\r                                                                        \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nNo. 94-1666, et al.,  (1st Cir. July 27, 1995).   Summarizing\r                               \r\n\nthe prior cases,  we said that \"where government  agents have\r\n\nimproperly enlarged  the scope  or scale  of the  crime,\" the\r                      \r\n\nsentencing  court   has  power   to   exclude  \"the   tainted\r\n\ntransaction\" from the guideline computations and for purposes\r\n\nof  any mandatory  minimum  statute.   Montoya, slip  op. 6-7\r                                                          \r\n\n(quoting in part Connell, 960 F.2d at 195).  \r                                    \r\n\n     However, recognizing the  broad latitude allowed to  the\r\n\ngovernment  in   investigating  and  suppressing   crime,  we\r\n\nstressed  that  it  was  only  \"extraordinary  misconduct\" by\r\n\nagents that could give rise to such an exclusion, which would\r\n\noccur  in the  teeth of  a statute  or guideline  approved by\r\n\nCongress.   Montoya, slip op. at 7-8, (quoting in part United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Gibbens, 25 F.3d 28,  31 (1st Cir. 1994)).   While\r                              \r\n\nsomething less than a constitutional violation might suffice,\r\n\nas  extraordinary misconduct,  Egemonye's  reference  to  due\r\n\nprocess concepts is certainly in the ballpark.\r\n\n     In Montoya, as in previous cases, we refused to lay down\r                           \r\n\nfixed rules to define  sentence factor manipulation, but said\r\n\nthat the focus is normally upon the conduct of the government\r\n\nrather  than the defendant.  Slip op. at 8.  Indeed, Egemonye\r\n\ndoes not  claim that his will  was overborne or deny  that he\r\n\nwas predisposed to the offense.  What Egemonye claims is that\r\n\nthe  fourth transaction  had  no legitimate  law  enforcement\r\n\npurpose and was designed solely to boost his federal sentence\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nbecause government agents were unhappy with lenient treatment\r\n\nthat Egemonye earlier received in state court. \r\n\n     There is some  basis for the suggestion  that task force\r\n\nagents  were  unhappy   with  Egemonye's  prior   record  and\r\n\nbelieved,  in  the  words of  one  of  the  agents, \"that  he\r\n\n[earlier]  got off lightly for his  criminal activity.\"  That\r\n\ncriminal record, according to the agent just quoted, involved\r\n\na  history of  credit card  fraud by  Egemonye that  could be\r\n\ntraced back  to 1990 and  involved a number  of transactions.\r\n\nOn this appeal, the government is prepared to assume arguendo\r                                                                         \r\n\nthat the background  facts, \"viewed collectively,  could call\r\n\nthe government's motives into question to some extent.\"    \r\n\n     Nonetheless,  the  government says  that  multiple sales\r\n\nwere clearly appropriate in  order to identify Egemonye's co-\r\n\nconspirators, which they  did.  As  to the final  sale of  40\r\n\ncards, the  government  insists  that it  too  \"had  a  valid\r\n\ninvestigatory purpose\"  which was \"to  explore the parameters\r\n\nof  the defendant's criminality.\"  Egemonye's counsel replies\r\n\nthat this \"parameters\" explanation  has no real substance and\r\n\ncould  be used to enlarge a defendant's sentence to virtually\r\n\nany height whatever.  We think that Egemonye's reply has some\r\n\nforce but overstates the matter.\r\n\n     There  is, it  should  be stressed,  no indication  that\r\n\nEgemonye was coerced or  pressured to achieve a new  level of\r\n\ncrime.   True,  the  fourth sale  was  much larger  than  the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nearlier  ones; but agent Kathy did  not force the 40 cards on\r\n\nEgemonye.   On the contrary, he  had insisted on  at least 10\r\n\ncards for  the new $200 per  card payment (\"I'm not  going to\r\n\nbuy one card for two hundred. . . .  It has to be like ten.\")\r\n\nAnd when offered a  bag full of cards--with the  request that\r\n\nhe  recommend another  buyer  for those  he did  not want--he\r\n\nresponded, \"I probably can handle them,\" and took them all.\r\n\n     Government  agents  are  not  limited to  replicating  a\r\n\nsuspect's largest  unsolicited crime.  In this case, the full\r\n\ncontours  of  the criminal  operation--its  size, techniques,\r\n\npersonnel--were,  like an iceberg, largely submerged; and the\r\n\nmeans of exploration were additional and larger transactions.\r\n\nThe first three transactions  clearly served this purpose and\r\n\nthe fourth,  even though followed immediately  by the arrest,\r\n\nprovided  air-tight evidence  for trial  that Egemonye  was a\r\n\nsignificant dealer and not a petty swindler.  While the sting\r\n\ncould not be endlessly prolonged and enlarged, nothing in the\r\n\nobjective facts  suggests  \"misconduct\"  at  all,  let  alone\r\n\n\"extraordinary misconduct.\"\r\n\n     The question, then, is whether the fourth transaction is\r\n\ntainted by  the agents'  subjective motives.   The  pallet in\r\n\nsuch  matters contains  not blacks and  whites but  shades of\r\n\ngray.   Motives may be mixed;  good and bad motives are often\r\n\nmatters of degree; and there can be multiple actors.  Whether\r\n\nto consider subjective  motive at all  presents a problem  of\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\npolicy.  Compare  Harlow v. Fitzgerald,  457 U.S. 800  (1982)\r                                                  \r\n\n(refusing  to  do  so  in the  qualified  immunity  context).\r\n\nStill, we  would be  greatly concerned if  evidence otherwise\r\n\navailable  showed that a plainly improper subjective motive--\r\n\nsay,  racial hostility  or personal  animus--had  enlarged or\r\n\nprolonged the sting.\r\n\n     But this is not such a case.  About the most that can be\r\n\nderived from the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in\r\n\nfavor of Egemonye, is  that the agents thought that  Egemonye\r\n\nwas an established and  unrepentant defrauder who had escaped\r\n\nserious  punishment for  a  series of  past, similar  frauds.\r\n\nWith  this in  mind, they  conducted a  sting operation  that\r\n\ninvolved no  pressure whatever  on Egemonye, lasted  for only\r\n\nfour transactions,  and  garnered several  other  defendants.\r\n\nThe first three transactions involved 11 cards; the last one,\r\n\n40.  This is a sizeable jump but hardly extraordinary.\r\n\n     That   agents  considered  Egemonye's   past  record  in\r\n\nselecting  him  for  overtures   by  the  task  force  is   a\r\n\ncommonplace   of  law  enforcement.    Undercover  operations\r\n\nfrequently target those  who are suspected of crime,  and the\r\n\nrecent history of fraudulent  activities gave the agents some\r\n\nreason to think  that Egemonye was  not only predisposed  but\r\n\nactively   engaged.    Fed.   R.  Evid.  404(a),  restricting\r\n\ncharacter  evidence to show propensity, is  a rule for trials\r\n\nand not the conduct of police investigations.  At  worst, the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nagents went  too far if  and to the extent  that they thought\r\n\nthemselves entitled  to make  up for any  shortfall in  prior\r\n\npunishments.  But the line is thin and blurred between such a\r\n\ndubious  motive and  a  simple  desire  to  be  sure  that  a\r\n\ncommitted  criminal is  caught  and tried  for a  substantial\r\n\noffense  based on  unshakeable  evidence.   And,  as we  have\r\n\nalready  held, Egemonye  was  legitimately  targeted and  the\r\n\nsting  objectively  reasonable   in  extent.    Under   these\r\n\ncircumstances,  even assuming that  the agents'  motives were\r\n\nmixed  and  not of  crystalline purity,  we see  nothing that\r\n\nwould require a curtailment of the sentence.\r\n\n     2.  Egemonye's second challenge to his sentence concerns\r\n\nthe district court's computation of loss.  As already  noted,\r\n\nthe governing  guideline keys the offense  level primarily to\r\n\n\"the loss\" caused by the offense, U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(1)(loss\r\n\ntable),  but goes  on to  provide (id.,  comment  (n.7)) that\r                                                  \r\n\nintended loss should  be used  if it is  greater than  actual\r\n\nloss:\r\n\n     Consistent  with the provisions of  2X1.1 (Attempt,\r\n     Solicitation  or Conspiracy),  if an  intended loss\r\n     that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be\r\n     determined,  this  figure will  be  used  if it  is\r\n     greater than the actual  loss. . . .   For example,\r\n     if the fraud consisted  of selling or attempting to\r\n     sell $40,000 in  worthless securities .  . . .  the\r\n     loss would be $40,000.\r\n\n     In  accord with  the  presentence  report, the  district\r\n\ncourt  in this case  attributed to Egemonye  an intended loss\r\n\nequal to the aggregate limits  of the purchased credit cards.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nA reading of  the transcript indicates  that the judge  found\r\n\nthat Egemonye was capable of and intended to use the cards to\r\n\nsecure amounts at or virtually at their aggregate limits.  We\r\n\nreview  such a  factual determination  only for  clear error,\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Pavao, 948  F.2d 74,  77 (1st  Cir. 1991),\r                                    \r\n\nreserving for closer scrutiny a buried legal issue shortly to\r\n\nbe described.\r\n\n     On the factual issue of intended use and capability, the\r\n\ngovernment bears the burden  of proof because an increase  in\r\n\nthe offense level was sought, see United States v. Sklar, 920\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 107,  112  (1st Cir.  1990),  but the  guideline  itself\r\n\ncautions  that a  reasonable estimate  of loss  will suffice.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1 comment. (n.8).  Egemonye begins by pointing\r\n\nout that he realized  only about 53 percent of  the aggregate\r\n\ncard limits  from  the  cards  involved in  the  first  three\r\n\ntransactions  and nothing  at all  from the  final  bagful of\r\n\ncards since he was apprehended almost immediately.  He argues\r\n\nthat to predict a 100 percent recovery is simply unrealistic.\r\n\n     Unfortunately  for  Egemonye,   there  was   affirmative\r\n\nevidence  that he  instructed his  runners  at the  outset to\r\n\nprocure cash\r\n\nfrom  the banks  at  or virtually  at the  card  limits.   In\r\n\naddition, he arranged  for the deposit of  stolen checks into\r\n\nsome of the accounts, in  order to refresh their limits.   By\r\n\nthis means, some of  the accounts could have been  milked for\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\namounts  in excess of their aggregate limits.  The 53 percent\r\n\nfigure represented only the  amount that Egemonye had secured\r\n\nat the time his scheme was interrupted by arrest.  See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Strozier, 981 F.2d 281, 284 (7th Cir. 1992).\r                              \r\n\n     In  sum, taking  the issue  purely as  a factual  one of\r\n\nintent  and capability, we do  not think that  on this record\r\n\nthe use of the aggregate card limits as a measure of intended\r\n\nand  potential loss was  clearly erroneous.   Where  there is\r\n\ngood evidence  of actual intent and some prospect of success,\r\n\nwe do not think that a court needs to engage  in more refined\r\n\nforecasts of just how successful the scheme was likely to be.\r\n\nSee United States v. Lorenzo, 995 F.2d 1448, 1460 (9th Cir.),\r                                        \r\n\ncert. denied,  114 S. Ct. 225  (1993).  The  situation may be\r                        \r\n\nquite difficult where intent must be inferred solely from the\r\n\nlikely effects of the scheme.  See United States v. Stern, 13\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 489 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n     But there is a  wrinkle.  There is a  cross-reference in\r\n\nU.S.S.G.     2F1.1's  application  note 7  (quoted  above  in\r\n\npertinent  part) to U.S.S.G.    2X1.1; and there  is a second\r\n\nsuch cross-reference  in application note 9,  which reads (in\r\n\npertinent part): \r\n\n     \"In  the  case  of  a partially  completed  offense\r\n     (e.g., an  offense involving a completed fraud that\r\n     is part of a  larger, attempted fraud), the offense\r\n     level is  to be  determined in accordance  with the\r\n     provisions of   2X1.1 . . .  whether the conviction\r\n     is  for  the  substantive  offense,   the  inchoate\r\n     offense  . . ., or both.\"\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nEgemonye's  counsel  argues  that  section   2X1.1,  and  the\r\n\ndiscount it makes available, apply in this case.\r\n\n     U.S.S.G.     2X1.1  is  concerned  with  determining the\r\n\noffense  level for an attempt or conspiracy; and this it sets\r                                                       \r\n\nat  three  levels  less  than   the  offense  level  for  the\r\n\nsubstantive  offense--unless   the  defendant  (or   his  co-\r\n\nconspirators)  have  completed  all   of  the  acts  believed\r\n\nnecessary  for  the substantive  offense  or  were \"about  to\r\n\ncomplete all such acts\"  when apprehended.  For cases  within\r\n\nthe   \"unless\"  clause--which  the  background  comment  says\r\n\nrepresent   \"most\"   cases--there   is   no   such  discount.\r\n\nEffectively, the  guideline gives the defendant a three-level\r\n\ndiscount  if   he  is  some  distance   from  completing  the\r\n\nsubstantive crime.\r\n\n     Read  literally, section  2X1.1 is  not relevant  to the\r\n\npresent case  because 14  of the  15 counts against  Egemonye\r\n\ninvolved   completed   substantive  offenses,   ranging  from\r\n\ntrafficking in unauthorized  credit cards to  producing false\r\n\ndriver's  licenses, and  the conspiracy  thus  embraced fully\r\n\ncompleted  crimes.  On the other hand, the cross-reference to\r\n\nsection 2X1.1 in section 2F1.1 arguably connects the intended\r\n\nloss  concept to  the  attempt guideline,  and section  2X1.1\r\n\nblurs the matter further  with the following application note\r\n\n(comment. (n.4)), providing (in pertinent part):\r\n\n     In  certain  cases,   the  participants  may   have\r\n     completed . . . . all of the acts necessary for the\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n     successful completion of part,  but not all, of the\r\n     intended offense.  In such cases, the offense level\r\n     for the count (or group of closely related multiple\r\n     counts) is  whichever of the following  is greater:\r\n     the offense level for  the intended offense minus 3\r\n     levels . . . or  the offense level for the part  of\r\n     the offense  for  which  the  necessary  acts  were\r\n     completed  . . . .  For example, where the intended\r\n     offense  was   the  theft   of  $800,000  but   the\r\n     participants   completed  .  .   .  only  the  acts\r\n     necessary to  steal $30,000,  the offense  level is\r\n     the offense level for the theft of $800,000 minus 3\r\n     levels,  or  the offense  level  for  the theft  of\r\n     $30,000, whichever is greater.\r\n\n     Interpreting  these  provisions  is  a  matter  of  some\r\n\ndifficulty,  and the  only cases  in point  are in  conflict.\r\n\nCompare United  States v. Watkins,  994 F.2d  1192 (6th  Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1993)  with United States v. Strozier, 981 F.2d 281 (7th Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1992)  The problem, in a nutshell, is that section 2X1.1  has\r\n\non  its  face  nothing to  do  with  a  completed substantive\r\n\noffense or a conspiracy that has  been carried to completion.\r\n\nOn the other hand, the notion of a discount could be extended\r                                                                         \r\n\nfrom the case of an incomplete offense to that of a completed\r\n\noffense where intended harm  is part of the calculus  and the\r\n\nharm is only partly completed.\r\n\n     Recognizing the question to be close, we are inclined to\r\n\nstand by the  literal language of the guidelines that directs\r\n\nsection 2X1.1 to cases where the substantive  offense has not\r\n\nbeen completed.  E.g., United States v. Sung, 51 F.3d 92 (7th\r                                                        \r\n\nCir.  1995).  The argument for a discount for inchoate crimes\r\n\nis  obvious; the defendant  has started down  the road toward\r\n\nthe  substantive crime  but  has not  gotten  there yet  and,\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nwhatever his intention, might still turn back before crossing\r\n\nthe  line.   By  contrast, Egemonye  did  cross the  line and\r\n\ncommit  the  substantive crime  by  acquiring  the cards  and\r\n\nmaking  the  false documents,  so  the basic  purpose  of the\r\n\nsection 2X1.1 discount has nothing to do with him.\r\n\n     Where  a completed  offense  is involved,  it is  surely\r\n\nrational to measure  culpability in part by the intended harm\r\n\nand to refuse a  discount where the offense is  complete even\r\n\nthough  the intended  harm has  not yet been  fully realized.\r\n\nFrom the standpoint of  moral guilt, and dangerousness, there\r\n\nis  little to distinguish such  a defendant from  one who has\r\n\nactually  inflicted  the same  amount of  harm.   And  we are\r\n\ninfluenced  in part by the fact that the case law calculating\r\n\nsentences  based  on intended  harm,  most  of it  admittedly\r\n\nwithout making reference to section 2X1.1, is consistent with\r\n\nthis view.   E.g., United States v.  Guyon, 27 F.3d  723 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir. 1994); United States v. Resurreccion, 978  F.2d 759 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1992).  \r\n\n     Of course, there would be nothing irrational in deciding\r\n\nthat  actual harm is worse than intended harm and providing a\r\n\nthree-level discount  wherever the  sentence for  a completed\r\n\noffense is  measured in part by  intended harm.  But  this is\r\n\nnot  in general the philosophy of the guidelines; if it were,\r\n\npossession  of  drugs  with  intent to  distribute  would  be\r\n\npunished  less harshly than the  actual sale of an equivalent\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\namount.    The  wrinkle of  section  2X1.1  cannot be  ironed\r\n\ncompletely smooth, but the pertinent language  already quoted\r\n\ncan in fact be squared with our result.\r\n\n     Thus, the cross-references  in section 2F1.1  are easily\r\n\nexplained; they do invoke the discount, or the possibility of\r\n\na  discount, where the underlying crime  is merely an attempt\r\n\nor conspiracy.  Application  note 4 in section 2X1.1  is less\r\n\neasily reconciled; but we think the difference is that in the\r\n\ntheft  case, there  is no  completed crime  as to  the larger\r\n\namount  but  only  (in  substance)  an  attempt.    Here,  by\r\n\ncontrast, all 51 of  the cards were the subject  of completed\r\n\ncrimes.\r\n\n     Egemonye's remaining  claim as to loss is  to argue that\r\n\nno  consideration  should be  given to  the  40 cards  in the\r\n\nfourth transaction,  or at least  to the unexpected  30 cards\r\n\n(over and above the  ten cards Egemonye requested).   This is\r\n\nlargely  a restatement  of the  claim that  sentencing factor\r\n\nmanipulation occurred.  Having  rejected that claim, we think\r\n\nthat--from  the standpoint  of  intended  loss--Egemonye  can\r\n\nfairly be charged with intending to inflict loss as to all of\r\n\nthe cards.\r\n\n     Both issues  in this  case are difficult  and important.\r\n\nWe  are thus  especially  indebted to  counsel  for the  able\r\n\nbriefing  and   argument  presented  on  both   sides.    The\r\n\nSentencing  Commission's  attention  will  be  drawn  to  the\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\narguable  lack of  clarity in  the interplay  between section\r\n\n2F1.1 and section 2X1.1.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n",

Secs. 1029(a)(2) (trafficking, fraud and use), 1029(a)(3) (possession with intent to defraud), 1029(b)(2) (conspiracy).  On June 10, 1994, Egemonye entered guilty pleas to all counts, and he now appeals from his sentence arguing that it is flawed by the government's manipulation of sentencing factors and by an improper computation of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there was no trial, we derive the facts primarily from the recitations at the plea hearing, from the presentence report, and from submissions at the sentencing hearing.  United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 192-93 (1st Cir.1992).  The case arose out of a sting operation conducted by a joint federal-state task force investigating credit card and other financial fraud in Massachusetts.  The critical events took place in January and February 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert Leslie, who was cooperating with authorities, introduced Egemonye to an undercover state trooper known to both only as \"Kathy.\"   On January 21, 1993, Kathy supplied Egemonye with two BayBank MasterCard credit cards and one BayBank Visa credit card with an aggregate credit limit of $7,450 for all three cards.  Egemonye then created false driver's licenses in the credit-card names, each license bearing Leslie's photograph, and drove Leslie to three different banks to obtain cash advances of $6,900.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egemonye purchased four more credit cards from Kathy on January 29, 1993, and four more on February 2, 1993.  The aggregate limits on the cards in the two transactions were $21,000 and $14,000, respectively.  In between these transactions, several of the cards were used to obtain advances from banks, and Egemonye and others in the conspiracy engineered deposits of some stolen checks into accounts of individual card holders to boost the depleted credit available for those cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until the fourth transaction, Kathy made the \"sales\" in exchange for a share of the proceeds, but on February 5 she proposed that she be paid a flat $200 per card.  Egemonye said, \"I'm not going to buy one card for two hundred....  It has to be like ten.\"   On February 10, Kathy told Egemonye that she expected to receive a number of cards that day, that Egemonye should bring $2,000 for 10 cards, and that she would \"front\" (finance) any additional cards and accept payment for them later.  Egemonye agreed, subject to his examination of the cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Kathy and Egemonye met later that day, Kathy said that she had a bag full of cards and asked Egemonye whether he knew of another buyer if he did not want them all.  He said, \"I probably can handle them,\" and proceeded to give Kathy $2,000 down, and a promise of $6,000 more later, for 40 Household Bank Visa and MasterCard credit cards with an aggregate limit of $200,000.  Egemonye was arrested immediately thereafter, followed by the indictment and plea already described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court increased the base offense level of 6 by 8 additional levels because the \"loss\" attributed by the court to Egemonye was over $200,000.  U.S.S.G. Secs. 2F1.1(a), (b)(1)(H).  The court computed the loss at $242,950, representing the aggregate credit limit of the 51 credit cards purchased from Kathy in the four transactions.  The offense level was then adjusted in other respects, not here in dispute, and Egemonye was sentenced within the guideline range to 37 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  On appeal, Egemonye's first claim is directed at the 40 cards supplied to him in the final transaction.  Egemonye contends that including these 40 cards in the loss calculation condones \"blatant sentencing factor manipulation engaged in by the investigating agents\" and is a violation of constitutional due process.  He relies on several decisions, including United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 196 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recently had occasion to discuss Connell and the other decisions in this circuit that have addressed sentencing factor manipulation.  United States v. Montoya, 62 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1995).  Summarizing the prior cases, we said that \"where government agents have improperly enlarged the scope or scale of the crime,\" the sentencing court has power to exclude \"the tainted transaction\" from the guideline computations and for purposes of any mandatory minimum statute.  Montoya, 62 F.3d at 3 (quoting in part Connell, 960 F.2d at 195).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, recognizing the broad latitude allowed to the government in investigating and suppressing crime, we stressed that it was only \"extraordinary misconduct\" by agents that could give rise to such an exclusion, which would occur in the teeth of a statute or guideline approved by Congress.  Montoya, 62 F.3d at 3-4 (quoting in part United States v. Gibbens, 25 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1994)).  While something less than a constitutional violation might suffice, as extraordinary misconduct, Egemonye's reference to due process concepts is certainly in the ballpark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Montoya, as in previous cases, we refused to lay down fixed rules to define sentence factor manipulation, but said that the focus is normally upon the conduct of the government rather than the defendant.  62 F.3d at 4.   Indeed, Egemonye does not claim that his will was overborne or deny that he was predisposed to the offense.  What Egemonye claims is that the fourth transaction had no legitimate law enforcement purpose and was designed solely to boost his federal sentence because government agents were unhappy with lenient treatment that Egemonye earlier received in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some basis for the suggestion that task force agents were unhappy with Egemonye's prior record and believed, in the words of one of the agents, \"that he [earlier] got off lightly for his criminal activity.\"   That criminal record, according to the agent just quoted, involved a history of credit card fraud by Egemonye that could be traced back to 1990 and involved a number of transactions.  On this appeal, the government is prepared to assume arguendo that the background facts, \"viewed collectively, could call the government's motives into question to some extent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the government says that multiple sales were clearly appropriate in order to identify Egemonye's co-conspirators, which they did.  As to the final sale of 40 cards, the government insists that it too \"had a valid investigatory purpose\" which was \"to explore the parameters of the defendant's criminality.\"   Egemonye's counsel replies that this \"parameters\" explanation has no real substance and could be used to enlarge a defendant's sentence to virtually any height whatever.  We think that Egemonye's reply has some force but overstates the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, it should be stressed, no indication that Egemonye was coerced or pressured to achieve a new level of crime.  True, the fourth sale was much larger than the earlier ones;  but agent Kathy did not force the 40 cards on Egemonye.  On the contrary, he had insisted on at least 10 cards for the new $200 per card payment (\"I'm not going to buy one card for two hundred....  It has to be like ten.\")   And when offered a bag full of cards--with the request that he recommend another buyer for those he did not want--he responded, \"I probably can handle them,\" and took them all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government agents are not limited to replicating a suspect's largest unsolicited crime.  In this case, the full contours of the criminal operation--its size, techniques, personnel--were, like an iceberg, largely submerged; and the means of exploration were additional and larger transactions.  The first three transactions clearly served this purpose and the fourth, even though followed immediately by the arrest, provided air-tight evidence for trial that Egemonye was a significant dealer and not a petty swindler.  While the sting could not be endlessly prolonged and enlarged, nothing in the objective facts suggests \"misconduct\" at all, let alone \"extraordinary misconduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the fourth transaction is tainted by the agents' subjective motives.  The pallet in such matters contains not blacks and whites but shades of gray.  Motives may be mixed;  good and bad motives are often matters of degree;  and there can be multiple actors.  Whether to consider subjective motive at all presents a problem of policy.  Compare Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (refusing to do so in the qualified immunity context).  Still, we would be greatly concerned if evidence otherwise available showed that a plainly improper subjective motive--say, racial hostility or personal animus--had enlarged or prolonged the sting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this is not such a case.  About the most that can be derived from the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Egemonye, is that the agents thought that Egemonye was an established and unrepentant defrauder who had escaped serious punishment for a series of past, similar frauds.  With this in mind, they conducted a sting operation that involved no pressure whatever on Egemonye, lasted for only four transactions, and garnered several other defendants.  The first three transactions involved 11 cards;  the last one, 40.  This is a sizeable jump but hardly extraordinary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That agents considered Egemonye's past record in selecting him for overtures by the task force is a commonplace of law enforcement.  Undercover operations frequently target those who are suspected of crime, and the recent history of fraudulent activities gave the agents some reason to think that Egemonye was not only predisposed but actively engaged.  Fed.R.Evid. 404(a), restricting character evidence to show propensity, is a rule for trials and not the conduct of police investigations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At worst, the agents went too far if and to the extent that they thought themselves entitled to make up for any shortfall in prior punishments.  But the line is thin and blurred between such a dubious motive and a simple desire to be sure that a committed criminal is caught and tried for a substantial offense based on unshakeable evidence.  And, as we have already held, Egemonye was legitimately targeted and the sting objectively reasonable in extent.  Under these circumstances, even assuming that the agents' motives were mixed and not of crystalline purity, we see nothing that would require a curtailment of the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Egemonye's second challenge to his sentence concerns the district court's computation of loss.  As already noted, the governing guideline keys the offense level primarily to \"the loss\" caused by the offense, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1) (loss table), but goes on to provide (id., comment (n. 7)) that intended loss should be used if it is greater than actual loss:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Consistent with the provisions of Sec. 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss....  For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or attempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities.... the loss would be $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accord with the presentence report, the district court in this case attributed to Egemonye an intended loss equal to the aggregate limits of the purchased credit cards.  A reading of the transcript indicates that the judge found that Egemonye was capable of and intended to use the cards to secure amounts at or virtually at their aggregate limits.  We review such a factual determination only for clear error, United States v. Pavao, 948 F.2d 74, 77 (1st Cir.1991), reserving for closer scrutiny a buried legal issue shortly to be described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the factual issue of intended use and capability, the government bears the burden of proof because an increase in the offense level was sought, see United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 112 (1st Cir.1990), but the guideline itself cautions that a reasonable estimate of loss will suffice.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1 comment.  (n. 8).  Egemonye begins by pointing out that he realized only about 53 percent of the aggregate card limits from the cards involved in the first three transactions and nothing at all from the final bagful of cards since he was apprehended almost immediately.  He argues that to predict a 100 percent recovery is simply unrealistic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Egemonye, there was affirmative evidence that he instructed his runners at the outset to procure cash from the banks at or virtually at the card limits.  In addition, he arranged for the deposit of stolen checks into some of the accounts, in order to refresh their limits.  By this means, some of the accounts could have been milked for amounts in excess of their aggregate limits.  The 53 percent figure represented only the amount that Egemonye had secured at the time his scheme was interrupted by arrest.  See United States v. Strozier, 981 F.2d 281, 284 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, taking the issue purely as a factual one of intent and capability, we do not think that on this record the use of the aggregate card limits as a measure of intended and potential loss was clearly erroneous.  Where there is good evidence of actual intent and some prospect of success, we do not think that a court needs to engage in more refined forecasts of just how successful the scheme was likely to be.  See United States v. Lorenzo, 995 F.2d 1448, 1460 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 225, 126 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993).  The situation may be quite difficult where intent must be inferred solely from the likely effects of the scheme.  See United States v. Stern, 13 F.3d 489 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there is a wrinkle.  There is a cross-reference in U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1's application note 7 (quoted above in pertinent part) to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2X1.1;  and there is a second such cross-reference in application note 9, which reads (in pertinent part):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>\"In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a completed fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2X1.1 ... whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense ..., or both.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egemonye's counsel argues that section 2X1.1, and the discount it makes available, apply in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 2X1.1 is concerned with determining the offense level for an attempt or conspiracy;  and this it sets at three levels less than the offense level for the substantive offense--unless the defendant (or his co-conspirators) have completed all of the acts believed necessary for the substantive offense or were \"about to complete all such acts\" when apprehended.  For cases within the \"unless\" clause--which the background comment says represent \"most\" cases--there is no such discount.  Effectively, the guideline gives the defendant a three-level discount if he is some distance from completing the substantive crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read literally, section 2X1.1 is not relevant to the present case because 14 of the 15 counts against Egemonye involved completed substantive offenses, ranging from trafficking in unauthorized credit cards to producing false driver's licenses, and the conspiracy thus embraced fully completed crimes.  On the other hand, the cross-reference to section 2X1.1 in section 2F1.1 arguably connects the intended loss concept to the attempt guideline, and section 2X1.1 blurs the matter further with the following application note (comment.  (n. 4)), providing (in pertinent part):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>In certain cases, the participants may have completed.... all of the acts necessary for the successful completion of part, but not all, of the intended offense.  In such cases, the offense level for the count (or group of closely related multiple counts) is whichever of the following is greater:  the offense level for the intended offense minus 3 levels ... or the offense level for the part of the offense for which the necessary acts were completed....  For example, where the intended offense was the theft of $800,000 but the participants completed ... only the acts necessary to steal $30,000, the offense level is the offense level for the theft of $800,000 minus 3 levels, or the offense level for the theft of $30,000, whichever is greater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interpreting these provisions is a matter of some difficulty, and the only cases in point are in conflict.  Compare United States v. Watkins, 994 F.2d 1192 (6th Cir.1993) with United States v. Strozier, 981 F.2d 281 (7th Cir.1992).  The problem, in a nutshell, is that section 2X1.1 has on its face nothing to do with a completed substantive offense or a conspiracy that has been carried to completion.  On the other hand, the notion of a discount could be extended from the case of an incomplete offense to that of a completed offense where intended harm is part of the calculus and the harm is only partly completed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing the question to be close, we are inclined to stand by the literal language of the guidelines that directs section 2X1.1 to cases where the substantive offense has not been completed.  E.g., United States v. Sung, 51 F.3d 92 (7th Cir.1995).  The argument for a discount for inchoate crimes is obvious;  the defendant has started down the road toward the substantive crime but has not gotten there yet and, whatever his intention, might still turn back before crossing the line.  By contrast, Egemonye did cross the line and commit the substantive crime by acquiring the cards and making the false documents, so the basic purpose of the section 2X1.1 discount has nothing to do with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a completed offense is involved, it is surely rational to measure culpability in part by the intended harm and to refuse a discount where the offense is complete even though the intended harm has not yet been fully realized.  From the standpoint of moral guilt, and dangerousness, there is little to distinguish such a defendant from one who has actually inflicted the same amount of harm.  And we are influenced in part by the fact that the case law calculating sentences based on intended harm, most of it admittedly without making reference to section 2X1.1, is consistent with this view.  E.g., United States v. Guyon, 27 F.3d 723 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Resurreccion, 978 F.2d 759 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there would be nothing irrational in deciding that actual harm is worse than intended harm and providing a three-level discount wherever the sentence for a completed offense is measured in part by intended harm.  But this is not in general the philosophy of the guidelines;  if it were, possession of drugs with intent to distribute would be punished less harshly than the actual sale of an equivalent amount.  The wrinkle of section 2X1.1 cannot be ironed completely smooth, but the pertinent language already quoted can in fact be squared with our result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the cross-references in section 2F1.1 are easily explained;  they do invoke the discount, or the possibility of a discount, where the underlying crime is merely an attempt or conspiracy.  Application note 4 in section 2X1.1 is less easily reconciled;  but we think the difference is that in the theft case, there is no completed crime as to the larger amount but only (in substance) an attempt.  Here, by contrast, all 51 of the cards were the subject of completed crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egemonye's remaining claim as to loss is to argue that no consideration should be given to the 40 cards in the fourth transaction, or at least to the unexpected 30 cards (over and above the ten cards Egemonye requested).  This is largely a restatement of the claim that sentencing factor manipulation occurred.  Having rejected that claim, we think that--from the standpoint of intended loss--Egemonye can fairly be charged with intending to inflict loss as to all of the cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both issues in this case are difficult and important.  We are thus especially indebted to counsel for the able briefing and argument presented on both sides.  The Sentencing Commission's attention will be drawn to the arguable lack of clarity in the interplay between section 2F1.1 and section 2X1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

United States v.

The case arose out of a sting operation conducted by a joint federal-state task force investigating credit card and other financial fraud in Massachusetts.  The critical events took place in January and February 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert Leslie, who was cooperating with authorities, introduced Egemonye to an undercover state trooper known to both only as \"Kathy.\"   On January 21, 1993, Kathy supplied Egemonye with two BayBank MasterCard credit cards and one BayBank Visa credit card with an aggregate credit limit of $7,450 for all three cards.  Egemonye then created false driver's licenses in the credit-card names, each license bearing Leslie's photograph, and drove Leslie to three different banks to obtain cash advances of $6,900.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egemonye purchased four more credit cards from Kathy on January 29, 1993, and four more on February 2, 1993.  The aggregate limits on the cards in the two transactions were $21,000 and $14,000, respectively.  In between these transactions, several of the cards were used to obtain advances from banks, and Egemonye and others in the conspiracy engineered deposits of some stolen checks into accounts of individual card holders to boost the depleted credit available for those cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until the fourth transaction, Kathy made the \"sales\" in exchange for a share of the proceeds, but on February 5 she proposed that she be paid a flat $200 per card.  Egemonye said, \"I'm not going to buy one card for two hundred....  It has to be like ten.\"   On February 10, Kathy told Egemonye that she expected to receive a number of cards that day, that Egemonye should bring $2,000 for 10 cards, and that she would \"front\" (finance) any additional cards and accept payment for them later.  Egemonye agreed, subject to his examination of the cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Kathy and Egemonye met later that day, Kathy said that she had a bag full of cards and asked Egemonye whether he knew of another buyer if he did not want them all.  He said, \"I probably can handle them,\" and proceeded to give Kathy $2,000 down, and a promise of $6,000 more later, for 40 Household Bank Visa and MasterCard credit cards with an aggregate limit of $200,000.  Egemonye was arrested immediately thereafter, followed by the indictment and plea already described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court increased the base offense level of 6 by 8 additional levels because the \"loss\" attributed by the court to Egemonye was over $200,000.  U.S.S.G. Secs. 2F1.1(a), (b)(1)(H).  The court computed the loss at $242,950, representing the aggregate credit limit of the 51 credit cards purchased from Kathy in the four transactions.  The offense level was then adjusted in other respects, not here in dispute, and Egemonye was sentenced within the guideline range to 37 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  On appeal, Egemonye's first claim is directed at the 40 cards supplied to him in the final transaction.  Egemonye contends that including these 40 cards in the loss calculation condones \"blatant sentencing factor manipulation engaged in by the investigating agents\" and is a violation of constitutional due process.  He relies on several decisions, including United States v. Connell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580693\"><a href=\"/opinion/580693/united-states-v-gerald-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 196 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recently had occasion to discuss Connell and the other decisions in this circuit that have addressed sentencing factor manipulation.  United States v. Montoya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196205\"><a href=\"/opinion/196205/united-states-v-montoya/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995).  Summarizing the prior cases, we said that \"where government agents have improperly enlarged the scope or scale of the crime,\" the sentencing court has power to exclude \"the tainted transaction\" from the guideline computations and for purposes of any mandatory minimum statute.  Montoya, 62 F.3d at 3 (quoting in part Connell, 960 F.2d at 195).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, recognizing the broad latitude allowed to the government in investigating and suppressing crime, we stressed that it was only \"extraordinary misconduct\" by agents that could give rise to such an exclusion, which would occur in the teeth of a statute or guideline approved by Congress.  Montoya, 62 F.3d at 3-4 (quoting in part United States v. Gibbens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195396\"><a href=\"/opinion/195396/united-states-v-gibbens/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1994)).  While something less than a constitutional violation might suffice, as extraordinary misconduct, Egemonye's reference to due process concepts is certainly in the ballpark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Montoya, as in previous cases, we refused to lay down fixed rules to define sentence factor manipulation, but said that the focus is normally upon the conduct of the government rather than the defendant.  62 F.3d at 4.   Indeed, Egemonye does not claim that his will was overborne or deny that he was predisposed to the offense.  What Egemonye claims is that the fourth transaction had no legitimate law enforcement purpose and was designed solely to boost his federal sentence because government agents were unhappy with lenient treatment that Egemonye earlier received in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some basis for the suggestion that task force agents were unhappy with Egemonye's prior record and believed, in the words of one of the agents, \"that he [earlier] got off lightly for his criminal activity.\"   That criminal record, according to the agent just quoted, involved a history of credit card fraud by Egemonye that could be traced back to 1990 and involved a number of transactions.  On this appeal, the government is prepared to assume arguendo that the background facts, \"viewed collectively, could call the government's motives into question to some extent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the government says that multiple sales were clearly appropriate in order to identify Egemonye's co-conspirators, which they did.  As to the final sale of 40 cards, the government insists that it too \"had a valid investigatory purpose\" which was \"to explore the parameters of the defendant's criminality.\"   Egemonye's counsel replies that this \"parameters\" explanation has no real substance and could be used to enlarge a defendant's sentence to virtually any height whatever.  We think that Egemonye's reply has some force but overstates the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, it should be stressed, no indication that Egemonye was coerced or pressured to achieve a new level of crime.  True, the fourth sale was much larger than the earlier ones;  but agent Kathy did not force the 40 cards on Egemonye.  On the contrary, he had insisted on at least 10 cards for the new $200 per card payment (\"I'm not going to buy one card for two hundred....  It has to be like ten.\")   And when offered a bag full of cards--with the request that he recommend another buyer for those he did not want--he responded, \"I probably can handle them,\" and took them all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government agents are not limited to replicating a suspect's largest unsolicited crime.  In this case, the full contours of the criminal operation--its size, techniques, personnel--were, like an iceberg, largely submerged; and the means of exploration were additional and larger transactions.  The first three transactions clearly served this purpose and the fourth, even though followed immediately by the arrest, provided air-tight evidence for trial that Egemonye was a significant dealer and not a petty swindler.  While the sting could not be endlessly prolonged and enlarged, nothing in the objective facts suggests \"misconduct\" at all, let alone \"extraordinary misconduct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the fourth transaction is tainted by the agents' subjective motives.  The pallet in such matters contains not blacks and whites but shades of gray.  Motives may be mixed;  good and bad motives are often matters of degree;  and there can be multiple actors.  Whether to consider subjective motive at all presents a problem of policy.  Compare Harlow v. Fitzgerald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (1982) (refusing to do so in the qualified immunity context).  Still, we would be greatly concerned if evidence otherwise available showed that a plainly improper subjective motive--say, racial hostility or personal animus--had enlarged or prolonged the sting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this is not such a case.  About the most that can be derived from the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Egemonye, is that the agents thought that Egemonye was an established and unrepentant defrauder who had escaped serious punishment for a series of past, similar frauds.  With this in mind, they conducted a sting operation that involved no pressure whatever on Egemonye, lasted for only four transactions, and garnered several other defendants.  The first three transactions involved 11 cards;  the last one, 40.  This is a sizeable jump but hardly extraordinary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That agents considered Egemonye's past record in selecting him for overtures by the task force is a commonplace of law enforcement.  Undercover operations frequently target those who are suspected of crime, and the recent history of fraudulent activities gave the agents some reason to think that Egemonye was not only predisposed but actively engaged.  Fed.R.Evid. 404(a), restricting character evidence to show propensity, is a rule for trials and not the conduct of police investigations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At worst, the agents went too far if and to the extent that they thought themselves entitled to make up for any shortfall in prior punishments.  But the line is thin and blurred between such a dubious motive and a simple desire to be sure that a committed criminal is caught and tried for a substantial offense based on unshakeable evidence.  And, as we have already held, Egemonye was legitimately targeted and the sting objectively reasonable in extent.  Under these circumstances, even assuming that the agents' motives were mixed and not of crystalline purity, we see nothing that would require a curtailment of the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Egemonye's second challenge to his sentence concerns the district court's computation of loss.  As already noted, the governing guideline keys the offense level primarily to \"the loss\" caused by the offense, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1) (loss table), but goes on to provide (id., comment (n. 7)) that intended loss should be used if it is greater than actual loss:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Consistent with the provisions of Sec. 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss....  For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or attempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities.... the loss would be $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accord with the presentence report, the district court in this case attributed to Egemonye an intended loss equal to the aggregate limits of the purchased credit cards.  A reading of the transcript indicates that the judge found that Egemonye was capable of and intended to use the cards to secure amounts at or virtually at their aggregate limits.  We review such a factual determination only for clear error, United States v. Pavao, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571260\"><a href=\"/opinion/571260/united-states-v-luis-m-pavao/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.1991), reserving for closer scrutiny a buried legal issue shortly to be described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the factual issue of intended use and capability, the government bears the burden of proof because an increase in the offense level was sought, see United States v. Sklar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.1990), but the guideline itself cautions that a reasonable estimate of loss will suffice.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1 comment.  (n. 8).  Egemonye begins by pointing out that he realized only about 53 percent of the aggregate card limits from the cards involved in the first three transactions and nothing at all from the final bagful of cards since he was apprehended almost immediately.  He argues that to predict a 100 percent recovery is simply unrealistic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Egemonye, there was affirmative evidence that he instructed his runners at the outset to procure cash from the banks at or virtually at the card limits.  In addition, he arranged for the deposit of stolen checks into some of the accounts, in order to refresh their limits.  By this means, some of the accounts could have been milked for amounts in excess of their aggregate limits.  The 53 percent figure represented only the amount that Egemonye had secured at the time his scheme was interrupted by arrest.  See United States v. Strozier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596435\"><a href=\"/opinion/596435/united-states-v-michael-a-strozier-also-known-as-m-kirt-strozier/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 284 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, taking the issue purely as a factual one of intent and capability, we do not think that on this record the use of the aggregate card limits as a measure of intended and potential loss was clearly erroneous.  Where there is good evidence of actual intent and some prospect of success, we do not think that a court needs to engage in more refined forecasts of just how successful the scheme was likely to be.  See United States v. Lorenzo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609204\"><a href=\"/opinion/609204/united-states-v-windyceslau-d-lorenzo-united-states-of-america-v-roger/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1448</span></a></span>, 1460 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span> (1993).  The situation may be quite difficult where intent must be inferred solely from the likely effects of the scheme.  See United States v. Stern, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660163\"><a href=\"/opinion/660163/united-states-v-aaron-stern-united-states-of-america-v-lawrence-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there is a wrinkle.  There is a cross-reference in U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1's application note 7 (quoted above in pertinent part) to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2X1.1;  and there is a second such cross-reference in application note 9, which reads (in pertinent part):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>\"In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a completed fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2X1.1 ... whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense ..., or both.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egemonye's counsel argues that section 2X1.1, and the discount it makes available, apply in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. Sec. 2X1.1 is concerned with determining the offense level for an attempt or conspiracy;  and this it sets at three levels less than the offense level for the substantive offense--unless the defendant (or his co-conspirators) have completed all of the acts believed necessary for the substantive offense or were \"about to complete all such acts\" when apprehended.  For cases within the \"unless\" clause--which the background comment says represent \"most\" cases--there is no such discount.  Effectively, the guideline gives the defendant a three-level discount if he is some distance from completing the substantive crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read literally, section 2X1.1 is not relevant to the present case because 14 of the 15 counts against Egemonye involved completed substantive offenses, ranging from trafficking in unauthorized credit cards to producing false driver's licenses, and the conspiracy thus embraced fully completed crimes.  On the other hand, the cross-reference to section 2X1.1 in section 2F1.1 arguably connects the intended loss concept to the attempt guideline, and section 2X1.1 blurs the matter further with the following application note (comment.  (n. 4)), providing (in pertinent part):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>In certain cases, the participants may have completed.... all of the acts necessary for the successful completion of part, but not all, of the intended offense.  In such cases, the offense level for the count (or group of closely related multiple counts) is whichever of the following is greater:  the offense level for the intended offense minus 3 levels ... or the offense level for the part of the offense for which the necessary acts were completed....  For example, where the intended offense was the theft of $800,000 but the participants completed ... only the acts necessary to steal $30,000, the offense level is the offense level for the theft of $800,000 minus 3 levels, or the offense level for the theft of $30,000, whichever is greater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interpreting these provisions is a matter of some difficulty, and the only cases in point are in conflict.  Compare United States v. Watkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608108\"><a href=\"/opinion/608108/united-states-v-caroll-a-watkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1993) with United States v. Strozier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596435\"><a href=\"/opinion/596435/united-states-v-michael-a-strozier-also-known-as-m-kirt-strozier/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1992).  The problem, in a nutshell, is that section 2X1.1 has on its face nothing to do with a completed substantive offense or a conspiracy that has been carried to completion.  On the other hand, the notion of a discount could be extended from the case of an incomplete offense to that of a completed offense where intended harm is part of the calculus and the harm is only partly completed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing the question to be close, we are inclined to stand by the literal language of the guidelines that directs section 2X1.1 to cases where the substantive offense has not been completed.  E.g., United States v. Sung, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692340\"><a href=\"/opinion/692340/united-states-v-kim-tae-sung/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1995).  The argument for a discount for inchoate crimes is obvious;  the defendant has started down the road toward the substantive crime but has not gotten there yet and, whatever his intention, might still turn back before crossing the line.  By contrast, Egemonye did cross the line and commit the substantive crime by acquiring the cards and making the false documents, so the basic purpose of the section 2X1.1 discount has nothing to do with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a completed offense is involved, it is surely rational to measure culpability in part by the intended harm and to refuse a discount where the offense is complete even though the intended harm has not yet been fully realized.  From the standpoint of moral guilt, and dangerousness, there is little to distinguish such a defendant from one who has actually inflicted the same amount of harm.  And we are influenced in part by the fact that the case law calculating sentences based on intended harm, most of it admittedly without making reference to section 2X1.1, is consistent with this view.  E.g., United States v. Guyon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195450\"><a href=\"/opinion/195450/united-states-v-guyon/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Resurreccion, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593906\"><a href=\"/opinion/593906/united-states-v-cesar-resurreccion/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there would be nothing irrational in deciding that actual harm is worse than intended harm and providing a three-level discount wherever the sentence for a completed offense is measured in part by intended harm.  But this is not in general the philosophy of the guidelines;  if it were, possession of drugs with intent to distribute would be punished less harshly than the actual sale of an equivalent amount.  The wrinkle of section 2X1.1 cannot be ironed completely smooth, but the pertinent language already quoted can in fact be squared with our result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the cross-references in section 2F1.1 are easily explained;  they do invoke the discount, or the possibility of a discount, where the underlying crime is merely an attempt or conspiracy.  Application note 4 in section 2X1.1 is less easily reconciled;  but we think the difference is that in the theft case, there is no completed crime as to the larger amount but only (in substance) an attempt.  Here, by contrast, all 51 of the cards were the subject of completed crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egemonye's remaining claim as to loss is to argue that no consideration should be given to the 40 cards in the fourth transaction, or at least to the unexpected 30 cards (over and above the ten cards Egemonye requested).  This is largely a restatement of the claim that sentencing factor manipulation occurred.  Having rejected that claim, we think that--from the standpoint of intended loss--Egemonye can fairly be charged with intending to inflict loss as to all of the cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both issues in this case are difficult and important.  We are thus especially indebted to counsel for the able briefing and argument presented on both sides.  The Sentencing Commission's attention will be drawn to the arguable lack of clarity in the interplay between section 2F1.1 and section 2X1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
