Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Wallace,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n    Wilfredo A. Geigel for appellant.\n    Jose E. De La Cruz-Skerrett with whom De La Cruz Skerrett\n\n\n    *Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fLaw Offices was on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                          December 1, 2000\n\n         BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.        In 1973 Dr. Maria Virginia\n\nHernandez-Loring was first employed as a teacher in the Ana G.\n\nMendez University System, a group of private institutions of\n\nhigher learning in Puerto Rico.       In 1981, after receiving her\n\nPh.D. in education, she became an instructor at Universidad\n\nMetropolitana, one of the units in the system.    She was promoted\n\nto auxiliary professor in 1983 and associate professor in 1988.\n\nHowever, in February 1995, a five-member academic committee\n\ndeclined to recommend Hernandez-Loring for promotion to full\n\nprofessor.   In February 1997 she brought the present action in\n\nthe federal district court in Puerto Rico based on diversity\n\njurisdiction, Hernandez-Loring by then having moved to Virginia\n\nto live with her husband.\n\n         In the first of two counts, the complaint charged that\n\nthe denial of promotion constituted a denial of due process for\n\na number of reasons (e.g., because the committee members were\n\nnot   competent     in   Hernandez-Loring's   field   of   applied\n\nlinguistics).     The second count charged sexual harassment; it\n\nsaid that the head of the committee--Dr. Luis R. Diaz-Rivera--\n\nhad harassed her and that her denial of promotion occurred\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fbecause \"she refused to date him.\"               The named defendants were\n\nUniversidad Metropolitana, its chancellor Rene Labarca, all five\n\nmembers      of   the    committee      that   had    refused   to   recommend\n\nHernandez-Loring's promotion, and the university system of which\n\nUniversidad Metropolitana is a part.\n\n\n\n             After a good deal of discovery including the deposition\n\nof Hernandez-Loring, the defendants moved for summary judgment.\n\nIn opposition, Hernandez-Loring offered an affidavit expanding\n\non her deposition testimony.             On August 20, 1999, the district\n\ncourt granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the\n\ncomplaint. Hernandez-Loring v. Universidad Metropolitana, 62 F.\n\nSupp.   2d    450,      463   (D.P.R.   1999).       The   court's   reasoning,\n\ndiscussed below, was different as to each of the three claims--\n\nthe due process claim (count I) and what the court took to be\n\ndistinct claims for quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fharassment (count II).1           Hernandez-Loring has now appealed to\n\nthis court.\n\n            In general, the grant of summary judgment is reviewed\n\nde novo, reasonable doubts and issues of credibility being\n\nresolved in favor of the non-moving party.               Landrau-Romero v.\n\nBanco Popular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 611 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nAt the threshold, Hernandez-Loring argues that the district\n\ncourt should be reversed because the summary judgment motion was\n\nfiled     after    the     original   deadline   fixed    by   the   court's\n\nscheduling order.          However, such an order may be modified for\n\n\"good cause,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b), and the district court's\n\nfinding of good cause, based on Hernandez-Loring's own discovery\n\ndelays, was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n            Turning to the grant of summary judgment on count I,\n\nwe   readily      affirm   the   district   court.   In   making     academic\n\nappointments or promotions, a private university is not directly\n\n\n\n      1\n     It is not at all clear from the complaint that Hernandez-\nLoring intended to state a separate sexual harassment claim or\nwhether references in the complaint were solely in support of\nthe due process claim.    However, during the summary judgment\nproceedings before the district court, both parties treated the\ncase as if there were a separate claim for sexual harassment,\ndevoting a substantial portion of their summary judgment\nmemoranda to that issue, and the district court proceeded on the\nsame basis. Accordingly, we treat the complaint as effectively\namended or clarified by consent.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b);\nRodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1172 (1st Cir.\n1995).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fgoverned   by    the       due    process    requirements     of     the   Fifth   and\n\nFourteenth Amendments.                See American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nSullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 50 (1999).                     Still, Puerto Rico law\n\napparently      regards          private-university      tenure       decisions    as\n\nsubject    to    an        implicit     contractual      constraint        that    the\n\nuniversity will follow its own regulations.                   This is the holding\n\nof Selosse v. Fundacion Educativa Ana G. Mendez, 122 D.P.R. 534,\n\n545-51 (P.R. 1988), a case that resulted from a suit by a\n\ndifferent teacher for denial of tenure by the same university\n\nsystem involved in the present case.\n\n           Hernandez-Loring does not allege a violation of any\n\nspecific     university           promotion       regulation.         Instead,     she\n\ncriticizes inter alia the failure to include on the committee\n\npersons who shared her own specialty, the scoring system used\n\n(she placed fourth out of four candidates for one promotion),\n\nthe   vagueness       of    the     standards      employed     in   the   promotion\n\nprocess, the disregard of her published work insofar as it was\n\nfor pay, the inadequacy of the appeals process, and the choice\n\nas head of the committee of a man (Diaz-Rivera) whose promotion\n\nto the university administration Professor Hernandez-Loring had\n\npreviously opposed.\n\n           Academic promotion disputes, as the district court\n\nnoted, often pit concerns about fair procedure against the\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fautonomy of universities; but in this case there is no balancing\n\nto be done nor any basis for considering whether the processes\n\nemployed     were   \"fair.\"        There    is    no    constitutional      claim\n\nasserted, no contract claim beyond the right to have regulations\n\nfollowed, and no asserted violation of any specific regulation.\n\nNothing in Hernandez-Loring's argument indicates that something\n\nelse is required by Puerto Rico law.                Perhaps Puerto Rico law\n\noffers more and, if so, future litigants are welcome to make\n\nthat showing.\n\n             The second claim--that of quid pro quo harassment--is\n\nfar   more   difficult   to   assess.        The    district      court   assumed\n\n(perhaps wrongly) that Hernandez-Loring was invoking Title VII,\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a)(1) (1994).2               On appeal, Hernandez-Loring\n\nhas cited only Puerto Rico statutory law, including the ban on\n\nsexual     harassment.        29   P.R.     Laws       Ann.   ยง   155b    (1995).\n\nNevertheless, the substantive law of Puerto Rico on sexual\n\nharassment appears to be aligned, so far as pertinent here, with\n\nTitle VII law, and Title VII precedents are used freely in\n\nconstruing Commonwealth law.           Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-\n\nVelez, 132 F.3d 848, 854 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\n\n      2\n     There   is   no   indication   that   the  administrative\npreconditions for a Title VII suit were ever satisfied.     See\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 798 (1973).\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            Under Title VII, quid pro quo sexual harassment can be\n\nshown where a supervisor uses employer processes to punish a\n\nsubordinate for refusing to comply with sexual demands.               Wills\n\nv. Brown Univ., 184 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1999);               Lipsett v.\n\nUniversity of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 897 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nThe gist of Hernandez-Loring's quid pro quo claim here is that\n\nDiaz-Rivera made advances to her, was rebuffed, and then used\n\nhis position as head of the committee to revenge himself by\n\nblocking her promotion.      The district court assumed that such a\n\nclaim would be legally viable but ruled that Hernandez-Loring\n\nhad not offered credible evidence sufficient to withstand a\n\nmotion for summary judgment against her.\n\n            During her deposition, Hernandez-Loring offered general\n\nallegations, but when pressed for specifics, became            vague, said\n\nshe   did   not    recollect,    or     simply     repeated   her   general\n\nassertions.       Later, in her affidavit prepared in response to\n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion, she furnished details,\n\nquotations, and in one case a wholly new incident that had not\n\nbeen offered in her deposition.             The district court declined to\n\nconsider these \"eleventh hour recollections.\" Hernandez-Loring,\n\n62 F. Supp. 2d at 461.          We will have more to say about this\n\nissue but think it clearer to explain first what appeared in the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fdeposition pertinent to the quid pro quo claim and what was\n\nadded thereafter.\n\n            In the deposition, Hernandez-Loring said that Diaz-\n\nRivera had repeatedly used foul and salacious language in the\n\nclassroom, that she had complained to the university chancellor\n\nor    others     on    a   number       of    occasions,       that   Diaz-Rivera          had\n\ninterrupted       her      own   classes       to    request      dates     with    her    and\n\npressed his requests on other occasions,                          that he had greeted\n\nher   in   the    hallways       with        the    phrase,    \"Listen,      you    haven't\n\ngreeted    me    today,      did    I    sleep       with   you    last     night,\"       that\n\nalthough married he had carried on with students, and that at a\n\nfaculty    workshop         in   August       1995    after    she    had    been    denied\n\npromotion, the following occurred:\n\n            Q.        What did [Dr. Diaz's] remark consist of?\n\n            A.   Dr. Diaz told me that if I had done\n            other things the results of my evaluation\n            would have been different.\n                   . . .\n            Q. What other words did he use?\n                   . . .\n            A. \"That [if] you had gone out with me you\n            would have... - something like that - like\n            going to bed with me, we would have had\n            another... another result.\"\n\n            When Hernandez-Loring filed her affidavit, she was far\n\nmore explicit about specific coarse and sexually explicit and\n\nsuggestive language used by Diaz-Rivera toward his students and\n\nto Hernandez-Loring herself.                  Further, in describing what Diaz-\n\n                                              -8-\n\fRivera allegedly said to her at the faculty workshop in August\n\n1995, Hernandez-Loringโs affidavit discarded paraphrase; Diaz-\n\nRivera, according to the affidavit, said:               \"Maria Virginia, this\n\nhappened to you for being such a bitch . . . and [for] not\n\n[being] willing to go out with me.\"              Finally, Hernandez-Loring\n\nalleged for the first time that in July 1995 she had been pawed,\n\nand lasciviously addressed, by the chancellor (Labarca), at a\n\nfaculty lunch while the latter was inebriated.\n\n            In rejecting the quid pro quo claim, the district court\n\ngave two different reasons for granting summary judgment.\n\nFirst,   the    court    ruled    that    the   affidavit     should      not   be\n\nconsidered because it did not square with Hernandez-Loringโs\n\nearlier deposition testimony.            And, second, the court said that\n\neven if it accepted the affidavitโs more detailed description of\n\nDiaz-Riveraโs      conduct,      \"plaintiff      must    still     establish     a\n\ncolorable      claim    that   her   denial     of   tenure   by    the   review\n\ncommittee was directly linked to\" retaliation by Diaz-Rivera,\n\nbut that she had \"failed to establish any link between her\n\ndenial of tenure and Diaz-Riveraโs discriminatory animus toward\n\nher.\"    Hernandez-Loring, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 462.                Even if Diaz-\n\nRiveraโs vote was tainted, the court said that it was \"unable to\n\ndiscern any causal link\" between his animus and \"the merit-based\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fobjective performance rendered by at least 4 of the 5 committee\n\nmembers.\"    Id.\n\n            On appeal, Hernandez-Loring says that the court erred\n\nin refusing to consider the affidavit, but as to the quid pro\n\nquo   claim,    the   affidavit   is     largely   beside     the   point.\n\nHernandez-Loring's deposition testimony already said that Diaz-\n\nRivera pestered her for dates, made explicit sexual references,\n\nand then--after the committee he headed recommended against her\n\npromotion--more or less said to her in August 1995 that this was\n\nthe consequence of her spurning him.         Deposition statements of\n\nstudents    also   corroborated   Diaz-Rivera's    use   of    suggestive\n\nlanguage.      The affidavit added little to Hernandez-Loringโs\n\nclaim that her promotion denial was an act of spite by Diaz-\n\nRivera.\n\n            Turning to causation, at first blush it seems unlikely\n\nthat the private animus of one committee member, even though the\n\npresiding member, would be the effective cause of a decision by\n\na committee of five members to rank Hernandez-Loring last among\n\nfour candidates, giving her a numerical score below the minimum\n\nnecessary to qualify for promotion to full professor (even if\n\nthere had been more than one vacancy available).            Cf. Coogan v.\n\nSmyers, 134 F.3d 479, 485 (2d Cir. 1998); Jeffries v. Harleston,\n\n52 F.3d 9, 14 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 862 (1995).             On\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthe other hand, it is not impossible: conceivably a biased chair\n\ncould have influenced other members privately or, depending on\n\nhow the score was developed, a very low score from one member\n\ncould   have    had    a    disproportionate          result.     The   briefs    are\n\nremarkably opaque as to how the committee operated and how it\n\nreached its decision.\n\n            For     the     most    part,      this    opacity    argues      against\n\nHernandez-Loring.          Faced with a motion for summary judgment, it\n\nwas her burden to establish that there existed evidence creating\n\na trial-worthy claim that Diaz-Rivera had caused her to be\n\ndenied the promotion.               Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Anderson               v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986).                    In deposing the\n\ncommittee members, she was free to ask questions to establish\n\nwhat was said at the deliberations, to identify so far as\n\npossible how the scoring was done, and to identify what Diaz-\n\nRivera might have done to influence the outcome adversely to her\n\npromotion.     Of course, objections might have been raised to such\n\ninquiries.\n\n            Yet     she    has     one   very   potent     fact   in    her    favor.\n\nAccording      to   her     deposition      testimony,     Diaz-Rivera        himself\n\nboasted to her that he had caused her denial of promotion\n\nbecause she had spurned him.              True, he did not explain how this\n\ntrick   had     been       done    and   his    statement       could   have     been\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fmisunderstood or, alternatively, it could have been a cruel\n\ndeceit to make a denial of promotion on the merits even more\n\npainful.    But an admission from a wrongdoer is powerful proof\n\neven without detail, see Hallquist v. Local 276, Plumbers &\n\nPipefitters Union, 843 F.2d 18, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1988), and how\n\nhis statement should be construed and whether it should be\n\naccepted as true are largely jury issues, at least where the\n\nadmission is not wholly incredible.            Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.\n\n            There is no evidence, apart from Hernandez-Loring's own\n\ntestimony, that Diaz-Rivera ever made the critical admission.\n\nThis is a troubling problem often prominent in harassment cases\n\nand   accentuated     here    by    the    surface   unlikelihood       of   the\n\ncausation    claim.     On    the   other    hand,   Hernandez-Loring        was\n\nconsistent in her claim that Diaz-Rivera made his boast; most\n\n(although not all) of the other changes in her testimony are\n\nless suspicious than they look (as we will shortly explain); and\n\nthe likelihood that the boast was made is somewhat enhanced,\n\neven if indirectly, by the evidence from the students as to how\n\nDiaz-Rivera      generally    behaved.        In   sum,    we   think   summary\n\njudgment on the quid pro quo claim should not have been granted\n\non the grounds given.\n\n            On   remand,     nothing      prevents   the   defense,     if   the\n\ndistrict court permits it, from making a second motion on this\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fissue.     If the four committee members told a consistent story\n\nthat effectively disproved Diaz-Rivera's boast,             it is not clear\n\nthat   a   reasonable   jury   could    accept    the    boast;   nor     would\n\nHernandez-Loring automatically be entitled to a trial simply in\n\nthe hope that the jury might disbelieve consistent, plausible,\n\nand otherwise unimpeached testimony from four other witnesses,\n\neven if (dubitante) they were technically \"interested\" parties.\n\nSee Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.\n\n1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992).\n\n            Finally,    we   consider    the     claim    that    there    was\n\nsufficient evidence of a \"hostile work environment\" to entitle\n\nHernandez-Loring to a trial on that claim.               Here, the district\n\ncourt thought it fatal that much of the force of this claim\n\nrested on allegations that appeared only in Hernandez-Loringโs\n\naffidavit and not in her deposition.             In the alternative, the\n\ncourt said that even if the affidavit were accepted, the court\n\ndoubted whether the allegations--which it said \"essentially\n\ncomprise three incidents by two separate individuals during a\n\nfive-year span, as well as a series of vague entreaties by Diaz-\n\nRivera to date Hernandez-Loring\"--were of \"sufficient frequency\n\nand severity\" to make out a colorable claim of hostile work\n\nenvironment.    Hernandez-Loring, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 462 n.5.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f               Whether (or to what extent) the affidavit had to be\n\nconsidered is a difficult question.               We have said in the past\n\nthat where a party has given \"clear answers to unambiguous\n\nquestions\" in discovery, that party cannot \"create a conflict\n\nand resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly\n\ncontradictory,\" unless there is a \"satisfactory explanation of\n\nwhy the testimony [has] changed.\"3             Partly, the concern is with\n\nthe credibility of a later disavowal, but the rule is also a\n\nmatter of policy:             if prior statements under oath could be\n\ndisavowed at will after a motion is made, the other side would\n\nbe     faced       with   a   constantly      moving   target    and     summary\n\ndispositions made almost impossible.\n\n               Of course, in applying this rule, it is critical that\n\nthere be no \"satisfactory explanation\" since lapse of memory,\n\nnew sources of information or other events can often explain a\n\nrevision of testimony.            Whether there is a contradiction and\n\nwhether the explanation for it is satisfactory are both likely\n\nto depend very much on an assessment of specific facts; and in\n\nsuch       cases   the    district   courtโs    judgment   is   likely    to   be\n\nsuperior to that of a more remote appellate tribunal.

DuPont de Nemours & Co.,\n219 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Russell v. Acme-Evans\nCo., 51 F.3d 64, 67-68 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                       -14-\n\fappellate courts give some deference to the district courtโs\n\nassessment of so-called \"mixed questions.\"              United States v.\n\nHoward (In re Extradition of Howard), 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-28\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).    Deference, however, does not mean abdication,\n\nand here our view of the situation differs somewhat from that of\n\nthe district court.\n\n           We think that in the present case the district court\n\nwas entitled to disregard any completely new incident that\n\nHernandez-Loring described for the first time in her affidavit,\n\nassuming   that   prior   questions    had    clearly   asked   for   such\n\ninformation.   This may be the case with Hernandez-Loringโs claim\n\nthat in July 1995 she was pawed and subjected to suggestive\n\ncomments by the chancellor.       She was asked in general terms\n\nabout incidents of harassment and this was a prime candidate:\n\nit was close in time to the deposition and it could have been\n\nadverted to without grave embarrassment by paraphrasing the\n\nalleged remarks.\n\n           On the other hand, the other two specific incidents\n\nidentified by date in Hernandez-Loring's affidavit were both\n\ncited in her deposition testimony:           the first was an offensive\n\noverture by Diaz-Rivera, probably at a Thanksgiving luncheon in\n\nNovember 1991; the other was the August 1995 claim by Diaz-\n\nRivera that he had blocked her promotion in retaliation for her\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fresistance.      In   the   first     case,   Hernandez-Loring           supplied\n\nprecise offensive language only in her affidavit, while in the\n\nsecond, the language offered in the affidavit was stronger only\n\nby degree than the softer paraphrase in the deposition.                          In\n\nneither case is there a real contradiction between deposition\n\nand affidavit; and, as for explanation for the changes, the\n\ndeposition    colloquies      make   clear,    and      the    preface    to    the\n\naffidavit makes explicit, Hernandez-Loringโs extreme discomfort\n\nand reluctance to repeat the offensive language allegedly used\n\nin the various incidents.\n\n            Of course, plaintiffs who bring sexual harassment suits\n\nhave to be prepared to repeat in timely fashion the offensive\n\nlanguage at issue, painful though it may be.                     Certainly the\n\nplaintiff's initial reluctance to remember, and her later offer\n\nof detail, could be considered in assessing her testimony.                      But\n\nin our view it would be an abuse of discretion in the present\n\ncase   to   disregard   the    affidavit      as   to    the    two   incidents\n\npreviously    identified      in     the    deposition        where   the      only\n\ndifference between deposition and affidavit was the affidavitโs\n\nprovision of more specific language allegedly used by Diaz-\n\nRivera.\n\n            This brings us to the district court's alternative\n\nobjection.    If the two incidents just mentioned stood alone, it\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fis not easy to see how Hernandez-Loring could make out much of\n\na hostile environment claim.                The first incident allegedly\n\noccurred        in   November   1991.      While    the   remarks   were   highly\n\noffensive, it appears that Hernandez-Loring did not work for\n\nDiaz-Rivera, never reported the incident, and continued to work\n\nat   the    university     until    her    January    1997   departure,    which\n\n(whether occasioned by marriage or the denial of promotion)\n\nseemingly had little connection with a very brief event five\n\nyears before.          As for Diaz-Riveraโs alleged boast in August\n\n1995,      it   is    highly    relevant   to   a   claim    of   quid   pro   quo\n\nharassment, but tamer (although not irrelevant) than the usual\n\nbasis for a hostile environment claim.\n\n                However, the two alleged incidents are only the most\n\nspecific of the events that underlie the claim of a hostile\n\nenvironment.          Without being specific as to dates, Hernandez-\n\nLoring said that Diaz-Rivera had repeatedly asked her for dates\n\nand used suggestive language toward her; that he had interrupted\n\nher class to do so; that she had been offended and upset by this\n\npattern of conduct; that Diaz-Rivera was known to have used\n\nsuggestive and offensive language to students in class (a charge\n\nbacked up by several student affidavits and depositions);4 and\n\n\n      4\n     Evidence of the harassment of third parties can help to\nprove a legally cognizable claim of a hostile environment.\nLipsett, 864 F.2d at 886, 888; accord Allen v. Tyson Foods,\n\n                                        -17-\n\fthat on various occasions she (Hernandez-Loring) had complained\n\nabout Diaz-Riveraโs conduct to the chancellor and others.\n\n          No       precise   formula     determines   what      constitutes     a\n\nhostile environment.           Under Title VII precedents, which we\n\nassume   to   be    followed    in   construing    Puerto       Rico   law,   see\n\nRodriguez-Hernandez, 132 F.3d at 854, the conduct must go beyond\n\nthe \"merely offensive\" and approach tangible injury (including\n\npsychological injury); and factors to be considered include\n\nfrequency,     severity,       whether    the    conduct     is    \"physically\n\nthreatening    or     humiliating,\"      and    whether    it     \"unreasonably\n\ninterferes with an employeeโs work performance.\"                       Harris v.\n\nForklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-23 (1993).                    While it is\n\neasy to find more grievous episodes of harassment, there are\n\nalso cases in which conduct no worse than that described by\n\nHernandez-Loring has been held sufficient to justify a finding\n\nof hostile environment.5\n\n          Accordingly, we cannot sustain the dismissal of the\n\nhostile environment claim upon the only grounds provided by the\n\n\nInc., 121 F.3d 642, 647 (11th Cir. 1997); Robinson v.\nJacksonville Shipyards, Inc., 760 F. Supp. 1486, 1522-23 (M.D.\nFla. 1991); 1 Lindemann & Grossman, Employment Discrimination\nLaw 793 (3d ed. 1996).\n    5E.g., Hutchison v. Amateur Elec.

It is a different matter whether this claim\n\nmight on some other basis be resolved in defendantsโ favor short\n\nof   trial;   in   particular,    it    is   far   from   clear    what   claim\n\nHernandez-Loring has under count II against the other four\n\ncommittee members.       Further, the timing of Hernandez-Loring's\n\nresignation    casts   doubt     on    any   suggestion    of     constructive\n\ndischarge.     Still, the possibility that Hernandez-Loring left\n\nfor reasons other than harassment does not necessarily preclude\n\nnarrower damage claims--if damages can be shown--for events\n\nwithin the applicable statute of limitations.\n\n          For the reasons stated, the grant of summary judgment\n\non count I is affirmed; the grant of summary judgment on count\n\nII is vacated and that count is remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.

Mendez University System, a group of private institutions of higher learning in Puerto Rico.  In 1981, after receiving her Ph.D. in education, she became an instructor at Universidad Metropolitana, one of the units in the system.  She was promoted to auxiliary professor in 1983 and associate professor in 1988.  However, in February 1995, a five-member academic committee declined to recommend Hernandez-Loring for promotion to full professor.  In February 1997 she brought the present action in the federal district court in Puerto Rico based on diversity jurisdiction, Hernandez-Loring by then having moved to Virginia to live with her husband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first of two counts, the complaint charged that the denial of promotion constituted a denial of due process for a number of reasons (e.g., because the committee members were not competent in Hernandez-Loring's field of applied linguistics).  The second count charged sexual harassment; it said that the head of the committee--Dr. Luis R. Diaz-Rivera--had harassed her and that her denial of promotion occurred because \"she refused to date him.\"  The named defendants were Universidad Metropolitana, its chancellor Rene Labarca, all five members of the committee that had refused to recommend Hernandez-Loring's promotion, and the university system of which Universidad Metropolitana is a part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a good deal of discovery including the deposition of Hernandez-Loring, the defendants moved for summary judgment. In opposition, Hernandez-Loring offered an affidavit expanding on her deposition testimony.  On August 20, 1999, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.  Hernandez-Loring v. Universidad Metropolitana, 62 F. Supp. 2d 450, 463 (D.P.R. 1999).  The court's reasoning, discussed below, was different as to each of the three claims--the due process claim (count I) and what the court took to be distinct claims for quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual harassment (count II).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Hernandez-Loring has now appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, the grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, reasonable doubts and issues of credibility being resolved in favor of the non-moving party.  Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 611 (1st Cir. 2000).  At the threshold, Hernandez-Loring argues that the district court should be reversed because the summary judgment motion was filed after the original deadline fixed by the court's scheduling order.  However, such an order may be modified for \"good cause,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b), and the district court's finding of good cause, based on Hernandez-Loring's own discovery delays, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the grant of summary judgment on count I, we readily affirm the district court.  In making academic appointments or promotions, a private university is not directly governed by the due process requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 50 (1999).  Still, Puerto Rico law apparently regards private-university tenure decisions as subject to an implicit contractual constraint that the university will follow its own regulations.  This is the holding of Selosse v. Fundacion Educativa Ana G. Mendez, 122 D.P.R. 534, 545-51 (P.R. 1988), a case that resulted from a suit by a different teacher for denial of tenure by the same university system involved in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez-Loring does not allege a violation of any specific university promotion regulation.  Instead, she criticizes inter alia the failure to include on the committee persons who shared her own specialty, the scoring system used (she placed fourth out of four candidates for one promotion), the vagueness of the standards employed in the promotion process, the disregard of her published work insofar as it was for pay, the inadequacy of the appeals process, and the choice as head of the committee of a man (Diaz-Rivera) whose promotion to the university administration Professor Hernandez-Loring had previously opposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Academic promotion disputes, as the district court noted, often pit concerns about fair procedure against the autonomy of universities; but in this case there is no balancing to be done nor any basis for considering whether the processes employed were \"fair.\"  There is no constitutional claim asserted, no contract claim beyond the right to have regulations followed, and no asserted violation of any specific regulation.  Nothing in Hernandez-Loring's argument indicates that something else is required by Puerto Rico law.  Perhaps Puerto Rico law offers more and, if so, future litigants are welcome to make that showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second claim--that of quid pro quo harassment--is far more difficult to assess. The district court assumed (perhaps wrongly) that Hernandez-Loring was invoking Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(a)(1) (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On appeal, Hernandez-Loring has cited only Puerto Rico statutory law, including the ban on sexual harassment.  29 P.R. Laws Ann.  155b (1995).  Nevertheless, the substantive law of Puerto Rico on sexual harassment appears to be aligned, so far as pertinent here, with Title VII law, and Title VII precedents are used freely in construing Commonwealth law.  Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, 132 F.3d 848, 854 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Title VII, quid pro quo sexual harassment can be shown where a supervisor uses employer processes to punish a subordinate for refusing to comply with sexual demands.  Wills v. Brown Univ., 184 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1999); Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 897 (1st Cir. 1988).  The gist of Hernandez-Loring's quid pro quo claim here is that Diaz-Rivera made advances to her, was rebuffed, and then used his position as head of the committee to revenge himself by blocking her promotion.  The district court assumed that such a claim would be legally viable but ruled that Hernandez-Loring had not offered credible evidence sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During her deposition, Hernandez-Loring offered general allegations, but when pressed for specifics, became  vague, said she did not recollect, or simply repeated her general assertions.  Later, in her affidavit prepared in response to defendants' summary judgment motion, she furnished details, quotations, and in one case a wholly new incident that had not been offered in her deposition.  The district court declined to consider these \"eleventh hour recollections.\"  Hernandez-Loring, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 461.  We will have more to say about this issue but think it clearer to explain first what appeared in the deposition pertinent to the quid pro quo claim and what was added thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the deposition, Hernandez-Loring said that Diaz-Rivera had repeatedly used foul and salacious language in the classroom, that she had complained to the university chancellor or others on a number of occasions, that Diaz-Rivera had interrupted her own classes to request dates with her and pressed his requests on other occasions,  that he had greeted her in the hallways with the phrase, \"Listen, you haven't greeted me today, did I sleep with you last night,\" that although married he had carried on with students, and that at a faculty workshop in August 1995 after she had been denied promotion, the following occurred:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.  What did [Dr. Diaz's] remark consist of?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.  Dr. Diaz told me that if I had done other things the results of my evaluation would have been different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.  What other words did he use?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.  \"That [if] you had gone out with me you would have... - something like that - like going to bed with me, we would have had another... another result.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Hernandez-Loring filed her affidavit, she was far more explicit about specific coarse and sexually explicit and suggestive language used by Diaz-Rivera toward his students and to Hernandez-Loring herself.  Further, in describing what Diaz-Rivera allegedly said to her at the faculty workshop in August 1995, Hernandez-Loring's affidavit discarded paraphrase; Diaz-Rivera, according to the affidavit, said:  \"Maria Virginia, this happened to you for being such a bitch . . . and [for] not [being] willing to go out with me.\"  Finally, Hernandez-Loring alleged for the first time that in July 1995 she had been pawed, and lasciviously addressed, by the chancellor (Labarca), at a faculty lunch while the latter was inebriated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting the quid pro quo claim, the district court gave two different reasons for granting summary judgment.    First, the court ruled that the affidavit should not be considered because it did not square with Hernandez-Loring's earlier deposition testimony.  And, second, the court said that even if it accepted the affidavit's more detailed description of Diaz-Rivera's conduct, \"plaintiff must still establish a colorable claim that her denial of tenure by the review committee was directly linked to\" retaliation by Diaz-Rivera, but that she had \"failed to establish any link between her denial of tenure and Diaz-Rivera's discriminatory animus toward her.\"  Hernandez-Loring, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 462.  Even if Diaz-Rivera's vote was tainted, the court said that it was \"unable to discern any causal link\" between his animus and \"the merit-based objective performance rendered by at least 4 of the 5 committee members.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hernandez-Loring says that the court erred in refusing to consider the affidavit, but as to the quid pro quo claim, the affidavit is largely beside the point.  Hernandez-Loring's deposition testimony already said that Diaz-Rivera pestered her for dates, made explicit sexual references, and then--after the committee he headed recommended against her promotion--more or less said to her in August 1995 that this was the consequence of her spurning him.  Deposition statements of students also corroborated Diaz-Rivera's use of suggestive language.  The affidavit added little to Hernandez-Loring's claim that her promotion denial was an act of spite by Diaz-Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to causation, at first blush it seems unlikely that the private animus of one committee member, even though the presiding member, would be the effective cause of a decision by a committee of five members to rank Hernandez-Loring last among four candidates, giving her a numerical score below the minimum necessary to qualify for promotion to full professor (even if there had been more than one vacancy available).  Cf. Coogan v. Smyers, 134 F.3d 479, 485 (2d Cir. 1998); Jeffries v. Harleston, 52 F.3d 9, 14 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 862 (1995).  On the other hand, it is not impossible: conceivably a biased chair could have influenced other members privately or, depending on how the score was developed, a very low score from one member could have had a disproportionate result.  The briefs are remarkably opaque as to how the committee operated and how it reached its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the most part, this opacity argues against Hernandez-Loring.  Faced with a motion for summary judgment, it was her burden to establish that there existed evidence creating a trial-worthy claim that Diaz-Rivera had caused her to be denied the promotion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986).  In deposing the committee members, she was free to ask questions to establish what was said at the deliberations, to identify so far as possible how the scoring was done, and to identify what Diaz-Rivera might have done to influence the outcome adversely to her promotion.  Of course, objections might have been raised to such inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet she has one very potent fact in her favor.  According to her deposition testimony, Diaz-Rivera himself boasted to her that he had caused her denial of promotion because she had spurned him.  True, he did not explain how this trick had been done and his statement could have been misunderstood or, alternatively, it could have been a cruel deceit to make a denial of promotion on the merits even more painful.  But an admission from a wrongdoer is powerful proof even without detail, see Hallquist v. Local 276, Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters Union, 843 F.2d 18, 24-25 (1stCir. 1988), and how his statement should be construed and whether it should be accepted as true are largely jury issues, at least where the admission is not wholly incredible.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence, apart from Hernandez-Loring's own testimony, that Diaz-Rivera ever made the critical admission.  This is a troubling problem often prominent in harassment cases and accentuated here by the surface unlikelihood of the causation claim.  On the other hand, Hernandez-Loring was consistent in her claim that Diaz-Rivera made his boast; most (although not all) of the other changes in her testimony are less suspicious than they look (as we will shortly explain); and the likelihood that the boast was made is somewhat enhanced, even if indirectly, by the evidence from the students as to how Diaz-Rivera generally behaved.  In sum, we think summary judgment on the quid pro quo claim should not have been granted on the grounds given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, nothing prevents the defense, if the district court permits it, from making a second motion on this issue.  If the four committee members told a consistent story that effectively disproved Diaz-Rivera's boast,  it is not clear that a reasonable jury could accept the boast; nor would Hernandez-Loring automatically be entitled to a trial simply in the hope that the jury might disbelieve consistent, plausible, and otherwise unimpeached testimony from four other witnesses, even if (dubitante) they were technically \"interested\" parties.  See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we consider the claim that there was sufficient evidence of a \"hostile work environment\" to entitle Hernandez-Loring to a trial on that claim.  Here, the district court thought it fatal that much of the force of this claim rested on allegations that appeared only in Hernandez-Loring's affidavit and not in her deposition.  In the alternative, the court said that even if the affidavit were accepted, the court doubted whether the allegations--which it said \"essentially comprise three incidents by two separate individuals during a five-year span, as well as a series of vague entreaties by Diaz-Rivera to date Hernandez-Loring\"--were of \"sufficient frequency and severity\" to make out a colorable claim of hostile work environment.  Hernandez-Loring, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 462 n.5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether (or to what extent) the affidavit had to be considered is a difficult question.  We have said in the past that where a party has given \"clear answers to unambiguous questions\" in discovery, that party cannot \"create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory,\" unless there is a \"satisfactory explanation of why the testimony [has] changed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Partly, the concern is with the credibility of a later disavowal, but the rule is also a matter of policy:  if prior statements under oath could be disavowed at will after a motion is made, the other side would be faced with a constantly moving target and summary dispositions made almost impossible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, in applying this rule, it is critical that there be no \"satisfactory explanation\" since lapse of memory, new sources of information or other events can often explain a revision of testimony.  Whether there is a contradiction and whether the explanation for it is satisfactory are both likely to depend very much on an assessment of specific facts; and in such cases the district court's judgment is likely to be superior to that of a more remote appellate tribunal.  Usually appellate courts give some deference to the district court's assessment of so-called \"mixed questions.\"  United States v. Howard (In re Extradition of Howard), 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1st Cir. 1993).  Deference, however, does not mean abdication, and here our view of the situation differs somewhat from that of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that in the present case the district court was entitled to disregard any completely new incident that Hernandez-Loring described for the first time in her affidavit, assuming that prior questions had clearly asked for such information.  This may be the case with Hernandez-Loring's claim that in July 1995 she was pawed and subjected to suggestive comments by the chancellor.  She was asked in general terms about incidents of harassment and this was a prime candidate:  it was close in time to the deposition and it could have been adverted to without grave embarrassment by paraphrasing the alleged remarks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the other two specific incidents identified by date in Hernandez-Loring's affidavit were both cited in her deposition testimony:  the first was an offensive overture by Diaz-Rivera, probably at a Thanksgiving luncheon in November 1991; the other was the August 1995 claim by Diaz-Rivera that he had blocked her promotion in retaliation for her resistance.  In the first case, Hernandez-Loring supplied precise offensive language only in her affidavit, while in the second, the language offered in the affidavit was stronger only by degree than the softer paraphrase in the deposition.  In neither case is there a real contradiction between deposition and affidavit; and, as for explanation for the changes, the deposition colloquies make clear, and the preface to the affidavit makes explicit, Hernandez-Loring's extreme discomfort and reluctance to repeat the offensive language allegedly used in the various incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, plaintiffs who bring sexual harassment suits have to be prepared to repeat in timely fashion the offensive language at issue, painful though it may be.  Certainly the plaintiff's initial reluctance to remember, and her later offer of detail, could be considered in assessing her testimony.   But in our view it would be an abuse of discretion in the present case to disregard the affidavit as to the two incidents previously identified in the deposition where the only difference between deposition and affidavit was the affidavit's provision of more specific language allegedly used by Diaz-Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the district court's alternative objection.  If the two incidents just mentioned stood alone, it is not easy to see how Hernandez-Loring could make out much of a hostile environment claim.  The first incident allegedly occurred in November 1991.  While the remarks were highly offensive, it appears that Hernandez-Loring did not work for Diaz-Rivera, never reported the incident, and continued to work at the university until her January 1997 departure, which (whether occasioned by marriage or the denial of promotion) seemingly had little connection with a very brief event five years before.  As for Diaz-Rivera's alleged boast in August 1995, it is highly relevant to a claim of quid pro quo harassment, but tamer (although not irrelevant) than the usual basis for a hostile environment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the two alleged incidents are only the most specific of the events that underlie the claim of a hostile environment.  Without being specific as to dates, Hernandez-Loring said that Diaz-Rivera had repeatedly asked her for dates and used suggestive language toward her; that he had interrupted her class to do so; that she had been offended and upset by this pattern of conduct; that Diaz-Rivera was known to have used suggestive and offensive language to students in class (a charge backed up by several student affidavits and depositions);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and that on various occasions she (Hernandez-Loring) had complained about Diaz-Rivera's conduct to the chancellor and others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No precise formula determines what constitutes a hostile environment.  Under Title VII precedents, which we assume to be followed in construing Puerto Rico law, see Rodriguez-Hernandez, 132 F.3d at 854, the conduct must go beyond the \"merely offensive\" and approach tangible injury (including psychological injury); and factors to be considered include frequency, severity, whether the conduct is \"physically threatening or humiliating,\" and whether it \"unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\"  Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-23 (1993).  While it is easy to find more grievous episodes of harassment, there are also cases in which conduct no worse than that described by Hernandez-Loring has been held sufficient to justify a finding of hostile environment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we cannot sustain the dismissal of the hostile environment claim upon the only grounds provided by the district court.   It is a different matter whether this claim might on some other basis be resolved in defendants' favor short of trial; in particular, it is far from clear what claim Hernandez-Loring has under count II against the other four committee members.  Further, the timing of Hernandez-Loring's resignation casts doubt on any suggestion of constructive discharge.  Still, the possibility that Hernandez-Loring left for reasons other than harassment does not necessarily preclude narrower damage claims--if damages can be shown--for events within the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the grant of summary judgment on count I is affirmed; the grant of summary judgment on count II is vacated and that count is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>   Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   It is not at all clear from the complaint that Hernandez-Loring intended to state a separate sexual  harassment claim or whether references in the complaint were solely in support of the due process claim.  However, during the summary judgment proceedings before the district court, both parties treated the case as if there were a separate claim for sexual harassment, devoting a substantial portion of their summary judgment memoranda to that issue, and the district court proceeded on the same basis.  Accordingly, we treat the complaint as effectively amended or clarified by consent.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b); Rodriguez v.

Mendez University System, a group of private institutions of higher learning in Puerto Rico.  In 1981, after receiving her Ph.D. in education, she became an instructor at Universidad Metropolitana, one of the units in the system.  She was promoted to auxiliary professor in 1983 and associate professor in 1988.  However, in February 1995, a five-member academic committee declined to recommend Hernandez-Loring for promotion to full professor.  In February 1997 she brought the present action in the federal district court in Puerto Rico based on diversity jurisdiction, Hernandez-Loring by then having moved to Virginia to live with her husband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first of two counts, the complaint charged that the denial of promotion constituted a denial of due process for a number of reasons (e.g., because the committee members were not competent in Hernandez-Loring's field of applied linguistics).  The second count charged sexual harassment; it said that the head of the committee--Dr. Luis R. Diaz-Rivera--had harassed her and that her denial of promotion occurred because \"she refused to date him.\"  The named defendants were Universidad Metropolitana, its chancellor Rene Labarca, all five members of the committee that had refused to recommend Hernandez-Loring's promotion, and the university system of which Universidad Metropolitana is a part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a good deal of discovery including the deposition of Hernandez-Loring, the defendants moved for summary judgment. In opposition, Hernandez-Loring offered an affidavit expanding on her deposition testimony.  On August 20, 1999, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.  Hernandez-Loring v. Universidad Metropolitana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410612\"><a href=\"/opinion/2410612/hernandez-loring-v-universidad-metropolitana/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 463 (D.P.R. 1999).  The court's reasoning, discussed below, was different as to each of the three claims--the due process claim (count I) and what the court took to be distinct claims for quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual harassment (count II).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Hernandez-Loring has now appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, the grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, reasonable doubts and issues of credibility being resolved in favor of the non-moving party.  Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></span>, 611 (1st Cir. 2000).  At the threshold, Hernandez-Loring argues that the district court should be reversed because the summary judgment motion was filed after the original deadline fixed by the court's scheduling order.  However, such an order may be modified for \"good cause,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b), and the district court's finding of good cause, based on Hernandez-Loring's own discovery delays, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the grant of summary judgment on count I, we readily affirm the district court.  In making academic appointments or promotions, a private university is not directly governed by the due process requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118268\"><a href=\"/opinion/118268/american-mfrs-mut-ins-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 50 (1999).  Still, Puerto Rico law apparently regards private-university tenure decisions as subject to an implicit contractual constraint that the university will follow its own regulations.  This is the holding of Selosse v. Fundacion Educativa Ana G. Mendez, 122 D.P.R. 534, 545-51 (P.R. 1988), a case that resulted from a suit by a different teacher for denial of tenure by the same university system involved in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez-Loring does not allege a violation of any specific university promotion regulation.  Instead, she criticizes inter alia the failure to include on the committee persons who shared her own specialty, the scoring system used (she placed fourth out of four candidates for one promotion), the vagueness of the standards employed in the promotion process, the disregard of her published work insofar as it was for pay, the inadequacy of the appeals process, and the choice as head of the committee of a man (Diaz-Rivera) whose promotion to the university administration Professor Hernandez-Loring had previously opposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Academic promotion disputes, as the district court noted, often pit concerns about fair procedure against the autonomy of universities; but in this case there is no balancing to be done nor any basis for considering whether the processes employed were \"fair.\"  There is no constitutional claim asserted, no contract claim beyond the right to have regulations followed, and no asserted violation of any specific regulation.  Nothing in Hernandez-Loring's argument indicates that something else is required by Puerto Rico law.  Perhaps Puerto Rico law offers more and, if so, future litigants are welcome to make that showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second claim--that of quid pro quo harassment--is far more difficult to assess. The district court assumed (perhaps wrongly) that Hernandez-Loring was invoking Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(a)(1) (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On appeal, Hernandez-Loring has cited only Puerto Rico statutory law, including the ban on sexual harassment.  29 P.R. Laws Ann.  155b (1995).  Nevertheless, the substantive law of Puerto Rico on sexual harassment appears to be aligned, so far as pertinent here, with Title VII law, and Title VII precedents are used freely in construing Commonwealth law.  Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749865\"><a href=\"/opinion/749865/75-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1228-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45317-48-fed-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 854 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Title VII, quid pro quo sexual harassment can be shown where a supervisor uses employer processes to punish a subordinate for refusing to comply with sexual demands.

The gist of Hernandez-Loring's quid pro quo claim here is that Diaz-Rivera made advances to her, was rebuffed, and then used his position as head of the committee to revenge himself by blocking her promotion.  The district court assumed that such a claim would be legally viable but ruled that Hernandez-Loring had not offered credible evidence sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During her deposition, Hernandez-Loring offered general allegations, but when pressed for specifics, became  vague, said she did not recollect, or simply repeated her general assertions.  Later, in her affidavit prepared in response to defendants' summary judgment motion, she furnished details, quotations, and in one case a wholly new incident that had not been offered in her deposition.  The district court declined to consider these \"eleventh hour recollections.\"  Hernandez-Loring, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 461.

Further, in describing what Diaz-Rivera allegedly said to her at the faculty workshop in August 1995, Hernandez-Loring's affidavit discarded paraphrase; Diaz-Rivera, according to the affidavit, said:  \"Maria Virginia, this happened to you for being such a bitch . . . and [for] not [being] willing to go out with me.\"  Finally, Hernandez-Loring alleged for the first time that in July 1995 she had been pawed, and lasciviously addressed, by the chancellor (Labarca), at a faculty lunch while the latter was inebriated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting the quid pro quo claim, the district court gave two different reasons for granting summary judgment.    First, the court ruled that the affidavit should not be considered because it did not square with Hernandez-Loring's earlier deposition testimony.  And, second, the court said that even if it accepted the affidavit's more detailed description of Diaz-Rivera's conduct, \"plaintiff must still establish a colorable claim that her denial of tenure by the review committee was directly linked to\" retaliation by Diaz-Rivera, but that she had \"failed to establish any link between her denial of tenure and Diaz-Rivera's discriminatory animus toward her.\"  Hernandez-Loring, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 462.  Even if Diaz-Rivera's vote was tainted, the court said that it was \"unable to discern any causal link\" between his animus and \"the merit-based objective performance rendered by at least 4 of the 5 committee members.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hernandez-Loring says that the court erred in refusing to consider the affidavit, but as to the quid pro quo claim, the affidavit is largely beside the point.  Hernandez-Loring's deposition testimony already said that Diaz-Rivera pestered her for dates, made explicit sexual references, and then--after the committee he headed recommended against her promotion--more or less said to her in August 1995 that this was the consequence of her spurning him.  Deposition statements of students also corroborated Diaz-Rivera's use of suggestive language.  The affidavit added little to Hernandez-Loring's claim that her promotion denial was an act of spite by Diaz-Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to causation, at first blush it seems unlikely that the private animus of one committee member, even though the presiding member, would be the effective cause of a decision by a committee of five members to rank Hernandez-Loring last among four candidates, giving her a numerical score below the minimum necessary to qualify for promotion to full professor (even if there had been more than one vacancy available).  Cf. Coogan v. Smyers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751096\"><a href=\"/opinion/751096/james-a-coogan-v-thomas-w-smyers-fred-priano-jr-ronald-j-pilozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 485 (2d Cir. 1998); Jeffries v. Harleston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"693421\"><a href=\"/opinion/693421/leonard-jeffries-v-bernard-harleston-individually-and-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></span> (1995).  On the other hand, it is not impossible: conceivably a biased chair could have influenced other members privately or, depending on how the score was developed, a very low score from one member could have had a disproportionate result.  The briefs are remarkably opaque as to how the committee operated and how it reached its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the most part, this opacity argues against Hernandez-Loring.  Faced with a motion for summary judgment, it was her burden to establish that there existed evidence creating a trial-worthy claim that Diaz-Rivera had caused her to be denied the promotion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 256 (1986).  In deposing the committee members, she was free to ask questions to establish what was said at the deliberations, to identify so far as possible how the scoring was done, and to identify what Diaz-Rivera might have done to influence the outcome adversely to her promotion.  Of course, objections might have been raised to such inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet she has one very potent fact in her favor.  According to her deposition testimony, Diaz-Rivera himself boasted to her that he had caused her denial of promotion because she had spurned him.  True, he did not explain how this trick had been done and his statement could have been misunderstood or, alternatively, it could have been a cruel deceit to make a denial of promotion on the merits even more painful.  But an admission from a wrongdoer is powerful proof even without detail, see Hallquist v. Local 276, Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters Union, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503771\"><a href=\"/opinion/503771/47-fair-emplpraccas-323-46-empl-prac-dec-p-37908-25-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1stCir. 1988), and how his statement should be construed and whether it should be accepted as true are largely jury issues, at least where the admission is not wholly incredible.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence, apart from Hernandez-Loring's own testimony, that Diaz-Rivera ever made the critical admission.  This is a troubling problem often prominent in harassment cases and accentuated here by the surface unlikelihood of the causation claim.  On the other hand, Hernandez-Loring was consistent in her claim that Diaz-Rivera made his boast; most (although not all) of the other changes in her testimony are less suspicious than they look (as we will shortly explain); and the likelihood that the boast was made is somewhat enhanced, even if indirectly, by the evidence from the students as to how Diaz-Rivera generally behaved.  In sum, we think summary judgment on the quid pro quo claim should not have been granted on the grounds given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, nothing prevents the defense, if the district court permits it, from making a second motion on this issue.  If the four committee members told a consistent story that effectively disproved Diaz-Rivera's boast,  it is not clear that a reasonable jury could accept the boast; nor would Hernandez-Loring automatically be entitled to a trial simply in the hope that the jury might disbelieve consistent, plausible, and otherwise unimpeached testimony from four other witnesses, even if (dubitante) they were technically \"interested\" parties.  See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 822 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></span> (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we consider the claim that there was sufficient evidence of a \"hostile work environment\" to entitle Hernandez-Loring to a trial on that claim.  Here, the district court thought it fatal that much of the force of this claim rested on allegations that appeared only in Hernandez-Loring's affidavit and not in her deposition.  In the alternative, the court said that even if the affidavit were accepted, the court doubted whether the allegations--which it said \"essentially comprise three incidents by two separate individuals during a five-year span, as well as a series of vague entreaties by Diaz-Rivera to date Hernandez-Loring\"--were of \"sufficient frequency and severity\" to make out a colorable claim of hostile work environment.  Hernandez-Loring, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 462 n.5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether (or to what extent) the affidavit had to be considered is a difficult question.  We have said in the past that where a party has given \"clear answers to unambiguous questions\" in discovery, that party cannot \"create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory,\" unless there is a \"satisfactory explanation of why the testimony [has] changed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Partly, the concern is with the credibility of a later disavowal, but the rule is also a matter of policy:  if prior statements under oath could be disavowed at will after a motion is made, the other side would be faced with a constantly moving target and summary dispositions made almost impossible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, in applying this rule, it is critical that there be no \"satisfactory explanation\" since lapse of memory, new sources of information or other events can often explain a revision of testimony.  Whether there is a contradiction and whether the explanation for it is satisfactory are both likely to depend very much on an assessment of specific facts; and in such cases the district court's judgment is likely to be superior to that of a more remote appellate tribunal.  Usually appellate courts give some deference to the district court's assessment of so-called \"mixed questions.\"  United States v. Howard (In re Extradition of Howard), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1327-28 (1st Cir. 1993).  Deference, however, does not mean abdication, and here our view of the situation differs somewhat from that of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that in the present case the district court was entitled to disregard any completely new incident that Hernandez-Loring described for the first time in her affidavit, assuming that prior questions had clearly asked for such information.  This may be the case with Hernandez-Loring's claim that in July 1995 she was pawed and subjected to suggestive comments by the chancellor.  She was asked in general terms about incidents of harassment and this was a prime candidate:  it was close in time to the deposition and it could have been adverted to without grave embarrassment by paraphrasing the alleged remarks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the other two specific incidents identified by date in Hernandez-Loring's affidavit were both cited in her deposition testimony:  the first was an offensive overture by Diaz-Rivera, probably at a Thanksgiving luncheon in November 1991; the other was the August 1995 claim by Diaz-Rivera that he had blocked her promotion in retaliation for her resistance.  In the first case, Hernandez-Loring supplied precise offensive language only in her affidavit, while in the second, the language offered in the affidavit was stronger only by degree than the softer paraphrase in the deposition.  In neither case is there a real contradiction between deposition and affidavit; and, as for explanation for the changes, the deposition colloquies make clear, and the preface to the affidavit makes explicit, Hernandez-Loring's extreme discomfort and reluctance to repeat the offensive language allegedly used in the various incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, plaintiffs who bring sexual harassment suits have to be prepared to repeat in timely fashion the offensive language at issue, painful though it may be.  Certainly the plaintiff's initial reluctance to remember, and her later offer of detail, could be considered in assessing her testimony.   But in our view it would be an abuse of discretion in the present case to disregard the affidavit as to the two incidents previously identified in the deposition where the only difference between deposition and affidavit was the affidavit's provision of more specific language allegedly used by Diaz-Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the district court's alternative objection.  If the two incidents just mentioned stood alone, it is not easy to see how Hernandez-Loring could make out much of a hostile environment claim.  The first incident allegedly occurred in November 1991.  While the remarks were highly offensive, it appears that Hernandez-Loring did not work for Diaz-Rivera, never reported the incident, and continued to work at the university until her January 1997 departure, which (whether occasioned by marriage or the denial of promotion) seemingly had little connection with a very brief event five years before.  As for Diaz-Rivera's alleged boast in August 1995, it is highly relevant to a claim of quid pro quo harassment, but tamer (although not irrelevant) than the usual basis for a hostile environment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the two alleged incidents are only the most specific of the events that underlie the claim of a hostile environment.  Without being specific as to dates, Hernandez-Loring said that Diaz-Rivera had repeatedly asked her for dates and used suggestive language toward her; that he had interrupted her class to do so; that she had been offended and upset by this pattern of conduct; that Diaz-Rivera was known to have used suggestive and offensive language to students in class (a charge backed up by several student affidavits and depositions);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and that on various occasions she (Hernandez-Loring) had complained about Diaz-Rivera's conduct to the chancellor and others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No precise formula determines what constitutes a hostile environment.  Under Title VII precedents, which we assume to be followed in construing Puerto Rico law, see Rodriguez-Hernandez, 132 F.3d at 854, the conduct must go beyond the \"merely offensive\" and approach tangible injury (including psychological injury); and factors to be considered include frequency, severity, whether the conduct is \"physically threatening or humiliating,\" and whether it \"unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\"  Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21-23 (1993).  While it is easy to find more grievous episodes of harassment, there are also cases in which conduct no worse than that described by Hernandez-Loring has been held sufficient to justify a finding of hostile environment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we cannot sustain the dismissal of the hostile environment claim upon the only grounds provided by the district court.   It is a different matter whether this claim might on some other basis be resolved in defendants' favor short of trial; in particular, it is far from clear what claim Hernandez-Loring has under count II against the other four committee members.  Further, the timing of Hernandez-Loring's resignation casts doubt on any suggestion of constructive discharge.  Still, the possibility that Hernandez-Loring left for reasons other than harassment does not necessarily preclude narrower damage claims--if damages can be shown--for events within the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the grant of summary judgment on count I is affirmed; the grant of summary judgment on count II is vacated and that count is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>   Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   It is not at all clear from the complaint that Hernandez-Loring intended to state a separate sexual  harassment claim or whether references in the complaint were solely in support of the due process claim.  However, during the summary judgment proceedings before the district court, both parties treated the case as if there were a separate claim for sexual harassment, devoting a substantial portion of their summary judgment memoranda to that issue, and the district court proceeded on the same basis.  Accordingly, we treat the complaint as effectively amended or clarified by consent.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b); Rodriguez v.
