On February 21, 1996, a federal\n\ngrand jury indicted defendant-appellant José R. Pérez-Carrera\n\n(along with two codefendants).                    The indictment contained six\n\ncounts,       viz.,    aiding    and    abetting          a    bank     robbery,    death\n\nresulting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 2113(a), (d), (e)\n\n(count 1); aiding and abetting the use and carriage of automatic\n\nweapons during and in relation to a crime of violence, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 924(c)(1), (3) (count 2); aiding\n\nand   abetting        the    taking    of    a    motor       vehicle    by    force    and\n\nviolence, intending to cause death or serious bodily harm and\n\nresulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 2119(3)\n\n(count 3); aiding and abetting the use and carriage of firearms\n\nduring    a    carjacking,       in    violation      of       18    U.S.C.    §§   2   and\n\n924(c)(1), (3) (count 4); aiding and abetting the possession or\n\nreceipt of firearms shipped or transported in interstate or\n\nforeign commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 922(g), and\n\n924(a)(2) (count 5); and aiding and abetting the possession of\n\ntwo semi-automatic assault rifles in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n2,    922(v)(1),       and    924(a)(1)(B)         (count      6).       The   appellant\n\noriginally pleaded not guilty across the board but subsequently\n\nmoved to revise his plea.\n\n              The district court convened a change-of-plea hearing\n\non April 9, 1997.            During that session, the appellant withdrew\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fhis original plea and entered a plea of guilty to counts 1, 2,\n\n3, 4, and 6 pursuant to a written agreement with the government\n\n(the Plea Agreement).       After conducting an extensive colloquy,\n\nsee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, the district court accepted the changed\n\nplea and scheduled disposition for August 15, 1997.\n\n          After    several     delays,       the     court    convened   the\n\ndisposition hearing on May 27, 1998.           At that time, the court\n\ndismissed count 5 of the indictment and sentenced the appellant\n\nto concurrent 293-month incarcerative terms on counts 1 and 3;\n\na similarly concurrent 60-month term on count 6; a 120-month\n\nterm on count 2, consecutive to the sentences imposed on counts\n\n1, 3, and 6; and a 240-month term on count 4, consecutive to all\n\nthe other sentences.    Facing the grim prospect of 653 months in\n\nprison, Pérez-Carrera filed this timely appeal.\n\n          Proceedings before this court have brought to light a\n\nseries of bevues.    The Plea Agreement erroneously recited that\n\ncount 2 exposed the appellant to \"[a] mandatory sentence of five\n\nyears.\"    But    because    count    2    charged    the    appellant   with\n\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) by the use and carriage of\n\nautomatic weapons, the offense carried a mandatory sentence of\n\nten years under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(B).              By like token, the\n\nPlea Agreement mistakenly recited that the appellant faced \"[a]\n\nstatutory maximum sentence of TEN (10) years imprisonment\" on\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcount 6.     But because that count charged the appellant with\n\naiding and abetting in the unlawful possession of two semi-\n\nautomatic assault weapons, as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 921(a)(30), the offense carried a maximum penalty of five\n\nyears.   See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(v)(1), 924(a)(1)(B).        These errors\n\nwere repeated in the change-of-plea colloquy.             During that\n\nexchange, the district court told the appellant that, if he pled\n\nguilty, he would be exposed to a mandatory sentence of five\n\nyears on count 2 and a maximum sentence of ten years on count 6.\n\nThese statements were inaccurate.1\n\n            By the time of sentencing, the probation department had\n\nfiled a presentence report that recited the correct sentencing\n\nparameters for counts 2 and 6, and the court sentenced the\n\nappellant    within   those   parameters.      No   one   spotted   the\n\ninconsistencies between the representations originally made to\n\nthe appellant and the sentence actually imposed.          Despite the\n\nlack of any contemporaneous objection, however, we may review\n\nthe sentence for plain error.    United States v. Gandia-Maysonet,\n\n227 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).2        We warm to that task, mindful\n\n\n    1 The Plea Agreement accurately described the penalties\nassociated with the other counts of conviction, and the district\ncourt gave the appellant correct advice anent those penalties in\nthe change-of-plea colloquy.\n    2The test for plain error is multi-dimensional. See United\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993) (explaining required\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthat part of the plain error calculus requires an appellant to\n\nshow that an error was not harmless, i.e., that it affected his\n\nsubstantial rights.       See supra note 2; see also Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(h).\n\n           As to count 6, the misstatements made by the government\n\nand the district court obviously were harmless (and, therefore,\n\nnot a proper ground for setting aside the appellant's plea or\n\nsentence).     Although the prosecutor and the court misinformed\n\nthe   appellant   as   to    the    maximum   penalty    for     count   6,   the\n\nsentence actually imposed was not only within legal limits, but\n\nalso was substantially less than the mistaken maximum.                    Under\n\nthose circumstances, there was no prejudice. 3                   E.g., United\n\nStates    v.   Camacho,     233    F.3d   1308,   1319   (11th    Cir.   2000),\n\npetition for cert. filed (U.S. Feb. 20, 2001) (No. 00-8593);\n\nUnited States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           Count 2 presents a different problem.               The government\n\nand the district court incorrectly advised the appellant that\n\nthis count carried a mandatory five-year penalty.                The appellant\n\n\nshowing as encompassing (1) an error (2) that is obvious and (3)\nthat affects the defendant's substantial rights, (4) provided\nthat the error, if uncorrected, also may affect the fairness,\nintegrity, or public repute of judicial proceedings); Gandia-\nMaysonet, 227 F.3d at 5-6 (same).\n      3\n     To cinch the harmless-error inquiry, the sentence imposed\non count 6 was less than, yet concurrent with, the untainted\nsentences validly imposed on counts 1 and 3.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fpleaded guilty based on that information.               The court nonetheless\n\nsentenced    him   to    ten   years    in    prison.      In    light   of    the\n\nrepresentations made to the appellant in connection with his\n\nguilty plea, this sentence cannot stand.\n\n            To its credit, the government concedes that, under\n\nthese circumstances, the imposition of a ten-year sentence on\n\ncount 2     violates Rule 11(c)(1) and is not harmless within the\n\ncontemplation of Rule 11(h).            In view of this concession, we\n\nthink that the error is easily corrected.                       After all, the\n\ndistrict court did inform the appellant that his plea to count\n\n2 would result in the imposition of a mandatory sentence of five\n\nyears.    Since the United States concedes the error and informs\n\nus that it has no objection to the lesser sentence, there is no\n\nneed to set aside the appellant's plea to this count.                    Rather,\n\nwe   instruct   the     district   court,      on   remand,     to   modify    the\n\nsentence imposed by reducing the incarcerative term under count\n\n2 to five years.        See Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(4); United States\n\nv. Moree, 928 F.2d 654, 655-56 (5th Cir. 1991).\n\n            We are cognizant of the appellant's claim that, had he\n\nbeen aware of the errors discussed above, he would not have\n\nentered a guilty plea at all.                Appellant's Br. at 10.           This\n\nclaim, however, is made in wholly conclusory terms.                      We have\n\nreviewed the record with care and find no basis for suspecting\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthat   the    misinformation        about      the     terms   of     imprisonment\n\navailable in respect to counts 2 and 6 deprived the appellant of\n\na full understanding of the consequences of his actions or\n\notherwise influenced his decision to change his plea.                          After\n\nall, counts 1 and 3 — each of which carried a maximum term of\n\nlife imprisonment — were the centerpieces of the indictment, and\n\nit is surpassingly difficult to believe that, having decided to\n\nbite   the    bullet   and    plead     to    those    grave   charges,    a    more\n\naccurate description of the penalties associated with counts 2\n\nand 6 would have made a dispositive difference.\n\n             We add two observations relating to different subjects.\n\nThe first deals with a pro se brief filed by the appellant.                       We\n\nhave carefully reviewed that submission (which dwells on the\n\ngovernment's     refusal      to    move     for   a   downward     departure     at\n\nsentencing pursuant to USSG §5K1.1) and find it wholly lacking\n\nin merit.     See, e.g., Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 185-\n\n86   (1992)    (holding      that   a   defendant      must    make   substantial\n\nshowing of improper motive to force review of the prosecutor's\n\nrefusal to seek a \"substantial assistance\" downward departure);\n\nUnited States v. Alegría, 192 F.3d 179, 183 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(similar); United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 293 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (noting that wholly conclusory allegations cannot overcome\n\nthe government motion requirement).\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f              Our second observation relates to yet another pro se\n\nfiling.      While this appeal was pending, the appellant served a\n\npro se motion suggesting that his appointed appellate counsel\n\nhad    failed       to   raise   various       defenses   and    was,    therefore,\n\nineffective.4        By separate order, we agreed to treat this motion\n\nas a supplemental pro se brief.\n\n              We have considered this submission.                We think that it\n\nfalls      within    the    ambit   of   our    oft-stated      rule    \"that    fact-\n\nspecific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their\n\ndebut on direct review of criminal convictions.\"                       United States\n\nv. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).\n\nGiven the need for factfinding — a task that we, as an appellate\n\ncourt, are neither equipped nor inclined to undertake — that\n\nrule applies here.            Consequently, we dismiss the appellant's\n\nineffective assistance claim, without prejudice to his right to\n\nassert it in the district court by way of a petition for post-\n\nconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n              We need go no further.           Despite the unfortunate errors\n\nthat occurred in the lower court, we see no manifest injustice\n\nand,       thus,    no     compelling    reason     for    setting       aside    the\n\n\n       4\n     The appellant apparently faults his counsel for neglecting\nto pursue sundry theories of prosecutorial misconduct or to\nexpose misrepresentations supposedly made by his trial counsel.\nThese arguments depend almost exclusively on facts that are not\nevident from the existing record.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fappellant's conviction or allowing him to withdraw his guilty\n\nplea.   Since the only cognizable defect in his sentence is\n\neasily corrected, we remand the case to the district court for\n\nthe entry of a modified sentence in regard to count 2 and, as\n\nmodified, uphold the judgment below.\n\n         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f",

Perez-Carrera (along with two codefendants). The indictment contained six counts, viz., aiding and abetting a bank robbery, death resulting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 2113(a), (d), (e) (count 1); aiding and abetting the use and carriage of automatic weapons during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 924(c)(1), (3) (count 2); aiding and abetting the taking of a motor vehicle by force and violence, intending to cause death or serious bodily harm and resulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 2119(3) (count 3); aiding and abetting the use and carriage of firearms during a carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 924(c)(1), (3) (count 4); aiding and abetting the possession or receipt of firearms shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 922(g), and 924(a)(2) (count 5); and aiding and abetting the possession of two semi-automatic assault rifles in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 922(v)(1), and 924(a)(1)(B) (count 6). The appellant originally pleaded not guilty across the board but subsequently moved to revise his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened a change-of-plea hearing on April 9, 1997. During that session, the appellant withdrew his original plea and entered a plea of guilty to counts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 pursuant to a written agreement with the government (the Plea Agreement). After conducting an extensive colloquy, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, the district court accepted the changed plea and scheduled disposition for August 15, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several delays, the court convened the disposition hearing on May 27, 1998.

The Plea Agreement erroneously recited that count 2 exposed the appellant to \"[a] mandatory sentence of five years.\" But because count 2 charged the appellant with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) by the use and carriage of automatic weapons, the offense carried a mandatory sentence of ten years under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(B). By like token, the Plea Agreement mistakenly recited that the appellant faced \"[a] statutory maximum sentence of TEN (10) years imprisonment\" on count 6. But because that count charged the appellant with aiding and abetting in the unlawful possession of two semi-automatic assault weapons, as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(30), the offense carried a maximum penalty of five years. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(v)(1), 924(a)(1)(B). These errors were repeated in the change-of-plea colloquy. During that exchange, the district court told the appellant that, if he pled guilty, he would be exposed to a mandatory sentence of five years on count 2 and a maximum sentence of ten years on count 6. These statements were inaccurate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time of sentencing, the probation department had filed a presentence report that recited the correct sentencing parameters for counts 2 and 6, and the court sentenced the appellant within those parameters.

In view of this concession, we think that the error is easily corrected. After all, the district court did inform the appellant that his plea to count 2 would result in the imposition of a mandatory sentence of five years. Since the United States concedes the error and informs us that it has no objection to the lesser sentence, there is no need to set aside the appellant's plea to this count. Rather, we instruct the district court, on remand, to modify the sentence imposed by reducing the incarcerative term under count 2 to five years. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(4); United States v. Moree, 928 F.2d 654, 655-56 (5th Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are cognizant of the appellant's claim that, had he been aware of the errors discussed above, he would not have entered a guilty plea at all. Appellant's Br. at 10. This claim, however, is made in wholly conclusory terms. We have reviewed the record with care and find no basis for suspecting that the misinformation about the terms of imprisonment available in respect to counts 2 and 6 deprived the appellant of a full understanding of the consequences of his actions or otherwise influenced his decision to change his plea. After all, counts 1 and 3 -- each of which carried a maximum term of life imprisonment -- were the centerpieces of the indictment, and it is surpassingly difficult to believe that, having decided to bite the bullet and plead to those grave charges, a more accurate description of the penalties associated with counts 2 and 6 would have made a dispositive difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add two observations relating to different subjects. The first deals with a pro se brief filed by the appellant. We have carefully reviewed that submission (which dwells on the government's refusal to move for a downward departure at sentencing pursuant to USSG &#167;5K1.1) and find it wholly lacking in merit. See, e.g., Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 185-86 (1992) (holding that a defendant must make substantial showing of improper motive to force review of the prosecutor's refusal to seek a \"substantial assistance\" downward departure); United States v. Alegra, 192 F.3d 179, 183 (1st Cir. 1999) (similar); United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 293 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that wholly conclusory allegations cannot overcome the government motion requirement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our second observation relates to yet another pro se filing. While this appeal was pending, the appellant served a pro se motion suggesting that his appointed appellate counsel had failed to raise various defenses and was, therefore, ineffective.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> By separate order, we agreed to treat this motion as a supplemental pro se brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered this submission. We think that it falls within the ambit of our oft-stated rule \"that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions.\" United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting cases). Given the need for factfinding -- a task that we, as an appellate court, are neither equipped nor inclined to undertake -- that rule applies here. Consequently, we dismiss the appellant's ineffective assistance claim, without prejudice to his right to assert it in the district court by way of a petition for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Despite the unfortunate errors that occurred in the lower court, we see no manifest injustice and, thus, no compelling reason for setting aside the appellant's conviction or allowing him to withdraw his guilty plea. Since the only cognizable defect in his sentence is easily corrected, we remand the case to the district court for the entry of a modified sentence in regard to count 2 and, as modified, uphold the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Plea Agreement accurately described the penalties associated with the other counts of conviction, and the district court gave the appellant correct advice anent those penalties in the change-of-plea colloquy.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The test for plain error is multi-dimensional.

Perez-Carrera (along with two codefendants). The indictment contained six counts, viz., aiding and abetting a bank robbery, death resulting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 2113(a), (d), (e) (count 1); aiding and abetting the use and carriage of automatic weapons during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 924(c)(1), (3) (count 2); aiding and abetting the taking of a motor vehicle by force and violence, intending to cause death or serious bodily harm and resulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 2119(3) (count 3); aiding and abetting the use and carriage of firearms during a carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2 and 924(c)(1), (3) (count 4); aiding and abetting the possession or receipt of firearms shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 922(g), and 924(a)(2) (count 5); and aiding and abetting the possession of two semi-automatic assault rifles in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 922(v)(1), and 924(a)(1)(B) (count 6). The appellant originally pleaded not guilty across the board but subsequently moved to revise his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened a change-of-plea hearing on April 9, 1997. During that session, the appellant withdrew his original plea and entered a plea of guilty to counts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 pursuant to a written agreement with the government (the Plea Agreement). After conducting an extensive colloquy, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, the district court accepted the changed plea and scheduled disposition for August 15, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several delays, the court convened the disposition hearing on May 27, 1998. At that time, the court dismissed count 5 of the indictment and sentenced the appellant to concurrent 293-month incarcerative terms on counts 1 and 3; a similarly concurrent 60-month term on count 6; a 120-month term on count 2, consecutive to the sentences imposed on counts 1, 3, and 6; and a 240-month term on count 4, consecutive to all the other sentences. Facing the grim prospect of 653 months in prison, Perez-Carrera filed this timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceedings before this court have brought to light a series of bevues. The Plea Agreement erroneously recited that count 2 exposed the appellant to \"[a] mandatory sentence of five years.\" But because count 2 charged the appellant with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) by the use and carriage of automatic weapons, the offense carried a mandatory sentence of ten years under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(B). By like token, the Plea Agreement mistakenly recited that the appellant faced \"[a] statutory maximum sentence of TEN (10) years imprisonment\" on count 6. But because that count charged the appellant with aiding and abetting in the unlawful possession of two semi-automatic assault weapons, as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(30), the offense carried a maximum penalty of five years. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(v)(1), 924(a)(1)(B). These errors were repeated in the change-of-plea colloquy. During that exchange, the district court told the appellant that, if he pled guilty, he would be exposed to a mandatory sentence of five years on count 2 and a maximum sentence of ten years on count 6. These statements were inaccurate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time of sentencing, the probation department had filed a presentence report that recited the correct sentencing parameters for counts 2 and 6, and the court sentenced the appellant within those parameters. No one spotted the inconsistencies between the representations originally made to the appellant and the sentence actually imposed. Despite the lack of any contemporaneous objection, however, we may review the sentence for plain error. United States v. Gandia-Maysonet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199077\"><a href=\"/opinion/199077/united-states-v-gandia-maysonet/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We warm to that task, mindful that part of the plain error calculus requires an appellant to show that an error was not harmless, i.e., that it affected his substantial rights. See supra note 2; see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to count 6, the misstatements made by the government and the district court obviously were harmless (and, therefore, not a proper ground for setting aside the appellant's plea or sentence). Although the prosecutor and the court misinformed the appellant as to the maximum penalty for count 6, the sentence actually imposed was not only within legal limits, but also was substantially less than the mistaken maximum. Under those circumstances, there was no prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> E.g., United States v. Camacho, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></span>, 1319 (11th Cir. 2000), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Feb. 20, 2001) (No. 00-8593); United States v. McDonald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744603\"><a href=\"/opinion/744603/united-states-v-cecilio-f-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 2 presents a different problem. The government and the district court incorrectly advised the appellant that this count carried a mandatory five-year penalty. The appellant pleaded guilty based on that information. The court nonetheless sentenced him to ten years in prison. In light of the representations made to the appellant in connection with his guilty plea, this sentence cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To its credit, the government concedes that, under these circumstances, the imposition of a ten-year sentence on count 2 violates Rule 11(c)(1) and is not harmless within the contemplation of Rule 11(h). In view of this concession, we think that the error is easily corrected. After all, the district court did inform the appellant that his plea to count 2 would result in the imposition of a mandatory sentence of five years. Since the United States concedes the error and informs us that it has no objection to the lesser sentence, there is no need to set aside the appellant's plea to this count. Rather, we instruct the district court, on remand, to modify the sentence imposed by reducing the incarcerative term under count 2 to five years. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(4); United States v. Moree, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557807\"><a href=\"/opinion/557807/united-states-v-sim-ed-moree/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span>, 655-56 (5th Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are cognizant of the appellant's claim that, had he been aware of the errors discussed above, he would not have entered a guilty plea at all.
