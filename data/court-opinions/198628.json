Charles B. Swartwood, III, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n          Selya, Boudin, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n        Raymond J. Reed for appellants.\r\n        Daniel P. Sullivan for appellee.\r\n\nSeptember 8, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  James and Mark Duffy own a 48-room\r\nlodging house with two retail stores on the first floor (the\r\nPremises), located at 257 Pleasant Street, Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts.  After the Premises sustained over $100,000 in fire\r\ndamage in July 1995, the Duffys' insurer rescinded the policy based\r\non misrepresentations in the Duffys' application for insurance\r\nabout the presence of sprinklers on the Premises.  The insurer\r\nthereafter filed suit in the district court seeking a declaratory\r\njudgment validating its rescission.  The district court obliged,\r\nruling that the insurer was justified in relying on the\r\nmisrepresentation by the Duffys in their application for insurance\r\nthat the Premises was protected by sprinklers, despite an earlier\r\nreport in the insurer's file indicating the absence of sprinklers.\r\nWe affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\nOn June 1, 1994, the Virzi Insurance Agency, Inc.\r\n(Virzi), on behalf of the Duffys, requested a quote from E.A. Kelly\r\nfor the cost of insuring the Premises.  E. A. Kelly has authority\r\nto issue policies on behalf of General Star Indemnity Company\r\n(General Star).  In order to facilitate the process, Virzi, on\r\nbehalf of the Duffys, forwarded an unsigned application to E.A.\r\nKelly.  That application indicated that: (a) all building\r\nimprovements had been updated within the last five years; and (b)\r\nthe Premises was sprinklered.  The notation that the Premises was\r\nsprinklered was handwritten.\r\nHaving received a quote from E. A. Kelly on June 3, 1994,\r\nVirzi, on behalf of the Duffys, submitted a signed application for\r\ninsurance on June 9, 1994.  E. A. Kelly issued an insurance policy\r\nfor the Premises effective June 9, 1994.  The policy contained an\r\nendorsement for \"Protective Safeguards\" which required smoke\r\nalarms, an ansul [fire protection] system and an automatic\r\nsprinkler system.  On June 18, 1994, E. A. Kelly, on behalf of\r\nGeneral Star, ordered an inspection of the Premises for the purpose\r\nof verifying its condition.  On July 25, 1994, E. A. Kelly received\r\nthe inspection report.  The inspection form included a list of\r\nsafety systems and devices, some of which had check marks next to\r\nthem and some of which had no markings.  The inspector's report\r\ncontained a hyphen after the word \"sprinkler\"; the district court\r\nassumed for the purpose of its summary judgment ruling that the\r\nreport indicated that the Premises was not sprinklered at the time\r\nof the inspection.  Neither E. A. Kelly nor General Star further\r\ninvestigated whether or not the Premises had an automatic sprinkler\r\nsystem.\r\nIn May 1995, the Duffys requested a renewal quote from E.\r\nA. Kelly.  In response, E. A. Kelly offered to renew the insurance\r\nfor the Premises.  The policy proposed stated that \"SMOKE ALARMS,\r\nSPRINKLER SYSTEM AND ANSUL SYSTEM WARRANTED.\"  On or about June 9,\r\n1995, Virzi, on behalf of the Duffys, provided E. A. Kelly with a\r\nrenewal application signed by Virzi and James Duffy.  The signed\r\nrenewal application warranted that the Premises was sprinklered. \r\nWhen E. A. Kelly renewed the insurance policy for the period of\r\nJune 9, 1995 through June 9, 1996, it contained an endorsement for\r\n\"Protective Safeguards\" which required smoke alarms, an ansul\r\nsystem and an automatic sprinkler.\r\nOn July 9, 1995, the Premises sustained fire damage in\r\nthe amount of $105,713.27.  On August 7, 1996, General Star\r\nforwarded correspondence to the Duffys denying coverage and\r\nrescinding the policy based on the misrepresentation in the 1995\r\napplication that the Premises was sprinklered.\r\nGeneral Star thereafter filed a complaint for declaratory\r\njudgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2201 &amp; 2202, seeking a judicial\r\ndetermination that General Star had a right to rescind the\r\ninsurance policy based on the misrepresentation.  In response, the\r\nDuffys filed counterclaims alleging violations of Massachusetts\r\ninsurance and consumer protection laws.  The district court granted\r\nGeneral Star a summary judgment, concluding that under\r\nMassachusetts law General Star had a right to rescind the policy\r\nbecause the Duffys' misrepresentation that the Premises was\r\nsprinklered was material in that it increased the risk of loss to\r\nGeneral Star as a matter of law.  The district court further held\r\nthat Massachusetts law imposed \"no requirement to have the Premises\r\ninspected prior to issuing a renewal policy\" and that \"General Star\r\nwas justified in relying on Mr. Duffy's representation that the\r\nPremises was sprinklered.\"\r\n                            II.\r\nSummary judgment is warranted only where an examination\r\nof the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\nparty, reveals no material factual disputes and the moving party is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\r\nSnow v. Harnishfeger Corp., 12 F.3d 1154, 1157 (1st Cir. 1993).  We\r\nreview the grant of a summary judgment de novo.  Siegal v. American\r\nHonda Motor Co., 921 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).   \r\nWe apply Massachusetts law to the insurance contract made\r\nin Massachusetts.  The Massachusetts statutory provision\r\nestablishing the conditions under which an insurer may rescind\r\ncontracts of insurance provides:\r\n  No oral or written misrepresentation or\r\nwarranty made in the negotiation of a policy\r\nof insurance by the insured or on his behalf\r\nshall be deemed material or defeat or avoid\r\nthe policy or prevent its attaching unless\r\nsuch misrepresentation or warranty is made\r\nwith actual intent to deceive, or unless the\r\nmatter misrepresented or made a warranty\r\nincreased the risk of loss.\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 175,  186.  For purposes of this appeal, the\r\nDuffys do not challenge the district court's findings that (1) the\r\nDuffys unintentionally made misrepresentations in their 1995\r\ninsurance application to General Star and (2) the misrepresentation\r\nregarding the existence of an automatic sprinkler system increased\r\nthe insurer's risk of loss as a matter of law.  The single issue\r\npressed by the Duffys is whether General Star waived its right to\r\nrescind the insurance contract on the basis of that\r\nmisrepresentation.  The Duffys argue that, at the time General Star\r\nrenewed the Duffys' policy in June 1995, General Star knew that the\r\nPremises was in fact not sprinklered because of the inspection\r\nreport it received in June 1994.  Having renewed the policy with\r\nknowledge that the Premises was not sprinklered, the Duffys argue,\r\nGeneral Star waived its right to rescind on the basis of a\r\nmisrepresentation about the presence of sprinklers (or so a jury,\r\ndrawing inferences favorable to the Duffys, could have found).\r\nThe Duffys err in their insistence that General Star had\r\nknowledge in June 1995 that there were no sprinklers on the\r\nPremises because of the inclusion in its files of the June 1994\r\ninspection report.  That position wrongly accords no legal\r\nsignificance to the warranty made by the Duffys in their\r\napplication for renewed insurance in June 1995 that there were\r\nsprinklers on the Premises.  To the extent that the Duffys argue\r\nthat the inclusion of the 1994 inspection report in the files of\r\nGeneral Star at least creates a factual issue about whether the\r\ninsurer should have inspected the premises to determine the\r\naccuracy of the representation by the Duffys about the presence of\r\nsprinklers, the Duffys again misapprehend the legal significance of\r\ntheir representation.\r\nPursuant to Massachusetts law and insurance law\r\ngenerally, General Star had a right to rely on the Duffys'\r\nrepresentation that the Premises was sprinklered in June 1995.  See\r\nAppleman &amp; Appleman, 16B Insurance Law and Practice  9086 (2d ed.\r\n1967) (\"[A]n insurer is entitled to rely on the representations of\r\nan insured without checking all of its files to determine if such\r\ninsured is guilty of fraud.\").  The Duffys were in the best\r\nposition to know the truthfulness of their statement about the\r\nsprinklers, and Massachusetts law does not impose an affirmative\r\nobligation on an insurer to investigate and verify the accuracy of\r\nan insured's representations.  See U.S. Express, Inc. v. Intercargo\r\nIns. Co., 841 F. Supp. 1328, 1338 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (construing\r\nMassachusetts law); see also North American Specialty Ins Co. v.\r\nSavage, 977 F. Supp. 725, 731 (D. Md. 1997) (\"Generally, insurers\r\ndo not have a duty to investigate insurance applicants and are\r\nentitled to believe what an applicant claims to be true.\"); Foster\r\nv. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 703 N.E.2d 657, 660 (Ind. 1998) (\"Imposing\r\nthis obligation [to cross-check the accuracy of an application\r\nagainst others submitted by the same applicant] would create the\r\nopportunity to play a catch-me-if-you-can game that would\r\nultimately generate additional costs to insurers and no legitimate\r\nbenefits to insureds.\"). \r\nGeneral Star was further justified in relying on the\r\nDuffys' representation that the Premises was sprinklered because of\r\nthe Duffys' impending legal obligation to sprinkler the building. \r\nOn September 25, 1990, the City of Worcester adopted the provisions\r\nof Massachusetts General Laws chapter 148, section 26H, requiring\r\nrooming houses such as the Premises to be equipped with automatic\r\nsprinkler systems no later than September 25, 1995.  This\r\nindependent legal obligation, applicable shortly after the renewal\r\nof the insurance contract, further justified General Star's\r\nreliance on the representation by the Duffys in June 1995 that the\r\nPremises was sprinklered.\r\nWe recognize the general proposition, cited by the\r\nDuffys, that an insurer may lose its right to rescind the coverage\r\nof an insurance contract if it knows of the facts that may warrant\r\nrescission and fails to disclaim within a reasonable time, or if it\r\nacts in any way inconsistent with an intention to disclaim.  See\r\ne.g., Kobico, Inc. v. Pipe, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 103 (1997).  Pursuant\r\nto Massachusetts law, \"[a]n insurance company is obliged to provide\r\ncoverage to an insured who has violated a provision of the policy\r\nif the company has waived its right to assert the policy breach as\r\na ground for denying liability.\"  Merrimack Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v.\r\nNonaka, 414 Mass. 187, 189, 606 N.E.2d 904 (1993).  \"Waiver\r\nconsists of the insurer's voluntary or intentional relinquishment\r\nof a known right.\"  Id.\r\nIn this case, however, these principles of waiver are\r\nsimply inapposite.  As a matter of law, on the basis of the summary\r\njudgment record, General Star was entitled to rely on the\r\nrepresentation of the Duffys in their application for insurance\r\nrenewal that the Premises was sprinklered, despite the presence in\r\nGeneral Star's files of the 1994 inspection report. \r\nThe Duffys challenge the district court's decision on\r\nanother ground, noting that the district court cited to an Oregon\r\ncase for the proposition that \"the presence of a fully operational\r\nsprinkler in an insured building is material to a fire insurer's\r\nrisk.\"  Coos Head Timber Co. v. Unigard Indemnity Co., 93 Or. 598,\r\n603, 699 P.2d 1143, 1146 (1985).  The Duffys cry foul because the\r\nCoos Head Timber case dealt with a policy in which the presence of\r\na sprinkler system was a condition precedent while under the\r\nDuffys' policy the insured was only required to warrant the\r\npresence of sprinklers.  Ergo, the Duffys argue, the district\r\ncourt actually treated the sprinkler requirement as a condition\r\nprecedent and therefore failed to analyze whether General Star had\r\nwaived its right to rescind.  See Krause v. Equitable Life Ins.\r\nCo., 333 Mass. 200, 203 (1955) (term which is made a condition\r\nprecedent to recovery under an insurance policy is not subject to\r\nwaiver).\r\nThe Duffys' argument on this point is unavailing.  The\r\nDuffys presented this same argument to the district court in a\r\nMotion to Reconsider and/or Clarify.  In disposing of that motion,\r\nthe district court acknowledged, as it had in its original summary\r\njudgment order, that Coos Head Timber dealt with a policy under\r\nwhich an operational sprinkler system was a condition precedent and\r\nthat the sprinkler clause in the Duffys' policy constituted a\r\nwarranty.  The district court, however, was merely citing to Coos\r\nHead Timber for the unassailable legal proposition that \"the\r\npresence of a fully operational sprinkler system in an insured\r\nbuilding is material to a fire insurer's risk.\"  Id.  Contrary to\r\nthe contention of the Duffys, the court did not treat the sprinkler\r\nrequirement as a condition precedent and it did consider the issue\r\nof waiver.  In all events, our review is de novo, and any\r\nmisapprehension below would not affect the outcome of this appeal.\r\n                             III.\r\nIn summary, the June 1995 renewal application of the\r\nDuffys warranted that the Premises was sprinklered.  This warranty\r\nwas explicitly made a part of the insurance contract.  Despite the\r\npresence in its files of a June 1994 inspection report indicating\r\nthe absence of sprinklers at the Premises, General Star was\r\njustified in issuing the policy renewal on the basis of the Duffys'\r\nnew warranty without conducting an inspection of the Premises. \r\nWhen General Star discovered that the Premises was not in fact\r\nsprinklered in violation of the policy, and contrary to the\r\nrepresentation of the Duffys, it took timely action to rescind the\r\npolicy.  The district court was correct in granting summary\r\njudgment for General Star and in dismissing the Duffys'\r\ncounterclaims.\r\nAffirmed. \n",

After the Premises sustained over $100,000 in fire damage in July 1995, the Duffys' insurer rescinded the policy based on misrepresentations in the Duffys' application for insurance about the presence of sprinklers on the Premises. The insurer thereafter filed suit in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment validating its rescission. The district court obliged, ruling that the insurer was justified in relying on the misrepresentation by the Duffys in their application for insurance that the Premises was protected by sprinklers, despite an earlier report in the insurer's file indicating the absence of sprinklers. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1994, the Virzi Insurance Agency, Inc. (Virzi), on behalf of the Duffys, requested a quote from E.A. Kelly for the cost of insuring the Premises. E. A. Kelly has authority to issue policies on behalf of General Star Indemnity Company (General Star). In order to facilitate the process, Virzi, on behalf of the Duffys, forwarded an unsigned application to E.A. Kelly. That application indicated that: (a) all building improvements had been updated within the last five years; and (b) the Premises was sprinklered. The notation that the Premises was sprinklered was handwritten.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having received a quote from E. A. Kelly on June 3, 1994, Virzi, on behalf of the Duffys, submitted a signed application for insurance on June 9, 1994. E. A. Kelly issued an insurance policy for the Premises effective June 9, 1994. The policy contained an endorsement for \"Protective Safeguards\" which required smoke alarms, an ansul [fire protection] system and an automatic sprinkler system. On June 18, 1994, E. A. Kelly, on behalf of General Star, ordered an inspection of the Premises for the purpose of verifying its condition. On July 25, 1994, E. A. Kelly received the inspection report. The inspection form included a list of safety systems and devices, some of which had check marks next to them and some of which had no markings. The inspector's report contained a hyphen after the word \"sprinkler\"; the district court assumed for the purpose of its summary judgment ruling that the report indicated that the Premises was not sprinklered at the time of the inspection. Neither E. A. Kelly nor General Star further investigated whether or not the Premises had an automatic sprinkler system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1995, the Duffys requested a renewal quote from E. A. Kelly. In response, E. A. Kelly offered to renew the insurance for the Premises. The policy proposed stated that \"SMOKE ALARMS, SPRINKLER SYSTEM AND ANSUL SYSTEM WARRANTED.\" On or about June 9, 1995, Virzi, on behalf of the Duffys, provided E. A. Kelly with a renewal application signed by Virzi and James Duffy. The signed renewal application warranted that the Premises was sprinklered. When E. A. Kelly renewed the insurance policy for the period of June 9, 1995 through June 9, 1996, it contained an endorsement for \"Protective Safeguards\" which required smoke alarms, an ansul system and an automatic sprinkler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 1995, the Premises sustained fire damage in the amount of $105,713.27. On August 7, 1996, General Star forwarded correspondence to the Duffys denying coverage and rescinding the policy based on the misrepresentation in the 1995 application that the Premises was sprinklered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">General Star thereafter filed a complaint for declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2201 &amp; 2202, seeking a judicial determination that General Star had a right to rescind the insurance policy based on the misrepresentation. In response, the Duffys filed counterclaims alleging violations of Massachusetts insurance and consumer protection laws. The district court granted General Star a summary judgment, concluding that under Massachusetts law General Star had a right to rescind the policy because the Duffys' misrepresentation that the Premises was sprinklered was material in that it increased the risk of loss to General Star as a matter of law. The district court further held that Massachusetts law imposed \"no requirement to have the Premises inspected prior to issuing a renewal policy\" and that \"General Star was justified in relying on Mr. Duffy's representation that the Premises was sprinklered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is warranted only where an examination of the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, reveals no material factual disputes and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 186. For purposes of this appeal, the Duffys do not challenge the district court's findings that (1) the Duffys unintentionally made misrepresentations in their 1995 insurance application to General Star and (2) the misrepresentation regarding the existence of an automatic sprinkler system increased the insurer's risk of loss as a matter of law. The single issue pressed by the Duffys is whether General Star waived its right to rescind the insurance contract on the basis of that misrepresentation. The Duffys argue that, at the time General Star renewed the Duffys' policy in June 1995, General Star knew that the Premises was in fact not sprinklered because of the inspection report it received in June 1994. Having renewed the policy with knowledge that the Premises was not sprinklered, the Duffys argue, General Star waived its right to rescind on the basis of a misrepresentation about the presence of sprinklers (or so a jury, drawing inferences favorable to the Duffys, could have found).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Duffys err in their insistence that General Star had knowledge in June 1995 that there were no sprinklers on the Premises because of the inclusion in its files of the June 1994 inspection report. That position wrongly accords no legal significance to the warranty made by the Duffys in their application for renewed insurance in June 1995 that there were sprinklers on the Premises. To the extent that the Duffys argue that the inclusion of the 1994 inspection report in the files of General Star at least creates a factual issue about whether the insurer should have inspected the premises to determine the accuracy of the representation by the Duffys about the presence of sprinklers, the Duffys again misapprehend the legal significance of their representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Massachusetts law and insurance law generally, General Star had a right to rely on the Duffys' representation that the Premises was sprinklered in June 1995. See Appleman &amp; Appleman, 16B Insurance Law and Practice &#167; 9086 (2d ed. 1967) (\"[A]n insurer is entitled to rely on the representations of an insured without checking all of its files to determine if such insured is guilty of fraud.\"). The Duffys were in the best position to know the truthfulness of their statement about the sprinklers, and Massachusetts law does not impose an affirmative obligation on an insurer to investigate and verify the accuracy of an insured's representations.
