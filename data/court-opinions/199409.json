Plaintiff Claire A. Straughn\n\nurges us to vacate several summary judgment rulings which ultimately\n\nprompted the district court to dismiss her claims against Delta\n\nAirlines, Inc., alleging gender discrimination under Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2001, et seq., race\n\ndiscrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and breach of contract, wrongful\n\ntermination, and defamation under New Hampshire law. Lastly, she seeks\n\nto set aside the summary judgment entered against her on Delta’s\n\ncounterclaim for reimbursement of certain workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits inadvertently disbursed to her in the first instance. We\n\naffirm the district court judgment in all respects.\n\n                                  I\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          Straughn began her employment with Delta in October 1983, as\n\na reservations agent.       In January 1995, she became a sales\n\nrepresentative in its Boston Marketing Office, responsible for an area\n\nwhich includes Vermont and Western New Hampshire. She was one of five\n\nwomen, as well as the only African American, among the fourteen sales\n\nrepresentatives in the Boston Marketing Office.         Her immediate\n\nsupervisor was Zone Manager Helen Meinhold, who reported directly to\n\nLou Giglio, District Marketing Manager.\n\n          On January 19, 1996, while on a sales call for Delta,\n\nStraughn fell and broke her wrist, which disabled her from work for\n\n\n                                  3\n\fmost of the ensuing period through March of 1997.        Although she\n\nreturned to work during this period, on each occasion she was unable to\n\ncontinue for more than a few days.\n\n          Under the applicable Delta employment policy, employees\n\ninjured on the job were entitled to thirteen weeks’ accident leave, as\n\nwell as accumulated sick leave, vacation time and full salary.\n\nNevertheless, these employees were obligated to reimburse Delta for all\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits received while absent on accident leave,\n\npursuant to the following Delta policy statement:\n\n\n          Personnel who receive weekly benefits for\n          occupational injury or illness under the\n          provisions of applicable Worker's (sic)\n          Compensation laws must reimburse the Company\n          in an amount equal to the sum of all such\n          weekly benefits received for the period\n          during which the Company pays the employee's\n          wages, in whole or in part, under accident\n          leave, sick leave, and disability benefit\n          policies.\n\n\n          ESIS, the third-party administrator of Delta’s self-insured\n\nworkers’ compensation plan, makes an independent determination as to\n\nwhether an employee is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits,\n\nbased on the controlling workers' compensation laws and the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the work-related injury. ESIS disburses\n\nworkers' compensation benefits directly to the eligible Delta\n\nemployee, notwithstanding the fact that the employee continues\n\n\n\n                                  4\n\fto receive full salary from Delta pursuant to its accident leave\n\npolicy.   While the pertinent policy statement, supra, obligates\n\nan employee absent on accident leave to reimburse Delta for all\n\nworkers' compensation benefits received from ESIS while on full\n\nsalary, once an employee's accident leave, accumulated sick\n\nleave and vacation time have been exhausted the employee is\n\nremoved from the Delta payroll and thereafter retains whatever\n\nworkers' compensation benefits are received from ESIS.\n\n           Thus, Straughn received three forms of remuneration\n\nwhile on accident leave.           First, during the fourteen-month\n\nperiod she was unable to work, she received her regular Delta\n\nsalary.    Second, from January 25 through July 4, 1996, she\n\nreceived $11,608.86 in workers’ compensation benefits through\n\nESIS.     Third,    she    received   periodic   checks    from     ESIS    as\n\nreimbursement      for   medical   expenses   directly    related    to    her\n\ninjury, including medical bills, prescription costs, and travel\n\nexpenses to and from medical appointments.1         Notwithstanding her\n\nobligation to remit the $11,608.86 in workers’ compensation\n\n\n    1 Although the parties have not addressed the matter, these\nreimbursements appear to have been made in accordance with Mass.\nGen. Laws ch. 152, §§ 30 & 45, which require insurers to furnish\ninjured employees with \"adequate and reasonable health care\nservices, and medicines if needed, together with the expenses\nnecessarily incidental to such services . . . ,\" see id. § 30,\nas well as reimbursement for \"reasonable travel expense\nincidental\" to physician examinations requested by the insurer\nor the insured, see id. § 45.\n\n                                      5\n\fbenefits       received       from   ESIS   during      her    absence    from     work,\n\nStraughn failed to do so.\n\n              Meanwhile, Delta inadvertently continued to disburse\n\nStraughn’s full salary from July 5, 1996, until her eventual\n\nreturn to work in March, 1997, even though her entitlement to\n\nfull       salary   had   expired     on    July   4,    1996,       pursuant    to   the\n\naccident       leave      policy.          Furthermore,        the     administrative\n\nemployees responsible for disbursing Straughn’s salary were\n\nneither       aware    that    she   had    received     and     retained       workers’\n\ncompensation benefits, along with her regular Delta salary, from\n\nJanuary 25 through July 4, 1996, nor that her Delta salary\n\ncontinued to be disbursed some nine months beyond the time she\n\nwas entitled to receive it.2               In March of 1997, upon discovering\n\nits error, Delta conducted a thorough review of all amounts\n\ndisbursed to Straughn since her injury.\n\n              Shortly after returning to work in April of 1997,\n\nStraughn was asked by Giglio, on two separate occasions, whether\n\nshe had received workers’ compensation benefits in addition to\n\n\n       2\n     The confusion appears to be explainable, at least in part,\nby the fact that during the time Straughn received workers’\ncompensation benefits through ESIS, she coordinated her receipt\nof the benefits solely with Catherine Ackles, an employee of\nESIS, and did not deal directly with any Delta employee.\nNonetheless, Delta acknowledges, as its error, the breakdown in\nits communications with ESIS.   Thus, Delta has not sought to\nimpose responsibility upon Straughn for the receipt of these\noverpayments in the first instance.\n\n                                            6\n\fher salary while absent on accident leave.3     On each occasion,\n\nStraughn   denied   receiving   workers’   compensation   benefits,\n\nexplaining instead that she had received money which she used\n\nfor meals and other expenses relating to her injury.4\n\n           At her deposition, however, Straughn recalled these\n\nconversations with Giglio as follows:\n\n           A.   [Giglio] said to me . . . \"By the way,\n                did   you  receive   any  money   from\n                compensation?\"\n\n           Q.   And what did you answer?\n\n           A.   I told him, no.      The money that\n                compensation gave me I used to order\n                out my meals, to help take care of\n                myself, because I was not able to do\n                anything. I had no support system . .\n                . .\n\n           Q.   Could you have said . . . \"No, they\n                gave me money for food, transportation\n                and expenses directly related to my\n                accident\"?\n\n    3Upon returning to work, Straughn was asked by Giglio to\nsign and backdate certain personnel forms relating to her\ninjury. Apparently, these forms were to have been completed at\nthe time of her injury, rather than when she returned to work.\nStraughn refused to do so.\n    4 Although neither party clearly defines the contours of\nESIS's obligation to reimburse Delta employees for certain\ninjury-related expenses, each has assumed that though travel\nexpenses and certain medical costs are reimbursable by ESIS,\nfood and other personal costs are not. Their assumptions appear\nto be based on the obligations imposed by Massachusetts law.\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, §§ 30, 45.     There is no record\nevidence that any Delta or ESIS policy required that Delta\nemployees be reimbursed for food and similar personal costs in\nthese circumstances.\n\n                                 7\n\f           A.   I could have said something like that.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n           After   Straughn    repeatedly    denied    having     received\n\nworkers’    compensation      benefits   —    an      assertion     flatly\n\ncontradicted by the business records maintained by both Delta\n\nand ESIS — Giglio relayed her responses to Michelle McColly,\n\nSenior Analyst in the Delta Personnel Department. 5                McColly\n\ninstructed Giglio to approach Straughn again and obtain her\n\nwritten response.    At the same time, Giglio was instructed to\n\nsuspend Straughn pending further investigation.\n\n\n    5Straughn contends on appeal that her responses to these\ninquiries were mixed and ambiguous, rather than direct denials.\nThus, she argues, Giglio should have sought clarification from\nher first, rather than simply reporting to his superiors that\nshe had denied receiving workers' compensation benefits. The\ndistrict court succinctly attended to that contention as\nfollows:\n\n           Straughn's seemingly odd (and ostensibly\n           ambiguous)   'no,   but   yes'   response  to\n           Giglio's inquiry about her receipt of\n           workers' compensation benefits makes perfect\n           sense   in   context    and  is,    in  fact,\n           unambiguous. She denied receiving workers'\n           compensation benefits from ESIS (which she\n           was obligated to sign over to Delta), but\n           acknowledged that ESIS had honored her\n           periodic requests for reimbursement of\n           medical, travel, and related expenses. That\n           response simply did not jibe with the\n           records maintained by Delta and its agent,\n           ESIS.\n\nDistrict Court Opinion, at 11.\n\n                                   8\n\f          Following    the   conversation   with   McColly,     Giglio\n\ninquired of Straughn in the presence of two Delta supervisors —\n\nHelen Meinhold and Tom Keating — regarding whether she had\n\nreceived workers’ compensation benefits while on accident leave.\n\nStraughn responded that she had not, stating once again that she\n\nhad simply received checks to compensate her for costs related\n\nto medical treatment, transportation, and meals.\n\n          Giglio thereupon suspended Straughn, as instructed, and\n\nrequested that she reduce her statement to writing.           Prior to\n\nproviding Giglio with her written response, however, Straughn\n\nconsulted with an attorney who had been representing her in a\n\nrelated tort action against the owner of the premises at which\n\nher injury occurred.\n\n          Helen Meinhold later recounted Straughn’s responses to\n\nGiglio’s inquiry as follows:\n\n          A.   [Giglio] asked [Straughn] whether she\n               had received any additional monies in\n               addition to her paycheck.\n\n          Q.   And what was her response?\n\n          A.   No;   that   she   only    had   gotten\n               reimbursement of some medical expenses.\n\n          Subsequently, Straughn recalled the interrogation by\n\nGiglio:\n\n          I was called into Lou [Giglio's] office and\n          asked  if   I  had   received   money  from\n\n\n                                 9\n\f            compensation to which I initially responded\n            no, but went on to explain to him as I had\n            in the past that I had received money from\n            compensation to help with my expenses such\n            as food, medicine, transportation, etc.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n            The written response Straughn thereafter submitted to\n\nGiglio explained as follows:\n\n            When I spoke to my attorney she advised me\n            [that] until she had an opportunity to look\n            into this[,] do not advise of comp money.\n            When I spoke to [Catherine Ackles] again she\n            reiterated [the] above info.       Also was\n            advised by attorney & [Catherine Ackles] all\n            will be settled. When Lou [Giglio] asked me\n            if I received comp, all I thought of was\n            attorney advise [sic].\n\n(Emphasis    added).      Thus,   the   written      response   provided    by\n\nStraughn admits that she intentionally misled Delta —                    albeit\n\nostensibly on the advice of counsel — regarding her receipt of\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits while continuing to receive full\n\nsalary from Delta.\n\n            Consequently, on May 8, 1997, Giglio recommended that\n\nStraughn be terminated from her employment due to dishonesty.\n\nFollowing further review, McColly recommended that Straughn be\n\nrequired    to   remit    the   $11,608.86      in   workers’   compensation\n\nbenefits     wrongfully    retained,      and    either   resign    or    face\n\ndischarge.\n\n            Thereafter, acting on these recommendations, Director\n\n\n                                     10\n\fof    Equal     Opportunity     Richard        Ealey    terminated        Straughn's\n\nemployment due to her dishonesty in responding to the repeated\n\ninquiries       regarding     her    receipt       of    workers’    compensation\n\nbenefits.         Director     Ealey,      himself      an    African     American,\n\nexplained that it was Straughn's dishonesty which distinguished\n\nher     conduct    from      that    of   other     employees       who    had    not\n\nspontaneously           reimbursed    Delta      after       receiving     workers’\n\ncompensation benefits in similar circumstances.\n\n              Straughn commenced an internal grievance procedure with\n\nthe Delta administrative appeals board.                      In due course, the\n\nboard, comprised of McColly and another member, recommended to\n\nDirector Ealey that Straughn be reinstated.                    The appeals board\n\nneither assigned reasons for its recommendation nor prescribed\n\nconditions for the reinstatement, except that Straughn reimburse\n\nDelta     for     all     workers’    compensation        benefits        wrongfully\n\nretained.\n\n              At that point Giglio offered Straughn employment as a\n\nSales Staff Assistant, a new position with no direct sales\n\nresponsibilities, at an annual salary of $39,696 rather than the\n\n$46,462 salary she formerly received.                   After Straughn accepted\n\nthe   offer,      Delta     placed   a    \"final    warning\"     letter      in   her\n\npersonnel file:          the most severe disciplinary action short of\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\foutright termination.6\n\n                Following her reinstatement, Straughn brought suit in\n\nthe   United      States    District    Court       for    the    District     of    New\n\nHampshire.        Delta answered and counterclaimed for the $11,608.86\n\nin workers’ compensation benefits retained by Straughn, then\n\nmoved     for    summary    judgment    on    all    claims,      as    well   as   its\n\ncounterclaim, contending that Straughn had been discharged for\n\na legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason:                    i.e., her persistent\n\nlack of candor in responding to legitimate inquiries regarding\n\nher wrongful retention of workers’ compensation benefits.\n\n                After   determining    that     Straughn         had   presented      no\n\ncompetent evidence that Delta had tendered a pretextual reason\n\nfor   terminating       her   employment,      the       district      court   granted\n\nsummary     judgment       against    Straughn      on    the     gender   and      race\n\n\n      6 The “final warning” letter stated, in relevant part:\n\n                Even if you did not intend to keep these\n                overpayments, your failure to monitor these\n                payments and to fully advise Delta of these\n                overpayments causes us great concern with\n                respect to your ability to be a reliable and\n                effective Sales Representative.      As you\n                know, that position entails great autonomy\n                and responsibility, including the handling\n                of company resources, and we do not believe\n                you should hold such a position at this time\n                considering the way you handled these\n                overpayments. Consequently, we have decided\n                to reinstate your employment as a Sales\n                Staff Assistant.\n\n\n                                        12\n\fdiscrimination claims, as well as all state-law claims.    At the\n\nsame time, the district court directed summary judgment for\n\nDelta on its counterclaim.\n\n                                 II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Title VII and Section 1981 Claims.\n\n     1.   The Standard of Review and Burden Shifting Framework.\n\n          Summary judgment rulings are reviewed     de novo, see\n\nMulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 672 (1st Cir.\n\n1996), after considering the record evidence \"in the light most\n\nfavorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,\n\nthe nonmoving party.\"   Feliciano De La Cruz v. El Conquistador\n\nResort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).         The\n\nsummary judgment ruling is to be upheld provided \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\n\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).    Moreover, \"[e]ven in employment discrimination cases\n\nwhere elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue,\n\nthis standard compels summary judgment if the non-moving party\n\nrests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences,\n\nand unsupported speculation.\"    Feliciano, 218 F.3d at 5 (quoting\n\n\n                                 13\n\fMedina-Munoz v.

At that point, Straughn’s \"burden of\n\nproducing evidence to rebut the stated reason for [Delta’s]\n\nemployment        action     merge[d]     with       the    ultimate       burden   of\n\npersuading the court that she [was] the victim of intentional\n\ndiscrimination.\"           Id.

Shuttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 431 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).        Finally, we must “exercise particular caution\n\nbefore [sustaining] summary judgment[s] for employers on such\n\nissues as pretext, motive, and intent.\"                    Santiago-Ramos, 217\n\nF.3d at 54 (citing Hodgens v.

The record does not bear\n\nout her contention.\n\n            It is undisputed that Director of Equal Opportunity\n\nRichard Ealey, after reviewing the dismissal recommendations by\n\nMichelle McColly and Giglio, ultimately was responsible for\n\nterminating Straughn's employment.                  Yet there is no record\n\nevidence, nor has Straughn contended, that either Ealey or\n\nMcColly harbored any race-or-gender-based animus.                           Instead,\n\nStraughn maintains that Giglio, her intermediate supervisor, was\n\nin a position to influence Ealey, the ultimate decisionmaker;\n\nthus, she argues, Giglio indirectly brought about her wrongful\n\ntermination       for     discriminatory        reasons     by     presenting    the\n\nultimate decisionmaker with a pretextual justification.\n\n            Straughn         contends      in     particular         that     Giglio\n\nintentionally inquired in an ambiguous manner regarding her\n\nreceipt of workers’ compensation benefits, then mischaracterized\n\nher   responses,        as   categorical     rather     than     qualified,     when\n\nreporting    to    Ealey     and   McColly.       She     claims    that    Giglio's\n\ndiscriminatory          intentions   are     evidenced       (i)    by     workplace\n\nutterances reflecting bias against African Americans and (ii) by\n\n\n                                        18\n\frelatively undesirable work assignments, unfair criticisms, and\n\nthe withholding of various perquisites and incentives available\n\nto other Delta sales representatives.\n\n            Straughn also claims that the decision to rehire her,\n\nfollowing    her     internal         appeal,         demonstrates     that      Delta\n\nmanagement ultimately realized that Giglio's rendition of her\n\nresponses had been contrived, whereas her actual responses were\n\naccurate.        Similarly,     she    insists        that   Giglio   unilaterally\n\ndemoted her to a position entailing reduced responsibilities and\n\nsalary   even     though   Delta      had   recommended        her    unconditional\n\nreinstatement.       Finally, Straughn argues that the discipline\n\ninitially imposed upon her — outright discharge — differed\n\nmaterially from that meted out to another Delta employee who had\n\nmade similar statements to Giglio in the past.                  We discuss these\n\ncontentions in turn.\n\n            a.     The Allegedly Discriminatory Utterances\n                   and Related Workplace Mistreatment\n\n\n            In    order    to   sustain         her   burden   of    persuasion     on\n\npretext,    Straughn       needed     to        demonstrate    either     that     her\n\ndismissal was (i) \"more likely motivated” by discrimination than\n\nby the explanation proffered by Delta, or (ii) the proffered\n\n“explanation [was] unworthy of credence\" in circumstances where\n\nthe suspect denial, taken together with other facts, suggests\n\n\n                                           19\n\fsuch a motivation.

The   burden    of\n\npersuasion on pretext may be met, inter alia, by showing “that\n\ndiscriminatory comments were made by the key decisionmaker or\n\nthose in a position to influence the decisionmaker.\"                     Santiago-\n\nRamos,    217     F.3d   at   55    (discriminatory       comments       by    direct\n\nsupervisor, along with similar comments by key decisionmaker,\n\nconstitute      evidence      of   pretext    where    direct      supervisor     was\n\nconsulted    by    key   supervisor        during     decisionmaking      process)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            (i)    The “Southern Black” Accent\n\n            Straughn testified on deposition that Giglio frequently\n\nused an offensive \"southern black\" accent at meetings attended\n\nby her and other Delta employees.                Although Giglio denies the\n\ncharge, it must be credited at summary judgment.                              See id.\n\n(citing DeNovellis v.          Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 308 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).\n\n            For present purposes, we assume arguendo that there are\n\ncircumstances in which use of an offensive “southern black”\n\nworkplace accent, by a superior in a position to influence the\n\nkey decisionmaker, would constitute probative evidence that the\n\nproffered       explanation        for   disciplining         an    employee      was\n\n\n                                         20\n\fpretextual.

See, e.g., Santiago-Ramos, 217 F.3d at 55 (remarks\n\nwithin two weeks of discharge probative of pretext); Fernandes,\n\n199 F.3d at 583 (remarks at time of employment action probative\n\nof   pretext);      cf.

Compare McMillan, 140\n\nF.3d at 301 (workplace remarks by male department head at time\n\nremote from incident in dispute — regarding physical traits and\n\nsexual activities of female co-workers, but bearing no direct\n\nrelationship to employment — held not probative of pretext where\n\nchallenged    decision        involved      lower    salaries     for    female\n\nemployees),    with    Fernandes,      199    F.3d   at   583    (comments   by\n\ndecisionmaker — including \"I don't need minorities”; “I don't\n\nneed residents on this job”; \"I don't have to hire you locals or\n\nCape Verdean people” — were not mere \"stray remarks\" where\n\nchallenged employment action concerned refusal to rehire dark-\n\nskinned residents of Cape Verdean descent).               Accordingly, even\n\nif we were to assume that the assertedly offensive workplace\n\n“accent” is somehow suggestive of racial bias,7 it would not be\n\nsignificantly   probative       of    pretext   absent    some    discernible\n\nindication that its communicative content, if any, materially\n\n\n    7As concerns the gender-based discrimination claim, however,\nwe can discern no relevance whatsoever in the “southern black”\naccent evidence.\n\n                                       22\n\ferodes    the   stated     rationale    for   the   challenged       employment\n\naction.\n\n           Straughn proffered no evidence that Giglio ever used\n\nthe nondescript “southern black” accent              either during or in\n\nrelation to the challenged employment action.                   Nor is there\n\ncompetent evidence from which a rational factfinder might fairly\n\ninfer that the communicative import of the nondescript accent\n\npertained to employment matters, let alone to Straughn or her\n\nemployment.     Indeed, Straughn herself has never intimated either\n\na   rationale     or   a   circumstantial       predicate     for    reasonably\n\ninferring that the “southern black” accent amounted to anything\n\nother than insensitive banter.              Thus, Straughn’s naked         ipse\n\ndixit was insufficient to generate a genuine issue of material\n\nfact.\n\n           Accordingly, we conclude that the “southern black”\n\naccent allegedly used on occasion by Giglio, without more, is\n\nnot probative of pretext on the part of Delta, given (i) the\n\nabsence of any discernible contextual or temporal relationship\n\nbetween the discharge decision and the workplace accent used by\n\nGiglio, (ii) the demonstrably self-sufficient basis for the\n\nmanagement recommendation by Richard Ealey to discharge Straughn\n\ndue to her persistent work-related dishonesty, and (iii) the\n\ndistinctly      subordinate    role    Giglio   played   in    the    dismissal\n\n\n                                       23\n\fdecision.\n\n              (ii)           The Disparate Workplace Treatment\n\n              Straughn        claims    that     Giglio    singled        her   out     for\n\ninferior work assignments, unfairly criticized her performance,\n\nand    withheld       various       perquisites      and    inducements         accorded\n\nsimilarly situated sales representatives.                        The district court\n\ndetermined that the evidence Straughn tendered to demonstrate\n\npretext was insufficient in light of the countervailing evidence\n\nthat       Delta     management        reasonably     believed          that    Straughn\n\nrepeatedly lied to her superiors regarding her receipt and\n\nwrongful         retention     of   workers'      compensation          benefits    while\n\nabsent      on     accident    leave     and     receiving       full    salary.        See\n\nDistrict Court Opinion, at 24. 8                   After evaluating Straughn’s\n\ndifferential         treatment      claim      against     the    “totality        of   the\n\nevidence . . .

The record discloses that the Vermont and Western\n\nNew Hampshire sales territory, to which Straughn initially was\n\nassigned, historically has generated lower revenues than all but\n\none other sales territory within the Boston Marketing Office\n\narea and accordingly has been selected in the past as a training\n\nterritory for relatively inexperienced sales representatives.\n\n            Nor did Straughn tender evidence that there was any\n\nnormal time frame within which sales representatives in training\n\ncustomarily     were     transferred       to    more    lucrative    sales\n\nterritories.    Similarly, she proffered no evidence regarding any\n\ncriteria utilized by Delta in determining when newer sales\n\nrepresentatives were considered eligible for transfer to more\n\ndesirable sales territories.\n\n            On the other hand, the record plainly discloses that\n\na   white    male    sales   representative      drew   the   Maine   sales\n\nterritory,    which    is    comparable    to   the   Vermont-Western   New\n\nHampshire sales territory in terms of the driving distances and\n\n\n                                     25\n\frelatively    low   sales    revenues.

Finally, there is no record evidence that\n\nStraughn’s experience or tenure differed in any material respect\n\nfrom   that   of    her    predecessors      in   the   Vermont-Western       New\n\nHampshire sales territory.\n\n          Since Straughn tendered no competent evidence that her\n\ninitial assignment as a sales representative differed materially\n\nfrom that of other relatively new sales representatives in the\n\nBoston Marketing Office, summary judgment was appropriate.                    See\n\nid.; Conward, 171 F.3d at 20 (“Where . . . the plaintiff in a\n\ndisparate treatment race [or gender] discrimination case offers\n\ncomparative evidence . . . to raise an inference of racial [or\n\ngender-based] discrimination, [she] must provide a suitable\n\nprovenance for the evidence by showing that others similarly\n\nsituated . . . in all relevant respects were treated differently\n\nby the employer.”) (emphasis added).\n\n          (iii)      Miscellaneous Evidence of Pretext\n\n          Similarly,        Straughn        tendered    insufficient        other\n\nevidence to generate a trialworthy issue on pretext.                   Instead,\n\nshe simply pointed to evidence that Giglio reprimanded her for\n\ntardiness,    driving      excessive   miles,       visiting    too   few   sales\n\naccounts, and failing to generate adequate “shuttle” flight\n\n\n                                       26\n\fticket   sales.        She      maintains     that   these   criticisms      were\n\nunjustified,       given   the    undisputed     evidence    that     (i)   sales\n\nrepresentatives in the Boston Marketing Office were not required\n\nto   report   to    work   at    any   particular    hour;   (ii)     her   sales\n\nterritory necessitated more driving, as it is one of the two\n\nlargest in geographic area; and (iii) it normally generates\n\nfewer “shuttle” ticket sales.\n\n            Straughn relies almost exclusively upon the                     Thomas\n\ncase, which held that where poor work performance is the stated\n\nreason for discharging an employee, pretext may be established\n\nby demonstrating that the evaluation process itself was tainted\n\nby   racial    bias    and      that   the    plaintiff’s     \"abilities      and\n\nqualifications were equal or superior to employees who were\n\nretained.\"     Thomas, 183 F.3d at 65 (quoting Goldman v. First\n\nNat'l Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1119 (1st Cir. 1993))\n\n(internal     quotation      marks     omitted).       The   Thomas    case     is\n\ninapposite.\n\n            There is no record evidence that Straughn’s discharge\n\nwas related in any way to work performance.                  For that matter,\n\nthere is no evidence that Straughn ever received a “poor” work\n\nevaluation.     See id. at 62-63.            On the contrary, following the\n\nonly documented review of her work performance with the Boston\n\nMarketing Office, Straughn received a “high” rating from none\n\n\n                                        27\n\fother than Giglio and Meinhold.                     Consequently, the present\n\ncontention provides no support for the claim that Straughn was\n\nsubjected      to       \"differential       treatment       in     the     workplace.”\n\nFernandes, 199 F.3d at 581.\n\n             Straughn         also    testified      that      various     privileges\n\navailable to other sales representatives were withheld from her,\n\nincluding authorization to:                  (a) provide clients with free\n\npromotional flight tickets, (b) obtain reimbursement for meals\n\nwhile entertaining clients, and (c) work on a part-time basis\n\nfrom a “virtual” home office.                     Nevertheless, she failed to\n\nproffer      competent        evidence     that   she    and     these   other    sales\n\nrepresentatives were “similarly situated” in all or even most\n\nrelevant respects.            See Conward, 171 F.3d at 20.\n\n             (a)    Free Promotional Flight Tickets\n\n             Straughn asserts, in conclusory fashion, that all sales\n\nrepresentatives          in     her   office      were    permitted,        at    their\n\ndiscretion,        to    give      promotional      flight       tickets    to    their\n\nrespective clients, whereas she \"rarely\" was allowed to do so.\n\nShe makes no attempt to approximate the number of occasions on\n\nwhich promotional flight tickets were made available to her or\n\nto other Delta sales representatives.                    Instead, she focuses on\n\na   single    instance        in   which   Helen    Meinhold       directed      her   to\n\nrecover a promotional flight ticket which Straughn had made\n\n\n                                            28\n\favailable to the spouse of a client.            It is undisputed that\n\nDelta policy contemplates that these promotional flight tickets\n\nare to be made available to Delta clients, not their spouses.\n\nThe   record   also   indicates   that   the   episode   referred   to   by\n\nStraughn occurred during the first six months of her tenure as\n\na sales representative.       Yet Straughn presented no competent\n\nevidence that she and these other sales representatives were\n\nsimilarly situated, either in regard to tenure, experience, or\n\nthe numbers of clients served.\n\n           (b)   Client Entertainment\n\n           Straughn asserts that some sales representatives were\n\nreimbursed for meal costs incurred while entertaining Delta\n\nclients.   The one person she names — Jane Martin — began work\n\nwith the Boston Marketing Office two weeks before Straughn.\n\nOther than similar starting dates, however, Straughn tendered no\n\nevidence that she and Martin were “similarly situated,” most\n\nnotably in regard to the particular characteristics of their\n\nrespective sales territories and clienteles. Moreover, Straughn\n\nadmitted that she was never denied reimbursement.           Instead, she\n\nstates that she was reprimanded by Meinhold on one occasion for\n\npurchasing donuts for the personnel in a “couple of offices” and\n\nwarned not to do so again.        See also note 8 supra.\n\n           (c)   The “Virtual Home Office” Privilege\n\n\n                                    29\n\f           Straughn testified that all other sales representatives\n\nin the Boston Marketing Office were granted the “virtual home\n\noffice” privilege.     See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 824 (noting that\n\nevidence of “differential treatment in the workplace” supports\n\npretext claim).   Yet Straughn points to no evidence that she and\n\nthese other sales representatives were similarly situated.\n\n           Competent   proof     that   the   plaintiff   was   denied\n\nprivileges and opportunities available to similarly situated\n\nemployees may constitute probative evidence that an adverse\n\nemployment action was motivated by discriminatory animus.          See\n\nThomas, 183 F.3d at 63 (evidence that supervisors prevented\n\nminority   employee    from    making   important   presentation   and\n\nwithheld \"appropriate developmental opportunities\" and computer\n\ntraining, all of which were accorded non-minority employees,\n\nsupports disparate treatment claim).          Straughn testified on\n\ndeposition that she made at least three requests to work from a\n\nvirtual home office.     The record also reflects that some sales\n\nrepresentatives were permitted to work from a “virtual” home\n\noffice.    Yet Richard Ealey denied Straughn permission to do so\n\nfollowing her extended absence from work, since her doctor had\n\nadvised that, though able to work, Straughn was not yet well\n\nenough to drive an automobile — hence unable to service clients,\n\nthe primary responsibility of her position.\n\n\n                                   30\n\f         As concerns Straughn’s previous requests to work from\n\na “virtual” home office, one was denied by Meinhold and several\n\nby Giglio.   The record reflects that her first request to Giglio\n\nwas made within six months of her hiring.   Straughn presented no\n\nevidence that other new sales representatives were accorded the\n\nprivilege so early in their tenure.    With regard to the other\n\nrequests which Giglio denied, she points to no evidence (i) that\n\nshe was “similarly situated” to any sales representative who was\n\naccorded the privilege, or (ii) that she met Delta’s criteria\n\nfor evaluating such requests.    Instead, she simply asserts in\n\nconclusory fashion that everyone else was permitted to work\n\npart-time from a “virtual” home office.     Thus, she failed to\n\npresent competent evidence that the proffered reason for the\n\nchallenged employment action was pretextual.   See Fernandes, 199\n\nF.2d at 581; Conward, 171 F.3d at 20; Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 824.\n\n         Moreover, given the overwhelming weight of the evidence\n\nthat the proffered reason for the dismissal action was both\n\nsound and sufficient, the tenuous disparate treatment evidence\n\npresented by Straughn was plainly insufficient to enable a\n\nreasonable factfinder to conclude that Giglio had fabricated the\n\nreport about Straughn’s prevarications relating to her wrongful\n\nretention of the workers’ compensation benefits.9   Nothing more\n\n    9The other instances Straughn cites in relation to her\ndisparate treatment claim lack adequate evidentiary support as\n\n                                31\n\fis exigible.\n\n          b.        The    Alleged     Distortions of Straughn’s\n          Responses\n\n          Straughn likewise failed to generate a trialworthy\n\nissue in relation to her claim that Giglio mischaracterized her\n\nresponses to his inquiries regarding her receipt and retention\n\nof   workers’   compensation   benefits.   As   the   district   court\n\nappropriately noted, Straughn's deposition testimony, affidavit,\n\nand written statement abundantly demonstrate her utter lack of\n\ncandor in responding to these legitimate inquiries.\n\n          Upon initial inquiry by Giglio, as to whether she had\n\nreceived \"any money from compensation,\" Straughn responded in\n\nthe negative, then added that she had received money \"to order\n\nout my meals [and] to help take care of myself . . . .\"          On the\n\nsecond occasion, in the presence of two other supervisors,\n\nStraughn again denied receiving workers’ compensation benefits,\n\n\nwell.   With regard to the authority to provide clients with\npromotional flight tickets, she points to no evidence that\nGiglio was involved in any way.      Instead, Straughn herself\ntestified on deposition that it was Meinhold who restricted her\nauthority in this regard.\n     Straughn acknowledged that some, but not all, Delta sales\nrepresentatives   were  reimbursed   for   client  meal   costs.\nFurthermore, she neither presented evidence that she was not\nreimbursed, nor that she was similarly situated to those\nemployees who were regularly reimbursed. Thus, she failed to\ngenerate a rational inference that any race-or-gender based bias\nharbored by    Giglio accounted in any way for the alleged\nrejections of her requests for reimbursement. See Conward, 171\nF.3d at 20.\n\n                                  32\n\fwhile allowing that she had received reimbursements for certain\n\nexpenses.      These responses were not only materially false, but\n\nknowingly made, in that Straughn was well aware that she had\n\nreceived and retained workers’ compensation benefits meant to\n\ncompensate her for lost salary, while continuing to receive full\n\nsalary from Delta.\n\n              Straughn    also     received       other    checks      from     ESIS,\n\nrepresenting reimbursements for various expenses incurred in\n\nconnection      with     her   job-related        injury,       such   as     medical\n\nservices, prescription drugs, and travel expenses incurred in\n\nconnection with medical appointments.                  Although food was not an\n\nexpense reimbursed by ESIS, it was among those Straughn listed\n\nwhen Giglio asked whether she had received money for \"expenses.\"\n\nCuriously, Straughn now attempts to characterize her response to\n\nGiglio   as    an   admission      that    she    had    indeed    received      both\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits and reimbursements for expenses\n\nfrom ESIS.      She reasons that since she listed food — an expense\n\nnot eligible for reimbursement from ESIS — her direct response\n\nto Giglio that she had             never received workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits      somehow    acknowledged      that    she    had    indeed     received\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits.\n\n              She also attempts to rationalize her negative response\n\nto   Giglio    as   simply     a   reference     “to    the   promised      workers’\n\n\n                                          33\n\fcompensation settlement, not weekly benefits . . . .”         Since she\n\nhas not elaborated, we are left to speculate about the precise\n\ndetails.\n\n            Thus, essentially Straughn sought — indeed still seeks\n\n— to rationalize the obvious inaccuracies in her response to\n\nGiglio, which she attributes to inartful language, as including\n\nan accurate response to a question she was never asked.                In\n\ncontrast, Giglio and Delta management rationally assessed her\n\npersistent refusals to acknowledge her receipt and wrongful\n\nretention    of   workers’   compensation   benefits   as   attempts   to\n\nconceal the truth.\n\n            Undeterred, Straughn continues to defend her responses\n\nas technically accurate in the sense that she did tell Giglio\n\nthat she had received food money, which could only have derived\n\nfrom workers’ compensation benefits since food is not an expense\n\nrelated to medical treatment.      This artful contention is belied\n\nas well, however, by her own written submission following her\n\nsuspension by Delta:\n\n            When I spoke to my attorney[,] she advised\n            me . . . do not advise of comp money. . . .\n            When [Giglio] asked me if I received comp,\n            all I thought of was attorney advise [sic].\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n            Thus, Straughn admitted to an attempt to conceal the\n\nfact that she had received workers’ compensation benefits while\n\n                                   34\n\fon accident leave from her employment with Delta, albeit on the\n\nadvice of counsel.        At a minimum, then, the summary judgment\n\nrecord     unambiguously     established     that    Straughn     plainly\n\nunderstood that she had received workers’ compensation benefits\n\nwhile on full salary, yet set out to conceal that fact from\n\nDelta.\n\n           No less importantly, at this point in the burden-\n\nshifting analysis the principal focus must be upon whether\n\nMcColly    and   Ealey,    the   responsible     Delta   decisionmakers,\n\nreasonably believed that Straughn lied, rather than whether she\n\nactually lied.    \"In assessing pretext, [our] 'focus must be on\n\nthe perception of the decisionmaker,' that is, whether the\n\nemployer believed its stated reason to be credible.\"          Goldman v.\n\nFirst Nat’l Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1118 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 824; Gray v. New England Tel. &\n\nTel. Co., 792 F.2d 251, 256 (1st Cir. 1986)).            As Straughn has\n\nnever claimed that either McColly or Ealey harbored a gender-\n\nbased or race-based bias, but rather that they were misled by\n\nGiglio's allegedly wrongful recommendation that her employment\n\nbe terminated, in these particular circumstances it is the\n\nreasonableness of Giglio's belief alone which is controlling.\n\n           The record plainly demonstrates that Giglio reasonably\n\nregarded   Straughn’s     responses   to   his   inquiries   as   wrongful\n\n\n                                    35\n\fattempts to conceal what he well knew to be so, based on Delta’s\n\nbusiness   records;      viz.,    that    Straughn   had    received    and\n\nwrongfully retained workers’ compensation benefits from ESIS,\n\nwhile continuing to receive her full Delta salary on accident\n\nleave.     Giglio   accordingly       recommended    that    Straughn   be\n\ndischarged,   due   to   her     persistent   dishonesty,    pursuant   to\n\nlongstanding Delta policy.\n\n           In these circumstances, no rational trier of fact could\n\nconclude that Giglio did not reasonably believe that Straughn\n\nhad responded dishonestly when repeatedly confronted with the\n\ndocumented fact that she had received workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits, as well as full salary, while on accident leave.\n\nThus, Straughn utterly failed to generate a trialworthy issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether Giglio reasonably believed that she\n\nhad attempted to mislead him regarding her receipt and retention\n\nof the workers’ compensation benefits to which she was not\n\nentitled.10   A fortiori, she failed to generate a trialworthy\n\n     10\n      Nevertheless, Straughn now insists that Giglio \"set [her]\nup and then reported her,\" by asking whether she had received\nworkers’ compensation benefits, rather than simply telling her\nthat he knew she had, then presenting her with various repayment\noptions. We can discern no animus in these attempts to verify,\nfirsthand with Straughn, the documented information that Giglio\nhad received.   As the district court appropriately noted, in\nthese circumstances Straughn cannot —\n\n           legitimately complain that Giglio knew the\n           answer to the question about her receipt of\n           workers' compensation benefits before he\n\n                                     36\n\fissue   as    to    whether     McColly       and    Ealey    reasonably      accepted\n\nGiglio’s version of the relevant events.\n\n              c.

For\n\npresent purposes, we shall assume, without deciding, that there\n\nmay    be    circumstances        in    which       the    decision    to    rehire    a\n\ndischarged employee constitutes competent evidence of pretext,\n\nat    least     insofar    as    the     rehiring         plainly    undermined      the\n\nproffered       justification          for   the     original       discharge.       Cf.\n\nNitschke v.

Even so, the summary judgment record came\n\nup well short of the required evidentiary support for Straughn’s\n\n              asked it.   Put simply, an employer has a\n              legitimate   right  to   expect   that  its\n              employees will respond in a truthful, non-\n              evasive manner to its questions . . . .\n\nDistrict Court Opinion, at 26, n. 6.\n\n                                             37\n\fcontention    that    the   decision    to    rehire   her   in    a    different\n\ncapacity reflected an abandonment of Delta’s original position\n\nthat she had misled Giglio in the first instance.\n\n            Straughn insists that the decision to rehire her, after\n\nher internal appeal, indicates that upon considering her version\n\nof   the   encounter    with   Giglio,       Delta   management        must   have\n\nrealized that Giglio had misled McColly and Ealey regarding\n\nStraughn's responses to Giglio’s inquiries.              McColly, one of the\n\ntwo Delta supervisors who participated in the internal appeal,\n\nexplained       the    rationale       for      recommending           Straughn’s\n\nreinstatement as follows:\n\n            [D]espite the fact that I . . .     believed\n            that [Straughn] had still done something\n            wrong, and furthermore that she knew she had\n            done something wrong, I did believe, after\n            meeting   with  her,   that   there  was   a\n            considerable amount of confusion in the\n            administration of the workers’ compensation,\n            or that it could have been handled better.\n            And Ms. Straughn did have a good record, and\n            several years with the company, so we\n            decided that we should recommend . . .\n            another chance.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n            Asked to clarify what she meant by \"confusion,\" McColly\n\nstated that she had neither concluded that Straughn was confused\n\nby   Giglio's    questions,    nor   that     Straughn    had     retained    the\n\nworkers’ compensation payments unwittingly.                  Instead, McColly\n\nexplained: \"I still believe that Ms. Straughn very likely knew\n\n                                       38\n\fthat she had not been entitled to the payments,” emphasizing\n\nthat the appeals process had in no sense caused her to \"question\n\nthe story that Lou Giglio had been telling . . . [and] that\n\nultimately led to [Straughn's] termination.\"\n\n            Plainly, then, the recommendation to rehire Straughn\n\nwas made notwithstanding McColly’s earnest belief that it was\n\nvery likely that Straughn knowingly had done “something wrong.”\n\nFurthermore,        McColly    stated           that     though      the    workers’\n\ncompensation      disbursements        should          have   been   managed      more\n\nefficiently and that some actual confusion had indeed resulted,\n\nDelta nonetheless had been justified in discharging Straughn due\n\nto her repeated attempts to mislead.\n\n            Thus,    there    is      no    evidentiary         support     for    the\n\ncontention that the appeals board hearing prompted McColly to\n\nconclude    either     that   Giglio        had    misrepresented          Straughn's\n\nresponses    or   that     Straughn    had      been     wrongfully    discharged.\n\nInstead, the record is clear that McColly recommended a \"second\n\nchance\"     based     on    Straughn’s          overall       employment      record,\n\nnotwithstanding ample grounds for the dismissal.                      Accordingly,\n\nnot only does the decision to rehire Straughn provide no support\n\nfor the claim that the proffered reason for discharging her was\n\n“unworthy of credence,” Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256, it strongly\n\nevidences an absence of any forbidden animus on the part of\n\n\n                                           39\n\fDelta.\n\n            Next,       we   turn     to   the    contention       that     Straughn’s\n\ndemotion    to     a    position      entailing       reduced     compensation       and\n\nresponsibilities,              notwithstanding              the         unconditional\n\nreinstatement recommended by Delta management, demonstrates that\n\nGiglio    harbored         discriminatory        motives    in     recommending      her\n\ndischarge in the first instance.                      The record reflects that\n\nMcColly     transmitted         a     memorandum       to    Director       of     Equal\n\nOpportunity Richard Ealey summarizing a discussion which had\n\ntaken    place    during      the    appeals     process,     as       follows:     \"Mr.\n\nStevenson and I recommend [Straughn’s] request for reinstatement\n\nbe granted and that she be required to reimburse Delta for the\n\noverpayment.\"\n\n            Subsequently, McColly explained that her recommendation\n\nto Ealey was simply that Straughn be reinstated, whereas the\n\nparticulars relating to her reinstatement, i.e., position and\n\nsalary, were left to others.                  Furthermore, Giglio denied any\n\nrole in determining that Straughn should be demoted after her\n\nrehiring    and    Straughn         neither     identified       nor    presented    any\n\nevidence    to    the      contrary.          Thus,    Straughn’s        rehiring    and\n\nplacement     in       a     position      entailing        reduced       salary    and\n\nresponsibilities provide no support for the claim that the\n\nstated reason for her discharge was pretextual.\n\n\n                                           40\n\f           d.    The Other Disparate Treatment Evidence\n\n           Straughn       next   contends       that    the    discipline      Delta\n\nadministered to her was disproportionately severe in comparison\n\nwith that meted out to one John Higgins, a white-male sales\n\nrepresentative      who    had   worked     under       Giglio    in    the   Boston\n\nMarketing Office and supposedly engaged in comparable conduct.\n\nThe record reflects that Higgins was disciplined for falsifying\n\nweekly sales reports relating to time spent with clients.                         Yet,\n\nit also plainly establishes that Higgins readily acknowledged\n\nthe misrepresentations upon inquiry by Giglio.                       Consequently,\n\nDelta   simply   relegated       Higgins     to    a    less     desirable     sales\n\nterritory and placed a \"letter of concern\" in his personnel\n\nfile.\n\n           Evidence       that   an   employer         administered       disparate\n\ntreatment to similarly situated employees may be competent proof\n\nthat the explanation given for the challenged employment action\n\nwas   pretextual,    see    Conward,      171    F.3d    at    19,     provided    the\n\nplaintiff-employee can make a preliminary showing “that others\n\nsimilarly situated . . . in all relevant respects were treated\n\n[more advantageously] by the employer.\"                       Id. at 20 (citing\n\nPerkins v. Brigham & Women's Hosp., 78 F.3d 747, 751 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)) (emphasis added) (\"Reasonableness is the touchstone:\n\nwhile the plaintiff's case and the comparison cases that [s]he\n\n\n                                       41\n\fadvances    need       not    be   perfect      replicas,    they   must    closely\n\nresemble       one     another     in   respect      to     relevant     facts   and\n\ncircumstances.\").\n\n            The district court correctly concluded that Straughn\n\nand Higgins were         not similarly situated in certain relevant\n\nrespects.        For    one    thing,      their   wrongful    conduct     differed\n\nmaterially.      Although each misled a supervisor, Straughn stood\n\nto realize a substantial monetary benefit through her deception\n\n— more than $11,000 — whereas Higgins did not.                             Yet more\n\nimportantly, unlike Straughn, Higgins forthrightly acknowledged\n\nhis     misconduct       when      first     confronted,       whereas     Straughn\n\nrepeatedly attempted to deceive Giglio in an effort to conceal\n\nthe fact that she had retained workers’ compensation benefits to\n\nwhich    she    was     not     entitled.          These    \"differentiating      or\n\nmitigating circumstances\" unquestionably undermined Straughn’s\n\nattempt to demonstrate that her conduct was similar to Higgins’s\n\nin all material respects.               See id. at 21.         Consequently, her\n\ndisparate treatment claim was fatally flawed.\n\n            As Straughn failed to generate a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding either pretext or disparate treatment,\n\nsummary judgment was entirely proper on her gender and race\n\ndiscrimination claims.\n\nB.    The State Law Claims\n\n\n                                           42\n\f      1.     Wrongful Discharge\n\n             Straughn contends that the district court erred in\n\nruling that no trialworthy issue of material fact remained\n\nregarding her wrongful discharge claim under New Hampshire law.\n\nStraughn alleged that Delta wrongfully (i) discharged her for\n\nrefusing to backdate certain personnel forms at Giglio’s request\n\nupon her return to work in April 1997, (ii) then demoted her for\n\nresorting to the internal appeals process.\n\n             In order to prevail on a wrongful termination claim\n\nunder      New   Hampshire   law,   “a    plaintiff    must     establish     two\n\nelements: one, that the employer terminated the employment out\n\nof bad faith, malice, or retaliation; and two, that . . . the\n\nemployment [was terminated] because the employee performed acts\n\nwhich public policy would encourage or . . . refused to perform\n\nacts which public policy would condemn.”             Short v. School Admin.\n\nUnit No. 16, 136 N.H. 76, 84, 612 A.2d 364, 369 (1992) (citing\n\nCloutier v. A & P Tea Co., Inc., 121 N.H. 915, 921-22, 436 A.2d\n\n1140, 1143-44 (1981)).         Bad faith or malice on the part of an\n\nemployer may be established under New Hampshire law where (i) an\n\nemployee is discharged for pursuing policies condoned by the\n\nemployer, (ii) the record does not support the stated reason for\n\nthe discharge, or (iii) disparate treatment was administered to\n\na   similarly     situated   employee.        See   Cloutier,    121   N.H.    at\n\n\n                                         43\n\f921-22, 436 A.2d at 1143-44.\n\n         Upon returning to work after her injury, Straughn was\n\nasked by Giglio to complete and backdate certain disability\n\nforms to correspond with the date of her injury, more than a\n\nyear earlier.     See supra note 3.     Straughn declined.     Shortly\n\nthereafter her employment was terminated by McColly, on Giglio’s\n\nrecommendation.\n\n         As the summary judgment record plainly demonstrates,\n\nsee supra Section II.A, Delta discharged Straughn based on its\n\nwell-founded    belief   that   she    had   not   responded   honestly\n\nregarding her receipt and retention of workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits to which she was not entitled.       In these circumstances,\n\nthe mere temporal proximity between (i) the occasion on which\n\nStraughn refused to backdate the disability forms and (ii) the\n\nlater recommendation by Giglio that her employment be terminated\n\npales to insignificance against the overwhelming weight of the\n\nevidence underpinning the plainly legitimate rationale for the\n\ndischarge decision by Delta.      Accordingly, we need not address\n\nthe public policy issue Straughn endeavors to raise.\n\n         Furthermore, there is simply no validity to the claim\n\nthat Straughn was demoted by Delta for resorting to its internal\n\nappeals process.    Following her discharge on June 16, 1997, and\n\nthe ensuing internal appeal, Straughn was rehired by Delta in a\n\n\n                                  44\n\fposition which carried reduced compensation and entailed less\n\nresponsibility.    Once again Straughn attempts to elide the\n\nobvious, however, by disregarding the indisputable reality that\n\nDelta thereby voluntarily conferred a substantial benefit upon\n\nher, notwithstanding her wrongful conduct.                 Thus, no rational\n\nfactfinder   reasonably      could        conclude     that    Straughn   was\n\nwrongfully   demoted   for   resorting        to     the   internal   appeals\n\nprocess.\n\n    2.     Breach of Contract\n\n           Straughn faults the dismissal of her breach of contract\n\nclaim as well, which was based on the spurious thesis that she\n\nwas dismissed as a result of Delta's failure to monitor her\n\nreceipt of workers’ compensation benefits as provided in the\n\nDelta Corporate Safety Handbook:\n\n           The supervisor should establish a protocol\n           for communication with the injured employee,\n           the medical provider and the workers’\n           compensation administrator. . . . This\n           communication   will   ensure   that   Delta\n           management is apprised of the injured\n           employee's diagnosis, status, and prognosis\n           for return to work.\n\nStraughn claims that the district court incorrectly determined\n\nthat (i) she could not establish a breach of contract, since she\n\nwas not an intended beneficiary of the Delta policy statement,\n\nand (ii) no damages resulted from the alleged breach in any\n\nevent.\n\n                                     45\n\f           Although    the   district         court     did   question      whether\n\nStraughn was an intended beneficiary of the above-quoted policy,\n\nits decision did not rest on that basis.                Instead, the district\n\ncourt assumed arguendo that the Delta policy statement creates\n\nan enforceable legal obligation that Delta monitor the workers’\n\ncompensation     benefits    received        by   its   employees. 11          As   the\n\ndistrict   court     decision    in    no     sense     rested      on   the    basis\n\nsuggested by Straughn, her present argument fails.\n\n           The alternative argument is flawed as well.                    Assuming,\n\nas did the district court, that Delta was obligated, yet failed,\n\nto   monitor   her   receipt    of     workers’       compensation        benefits,\n\nStraughn cannot demonstrate that any harm flowing from the\n\nfailure to monitor was proximately related to her discharge.\n\n\"Damages   are   available      only    if    the     harm    was   a    reasonably\n\nforeseeable result at the time the parties entered into the\n\ncontract.\"     Independent Mech. Contractors, Inc., v. Gordon T.\n\nBurke & Sons, Inc., 138 N.H. 110, 114, 635 A.2d 487, 489 (1993)\n\n\n      11\n      The New Hampshire Supreme Court has held that \"an\nemployer's unilateral promulgation to present at-will employees\nof a statement of intent to pay and provide such economic\nbenefits may be recognized under New Hampshire law as an offer\nto modify their existing relationship by means of a unilateral\ncontract, which offer is subject to such an employee's\nacceptance by continued performance of his duties.\" Panto v.\nMoore Bus.

Thus, statements in employee handbooks\nregarding benefits may give rise to enforceable contracts under\nNew Hampshire law. See id. at 734-35.\n\n                                       46\n\f(\"[A] plaintiff may satisfy this requirement by specifically\n\nproving that the defendant 'had reason to know the facts' at the\n\ntime the parties contracted and to foresee that the injury would\n\nbe a probable consequence of a breach.\").               Any breach of the\n\nobligation       to   monitor      Straughn’s      receipt    of       workers’\n\ncompensation benefits resulted in an overpayment of benefits,\n\nrather than termination of her employment.\n\n            As previously discussed at considerable length, see\n\nsupra Section II.A., the termination of Straughn’s employment\n\ndirectly    resulted      from    her   attempts   to   conceal    —    through\n\ndishonest responses to the inquiries initiated by Delta — her\n\nretention of the inadvertently disbursed workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits.       Consequently, summary judgment was entirely proper,\n\nsince the decision to terminate Straughn’s employment was in no\n\nsense precipitated by any failure on the part of Delta to\n\nmonitor    her    receipt    of   workers’     compensation   benefits,      as\n\ndistinguished from her wrongful retention of those benefits and\n\nher prevarications concerning their retention.\n\n    3.      Defamation\n\n            The remaining state-law claim alleged that Straughn was\n\ndefamed    by    Giglio    following     her   reinstatement.          Straughn\n\ntestified on deposition that two coworkers told her that Giglio\n\nsaid she had done something \"very, very bad.\"                      This claim\n\n\n                                        47\n\flikewise fails, since there can be no actionable defamation\n\nunless the offending statement was false.                   See Nash v. Keene\n\nPubl'g Corp., 127 N.H. 214, 219, 498 A.2d 348, 351 (1985)\n\n(citing Duchesnaye v. Munro Enter., Inc., 125 N.H. 244, 252, 480\n\nA.2d 123, 127 (1984)).       \"To establish defamation, there must be\n\nevidence that a defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in\n\npublishing, without a valid privilege, a false and defamatory\n\nstatement    of   fact   about    the    plaintiff     to    a    third    party.\"\n\nIndependent Mech.

As previously\n\ndiscussed,     see   supra     Section       II.A,    the        record    plainly\n\ndemonstrates that Straughn attempted to mislead her supervisors\n\nin an effort to conceal the fact that she had retained more than\n\n$11,000 in workers’ compensation benefits to which she was not\n\nentitled.     Accordingly, summary judgment was entirely proper.\n\nC.      The Delta Counterclaim\n\n            The district court granted summary judgment on the\n\nDelta    counterclaim    for     $11,608.86,     representing         the    total\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits improperly retained by Straughn.\n\nStraughn insists that summary judgment was inappropriate since\n\nDelta failed to establish the amount due.\n\n            Delta established its entitlement to $11,608.86, as\n\nclaimed,     representing      the   workers’        compensation         benefits\n\n\n                                        48\n\fmistakenly disbursed to Straughn between January 25 and July 4,\n\n1996, while she remained on full salary with Delta.                 Donna\n\nCrews,    Delta   Payroll    Administrator,   attested    that    she   had\n\ncalculated the mistaken overpayments to Straughn at not less\n\nthan $11,608.86.12     Straughn cites no record evidence to the\n\ncontrary and Delta is entitled to reimbursement in that amount\n\npursuant to its “accident leave” policy.\n\n            Accordingly, the summary judgment entered on Delta’s\n\ncounterclaim was entirely proper.\n\n\n\n                                      III\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n            The   district    court    judgment   is   affirmed   in    all\n\nrespects.    Costs are assessed against appellant.\n\n            SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      Once her accident and sick leave benefits had been\nexhausted, Straughn received full salary from July 1996 through\nMarch 1997, when she returned to full-time work. These salary\npayments   totaled   approximately    $20,000    in    additional\noverpayments to Straughn.     Nevertheless, at oral argument,\ncounsel   explained  that   though   Delta   was    entitled   to\nreimbursement in the larger amount, it intended to pursue only\nits $11,608.86 counterclaim for the period January 25 through\nJuly 4, 1996, since its own oversight had enabled Straughn to\ncontinue to receive full salary after July 4, 1996.\n\n                                      49\n\f",

Straughn\n\nurges us to vacate several summary judgment rulings which ultimately\n\nprompted the district court to dismiss her claims against Delta\n\nAirlines, Inc., alleging gender discrimination under Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2001, et seq., race\n\ndiscrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and breach of contract, wrongful\n\ntermination, and defamation under New Hampshire law. Lastly, she seeks\n\nto set aside the summary judgment entered against her on Delta’s\n\ncounterclaim for reimbursement of certain workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits inadvertently disbursed to her in the first instance. We\n\naffirm the district court judgment in all respects.\n\n                                  I\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          Straughn began her employment with Delta in October 1983, as\n\na reservations agent.       In January 1995, she became a sales\n\nrepresentative in its Boston Marketing Office, responsible for an area\n\nwhich includes Vermont and Western New Hampshire. She was one of five\n\nwomen, as well as the only African American, among the fourteen sales\n\nrepresentatives in the Boston Marketing Office.         Her immediate\n\nsupervisor was Zone Manager Helen Meinhold, who reported directly to\n\nLou Giglio, District Marketing Manager.\n\n          On January 19, 1996, while on a sales call for Delta,\n\nStraughn fell and broke her wrist, which disabled her from work for\n\n\n                                  3\n\fmost of the ensuing period through March of 1997.        Although she\n\nreturned to work during this period, on each occasion she was unable to\n\ncontinue for more than a few days.\n\n          Under the applicable Delta employment policy, employees\n\ninjured on the job were entitled to thirteen weeks’ accident leave, as\n\nwell as accumulated sick leave, vacation time and full salary.\n\nNevertheless, these employees were obligated to reimburse Delta for all\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits received while absent on accident leave,\n\npursuant to the following Delta policy statement:\n\n\n          Personnel who receive weekly benefits for\n          occupational injury or illness under the\n          provisions of applicable Worker's (sic)\n          Compensation laws must reimburse the Company\n          in an amount equal to the sum of all such\n          weekly benefits received for the period\n          during which the Company pays the employee's\n          wages, in whole or in part, under accident\n          leave, sick leave, and disability benefit\n          policies.\n\n\n          ESIS, the third-party administrator of Delta’s self-insured\n\nworkers’ compensation plan, makes an independent determination as to\n\nwhether an employee is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits,\n\nbased on the controlling workers' compensation laws and the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the work-related injury. ESIS disburses\n\nworkers' compensation benefits directly to the eligible Delta\n\nemployee, notwithstanding the fact that the employee continues\n\n\n\n                                  4\n\fto receive full salary from Delta pursuant to its accident leave\n\npolicy.   While the pertinent policy statement, supra, obligates\n\nan employee absent on accident leave to reimburse Delta for all\n\nworkers' compensation benefits received from ESIS while on full\n\nsalary, once an employee's accident leave, accumulated sick\n\nleave and vacation time have been exhausted the employee is\n\nremoved from the Delta payroll and thereafter retains whatever\n\nworkers' compensation benefits are received from ESIS.\n\n           Thus, Straughn received three forms of remuneration\n\nwhile on accident leave.           First, during the fourteen-month\n\nperiod she was unable to work, she received her regular Delta\n\nsalary.    Second, from January 25 through July 4, 1996, she\n\nreceived $11,608.86 in workers’ compensation benefits through\n\nESIS.     Third,    she    received   periodic   checks    from     ESIS    as\n\nreimbursement      for   medical   expenses   directly    related    to    her\n\ninjury, including medical bills, prescription costs, and travel\n\nexpenses to and from medical appointments.1         Notwithstanding her\n\nobligation to remit the $11,608.86 in workers’ compensation\n\n\n    1 Although the parties have not addressed the matter, these\nreimbursements appear to have been made in accordance with Mass.\nGen. Laws ch. 152, §§ 30 & 45, which require insurers to furnish\ninjured employees with \"adequate and reasonable health care\nservices, and medicines if needed, together with the expenses\nnecessarily incidental to such services . . . ,\" see id. § 30,\nas well as reimbursement for \"reasonable travel expense\nincidental\" to physician examinations requested by the insurer\nor the insured, see id. § 45.\n\n                                      5\n\fbenefits       received       from   ESIS   during      her    absence    from     work,\n\nStraughn failed to do so.\n\n              Meanwhile, Delta inadvertently continued to disburse\n\nStraughn’s full salary from July 5, 1996, until her eventual\n\nreturn to work in March, 1997, even though her entitlement to\n\nfull       salary   had   expired     on    July   4,    1996,       pursuant    to   the\n\naccident       leave      policy.          Furthermore,        the     administrative\n\nemployees responsible for disbursing Straughn’s salary were\n\nneither       aware    that    she   had    received     and     retained       workers’\n\ncompensation benefits, along with her regular Delta salary, from\n\nJanuary 25 through July 4, 1996, nor that her Delta salary\n\ncontinued to be disbursed some nine months beyond the time she\n\nwas entitled to receive it.2               In March of 1997, upon discovering\n\nits error, Delta conducted a thorough review of all amounts\n\ndisbursed to Straughn since her injury.\n\n              Shortly after returning to work in April of 1997,\n\nStraughn was asked by Giglio, on two separate occasions, whether\n\nshe had received workers’ compensation benefits in addition to\n\n\n       2\n     The confusion appears to be explainable, at least in part,\nby the fact that during the time Straughn received workers’\ncompensation benefits through ESIS, she coordinated her receipt\nof the benefits solely with Catherine Ackles, an employee of\nESIS, and did not deal directly with any Delta employee.\nNonetheless, Delta acknowledges, as its error, the breakdown in\nits communications with ESIS.   Thus, Delta has not sought to\nimpose responsibility upon Straughn for the receipt of these\noverpayments in the first instance.\n\n                                            6\n\fher salary while absent on accident leave.3     On each occasion,\n\nStraughn   denied   receiving   workers’   compensation   benefits,\n\nexplaining instead that she had received money which she used\n\nfor meals and other expenses relating to her injury.4\n\n           At her deposition, however, Straughn recalled these\n\nconversations with Giglio as follows:\n\n           A.   [Giglio] said to me . . . \"By the way,\n                did   you  receive   any  money   from\n                compensation?\"\n\n           Q.   And what did you answer?\n\n           A.   I told him, no.      The money that\n                compensation gave me I used to order\n                out my meals, to help take care of\n                myself, because I was not able to do\n                anything. I had no support system . .\n                . .\n\n           Q.   Could you have said . . . \"No, they\n                gave me money for food, transportation\n                and expenses directly related to my\n                accident\"?\n\n    3Upon returning to work, Straughn was asked by Giglio to\nsign and backdate certain personnel forms relating to her\ninjury. Apparently, these forms were to have been completed at\nthe time of her injury, rather than when she returned to work.\nStraughn refused to do so.\n    4 Although neither party clearly defines the contours of\nESIS's obligation to reimburse Delta employees for certain\ninjury-related expenses, each has assumed that though travel\nexpenses and certain medical costs are reimbursable by ESIS,\nfood and other personal costs are not. Their assumptions appear\nto be based on the obligations imposed by Massachusetts law.\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, §§ 30, 45.     There is no record\nevidence that any Delta or ESIS policy required that Delta\nemployees be reimbursed for food and similar personal costs in\nthese circumstances.\n\n                                 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>\n\f           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> could have said something like that.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n           After   Straughn    repeatedly    denied    having     received\n\nworkers’    compensation      benefits   —    an      assertion     flatly\n\ncontradicted by the business records maintained by both Delta\n\nand ESIS — Giglio relayed her responses to Michelle McColly,\n\nSenior Analyst in the Delta Personnel Department. 5                McColly\n\ninstructed Giglio to approach Straughn again and obtain her\n\nwritten response.    At the same time, Giglio was instructed to\n\nsuspend Straughn pending further investigation.\n\n\n    5Straughn contends on appeal that her responses to these\ninquiries were mixed and ambiguous, rather than direct denials.\nThus, she argues, Giglio should have sought clarification from\nher first, rather than simply reporting to his superiors that\nshe had denied receiving workers' compensation benefits. The\ndistrict court succinctly attended to that contention as\nfollows:\n\n           Straughn's seemingly odd (and ostensibly\n           ambiguous)   'no,   but   yes'   response  to\n           Giglio's inquiry about her receipt of\n           workers' compensation benefits makes perfect\n           sense   in   context    and  is,    in  fact,\n           unambiguous. She denied receiving workers'\n           compensation benefits from ESIS (which she\n           was obligated to sign over to Delta), but\n           acknowledged that ESIS had honored her\n           periodic requests for reimbursement of\n           medical, travel, and related expenses. That\n           response simply did not jibe with the\n           records maintained by Delta and its agent,\n           ESIS.\n\nDistrict Court Opinion, at 11.\n\n                                   8\n\f          Following    the   conversation   with   McColly,     Giglio\n\ninquired of Straughn in the presence of two Delta supervisors —\n\nHelen Meinhold and Tom Keating — regarding whether she had\n\nreceived workers’ compensation benefits while on accident leave.\n\nStraughn responded that she had not, stating once again that she\n\nhad simply received checks to compensate her for costs related\n\nto medical treatment, transportation, and meals.\n\n          Giglio thereupon suspended Straughn, as instructed, and\n\nrequested that she reduce her statement to writing.           Prior to\n\nproviding Giglio with her written response, however, Straughn\n\nconsulted with an attorney who had been representing her in a\n\nrelated tort action against the owner of the premises at which\n\nher injury occurred.\n\n          Helen Meinhold later recounted Straughn’s responses to\n\nGiglio’s inquiry as follows:\n\n          A.   [Giglio] asked [Straughn] whether she\n               had received any additional monies in\n               addition to her paycheck.\n\n          Q.   And what was her response?\n\n          A.   No;   that   she   only    had   gotten\n               reimbursement of some medical expenses.\n\n          Subsequently, Straughn recalled the interrogation by\n\nGiglio:\n\n          I was called into Lou [Giglio's] office and\n          asked  if   I  had   received   money  from\n\n\n                                 9\n\f            compensation to which I initially responded\n            no, but went on to explain to him as I had\n            in the past that I had received money from\n            compensation to help with my expenses such\n            as food, medicine, transportation, etc.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n            The written response Straughn thereafter submitted to\n\nGiglio explained as follows:\n\n            When I spoke to my attorney she advised me\n            [that] until she had an opportunity to look\n            into this[,] do not advise of comp money.\n            When I spoke to [Catherine Ackles] again she\n            reiterated [the] above info.       Also was\n            advised by attorney & [Catherine Ackles] all\n            will be settled. When Lou [Giglio] asked me\n            if I received comp, all I thought of was\n            attorney advise [sic].\n\n(Emphasis    added).      Thus,   the   written      response   provided    by\n\nStraughn admits that she intentionally misled Delta —                    albeit\n\nostensibly on the advice of counsel — regarding her receipt of\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits while continuing to receive full\n\nsalary from Delta.\n\n            Consequently, on May 8, 1997, Giglio recommended that\n\nStraughn be terminated from her employment due to dishonesty.\n\nFollowing further review, McColly recommended that Straughn be\n\nrequired    to   remit    the   $11,608.86      in   workers’   compensation\n\nbenefits     wrongfully    retained,      and    either   resign    or    face\n\ndischarge.\n\n            Thereafter, acting on these recommendations, Director\n\n\n                                     10\n\fof    Equal     Opportunity     Richard        Ealey    terminated        Straughn's\n\nemployment due to her dishonesty in responding to the repeated\n\ninquiries       regarding     her    receipt       of    workers’    compensation\n\nbenefits.         Director     Ealey,      himself      an    African     American,\n\nexplained that it was Straughn's dishonesty which distinguished\n\nher     conduct    from      that    of   other     employees       who    had    not\n\nspontaneously           reimbursed    Delta      after       receiving     workers’\n\ncompensation benefits in similar circumstances.\n\n              Straughn commenced an internal grievance procedure with\n\nthe Delta administrative appeals board.                      In due course, the\n\nboard, comprised of McColly and another member, recommended to\n\nDirector Ealey that Straughn be reinstated.                    The appeals board\n\nneither assigned reasons for its recommendation nor prescribed\n\nconditions for the reinstatement, except that Straughn reimburse\n\nDelta     for     all     workers’    compensation        benefits        wrongfully\n\nretained.\n\n              At that point Giglio offered Straughn employment as a\n\nSales Staff Assistant, a new position with no direct sales\n\nresponsibilities, at an annual salary of $39,696 rather than the\n\n$46,462 salary she formerly received.                   After Straughn accepted\n\nthe   offer,      Delta     placed   a    \"final    warning\"     letter      in   her\n\npersonnel file:          the most severe disciplinary action short of\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\foutright termination.6\n\n                Following her reinstatement, Straughn brought suit in\n\nthe   United      States    District    Court       for    the    District     of    New\n\nHampshire.        Delta answered and counterclaimed for the $11,608.86\n\nin workers’ compensation benefits retained by Straughn, then\n\nmoved     for    summary    judgment    on    all    claims,      as    well   as   its\n\ncounterclaim, contending that Straughn had been discharged for\n\na legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason:                    i.e., her persistent\n\nlack of candor in responding to legitimate inquiries regarding\n\nher wrongful retention of workers’ compensation benefits.\n\n                After   determining    that     Straughn         had   presented      no\n\ncompetent evidence that Delta had tendered a pretextual reason\n\nfor   terminating       her   employment,      the       district      court   granted\n\nsummary     judgment       against    Straughn      on    the     gender   and      race\n\n\n      6 The “final warning” letter stated, in relevant part:\n\n                Even if you did not intend to keep these\n                overpayments, your failure to monitor these\n                payments and to fully advise Delta of these\n                overpayments causes us great concern with\n                respect to your ability to be a reliable and\n                effective Sales Representative.      As you\n                know, that position entails great autonomy\n                and responsibility, including the handling\n                of company resources, and we do not believe\n                you should hold such a position at this time\n                considering the way you handled these\n                overpayments. Consequently, we have decided\n                to reinstate your employment as a Sales\n                Staff Assistant.\n\n\n                                        12\n\fdiscrimination claims, as well as all state-law claims.    At the\n\nsame time, the district court directed summary judgment for\n\nDelta on its counterclaim.\n\n                                 II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nA.

The record does not bear\n\nout her contention.\n\n            It is undisputed that Director of Equal Opportunity\n\nRichard Ealey, after reviewing the dismissal recommendations by\n\nMichelle McColly and Giglio, ultimately was responsible for\n\nterminating Straughn's employment.                  Yet there is no record\n\nevidence, nor has Straughn contended, that either Ealey or\n\nMcColly harbored any race-or-gender-based animus.                           Instead,\n\nStraughn maintains that Giglio, her intermediate supervisor, was\n\nin a position to influence Ealey, the ultimate decisionmaker;\n\nthus, she argues, Giglio indirectly brought about her wrongful\n\ntermination       for     discriminatory        reasons     by     presenting    the\n\nultimate decisionmaker with a pretextual justification.\n\n            Straughn         contends      in     particular         that     Giglio\n\nintentionally inquired in an ambiguous manner regarding her\n\nreceipt of workers’ compensation benefits, then mischaracterized\n\nher   responses,        as   categorical     rather     than     qualified,     when\n\nreporting    to    Ealey     and   McColly.       She     claims    that    Giglio's\n\ndiscriminatory          intentions   are     evidenced       (i)    by     workplace\n\nutterances reflecting bias against African Americans and (ii) by\n\n\n                                        18\n\frelatively undesirable work assignments, unfair criticisms, and\n\nthe withholding of various perquisites and incentives available\n\nto other Delta sales representatives.\n\n            Straughn also claims that the decision to rehire her,\n\nfollowing    her     internal         appeal,         demonstrates     that      Delta\n\nmanagement ultimately realized that Giglio's rendition of her\n\nresponses had been contrived, whereas her actual responses were\n\naccurate.        Similarly,     she    insists        that   Giglio   unilaterally\n\ndemoted her to a position entailing reduced responsibilities and\n\nsalary   even     though   Delta      had   recommended        her    unconditional\n\nreinstatement.       Finally, Straughn argues that the discipline\n\ninitially imposed upon her — outright discharge — differed\n\nmaterially from that meted out to another Delta employee who had\n\nmade similar statements to Giglio in the past.                  We discuss these\n\ncontentions in turn.\n\n            a.     The Allegedly Discriminatory Utterances\n                   and Related Workplace Mistreatment\n\n\n            In    order    to   sustain         her   burden   of    persuasion     on\n\npretext,    Straughn       needed     to        demonstrate    either     that     her\n\ndismissal was (i) \"more likely motivated” by discrimination than\n\nby the explanation proffered by Delta, or (ii) the proffered\n\n“explanation [was] unworthy of credence\" in circumstances where\n\nthe suspect denial, taken together with other facts, suggests\n\n\n                                           19\n\fsuch a motivation.

Compare McMillan, 140\n\nF.3d at 301 (workplace remarks by male department head at time\n\nremote from incident in dispute — regarding physical traits and\n\nsexual activities of female co-workers, but bearing no direct\n\nrelationship to employment — held not probative of pretext where\n\nchallenged    decision        involved      lower    salaries     for    female\n\nemployees),    with    Fernandes,      199    F.3d   at   583    (comments   by\n\ndecisionmaker — including \"I don't need minorities”; “I don't\n\nneed residents on this job”; \"I don't have to hire you locals or\n\nCape Verdean people” — were not mere \"stray remarks\" where\n\nchallenged employment action concerned refusal to rehire dark-\n\nskinned residents of Cape Verdean descent).               Accordingly, even\n\nif we were to assume that the assertedly offensive workplace\n\n“accent” is somehow suggestive of racial bias,7 it would not be\n\nsignificantly   probative       of    pretext   absent    some    discernible\n\nindication that its communicative content, if any, materially\n\n\n    7As concerns the gender-based discrimination claim, however,\nwe can discern no relevance whatsoever in the “southern black”\naccent evidence.\n\n                                       22\n\ferodes    the   stated     rationale    for   the   challenged       employment\n\naction.\n\n           Straughn proffered no evidence that Giglio ever used\n\nthe nondescript “southern black” accent              either during or in\n\nrelation to the challenged employment action.                   Nor is there\n\ncompetent evidence from which a rational factfinder might fairly\n\ninfer that the communicative import of the nondescript accent\n\npertained to employment matters, let alone to Straughn or her\n\nemployment.     Indeed, Straughn herself has never intimated either\n\na   rationale     or   a   circumstantial       predicate     for    reasonably\n\ninferring that the “southern black” accent amounted to anything\n\nother than insensitive banter.              Thus, Straughn’s naked         ipse\n\ndixit was insufficient to generate a genuine issue of material\n\nfact.\n\n           Accordingly, we conclude that the “southern black”\n\naccent allegedly used on occasion by Giglio, without more, is\n\nnot probative of pretext on the part of Delta, given (i) the\n\nabsence of any discernible contextual or temporal relationship\n\nbetween the discharge decision and the workplace accent used by\n\nGiglio, (ii) the demonstrably self-sufficient basis for the\n\nmanagement recommendation by Richard Ealey to discharge Straughn\n\ndue to her persistent work-related dishonesty, and (iii) the\n\ndistinctly      subordinate    role    Giglio   played   in    the    dismissal\n\n\n                                       23\n\fdecision.\n\n              (ii)           The Disparate Workplace Treatment\n\n              Straughn        claims    that     Giglio    singled        her   out     for\n\ninferior work assignments, unfairly criticized her performance,\n\nand    withheld       various       perquisites      and    inducements         accorded\n\nsimilarly situated sales representatives.                        The district court\n\ndetermined that the evidence Straughn tendered to demonstrate\n\npretext was insufficient in light of the countervailing evidence\n\nthat       Delta     management        reasonably     believed          that    Straughn\n\nrepeatedly lied to her superiors regarding her receipt and\n\nwrongful         retention     of   workers'      compensation          benefits    while\n\nabsent      on     accident    leave     and     receiving       full    salary.

The record discloses that the Vermont and Western\n\nNew Hampshire sales territory, to which Straughn initially was\n\nassigned, historically has generated lower revenues than all but\n\none other sales territory within the Boston Marketing Office\n\narea and accordingly has been selected in the past as a training\n\nterritory for relatively inexperienced sales representatives.\n\n            Nor did Straughn tender evidence that there was any\n\nnormal time frame within which sales representatives in training\n\ncustomarily     were     transferred       to    more    lucrative    sales\n\nterritories.    Similarly, she proffered no evidence regarding any\n\ncriteria utilized by Delta in determining when newer sales\n\nrepresentatives were considered eligible for transfer to more\n\ndesirable sales territories.\n\n            On the other hand, the record plainly discloses that\n\na   white    male    sales   representative      drew   the   Maine   sales\n\nterritory,    which    is    comparable    to   the   Vermont-Western   New\n\nHampshire sales territory in terms of the driving distances and\n\n\n                                     25\n\frelatively    low   sales    revenues.        Yet    Straughn    proffered     no\n\nevidence regarding the tenure of her counterpart in the                     Maine\n\nsales territory.          Finally, there is no record evidence that\n\nStraughn’s experience or tenure differed in any material respect\n\nfrom   that   of    her    predecessors      in   the   Vermont-Western       New\n\nHampshire sales territory.\n\n          Since Straughn tendered no competent evidence that her\n\ninitial assignment as a sales representative differed materially\n\nfrom that of other relatively new sales representatives in the\n\nBoston Marketing Office, summary judgment was appropriate.                    See\n\nid.; Conward, 171 F.3d at 20 (“Where . . . the plaintiff in a\n\ndisparate treatment race [or gender] discrimination case offers\n\ncomparative evidence . . . to raise an inference of racial [or\n\ngender-based] discrimination, [she] must provide a suitable\n\nprovenance for the evidence by showing that others similarly\n\nsituated . . . in all relevant respects were treated differently\n\nby the employer.”) (emphasis added).\n\n          (iii)      Miscellaneous Evidence of Pretext\n\n          Similarly,        Straughn        tendered    insufficient        other\n\nevidence to generate a trialworthy issue on pretext.                   Instead,\n\nshe simply pointed to evidence that Giglio reprimanded her for\n\ntardiness,    driving      excessive   miles,       visiting    too   few   sales\n\naccounts, and failing to generate adequate “shuttle” flight\n\n\n                                       26\n\fticket   sales.

The   Thomas    case     is\n\ninapposite.\n\n            There is no record evidence that Straughn’s discharge\n\nwas related in any way to work performance.                  For that matter,\n\nthere is no evidence that Straughn ever received a “poor” work\n\nevaluation.     See id. at 62-63.            On the contrary, following the\n\nonly documented review of her work performance with the Boston\n\nMarketing Office, Straughn received a “high” rating from none\n\n\n                                        27\n\fother than Giglio and Meinhold.                     Consequently, the present\n\ncontention provides no support for the claim that Straughn was\n\nsubjected      to       \"differential       treatment       in     the     workplace.”\n\nFernandes, 199 F.3d at 581.\n\n             Straughn         also    testified      that      various     privileges\n\navailable to other sales representatives were withheld from her,\n\nincluding authorization to:                  (a) provide clients with free\n\npromotional flight tickets, (b) obtain reimbursement for meals\n\nwhile entertaining clients, and (c) work on a part-time basis\n\nfrom a “virtual” home office.                     Nevertheless, she failed to\n\nproffer      competent        evidence     that   she    and     these   other    sales\n\nrepresentatives were “similarly situated” in all or even most\n\nrelevant respects.            See Conward, 171 F.3d at 20.\n\n             (a)    Free Promotional Flight Tickets\n\n             Straughn asserts, in conclusory fashion, that all sales\n\nrepresentatives          in     her   office      were    permitted,        at    their\n\ndiscretion,        to    give      promotional      flight       tickets    to    their\n\nrespective clients, whereas she \"rarely\" was allowed to do so.\n\nShe makes no attempt to approximate the number of occasions on\n\nwhich promotional flight tickets were made available to her or\n\nto other Delta sales representatives.                    Instead, she focuses on\n\na   single    instance        in   which   Helen    Meinhold       directed      her   to\n\nrecover a promotional flight ticket which Straughn had made\n\n\n                                            28\n\favailable to the spouse of a client.            It is undisputed that\n\nDelta policy contemplates that these promotional flight tickets\n\nare to be made available to Delta clients, not their spouses.\n\nThe   record   also   indicates   that   the   episode   referred   to   by\n\nStraughn occurred during the first six months of her tenure as\n\na sales representative.       Yet Straughn presented no competent\n\nevidence that she and these other sales representatives were\n\nsimilarly situated, either in regard to tenure, experience, or\n\nthe numbers of clients served.\n\n           (b)   Client Entertainment\n\n           Straughn asserts that some sales representatives were\n\nreimbursed for meal costs incurred while entertaining Delta\n\nclients.   The one person she names — Jane Martin — began work\n\nwith the Boston Marketing Office two weeks before Straughn.\n\nOther than similar starting dates, however, Straughn tendered no\n\nevidence that she and Martin were “similarly situated,” most\n\nnotably in regard to the particular characteristics of their\n\nrespective sales territories and clienteles. Moreover, Straughn\n\nadmitted that she was never denied reimbursement.           Instead, she\n\nstates that she was reprimanded by Meinhold on one occasion for\n\npurchasing donuts for the personnel in a “couple of offices” and\n\nwarned not to do so again.        See also note 8 supra.\n\n           (c)   The “Virtual Home Office” Privilege\n\n\n                                    29\n\f           Straughn testified that all other sales representatives\n\nin the Boston Marketing Office were granted the “virtual home\n\noffice” privilege.     See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 824 (noting that\n\nevidence of “differential treatment in the workplace” supports\n\npretext claim).   Yet Straughn points to no evidence that she and\n\nthese other sales representatives were similarly situated.\n\n           Competent   proof     that   the   plaintiff   was   denied\n\nprivileges and opportunities available to similarly situated\n\nemployees may constitute probative evidence that an adverse\n\nemployment action was motivated by discriminatory animus.          See\n\nThomas, 183 F.3d at 63 (evidence that supervisors prevented\n\nminority   employee    from    making   important   presentation   and\n\nwithheld \"appropriate developmental opportunities\" and computer\n\ntraining, all of which were accorded non-minority employees,\n\nsupports disparate treatment claim).          Straughn testified on\n\ndeposition that she made at least three requests to work from a\n\nvirtual home office.     The record also reflects that some sales\n\nrepresentatives were permitted to work from a “virtual” home\n\noffice.    Yet Richard Ealey denied Straughn permission to do so\n\nfollowing her extended absence from work, since her doctor had\n\nadvised that, though able to work, Straughn was not yet well\n\nenough to drive an automobile — hence unable to service clients,\n\nthe primary responsibility of her position.\n\n\n                                   30\n\f         As concerns Straughn’s previous requests to work from\n\na “virtual” home office, one was denied by Meinhold and several\n\nby Giglio.   The record reflects that her first request to Giglio\n\nwas made within six months of her hiring.   Straughn presented no\n\nevidence that other new sales representatives were accorded the\n\nprivilege so early in their tenure.    With regard to the other\n\nrequests which Giglio denied, she points to no evidence (i) that\n\nshe was “similarly situated” to any sales representative who was\n\naccorded the privilege, or (ii) that she met Delta’s criteria\n\nfor evaluating such requests.    Instead, she simply asserts in\n\nconclusory fashion that everyone else was permitted to work\n\npart-time from a “virtual” home office.     Thus, she failed to\n\npresent competent evidence that the proffered reason for the\n\nchallenged employment action was pretextual.   See Fernandes, 199\n\nF.2d at 581; Conward, 171 F.3d at 20; Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 824.\n\n         Moreover, given the overwhelming weight of the evidence\n\nthat the proffered reason for the dismissal action was both\n\nsound and sufficient, the tenuous disparate treatment evidence\n\npresented by Straughn was plainly insufficient to enable a\n\nreasonable factfinder to conclude that Giglio had fabricated the\n\nreport about Straughn’s prevarications relating to her wrongful\n\nretention of the workers’ compensation benefits.9   Nothing more\n\n    9The other instances Straughn cites in relation to her\ndisparate treatment claim lack adequate evidentiary support as\n\n                                31\n\fis exigible.\n\n          b.        The    Alleged     Distortions of Straughn’s\n          Responses\n\n          Straughn likewise failed to generate a trialworthy\n\nissue in relation to her claim that Giglio mischaracterized her\n\nresponses to his inquiries regarding her receipt and retention\n\nof   workers’   compensation   benefits.   As   the   district   court\n\nappropriately noted, Straughn's deposition testimony, affidavit,\n\nand written statement abundantly demonstrate her utter lack of\n\ncandor in responding to these legitimate inquiries.\n\n          Upon initial inquiry by Giglio, as to whether she had\n\nreceived \"any money from compensation,\" Straughn responded in\n\nthe negative, then added that she had received money \"to order\n\nout my meals [and] to help take care of myself . . . .\"          On the\n\nsecond occasion, in the presence of two other supervisors,\n\nStraughn again denied receiving workers’ compensation benefits,\n\n\nwell.   With regard to the authority to provide clients with\npromotional flight tickets, she points to no evidence that\nGiglio was involved in any way.      Instead, Straughn herself\ntestified on deposition that it was Meinhold who restricted her\nauthority in this regard.\n     Straughn acknowledged that some, but not all, Delta sales\nrepresentatives   were  reimbursed   for   client  meal   costs.\nFurthermore, she neither presented evidence that she was not\nreimbursed, nor that she was similarly situated to those\nemployees who were regularly reimbursed. Thus, she failed to\ngenerate a rational inference that any race-or-gender based bias\nharbored by    Giglio accounted in any way for the alleged\nrejections of her requests for reimbursement. See Conward, 171\nF.3d at 20.\n\n                                  32\n\fwhile allowing that she had received reimbursements for certain\n\nexpenses.      These responses were not only materially false, but\n\nknowingly made, in that Straughn was well aware that she had\n\nreceived and retained workers’ compensation benefits meant to\n\ncompensate her for lost salary, while continuing to receive full\n\nsalary from Delta.\n\n              Straughn    also     received       other    checks      from     ESIS,\n\nrepresenting reimbursements for various expenses incurred in\n\nconnection      with     her   job-related        injury,       such   as     medical\n\nservices, prescription drugs, and travel expenses incurred in\n\nconnection with medical appointments.                  Although food was not an\n\nexpense reimbursed by ESIS, it was among those Straughn listed\n\nwhen Giglio asked whether she had received money for \"expenses.\"\n\nCuriously, Straughn now attempts to characterize her response to\n\nGiglio   as    an   admission      that    she    had    indeed    received      both\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits and reimbursements for expenses\n\nfrom ESIS.      She reasons that since she listed food — an expense\n\nnot eligible for reimbursement from ESIS — her direct response\n\nto Giglio that she had             never received workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits      somehow    acknowledged      that    she    had    indeed     received\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits.\n\n              She also attempts to rationalize her negative response\n\nto   Giglio    as   simply     a   reference     “to    the   promised      workers’\n\n\n                                          33\n\fcompensation settlement, not weekly benefits . . . .”         Since she\n\nhas not elaborated, we are left to speculate about the precise\n\ndetails.\n\n            Thus, essentially Straughn sought — indeed still seeks\n\n— to rationalize the obvious inaccuracies in her response to\n\nGiglio, which she attributes to inartful language, as including\n\nan accurate response to a question she was never asked.                In\n\ncontrast, Giglio and Delta management rationally assessed her\n\npersistent refusals to acknowledge her receipt and wrongful\n\nretention    of   workers’   compensation   benefits   as   attempts   to\n\nconceal the truth.\n\n            Undeterred, Straughn continues to defend her responses\n\nas technically accurate in the sense that she did tell Giglio\n\nthat she had received food money, which could only have derived\n\nfrom workers’ compensation benefits since food is not an expense\n\nrelated to medical treatment.      This artful contention is belied\n\nas well, however, by her own written submission following her\n\nsuspension by Delta:\n\n            When I spoke to my attorney[,] she advised\n            me . . . do not advise of comp money. . . .\n            When [Giglio] asked me if I received comp,\n            all I thought of was attorney advise [sic].\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n            Thus, Straughn admitted to an attempt to conceal the\n\nfact that she had received workers’ compensation benefits while\n\n                                   34\n\fon accident leave from her employment with Delta, albeit on the\n\nadvice of counsel.        At a minimum, then, the summary judgment\n\nrecord     unambiguously     established     that    Straughn     plainly\n\nunderstood that she had received workers’ compensation benefits\n\nwhile on full salary, yet set out to conceal that fact from\n\nDelta.\n\n           No less importantly, at this point in the burden-\n\nshifting analysis the principal focus must be upon whether\n\nMcColly    and   Ealey,    the   responsible     Delta   decisionmakers,\n\nreasonably believed that Straughn lied, rather than whether she\n\nactually lied.    \"In assessing pretext, [our] 'focus must be on\n\nthe perception of the decisionmaker,' that is, whether the\n\nemployer believed its stated reason to be credible.\"          Goldman v.\n\nFirst Nat’l Bank of Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600349\"><a href=\"/opinion/600349/robert-goldman-v-first-national-bank-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 824; Gray v.

As Straughn has\n\nnever claimed that either McColly or Ealey harbored a gender-\n\nbased or race-based bias, but rather that they were misled by\n\nGiglio's allegedly wrongful recommendation that her employment\n\nbe terminated, in these particular circumstances it is the\n\nreasonableness of Giglio's belief alone which is controlling.\n\n           The record plainly demonstrates that Giglio reasonably\n\nregarded   Straughn’s     responses   to   his   inquiries   as   wrongful\n\n\n                                    35\n\fattempts to conceal what he well knew to be so, based on Delta’s\n\nbusiness   records;      viz.,    that    Straughn   had    received    and\n\nwrongfully retained workers’ compensation benefits from ESIS,\n\nwhile continuing to receive her full Delta salary on accident\n\nleave.     Giglio   accordingly       recommended    that    Straughn   be\n\ndischarged,   due   to   her     persistent   dishonesty,    pursuant   to\n\nlongstanding Delta policy.\n\n           In these circumstances, no rational trier of fact could\n\nconclude that Giglio did not reasonably believe that Straughn\n\nhad responded dishonestly when repeatedly confronted with the\n\ndocumented fact that she had received workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits, as well as full salary, while on accident leave.\n\nThus, Straughn utterly failed to generate a trialworthy issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether Giglio reasonably believed that she\n\nhad attempted to mislead him regarding her receipt and retention\n\nof the workers’ compensation benefits to which she was not\n\nentitled.10   A fortiori, she failed to generate a trialworthy\n\n     10\n      Nevertheless, Straughn now insists that Giglio \"set [her]\nup and then reported her,\" by asking whether she had received\nworkers’ compensation benefits, rather than simply telling her\nthat he knew she had, then presenting her with various repayment\noptions. We can discern no animus in these attempts to verify,\nfirsthand with Straughn, the documented information that Giglio\nhad received.   As the district court appropriately noted, in\nthese circumstances Straughn cannot —\n\n           legitimately complain that Giglio knew the\n           answer to the question about her receipt of\n           workers' compensation benefits before he\n\n                                     36\n\fissue   as    to    whether     McColly       and    Ealey    reasonably      accepted\n\nGiglio’s version of the relevant events.\n\n              c.

McColly, one of the\n\ntwo Delta supervisors who participated in the internal appeal,\n\nexplained       the    rationale       for      recommending           Straughn’s\n\nreinstatement as follows:\n\n            [D]espite the fact that I . . .     believed\n            that [Straughn] had still done something\n            wrong, and furthermore that she knew she had\n            done something wrong, I did believe, after\n            meeting   with  her,   that   there  was   a\n            considerable amount of confusion in the\n            administration of the workers’ compensation,\n            or that it could have been handled better.\n            And Ms. Straughn did have a good record, and\n            several years with the company, so we\n            decided that we should recommend . . .\n            another chance.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n            Asked to clarify what she meant by \"confusion,\" McColly\n\nstated that she had neither concluded that Straughn was confused\n\nby   Giglio's    questions,    nor   that     Straughn    had     retained    the\n\nworkers’ compensation payments unwittingly.                  Instead, McColly\n\nexplained: \"I still believe that Ms. Straughn very likely knew\n\n                                       38\n\fthat she had not been entitled to the payments,” emphasizing\n\nthat the appeals process had in no sense caused her to \"question\n\nthe story that Lou Giglio had been telling . . . [and] that\n\nultimately led to [Straughn's] termination.\"\n\n            Plainly, then, the recommendation to rehire Straughn\n\nwas made notwithstanding McColly’s earnest belief that it was\n\nvery likely that Straughn knowingly had done “something wrong.”\n\nFurthermore,        McColly    stated           that     though      the    workers’\n\ncompensation      disbursements        should          have   been   managed      more\n\nefficiently and that some actual confusion had indeed resulted,\n\nDelta nonetheless had been justified in discharging Straughn due\n\nto her repeated attempts to mislead.\n\n            Thus,    there    is      no    evidentiary         support     for    the\n\ncontention that the appeals board hearing prompted McColly to\n\nconclude    either     that   Giglio        had    misrepresented          Straughn's\n\nresponses    or   that     Straughn    had      been     wrongfully    discharged.\n\nInstead, the record is clear that McColly recommended a \"second\n\nchance\"     based     on    Straughn’s          overall       employment      record,\n\nnotwithstanding ample grounds for the dismissal.                      Accordingly,\n\nnot only does the decision to rehire Straughn provide no support\n\nfor the claim that the proffered reason for discharging her was\n\n“unworthy of credence,” Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256, it strongly\n\nevidences an absence of any forbidden animus on the part of\n\n\n                                           39\n\fDelta.\n\n            Next,       we   turn     to   the    contention       that     Straughn’s\n\ndemotion    to     a    position      entailing       reduced     compensation       and\n\nresponsibilities,              notwithstanding              the         unconditional\n\nreinstatement recommended by Delta management, demonstrates that\n\nGiglio    harbored         discriminatory        motives    in     recommending      her\n\ndischarge in the first instance.                      The record reflects that\n\nMcColly     transmitted         a     memorandum       to    Director       of     Equal\n\nOpportunity Richard Ealey summarizing a discussion which had\n\ntaken    place    during      the    appeals     process,     as       follows:     \"Mr.\n\nStevenson and I recommend [Straughn’s] request for reinstatement\n\nbe granted and that she be required to reimburse Delta for the\n\noverpayment.\"\n\n            Subsequently, McColly explained that her recommendation\n\nto Ealey was simply that Straughn be reinstated, whereas the\n\nparticulars relating to her reinstatement, i.e., position and\n\nsalary, were left to others.                  Furthermore, Giglio denied any\n\nrole in determining that Straughn should be demoted after her\n\nrehiring    and    Straughn         neither     identified       nor    presented    any\n\nevidence    to    the      contrary.          Thus,    Straughn’s        rehiring    and\n\nplacement     in       a     position      entailing        reduced       salary    and\n\nresponsibilities provide no support for the claim that the\n\nstated reason for her discharge was pretextual.\n\n\n                                           40\n\f           d.    The Other Disparate Treatment Evidence\n\n           Straughn       next   contends       that    the    discipline      Delta\n\nadministered to her was disproportionately severe in comparison\n\nwith that meted out to one John Higgins, a white-male sales\n\nrepresentative      who    had   worked     under       Giglio    in    the   Boston\n\nMarketing Office and supposedly engaged in comparable conduct.\n\nThe record reflects that Higgins was disciplined for falsifying\n\nweekly sales reports relating to time spent with clients.                         Yet,\n\nit also plainly establishes that Higgins readily acknowledged\n\nthe misrepresentations upon inquiry by Giglio.                       Consequently,\n\nDelta   simply   relegated       Higgins     to    a    less     desirable     sales\n\nterritory and placed a \"letter of concern\" in his personnel\n\nfile.\n\n           Evidence       that   an   employer         administered       disparate\n\ntreatment to similarly situated employees may be competent proof\n\nthat the explanation given for the challenged employment action\n\nwas   pretextual,    see    Conward,      171    F.3d    at    19,     provided    the\n\nplaintiff-employee can make a preliminary showing “that others\n\nsimilarly situated . . . in all relevant respects were treated\n\n[more advantageously] by the employer.\"                       Id. at 20 (citing\n\nPerkins v.

For    one    thing,      their   wrongful    conduct     differed\n\nmaterially.      Although each misled a supervisor, Straughn stood\n\nto realize a substantial monetary benefit through her deception\n\n— more than $11,000 — whereas Higgins did not.                             Yet more\n\nimportantly, unlike Straughn, Higgins forthrightly acknowledged\n\nhis     misconduct       when      first     confronted,       whereas     Straughn\n\nrepeatedly attempted to deceive Giglio in an effort to conceal\n\nthe fact that she had retained workers’ compensation benefits to\n\nwhich    she    was     not     entitled.          These    \"differentiating      or\n\nmitigating circumstances\" unquestionably undermined Straughn’s\n\nattempt to demonstrate that her conduct was similar to Higgins’s\n\nin all material respects.               See id. at 21.         Consequently, her\n\ndisparate treatment claim was fatally flawed.\n\n            As Straughn failed to generate a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding either pretext or disparate treatment,\n\nsummary judgment was entirely proper on her gender and race\n\ndiscrimination claims.\n\nB.

Bad faith or malice on the part of an\n\nemployer may be established under New Hampshire law where (i) an\n\nemployee is discharged for pursuing policies condoned by the\n\nemployer, (ii) the record does not support the stated reason for\n\nthe discharge, or (iii) disparate treatment was administered to\n\na   similarly     situated   employee.        See   Cloutier,    121   N.H.    at\n\n\n                                         43\n\f921-22, 436 A.2d at 1143-44.\n\n         Upon returning to work after her injury, Straughn was\n\nasked by Giglio to complete and backdate certain disability\n\nforms to correspond with the date of her injury, more than a\n\nyear earlier.     See supra note 3.     Straughn declined.     Shortly\n\nthereafter her employment was terminated by McColly, on Giglio’s\n\nrecommendation.\n\n         As the summary judgment record plainly demonstrates,\n\nsee supra Section II.A, Delta discharged Straughn based on its\n\nwell-founded    belief   that   she    had   not   responded   honestly\n\nregarding her receipt and retention of workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits to which she was not entitled.       In these circumstances,\n\nthe mere temporal proximity between (i) the occasion on which\n\nStraughn refused to backdate the disability forms and (ii) the\n\nlater recommendation by Giglio that her employment be terminated\n\npales to insignificance against the overwhelming weight of the\n\nevidence underpinning the plainly legitimate rationale for the\n\ndischarge decision by Delta.      Accordingly, we need not address\n\nthe public policy issue Straughn endeavors to raise.\n\n         Furthermore, there is simply no validity to the claim\n\nthat Straughn was demoted by Delta for resorting to its internal\n\nappeals process.    Following her discharge on June 16, 1997, and\n\nthe ensuing internal appeal, Straughn was rehired by Delta in a\n\n\n                                  44\n\fposition which carried reduced compensation and entailed less\n\nresponsibility.    Once again Straughn attempts to elide the\n\nobvious, however, by disregarding the indisputable reality that\n\nDelta thereby voluntarily conferred a substantial benefit upon\n\nher, notwithstanding her wrongful conduct.                 Thus, no rational\n\nfactfinder   reasonably      could        conclude     that    Straughn   was\n\nwrongfully   demoted   for   resorting        to     the   internal   appeals\n\nprocess.\n\n    2.     Breach of Contract\n\n           Straughn faults the dismissal of her breach of contract\n\nclaim as well, which was based on the spurious thesis that she\n\nwas dismissed as a result of Delta's failure to monitor her\n\nreceipt of workers’ compensation benefits as provided in the\n\nDelta Corporate Safety Handbook:\n\n           The supervisor should establish a protocol\n           for communication with the injured employee,\n           the medical provider and the workers’\n           compensation administrator. . . . This\n           communication   will   ensure   that   Delta\n           management is apprised of the injured\n           employee's diagnosis, status, and prognosis\n           for return to work.\n\nStraughn claims that the district court incorrectly determined\n\nthat (i) she could not establish a breach of contract, since she\n\nwas not an intended beneficiary of the Delta policy statement,\n\nand (ii) no damages resulted from the alleged breach in any\n\nevent.\n\n                                     45\n\f           Although    the   district         court     did   question      whether\n\nStraughn was an intended beneficiary of the above-quoted policy,\n\nits decision did not rest on that basis.                Instead, the district\n\ncourt assumed arguendo that the Delta policy statement creates\n\nan enforceable legal obligation that Delta monitor the workers’\n\ncompensation     benefits    received        by   its   employees. 11          As   the\n\ndistrict   court     decision    in    no     sense     rested      on   the    basis\n\nsuggested by Straughn, her present argument fails.\n\n           The alternative argument is flawed as well.                    Assuming,\n\nas did the district court, that Delta was obligated, yet failed,\n\nto   monitor   her   receipt    of     workers’       compensation        benefits,\n\nStraughn cannot demonstrate that any harm flowing from the\n\nfailure to monitor was proximately related to her discharge.\n\n\"Damages   are   available      only    if    the     harm    was   a    reasonably\n\nforeseeable result at the time the parties entered into the\n\ncontract.\"     Independent Mech.

Consequently, summary judgment was entirely proper,\n\nsince the decision to terminate Straughn’s employment was in no\n\nsense precipitated by any failure on the part of Delta to\n\nmonitor    her    receipt    of   workers’     compensation   benefits,      as\n\ndistinguished from her wrongful retention of those benefits and\n\nher prevarications concerning their retention.\n\n    3.      Defamation\n\n            The remaining state-law claim alleged that Straughn was\n\ndefamed    by    Giglio    following     her   reinstatement.          Straughn\n\ntestified on deposition that two coworkers told her that Giglio\n\nsaid she had done something \"very, very bad.\"                      This claim\n\n\n                                        47\n\flikewise fails, since there can be no actionable defamation\n\nunless the offending statement was false.

Contractors, Inc., 138 N.H. at 118, 635 A.2d\n\nat 492 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).                      As previously\n\ndiscussed,     see   supra     Section       II.A,    the        record    plainly\n\ndemonstrates that Straughn attempted to mislead her supervisors\n\nin an effort to conceal the fact that she had retained more than\n\n$11,000 in workers’ compensation benefits to which she was not\n\nentitled.     Accordingly, summary judgment was entirely proper.\n\nC.      The Delta Counterclaim\n\n            The district court granted summary judgment on the\n\nDelta    counterclaim    for     $11,608.86,     representing         the    total\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits improperly retained by Straughn.\n\nStraughn insists that summary judgment was inappropriate since\n\nDelta failed to establish the amount due.\n\n            Delta established its entitlement to $11,608.86, as\n\nclaimed,     representing      the   workers’        compensation         benefits\n\n\n                                        48\n\fmistakenly disbursed to Straughn between January 25 and July 4,\n\n1996, while she remained on full salary with Delta.                 Donna\n\nCrews,    Delta   Payroll    Administrator,   attested    that    she   had\n\ncalculated the mistaken overpayments to Straughn at not less\n\nthan $11,608.86.12     Straughn cites no record evidence to the\n\ncontrary and Delta is entitled to reimbursement in that amount\n\npursuant to its “accident leave” policy.\n\n            Accordingly, the summary judgment entered on Delta’s\n\ncounterclaim was entirely proper.\n\n\n\n                                      III\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n            The   district    court    judgment   is   affirmed   in    all\n\nrespects.    Costs are assessed against appellant.\n\n            SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      Once her accident and sick leave benefits had been\nexhausted, Straughn received full salary from July 1996 through\nMarch 1997, when she returned to full-time work. These salary\npayments   totaled   approximately    $20,000    in    additional\noverpayments to Straughn.     Nevertheless, at oral argument,\ncounsel   explained  that   though   Delta   was    entitled   to\nreimbursement in the larger amount, it intended to pursue only\nits $11,608.86 counterclaim for the period January 25 through\nJuly 4, 1996, since its own oversight had enabled Straughn to\ncontinue to receive full salary after July 4, 1996.\n\n                                      49\n\f</pre>",
