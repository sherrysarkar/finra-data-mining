CLAYTON and\r\n             MARLENE B. CLAYTON,\r\n\n           Petitioners, Appellants,\r\n\n                      v.\r\n\n      COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE,\r\n\n            Respondent, Appellee.\r\n\n        ON APPEAL FROM THE DECISION OF\r\n         THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT\r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n            Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nRosenn* and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nRobert S. Grodberg with whom Zimble &amp; Brettler was on brief\r\nfor appellants.\r\nLaurie Snyder with whom Kenneth L. Greene, Attorneys, Tax\r\nDivision, Department of Justice, and Loretta C. Argrett, Assistant\r\nAttorney General, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 10, 1998\r\n\n     \r\n\n*Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\r\n\nPer Curiam.  The Commissioner assessed a deficiency in\r\nAppellants' return for taxable year 1985.  Appellants sought review\r\nin the Tax Court, which rejected their challenge, and now appeal to\r\nthis court.  Having reviewed Appellants' briefs and heard argument,\r\nwe affirm the decision of the Tax Court substantially for the\r\nreasons set out in its opinion.  Clayton v. Commissioner, 74 T.C.M.\r\n(CCH) 146, T.C.M (RIA) 97,327 (1997).  \r\nWe specifically note that we are unable to find clear\r\nerror in the Tax Court's determination that there was insufficient\r\nevidence to satisfy Appellants' burden of proof regarding the\r\nmailing of the fourth amended return.  The Tax Court was not\r\nobliged to accept taxpayer Mr. Clayton's testimony as determinative\r\nthat the fourth amended return was in fact mailed, given the\r\nevidence of non-delivery, his lack of specificity as to details,\r\nand the other factors noted in the Tax Court's decision and pointed\r\nout in the government's brief.  While the issue was perhaps close,\r\nAppellants have not shown that the Tax Court's finding was clearly\r\nerroneous.  See 26 U.S.C.  7482(a) (providing that Courts of\r\nAppeals review decisions of the Tax Court in the same manner as\r\ndistrict court decisions in non-jury matters); McMurray v.\r\nCommissioner, 985 F.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nIn respect to the other issues Appellants raise, we are\r\nlikewise satisfied that the Tax Court committed neither legal error\r\nnor clear factual error.\r\nAffirmed.\n",
