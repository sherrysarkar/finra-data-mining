Having read carefully  the record in  this\r                           \r\n\ncase,  including the  briefs of  the  parties, we  affirm the\r\n\ndenial of  appellant Orellana's  motion for return  of seized\r\n\nproperty.\r\n\n     Orellana's  sole  claim argued  on  appeal  is that  the\r\n\nadministrative  forfeiture of  money seized  from him  at the\r\n\ntime  of his arrest violated  due process because  he did not\r\n\nreceive  adequate  prior notice  of the  intended forfeiture.\r\n\nHowever, the record indicates  that prior notice was sent  by\r\n\nfirst class mail  to the detention  center in which  Orellana\r\n\nwas  at the  time incarcerated.    Generally, notice  sent by\r\n\nordinary mail to  an address at which  the intended recipient\r\n\nresides  is sufficient  to meet the  requirements of  the due\r\n\nprocess clause.   See Weigner v.  City of New York,  852 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n646  (2d Cir.  1988),  cert. denied,  488  U.S. 1005  (1989).\r                                               \r\n\n\"[T]he  proper  inquiry  is  whether  the [government]  acted\r\n\nreasonably in  selecting the  means likely to  inform persons\r\n\naffected, not whether  each property owner  actually received\r\n\nnotice.\"   Id. at 649; see also  United States v.
