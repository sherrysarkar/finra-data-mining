William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Jonathan Shapiro and Stern, Shapiro, Weissberg &amp; Garin on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, Emily R. Schulman and\r\nAlex Whiting, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nAugust 9, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Edwin Jones appeals from a district\r\ncourt order affirming the magistrate-judge's order of pretrial\r\ndetention.  He also appeals from the district court's failure\r\nto order his release from pretrial detention under 18 U.S.C. \r\n3145(b) (requiring prompt review of detention orders) and \r\n3164 (Speedy Trial Act provisions for pretrial detainees). \r\nJones also argues (for the first time on appeal) that his\r\ncontinued pretrial detention violates due process.\r\n          Jones was indicted, together with six other\r\ndefendants, on charges of conspiring to possess cocaine base\r\nwith intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \r\n841(a)(1) and 846; possessing with intent to distribute cocaine\r\nbase, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.  2;\r\nand money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \r\n1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 2.  A superseding indictment was returned\r\nin this case on June 23, 1999, adding the following two charges\r\nagainst Jones: leading a continuing criminal enterprise that\r\nengaged in the distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21\r\nU.S.C.  848; and being a felon in possession of a firearm and\r\nammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g).\r\n          The government moved to detain Jones under 18 U.S.C.\r\n 3142(f).  A magistrate judge held a hearing on June 4, 1998, \r\nto consider the detention of Jones and three co-defendants\r\n(Jason Gendron, Saul Pereira and Armando Velez).  The evidence\r\npresented at the hearing consisted of testimony and an\r\naffidavit of Terrence O'Connell, a sergeant with the Sandwich,\r\nMassachusetts, Police Department.  O'Connell based his\r\ntestimony and affidavit on his participation in the\r\ninvestigation of a drug trafficking and money laundering\r\norganization allegedly run by Jones.  He also relied upon\r\ninformation provided by other law enforcement officers,\r\nunidentified cooperating witnesses who assisted in the\r\ninvestigation, and confidential informants used to make\r\ncontrolled drug purchases from some of Jones' co-defendants. \r\nAlso submitted into evidence was a photograph of weapons seized\r\nfrom Gendron's home on the date of the arrest of Jones and his\r\nco-defendants.  The defendants did not call any witnesses. \r\nJones' attorney argued, however, that his strong family ties\r\nand limited resources, among other factors, weighed against\r\ngranting the government's motion for pretrial detention.\r\n          The magistrate-judge issued a detailed Memorandum and\r\nOrder dated June 17, 1998, granting the government's motion for\r\npretrial detention as to Jones and Gendron.  The court found\r\nthat there was no condition or combination of conditions of\r\nrelease which would assure 1) Jones' appearance at trial, 2)\r\nthe safety of any person or the community, or 3) that Jones\r\nwould refrain from obstructing justice.  Jones, who was\r\nrepresented by retained counsel at the time, filed a pro se\r\nmotion for review of the detention order on September 10, 1998,\r\nclaiming violation of the Speedy Trial Act. \r\n          A hearing on Jones' motion for review of the\r\ndetention order was eventually held on April 20, 1999, before \r\nJudge Young.  The events that transpired between the filing of\r\nthe motion on September 10, 1998, and the hearing on April 20,\r\n1999, are fully and accurately set forth in Judge Young's\r\nRevised Memorandum, dated June 4, 1999, and we will not\r\nduplicate his efforts here.  At the hearing, the district court\r\nheard arguments by the parties' attorneys but denied the\r\ngovernment's request to submit new evidence.  The district\r\ncourt affirmed Jones' pretrial detention in an order dated May\r\n6, 1999.  It adopted the findings of the magistrate-judge in\r\ndeclining to revoke or amend the detention order.  The district\r\ncourt rejected Jones' argument that he was entitled to release\r\nunder 18 U.S.C.  3145(b) and granted no relief on the basis of\r\nJones' Speedy Trial Act claim.\r\n          I.   Review of Detention Order\r\n          The standard of review for pretrial detention orders\r\nunder 18 U.S.C.  3145(c) is one of independent review, with\r\n\"deference to the determination of the district court.\" United\r\nStates v. O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810, 814 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\n\"Recognizing that appellate courts are ill-equipped to resolve\r\nfactbound disputes, this standard cedes particular respect, as\r\na practical matter, to the lower court's factual\r\ndeterminations.\" United States v. Tortora, 922 F.2d 880, 882-83\r\n(1st Cir. 1990).\r\n          The indictment in this case establishes probable\r\ncause to believe that Jones committed an offense that triggers\r\nthe rebuttable presumption in favor of detention contained in\r\n18 U.S.C.  3142(e).  See United States v. Dillon, 938 F.2d\r\n1412, 1416 (1st Cir. 1991).  The burden of persuasion remains\r\non the government, however, where, as here and in most cases,\r\nthe defendant comes forward with \"some\" contrary evidence.  See\r\nid.  Withal, the presumption retains evidentiary weight. \r\nAccordingly, the magistrate-judge in this case properly weighed\r\nthe presumption in favor of pretrial detention as one of the\r\nfactors to be considered along with those set forth in \r\n3142(g).\r\n          Having thoroughly reviewed the record, including the\r\ntranscript of the detention hearing before the magistrate-\r\njudge, and having carefully considered all of the factors\r\nlisted in  3142(g) as they apply to this case, we conclude\r\nthat the government met its burden of establishing that \"no\r\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\r\nthe appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\r\nother person and the community.\"  3142(e).  We reach this\r\ndecision for essentially the same reasons stated in the\r\nmagistrate-judge's detailed Memorandum and Order, dated June\r\n17, 1998.  We add, however, the following comments in response\r\nto some of the specific points Jones has raised on appeal.\r\n          A. Risk of Flight\r\n          Jones argues that, contrary to the congressional\r\nparadigm underlying the  3142(e) presumption, the drug\r\norganization that he is alleged to have led does not appear to\r\nbe \"highly lucrative.\" United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378,\r\n386 (1st Cir. 1985).  However, both the original and superseding\r\nindictments in this case seek, inter alia, forfeiture of\r\n$365,000 and eight motorcycles and automobiles.  Those charges,\r\ntogether with the large number of defendants in this case,\r\nsuggest a financial base that is not inconsistent with the type\r\nof organization with which Congress was concerned.  The\r\nmagistrate-judge's findings on Jones' use of aliases also\r\nsupport the risk of flight determination.  \r\n          Jones argues that his pretrial release on federal\r\ncharges in 1988, without incident, indicates that he does not\r\npose a risk of flight in this case.  The penal consequences of\r\nthat offense (for which he claims to have been sentenced to two\r\nyears' imprisonment) were not nearly as severe as the possible\r\nlengthy sentence presently facing Jones.  Therefore, the\r\nincentive to flee is that much greater, and Jones' past\r\ncompliance with pretrial release conditions is not\r\ndeterminative here.\r\n          B. Dangerousness\r\n          The  3142(e) presumption continues to weigh in favor\r\nof a finding of danger to the community, even though Jones'\r\nattorney argued at the hearing that his record included no\r\nconvictions for violent offenses.  The magistrate-judge found\r\nthat Jones' prior record included convictions for possession of\r\nClass B and Class D controlled substances, making false\r\nstatements to obtain firearms, and threatening to commit\r\nmurder.  Jones' argument that all of his alleged co-\r\nconspirators have been arrested and therefor he could not\r\ncontinue to deal drugs does not sway us.  We note that,\r\naccording to the O'Connell affidavit, two of the co-defendants\r\nwere on pretrial release for other charges when they engaged in\r\nsome of the drug transactions detailed in the affidavit.\r\n          C. Obstruction of Justice\r\n          The magistrate-judges' findings support the\r\nconclusion that there is \"clear and convincing evidence\" that\r\nthis case involves a serious risk that Jones will attempt to\r\nobstruct justice.  See 18 U.S.C.  3142(f)(2)(B).  The\r\nmagistrate-judge found that Jones had a prior conviction for\r\nthreatening to commit murder.  O'Connell's affidavit related at\r\nleast four threats of violence by Jones, some of which were\r\nallegedly made to discourage co-defendants from speaking to\r\nlaw-enforcement authorities about the activities underlying the\r\npresent charges.  \r\n          Jones' objection to the court's reliance on\r\nstatements of \"unidentified informants about whom there is no\r\nway to determine reliability\" is misplaced in the context of a\r\nbail hearing.  See United States v. Acevedo-Ramos, 755 F.2d\r\n203, 207-09 (1st Cir. 1985).  Even if the threat allegedly \r\nrecounted by Gendron is ignored (as Jones argues it should be\r\nin light of Gendron's affidavit), the evidence was sufficient\r\nfor \"the district court to conclude from defendant's past\r\nbehavior that there is a serious risk that defendant, if\r\nreleased, will attempt to injure or intimidate prospective\r\nwitnesses.\" United States v. Ploof, 851 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir.\r\n1988).\r\n          For the above reasons, as well as the reasons stated\r\nin the Memorandum and Order of the magistrate-judge, we affirm\r\nthe district court's order of pretrial detention with respect\r\nto Jones.        \r\n          II.  Prompt Review,  3145(b)\r\n          A motion for district court review of a magistrate-\r\njudge's order of pretrial detention \"shall be determined\r\npromptly.\" 18 U.S.C.  3145(b).  Jones argues that the district\r\ncourt's failure to abide by this timeliness requirement\r\nmandates his release.  The Bail Reform Act of 1984 \"is silent\r\non the issue of a remedy for its time limits.  Neither the\r\ntiming requirements nor any other part of the Act can be read\r\nto require or even suggest, that a timing error must result in\r\nrelease of a person who should otherwise be detained.\"  United\r\nStates v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, 716 (1990).  Although\r\nMontalvo-Murillo dealt with the requirement for a prompt\r\ninitial hearing under  3142(f), the case for mandating release\r\nfor violation of the prompt review provision of  3145(b) is\r\nless compelling than where the defendant has not yet received\r\neven an initial hearing and decision by a judicial officer.  \r\nThe district court did not err in denying Jones' request for\r\nrelease under  3145(b).\r\n\n                         III. Speedy Trial Act,  3164\r\n          Under 18 U.S.C.  3164, the trial of a person being\r\ndetained solely because he is awaiting trial \"shall commence\r\nnot later than ninety days following the beginning of such\r\ncontinuous detention . . . . The periods of delay enumerated in\r\nsection 3161(h) are excluded in computing the time limitation\r\nspecified in this section.\" 3164(b).  Failure to begin trial\r\nwithin the ninety-day period \"through no fault of the accused\r\nor his counsel\" triggers automatic review by the court of the\r\nconditions of release.  3164(c).  A pretrial detainee shall\r\nnot be held in custody beyond the ninety-day period. Id.\r\n          Jones' pretrial detention commenced on June 17, 1998. \r\nTherefore, if there were no applicable exclusions under \r\n3164(h), Jones would have been entitled to release pending\r\ntrial as of mid-September 1998.  The district court granted a\r\ncontinuance \"in the interest of justice,\" excluding the time\r\nfrom March 10, 1999 (status conference before Judge Young) to\r\nNovember 1, 1999 (scheduled trial date).  At the April 20, 1999\r\nhearing before Judge Young, Jones' attorney explained that his\r\nargument was that the ninety-day period had expired by March\r\n10, 1999.  Jones concedes that the period between the filing of\r\nmotions by Jones on June 23, 1998 and their dipsosition on\r\nSeptember 3, 1998, is exludable under  3161(h)(1)(F). \r\n          The government argues that exclusions under \r\n3161(h)(1)(F) (time during which pretrial motions are pending)\r\nand (h)(7) (reasonable period of delay when defendant is joined\r\ntogether with co-defendant as to whom time for trial has not\r\nyet run) reduce the relevant time lapse for the purposes of \r\n3164 to less than ninety days.  \"A pretrial motion resulting in\r\nexcludable time for one defendant also stops the clock for all\r\ncodefendants.\" United States v. Torres Lopez, 851 F.2d 520, 526\r\n(1st Cir. 1988).  Application of that principle in this case,\r\nwhere the docket sheet lists numerous pretrial motions by the\r\ndefendants, defeats Jones' Speedy Trial Act claim.  \r\n          Jones does not dispute that pendency of the co-\r\ndefendants' motions   if they stopped the clock for Jones  \r\nwould reduce the relevant time lapse to less than ninety days. \r\nInstead, relying on  United States v. Theron, 782 F.2d 1510\r\n(10th Cir. 1986), Jones argues that in the circumstances of the\r\npresent case, the time during which co-defendants' motions were\r\npending should not be excluded.  Jones' reliance on Theron is\r\nmisplaced.  Jones has not requested a severence.  Nor did he\r\naccept the district court's offer (at the April 20, 1999\r\nhearing) to sever the case and try it in May, 1999.  Instead,\r\nJones' attorney indicated that he would need more time to\r\nprepare because he had only recently been appointed. \r\nTherefore, even if this court were prepared to adopt the\r\nholding in Theron (a point that we need not decide), its\r\napplication would not dictate Jones' release under  3164 in\r\nthis case.  The district court did not err in not releasing\r\nJones under the Speedy Trial Act.\r\n\n          IV. Due Process\r\n          Jones argues on appeal that his pretrial detention\r\nfor thirteen months violates his due process rights.  It\r\nappears that Jones did not assert this claim in district court. \r\nTherefore, we will not consider the claim for the first time on\r\nappeal. See United States v. Perez-Franco, 839 F.2d 867, 871\r\n(1st Cir. 1988).   \r\n          The orders appealed from are affirmed.\r\n",

Risk of Flight\r\n          Jones argues that, contrary to the congressional\r\nparadigm underlying the  3142(e) presumption, the drug\r\norganization that he is alleged to have led does not appear to\r\nbe \"highly lucrative.\" United States v. Jessup, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449455\"><a href=\"/opinion/449455/united-states-v-mark-jessup/\"><span class=\"volume\">757</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n386 (1st Cir. 1985).  However, both the original and superseding\r\nindictments in this case seek, inter alia, forfeiture of\r\n$365,000 and eight motorcycles and automobiles.  Those charges,\r\ntogether with the large number of defendants in this case,\r\nsuggest a financial base that is not inconsistent with the type\r\nof organization with which Congress was concerned.  The\r\nmagistrate-judge's findings on Jones' use of aliases also\r\nsupport the risk of flight determination.  \r\n          Jones argues that his pretrial release on federal\r\ncharges in 1988, without incident, indicates that he does not\r\npose a risk of flight in this case.  The penal consequences of\r\nthat offense (for which he claims to have been sentenced to two\r\nyears' imprisonment) were not nearly as severe as the possible\r\nlengthy sentence presently facing Jones.  Therefore, the\r\nincentive to flee is that much greater, and Jones' past\r\ncompliance with pretrial release conditions is not\r\ndeterminative here.\r\n          B. Dangerousness\r\n          The  3142(e) presumption continues to weigh in favor\r\nof a finding of danger to the community, even though Jones'\r\nattorney argued at the hearing that his record included no\r\nconvictions for violent offenses.  The magistrate-judge found\r\nthat Jones' prior record included convictions for possession of\r\nClass B and Class D controlled substances, making false\r\nstatements to obtain firearms, and threatening to commit\r\nmurder.  Jones' argument that all of his alleged co-\r\nconspirators have been arrested and therefor he could not\r\ncontinue to deal drugs does not sway us.  We note that,\r\naccording to the O'Connell affidavit, two of the co-defendants\r\nwere on pretrial release for other charges when they engaged in\r\nsome of the drug transactions detailed in the affidavit.\r\n          C. Obstruction of Justice\r\n          The magistrate-judges' findings support the\r\nconclusion that there is \"clear and convincing evidence\" that\r\nthis case involves a serious risk that Jones will attempt to\r\nobstruct justice.  See 18 U.S.C.  3142(f)(2)(B).  The\r\nmagistrate-judge found that Jones had a prior conviction for\r\nthreatening to commit murder.  O'Connell's affidavit related at\r\nleast four threats of violence by Jones, some of which were\r\nallegedly made to discourage co-defendants from speaking to\r\nlaw-enforcement authorities about the activities underlying the\r\npresent charges.  \r\n          Jones' objection to the court's reliance on\r\nstatements of \"unidentified informants about whom there is no\r\nway to determine reliability\" is misplaced in the context of a\r\nbail hearing.  See United States v. Acevedo-Ramos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448140\"><a href=\"/opinion/448140/united-states-v-hector-acevedo-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207-09 (1st Cir. 1985).  Even if the threat allegedly \r\nrecounted by Gendron is ignored (as Jones argues it should be\r\nin light of Gendron's affidavit), the evidence was sufficient\r\nfor \"the district court to conclude from defendant's past\r\nbehavior that there is a serious risk that defendant, if\r\nreleased, will attempt to injure or intimidate prospective\r\nwitnesses.\" United States v. Ploof, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508508\"><a href=\"/opinion/508508/united-states-v-roger-r-ploof-aka-george-godin/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir.\r\n1988).\r\n          For the above reasons, as well as the reasons stated\r\nin the Memorandum and Order of the magistrate-judge, we affirm\r\nthe district court's order of pretrial detention with respect\r\nto Jones.        \r\n          II.  Prompt Review,  3145(b)\r\n          A motion for district court review of a magistrate-\r\njudge's order of pretrial detention \"shall be determined\r\npromptly.\" 18 U.S.C.  3145(b).  Jones argues that the district\r\ncourt's failure to abide by this timeliness requirement\r\nmandates his release.  The Bail Reform Act of 1984 \"is silent\r\non the issue of a remedy for its time limits.  Neither the\r\ntiming requirements nor any other part of the Act can be read\r\nto require or even suggest, that a timing error must result in\r\nrelease of a person who should otherwise be detained.\"  United\r\nStates v. Montalvo-Murillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112440\"><a href=\"/opinion/112440/united-states-v-montalvo-murillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716 (1990).  Although\r\nMontalvo-Murillo dealt with the requirement for a prompt\r\ninitial hearing under  3142(f), the case for mandating release\r\nfor violation of the prompt review provision of  3145(b) is\r\nless compelling than where the defendant has not yet received\r\neven an initial hearing and decision by a judicial officer.  \r\nThe district court did not err in denying Jones' request for\r\nrelease under  3145(b).\r\n\n                         III. Speedy Trial Act,  3164\r\n          Under 18 U.S.C.  3164, the trial of a person being\r\ndetained solely because he is awaiting trial \"shall commence\r\nnot later than ninety days following the beginning of such\r\ncontinuous detention . . . . The periods of delay enumerated in\r\nsection 3161(h) are excluded in computing the time limitation\r\nspecified in this section.\" 3164(b).  Failure to begin trial\r\nwithin the ninety-day period \"through no fault of the accused\r\nor his counsel\" triggers automatic review by the court of the\r\nconditions of release.  3164(c).  A pretrial detainee shall\r\nnot be held in custody beyond the ninety-day period. Id.\r\n          Jones' pretrial detention commenced on June 17, 1998. \r\nTherefore, if there were no applicable exclusions under \r\n3164(h), Jones would have been entitled to release pending\r\ntrial as of mid-September 1998.  The district court granted a\r\ncontinuance \"in the interest of justice,\" excluding the time\r\nfrom March 10, 1999 (status conference before Judge Young) to\r\nNovember 1, 1999 (scheduled trial date).  At the April 20, 1999\r\nhearing before Judge Young, Jones' attorney explained that his\r\nargument was that the ninety-day period had expired by March\r\n10, 1999.  Jones concedes that the period between the filing of\r\nmotions by Jones on June 23, 1998 and their dipsosition on\r\nSeptember 3, 1998, is exludable under  3161(h)(1)(F). \r\n          The government argues that exclusions under \r\n3161(h)(1)(F) (time during which pretrial motions are pending)\r\nand (h)(7) (reasonable period of delay when defendant is joined\r\ntogether with co-defendant as to whom time for trial has not\r\nyet run) reduce the relevant time lapse for the purposes of \r\n3164 to less than ninety days.  \"A pretrial motion resulting in\r\nexcludable time for one defendant also stops the clock for all\r\ncodefendants.\" United States v. Torres Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508721\"><a href=\"/opinion/508721/united-states-v-angel-torres-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526\r\n(1st Cir. 1988).  Application of that principle in this case,\r\nwhere the docket sheet lists numerous pretrial motions by the\r\ndefendants, defeats Jones' Speedy Trial Act claim.  \r\n          Jones does not dispute that pendency of the co-\r\ndefendants' motions   if they stopped the clock for Jones  \r\nwould reduce the relevant time lapse to less than ninety days. \r\nInstead, relying on  United States v. Theron, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"464679\"><a href=\"/opinion/464679/united-states-v-frans-j-theron-frans-j-theron-v-honorable-earl-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">782</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(10th Cir. 1986), Jones argues that in the circumstances of the\r\npresent case, the time during which co-defendants' motions were\r\npending should not be excluded.  Jones' reliance on Theron is\r\nmisplaced.  Jones has not requested a severence.  Nor did he\r\naccept the district court's offer (at the April 20, 1999\r\nhearing) to sever the case and try it in May, 1999.  Instead,\r\nJones' attorney indicated that he would need more time to\r\nprepare because he had only recently been appointed. \r\nTherefore, even if this court were prepared to adopt the\r\nholding in Theron (a point that we need not decide), its\r\napplication would not dictate Jones' release under  3164 in\r\nthis case.  The district court did not err in not releasing\r\nJones under the Speedy Trial Act.\r\n\n          IV. Due Process\r\n          Jones argues on appeal that his pretrial detention\r\nfor thirteen months violates his due process rights.  It\r\nappears that Jones did not assert this claim in district court. \r\nTherefore, we will not consider the claim for the first time on\r\nappeal. See United States v. Perez-Franco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501809\"><a href=\"/opinion/501809/united-states-v-jose-rafael-perez-franco-united-states-v-jose-luis/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871\r\n(1st Cir. 1988).   \r\n          The orders appealed from are affirmed.\r\n</pre>",
