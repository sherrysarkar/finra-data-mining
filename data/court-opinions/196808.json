BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  indictment in this  case arises out  of an aborted\r\n\ndrug smuggle  that took the appellant by  sea from Puerto Rico to\r\n\nthe  island   of  St.  Maarten  in   the  Netherlands  Antilles.1\r\n\nAccording  to the appellant's  uncontradicted allegations, Victor\r\n\nAyala,   an  agent   of  the   United  States   Drug  Enforcement\r\n\nAdministration  (DEA), followed  the LEE  MARY (captained  by the\r\n\nappellant)  to St. Maarten in August 1990, and then surveilled it\r\n\nfor two days.   At  this juncture Dutch  authorities boarded  the\r\n\nship, searched  her, seized  seventy-three kilograms  of cocaine,\r\n\nand detained several  persons.  The appellant alleges  that Ayala\r\n\njoined in the  search, but  the United States  maintains that  he\r\n\nmerely observed it  from his surveillance post.  At  any rate, it\r\n\nis  undisputed that after the search had begun Ayala informed the\r\n\nDutch  authorities of  Guzman's  involvement.   Local police  ran\r\n\nGuzman to ground nearby and arrested him.\r\n\n          The  Dutch  government  charged  Guzman  with  a  crime\r\n\ninvolving possession  of the  cocaine stashed  on  board the  LEE\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Further details of the  failed drug-smuggling operation can\r\nbe  found in our opinion  in United States  v. LaBoy-Delgado,    \r                                                                      \r\nF.3d     (1st Cir. 1996) [No. 95-1863].\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nMARY.  He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to a ten-year  term\r\n\nof  immurement  in  St. Maarten.    He  escaped in  May  of 1992.\r\n\nApproximately  seven months later the DEA  arrested him in Puerto\r\n\nRico when he  attempted to  sell heroin to  an undercover  agent.\r\n\nAfter being  found guilty of that  crime he was sentenced  to 147\r\n\nmonths' imprisonment.\r\n\n          The appellant's troubles were  not yet behind him:   in\r\n\nNovember  of 1993,  federal authorities  in Puerto  Rico indicted\r\n\nseveral individuals (including Guzman)  for the attempted smuggle\r\n\nthat had occurred in the summer of 1990.  The charges against the\r\n\nappellant   included  conspiring  to   possess,  with  intent  to\r\n\ndistribute, in excess of five kilograms of cocaine, see 21 U.S.C.\r                                                                 \r\n\n    841(a)(1) &amp; 846; attempting to import cocaine into the United\r\n\nStates, see id.    952,  960, &amp; 963; and aiding and  abetting the\r                         \r\n\ncommission of certain charged offenses, see 18 U.S.C.   2.\r                                                     \r\n\n          In  due season  the  district court  denied motions  to\r\n\ndismiss  the  indictment  which  posited, inter  alia,  that  the\r                                                               \r\n\nbringing  of charges  violated the  Double Jeopardy  Clause, U.S.\r\n\nConst.  amend. V,  cl.2,  and that  the  delay in  procuring  the\r\n\nindictment countervailed the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C.    3161-\r\n\n3174.   Rather  than entrust  his fate  to a jury,  the appellant\r\n\nentered into  a plea  agreement with  the government pursuant  to\r\n\nwhich he pleaded guilty  to possession of cocaine with  intent to\r\n\ndistribute.  All  other charges  against him were  dropped.   The\r\n\ndistrict court imposed  a sentence of  seventy months in  prison,\r\n\ndirecting that the term run consecutive to the previously imposed\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nheroin-trafficking sentence.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          In addition  to the double  jeopardy claim    which has\r\n\nbeen extensively  briefed by Guzman's appellate  counsel   Guzman\r\n\nhimself   advances  four   other  assignments   of  error   in  a\r\n\nsupplemental pro se brief.  We address all five claims.\r\n\n                       A.  Double Jeopardy.\r                                 A.  Double Jeopardy.\r                                                    \r\n\n          The appellant  contends that the offense  of conviction\r\n\nin this  case and the offense  for which he was  convicted in St.\r\n\nMaarten  are one  and the same,  thus triggering  double jeopardy\r\n\nconcerns.    Even  though  both  cases  involve  the  appellant's\r\n\npossession  of  the  identical  seventy-three  kilos  of cocaine,\r\n\ndestined for importation  into the United States via St. Maarten,\r\n\na towering obstacle looms:  the two sets  of charges were brought\r\n\nby  different  governments.     The  black-letter  rule  is  that\r\n\nprosecutions  undertaken  by separate  sovereign  governments, no\r\n\nmatter how  similar they may  be in character,  do not  raise the\r\n\nspecter  of double  jeopardy as  that constitutional  doctrine is\r\n\ncommonly  understood.   See  Heath v.  Alabama,  474 U.S.  82, 88\r                                                        \r\n\n(1985); United States v.  Lopez Andino, 831 F.2d 1164,  1167 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1987), cert.  denied,  486 U.S.  1034  (1988).   This  rule\r                                    \r\n\nderives from the  tenet that when  \"a defendant  in a single  act\r\n\nviolates  the `peace and  dignity' of two  sovereigns by breaking\r\n\nthe laws of each,  he has committed two distinct  `offences'\" and\r\n\ncan be prosecuted and punished for both.  Heath, 474 U.S. at 88.\r                                                         \r\n\n          The  appellant concedes  the  general validity  of this\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n\"dual sovereign\" rule, and recognizes that, if applicable in this\r\n\ninstance,  it  shields  the  United States  from  the  successive\r\n\nprosecution  prong of  the  Double Jeopardy  Clause.   He  argues\r\n\nnonetheless  that  the shield  is  unavailable  here because  the\r\n\nUnited   States   government   orchestrated   the   St.   Maarten\r\n\ninvestigation  and superintended  the  ensuing prosecution,  thus\r\n\neffectively  merging  the  two  sovereigns into  one  for  double\r\n\njeopardy purposes.\r\n\n          The argument is not entirely without basis.  In Bartkus\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Illinois,  359 U.S.  121,  131-33 (1959),  the  Supreme Court\r                      \r\n\nupheld the second of two convictions of  a defendant who had been\r\n\nprosecuted by two sovereigns   the federal government and a state\r\n\n  for the same conduct.  The Court indicated, however, that under\r\n\nvery  limited circumstances  successive prosecutions  by separate\r\n\nsovereigns might  transgress the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat  123-24.   Bartkus was  not such  a case  because, there,  the\r                               \r\n\nrecord did\r\n\n          not  support  the  claim  that  the State  of\r\n          Illinois  in  bringing  its  prosecution  was\r\n          merely a tool of the federal authorities, who\r\n          thereby avoided the  prohibition of the Fifth\r\n          Amendment  against  a  retrial  of  a federal\r\n          prosecution after an acquittal.   It does not\r\n          sustain   a   conclusion   that   the   state\r\n          prosecution  was a  sham  and a  cover for  a\r\n          federal prosecution, and thereby in essential\r\n          fact another federal prosecution.\r\n\nId.\r             \r\n\n          This   language   strongly  suggests   that  defendants\r\n\nprosecuted by two sovereign governments for the same  conduct may\r\n\non  occasion be able to invoke double jeopardy protection.  While\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nsome courts have brushed aside this language as dictum and hinted\r\n\nthat the Bartkus  exception to  the dual sovereign  rule may  not\r                          \r\n\nexist at all, see United States v. Paiz, 905 F.2d 1014, 1024 n.13\r                                                 \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 924 (1991); United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

To hold  otherwise would,  of\r\n\ncourse,  result in a mockery of the dual sovereignty concept that\r\n\nunderlies our system of criminal justice.\").\r\n\n          We emphasize that the Bartkus exception  is narrow.

Under  this matrix,  the\r\n\ndefendant must  proffer evidence sufficient to  establish a prima\r\n\nfacie case that the  two prosecutions were for the  same offense.\r\n\nIf  the  defendant  meets his  entry-level  burden  by  making an\r\n\nadequate  evidentiary  showing  to  that effect,  the  devoir  of\r\n\npersuasion  shifts to the  government to prove  that the offenses\r\n\nare not identical.2   See United States v.

Thus, the  defendant must produce some evidence\r\n\ntending  to  prove that  the rule  should  not apply  because one\r\n\nsovereign  was  a pawn  of the  other, with  the result  that the\r\n\nnotion  of two  supposedly independent  prosecutions is  merely a\r\n\nsham.   If the defendant  proffers evidence sufficient to support\r\n\nsuch a finding   in  effect, a prima facie case    the government\r\n\nmust  shoulder the burden of  proving that one  sovereign did not\r\n\norchestrate  both prosecutions,  or,  put another  way, that  one\r\n\nsovereign was  not a tool of the other.  See, e.g., United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Nothing in  the appellant's\r\n\nproffer remotely suggests that  the Dutch authorities were merely\r\n\nhandmaidens  of  the DEA  or that  the  Dutch prosecution  was in\r\n\nreality a prosecution  undertaken sub rosa  by the United  States\r                                                    \r\n\ngovernment.  Even  if all  the appellant's facts    stripped,  of\r\n\ncourse, of opprobrious epithets and unsupported conclusions   are\r\n\ntaken  at  face value,  those facts  show  nothing more  than the\r\n\nrendering  of routine intergovernmental  assistance.  Cooperative\r\n\nlaw  enforcement  efforts   between  independent  sovereigns  are\r\n\ncommendable, and, without more,  such efforts will not  furnish a\r\n\nlegally  adequate basis for invoking the Bartkus exception to the\r                                                          \r\n\ndual sovereign rule.

Consequently,  the district  court  did not  err  in\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1108  (1983); Mallah, 503  F.2d at 986 (same).

See United States  v. Staula,\r                                                                          \r\n\n80  F.3d  596,  600  (1st  Cir.  1996).    Juxtaposed  with  this\r\n\nrequirement  is the  requirement that,  once arrested,  a suspect\r\n\nmust be indicted or otherwise formally charged within thirty days\r\n\nof his  arrest.  See 18 U.S.C.   3161(b).  The appellant suggests\r                              \r\n\ntwo reasons why the  government's actions in this case  run afoul\r\n\nof this latter proscription.  Neither reason is persuasive.\r\n\n          1.  The first iteration of the appellant's speedy trial\r                    1.\r\n\nclaim embodies  a repullulation of his  double jeopardy analysis.\r\n\nHe  asseverates that  since  the United  States orchestrated  his\r\n\narrest  in St. Maarten, 18  U.S.C.   3161(b)  required the United\r\n\nStates  to indict  him within thirty  days of that  arrest.  This\r\n\nasseveration elevates hope  over reason, and  we need not  linger\r\n\nlong in dispatching it.\r\n\n          The Speedy  Trial Act, in  terms, applies  only to  the\r\n\nconduct of the United States.  Because  we already have held that\r\n\nthe  United States did  not control, dominate,  or manipulate the\r\n\nactions of  the Dutch authorities  in respect to  Guzman's arrest\r\n\nand prosecution in St.  Maarten, see supra Part II(A),  the claim\r                                                    \r\n\nthat  the date of that arrest affected the movement of the speedy\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\ntrial  clock in  this  case is  without  foundation.   Arrest  or\r\n\nindictment  by  one  sovereign  does  not  engage  the  statutory\r\n\nguarantee of a speedy trial in respect to a subsequent indictment\r\n\nby  a different sovereign.   See United States  v. MacDonald, 456\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 1, 10 n.11 (1982).\r\n\n          2.   The  second  iteration of  the appellant's  speedy\r                    2.\r\n\ntrial claim takes a  somewhat divergent slant.  He  asserts that,\r\n\nwhen he was arrested  in Puerto Rico for heroin  trafficking, the\r\n\nUnited States  knew of  his 1990  involvement with  the ill-fated\r\n\ncocaine smuggle and, hence, the government was obliged to  charge\r\n\nhim within thirty days  of that arrest, see 18 U.S.C.    3161(b),\r                                                     \r\n\nor in  the alternative,  to seek a  detainer from  the Bureau  of\r\n\nPrisons  (which  had  custody of  him  at  the time),  see  id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n3161(j)(1).  This assertion is equally devoid of merit.\r\n\n          In the  first place, the Speedy Trial Act requires that\r\n\na person  arrested for a crime  must be charged by  indictment or\r\n\ninformation  within thirty days of his arrest \"in connection with\r\n\nsuch charges.\"   Id.   3161(b).   In this  situation, the heroin-\r                              \r\n\ntrafficking incident  that led  to the appellant's  December 1992\r\n\narrest  had no connection with  his activity in  St. Maarten two-\r\n\nand-one-half years  earlier.   It follows, therefore,  that since\r\n\nthe authorities did not arrest the appellant  in 1992 for a crime\r\n\nrelated to his St. Maarten conduct, the Speedy Trial Act did  not\r\n\nrequire  that  he be  charged  with  the cocaine-smuggling  crime\r\n\nwithin thirty days of that arrest.  See  United States v. Orbino,\r                                                                          \r\n\n981  F.2d 1035, 1036-37 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 114 S.

Until  it brought  such a\r\n\ncharge,  the government had no obligation to file a detainer with\r\n\nthe Bureau of Prisons.4\r\n\n                       C.

He tells  us that  the U.S.  Attorney's office\r\n\npromised it would  not oppose a  recommendation for a  concurrent\r\n\nsentence, but  the prosecutor  instead argued successfully  for a\r\n\nconsecutive sentence.\r\n\n          This  contention  is  baseless.5   The  plea  agreement\r\n\nsigned   by   the   appellant   specifically,   explicitly,   and\r\n\nunambiguously states:  \"The United States and the defendant agree\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4To cinch matters, the law is pellucid that the dismissal of\r\nan  indictment is  not a suitable  remedy for  a violation  of 18\r\nU.S.C.   3161(j)(1).

The question  of procedural  default vis-a-vis\r\nclaims involving breached plea  agreements has divided the courts\r\nof  appeals.  See United States v. Gonzalez-Perdomo, 980 F.2d 13,\r                                                             \r\n15-16 (1st Cir. 1992) (collecting cases).  We need not enter this\r\nthicket  today because we find the appellant's claim of breach to\r\nbe without basis.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nthat   the  sentence  to  be  imposed  in  this  case  shall  run\r\n\nconsecutive  to  any  other  sentence of  imprisonment  that  the\r\n\ndefendant  is  currently  serving.\"    The  plea  agreement  also\r\n\ncontains  an integration  clause  that provides:   \"This  written\r\n\nagreement  constitutes the  complete  plea agreement  between the\r\n\nUnited States, the defendant,  and the defendant's counsel.   The\r\n\nUnited States has made  no promises or representations  except as\r\n\nset  forth in writing in this plea agreement.\"  The questionnaire\r\n\nthat  the appellant  completed in  advance of  the change-of-plea\r\n\ncolloquy  is  consistent   with  these   understandings.6     The\r\n\nappellant has made no allegation that he was coerced into signing\r\n\nthe  plea agreement, that  he was misled  as to its  contents, or\r\n\nthat the questionnaire is bogus.\r\n\n          In short, the appellant  identifies nothing that  would\r\n\njustify  an  objectively  reasonable expectation  that  the  plea\r\n\nagreement  meant anything other than what it plainly says.  Since\r\n\nthe  government  abided faithfully  by  the  clear  terms of  its\r\n\nwritten agreement, we have  no warrant to set aside  the sentence\r\n\nimposed by the  district court.

He  also  claimed entitlement  to a  tool box,\r\n\ntogether with its contents, alleging that the tool box was inside\r\n\na  car, belonging to his sister,  that federal authorities seized\r\n\nin  Puerto  Rico.   The district  court  found that  the property\r\n\nseized in St. Maarten was  taken not by the United States  but by\r\n\nthe Netherlands  Antilles, and that, therefore,  the court lacked\r\n\njurisdiction to order its  return.8  However, the  district court\r\n\ndid not rule on the appellant's motion insofar as it pertained to\r\n\nthe  tool  box's confiscation.   The  appellant  did not  ask for\r\n\nreconsideration  based  on  this  oversight.     He  nevertheless\r\n\nattempts  to appeal from the  court's failure to  direct that the\r\n\ntool box be returned.\r\n\n          The  government's brief  misses the  appellant's point.\r\n\nIt  contends,  correctly,  that  Guzman  never  made a  claim  of\r\n\nownership referable to the  car, and thus does not  have standing\r\n\nto contest its seizure.

But this\r                        \r\n\nobservation does not  in any way trump the appellant's insistence\r\n\nthat he owns,  and is entitled to the return of, the tool box and\r\n\nits contents.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8On appeal,  the appellant  does not challenge  this ruling,\r\nand we do not address it.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n          Although  the  appellant's  point is  arguable,  it  is\r\n\nseparable  from,   and  has  no  effect   upon,  the  appellant's\r\n\nconviction and  sentence.

Since such a complaint serves as the\r\n\nfunctional equivalent of a Rule 41(e) motion, we perceive no need\r\n\nto prolong this  case in order to pursue the point (especially in\r\n\nview of the  fact that  the district  court made  no findings  in\r\n\nregard to the tool box).

Discerning neither a constitutional flaw nor any other significant error, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment in this case arises out of an aborted drug smuggle that took the appellant by sea from Puerto Rico to the island of St. Maarten in the Netherlands Antilles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  According to the appellant's uncontradicted allegations, Victor Ayala, an agent of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), followed the LEE MARY (captained by the appellant) to St. Maarten in August 1990, and then surveilled it for two days.   At this juncture Dutch authorities boarded the ship, searched her, seized seventy-three kilograms of cocaine, and detained several persons.   The appellant alleges that Ayala joined in the search, but the United States maintains that he merely observed it from his surveillance post.   At any rate, it is undisputed that after the search had begun Ayala informed the Dutch authorities of Guzman's involvement.   Local police ran Guzman to ground nearby and arrested him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dutch government charged Guzman with a crime involving possession of the cocaine stashed on board the LEE MARY.   He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to a ten-year term of immurement in St. Maarten.   He escaped in May of 1992.   Approximately seven months later the DEA arrested him in Puerto Rico when he attempted to sell heroin to an undercover agent.   After being found guilty of that crime he was sentenced to 147 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's troubles were not yet behind him:  in November of 1993, federal authorities in Puerto Rico indicted several individuals (including Guzman) for the attempted smuggle that had occurred in the summer of 1990.   The charges against the appellant included conspiring to possess, with intent to distribute, in excess of five kilograms of cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846;  attempting to import cocaine into the United States, see id. &#167;&#167; 952, 960, &amp; 963;  and aiding and abetting the commission of certain charged offenses, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season the district court denied motions to dismiss the indictment which posited, inter alia, that the bringing of charges violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend.  V, cl.2, and that the delay in procuring the indictment countervailed the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161-3174.   Rather than entrust his fate to a jury, the appellant entered into a plea agreement with the government pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.   All other charges against him were dropped.   The district court imposed a sentence of seventy months in prison, directing that the term run consecutive to the previously imposed heroin-trafficking sentence.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the double jeopardy claim--which has been extensively briefed by Guzman's appellate counsel--Guzman himself advances four other assignments of error in a supplemental pro se brief.   We address all five claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A. Double Jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that the offense of conviction in this case and the offense for which he was convicted in St. Maarten are one and the same, thus triggering double jeopardy concerns.   Even though both cases involve the appellant's possession of the identical seventy-three kilos of cocaine, destined for importation into the United States via St. Maarten, a towering obstacle looms:  the two sets of charges were brought by different governments.   The black-letter rule is that prosecutions undertaken by separate sovereign governments, no matter how similar they may be in character, do not raise the specter of double jeopardy as that constitutional doctrine is commonly understood.   See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 88, 106 S.Ct. 433, 437, 88 L.Ed.2d 387 (1985);  United States v. Lopez Andino, 831 F.2d 1164, 1167 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1034, 108 S.Ct. 2018, 100 L.Ed.2d 605 (1988).   This rule derives from the tenet that when \"a defendant in a single act violates the 'peace and dignity' of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct 'offences' \" and can be prosecuted and punished for both.  Heath, 474 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 437.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant concedes the general validity of this \"dual sovereign\" rule, and recognizes that, if applicable in this instance, it shields the United States from the successive prosecution prong of the Double Jeopardy Clause.   He argues nonetheless that the shield is unavailable here because the United States government orchestrated the St. Maarten investigation and superintended the ensuing prosecution, thus effectively merging the two sovereigns into one for double jeopardy purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument is not entirely without basis.   In Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 131-33, 79 S.Ct. 676, 683-84, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959), the Supreme Court upheld the second of two convictions of a defendant who had been prosecuted by two sovereigns--the federal government and a state--for the same conduct.   The Court indicated, however, that under very limited circumstances successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns might transgress the Double Jeopardy Clause.   See id. at 123-24, 79 S.Ct. at 678-79.   Bartkus was not such a case because, there, the record did</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>not support the claim that the State of Illinois in bringing its prosecution was merely a tool of the federal authorities, who thereby avoided the prohibition of the Fifth Amendment against a retrial of a federal prosecution after an acquittal.   It does not sustain a conclusion that the state prosecution was a sham and a cover for a federal prosecution, and thereby in essential fact another federal prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This language strongly suggests that defendants prosecuted by two sovereign governments for the same conduct may on occasion be able to invoke double jeopardy protection.   While some courts have brushed aside this language as dictum and hinted that the Bartkus exception to the dual sovereign rule may not exist at all, see United States v. Paiz, 905 F.2d 1014, 1024 n. 13 (7th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 924, 111 S.Ct. 1319, 113 L.Ed.2d 252 (1991);  United States v. Patterson, 809 F.2d 244, 247 n. 2 (5th Cir.1987), most courts have treated the Bartkus intimation as good law.   See, e.g., United States v. Certain Real Property and Premises Known as 38 Whalers Cove Dr., 954 F.2d 29, 38 (2d Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 815, 113 S.Ct. 55, 121 L.Ed.2d 24 (1992);  United States v. Raymer, 941 F.2d 1031, 1037 (10th Cir.1991);  United States v. Louisville Edible Oil Prods., Inc., 926 F.2d 584, 587-88 (6th Cir.1991);  In re Kunstler, 914 F.2d 505, 517 (4th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 969, 111 S.Ct. 1607, 113 L.Ed.2d 669 (1991);  United States v. Bernhardt, 831 F.2d 181, 182-83 (9th Cir.1987);  United States v. Lane, 891 F.Supp. 8, 10 (D.Me.1995);  United States v. Bouthot, 685 F.Supp. 286, 294 (D.Mass.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the gravitational pull of Bartkus irresistible.   Indeed, we think that the exception is compelled by the bedrock principles of dual sovereignty.   See United States v. Liddy, 542 F.2d 76, 79 (D.C.Cir.1976) (\"Bartkus, as we view it, stands for the proposition that federal authorities are proscribed from manipulating state processes to accomplish that which they cannot constitutionally do themselves.   To hold otherwise would, of course, result in a mockery of the dual sovereignty concept that underlies our system of criminal justice.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that the Bartkus exception is narrow.   It is limited to situations in which one sovereign so thoroughly dominates or manipulates the prosecutorial machinery of another that the latter retains little or no volition in its own proceedings.   See, e.g., United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, 17 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.1994);  Whalers Cove, 954 F.2d at 38;  Raymer, 941 F.2d at 1037;  Kunstler, 914 F.2d at 517;  Liddy, 542 F.2d at 79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts have suggested that a defendant who seeks shelter under the Bartkus exception bears the burden of proving that one sovereign dominated the other's acts.   See, e.g., Raymer, 941 F.2d at 1037;  Liddy, 542 F.2d at 79.   Nevertheless, this court has erected a framework that dictates a somewhat different allocation of the burden.   Under this matrix, the defendant must proffer evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case that the two prosecutions were for the same offense.   If the defendant meets his entry-level burden by making an adequate evidentiary showing to that effect, the devoir of persuasion shifts to the government to prove that the offenses are not identical.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 229 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1030, 110 S.Ct. 742, 107 L.Ed.2d 760 (1990);  United States v. Booth, 673 F.2d 27, 30-31 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 978, 102 S.Ct. 2245, 72 L.Ed.2d 853 (1982);  see also United States v. Schinnell, 80 F.3d 1064, 1066 (5th Cir.1996) (employing same paradigm);  United States v. Inmon, 568 F.2d 326, 331-32 (3d Cir.1977) (same);  United States v. Mallah, 503 F.2d 971, 986 (2d Cir.1974) (same), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 995, 95 S.Ct. 1425, 43 L.Ed.2d 671 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Bartkus context, the question whether a defendant is being twice prosecuted for the same offense turns in part on the applicability of the dual sovereign rule.   See Heath, 474 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 437.   Thus, the defendant must produce some evidence tending to prove that the rule should not apply because one sovereign was a pawn of the other, with the result that the notion of two supposedly independent prosecutions is merely a sham.   If the defendant proffers evidence sufficient to support such a finding--in effect, a prima facie case--the government must shoulder the burden of proving that one sovereign did not orchestrate both prosecutions, or, put another way, that one sovereign was not a tool of the other.   See, e.g., United States v. Harrison, 918 F.2d 469, 475 (5th Cir.1990) (applying burden-shifting matrix in the Bartkus context).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, it is crystal clear that the appellant did not offer enough evidence to carry his entry-level burden.   Factually, his claim comes down to this:  he asserts that Agent Ayala traveled to St. Maarten, surveilled the LEE MARY, alerted the St. Maarten police to the appellant's presence, participated in the shipboard search (a fact that the United States contests), and testified at the ensuing trial.   Nothing in the appellant's proffer remotely suggests that the Dutch authorities were merely handmaidens of the DEA or that the Dutch prosecution was in reality a prosecution undertaken sub rosa by the United States government.   Even if all the appellant's facts--stripped, of course, of opprobrious epithets and unsupported conclusions--are taken at face value, those facts show nothing more than the rendering of routine intergovernmental assistance.   Cooperative law enforcement efforts between independent sovereigns are commendable, and, without more, such efforts will not furnish a legally adequate basis for invoking the Bartkus exception to the dual sovereign rule.   See Whalers Cove, 954 F.2d at 38;  Paiz, 905 F.2d at 1024.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this legal and factual mise en scene, the indictment in this case did not constitute a second prosecution for the same offense within the purview of the Fifth Amendment.   Consequently, the district court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>B. Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The baseline premise of the Speedy Trial Act is the requirement that a defendant has a right to be tried promptly following his indictment or initial appearance before a judicial officer (whichever first occurs).   See United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 600 (1st Cir.1996).   Juxtaposed with this requirement is the requirement that, once arrested, a suspect must be indicted or otherwise formally charged within thirty days of his arrest.   See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b).   The appellant suggests two reasons why the government's actions in this case run afoul of this latter proscription.   Neither reason is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The first iteration of the appellant's speedy trial claim embodies a repullulation of his double jeopardy analysis.   He asseverates that since the United States orchestrated his arrest in St. Maarten, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b) required the United States to indict him within thirty days of that arrest.   This asseveration elevates hope over reason, and we need not linger long in dispatching it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Speedy Trial Act, in terms, applies only to the conduct of the United States.   Because we already have held that the United States did not control, dominate, or manipulate the actions of the Dutch authorities in respect to Guzman's arrest and prosecution in St. Maarten, see supra Part II(A), the claim that the date of that arrest affected the movement of the speedy trial clock in this case is without foundation.   Arrest or indictment by one sovereign does not engage the statutory guarantee of a speedy trial in respect to a subsequent indictment by a different sovereign.   See United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 10 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 1503 n. 11, 71 L.Ed.2d 696 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The second iteration of the appellant's speedy trial claim takes a somewhat divergent slant.   He asserts that, when he was arrested in Puerto Rico for heroin trafficking, the United States knew of his 1990 involvement with the ill-fated cocaine smuggle and, hence, the government was obliged to charge him within thirty days of that arrest, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b), or in the alternative, to seek a detainer from the Bureau of Prisons (which had custody of him at the time), see id. &#167; 3161(j)(1).   This assertion is equally devoid of merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a person arrested for a crime must be charged by indictment or information within thirty days of his arrest \"in connection with such charges.\"   Id. &#167; 3161(b).   In this situation, the heroin-trafficking incident that led to the appellant's December 1992 arrest had no connection with his activity in St. Maarten two-and-one-half years earlier.   It follows, therefore, that since the authorities did not arrest the appellant in 1992 for a crime related to his St. Maarten conduct, the Speedy Trial Act did not require that he be charged with the cocaine-smuggling crime within thirty days of that arrest.   See United States v. Orbino, 981 F.2d 1035, 1036-37 (9th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 256, 126 L.Ed.2d 208 (1993);  United States v. Savage, 863 F.2d 595, 597-98 (8th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1082, 109 S.Ct. 2105, 104 L.Ed.2d 666 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(j)(1) applies only to a person who has been \"charged with an offense.\"   In this instance, the appellant was not charged with the offenses of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and attempted importation until the end of 1993.   Until it brought such a charge, the government had no obligation to file a detainer with the Bureau of Prisons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>C. Plea Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that the government breached the plea agreement.   He tells us that the U.S. Attorney's office promised it would not oppose a recommendation for a concurrent sentence, but the prosecutor instead argued successfully for a consecutive sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention is baseless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The plea agreement signed by the appellant specifically, explicitly, and unambiguously states:  \"The United States and the defendant agree that the sentence to be imposed in this case shall run consecutive to any other sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is currently serving.\"   The plea agreement also contains an integration clause that provides:  \"This written agreement constitutes the complete plea agreement between the United States, the defendant, and the defendant's counsel.   The United States has made no promises or representations except as set forth in writing in this plea agreement.\"   The questionnaire that the appellant completed in advance of the change-of-plea colloquy is consistent with these understandings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The appellant has made no allegation that he was coerced into signing the plea agreement, that he was misled as to its contents, or that the questionnaire is bogus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the appellant identifies nothing that would justify an objectively reasonable expectation that the plea agreement meant anything other than what it plainly says.   Since the government abided faithfully by the clear terms of its written agreement, we have no warrant to set aside the sentence imposed by the district court.   See United States v. Hogan, 862 F.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant claims that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to (1) file appropriate pretrial motions, (2) notify the sentencing court of health problems afflicting his family, and (3) make a proper request for the return of property.   The rule is firmly settled in this circuit that \"fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions.\"  United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining the rule and collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1839, 128 L.Ed.2d 466 (1994).   While we have made occasional exceptions to the rule in certain idiosyncratic circumstances, see, e.g., United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1079, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992), this case does not fall within the isthmian confines of any recognized exception.   Because the appellant did not present this claim of ineffective assistance to the lower court, we decline to consider it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>E. Seizure of Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Criminal Rules, a person deprived of property \"may move the district court for the district in which the property was seized for the return of the property on the ground that such person is entitled to lawful possession of the property.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e).   Acting pro se, Guzman made such a motion below;  in it, he claimed entitlement to certain items allegedly seized from him at the time of his initial arrest in St. Maarten.   He also claimed entitlement to a tool box, together with its contents, alleging that the tool box was inside a car, belonging to his sister, that federal authorities seized in Puerto Rico.   The district court found that the property seized in St. Maarten was taken not by the United States but by the Netherlands Antilles, and that, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to order its return.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  However, the district court did not rule on the appellant's motion insofar as it pertained to the tool box's confiscation.   The appellant did not ask for reconsideration based on this oversight.   He nevertheless attempts to appeal from the court's failure to direct that the tool box be returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's brief misses the appellant's point.   It contends, correctly, that Guzman never made a claim of ownership referable to the car, and thus does not have standing to contest its seizure.   Cf. United States v. One Parcel of Real Property ... Known as Plat 20, Lot 17, 960 F.2d 200, 206 n. 3 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that a person who does not claim ownership cannot contest the civil forfeiture of property);  United States v. One Parcel of Real Property ... Known as 116 Emerson Street, 942 F.2d 74, 78 (1st Cir.1991) (same).   But this observation does not in any way trump the appellant's insistence that he owns, and is entitled to the return of, the tool box and its contents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellant's point is arguable, it is separable from, and has no effect upon, the appellant's conviction and sentence.   A defendant may bring an independent civil action for the return of property even if the underlying criminal case has been closed.   See United States v. Garcia, 65 F.3d 17, 19-20 (4th Cir.1995);  United States v. Giraldo, 45 F.3d 509, 511 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Giovanelli, 998 F.2d 116, 118-19 (2d Cir.1993).   Since such a complaint serves as the functional equivalent of a Rule 41(e) motion, we perceive no need to prolong this case in order to pursue the point (especially in view of the fact that the district court made no findings in regard to the tool box).   We therefore deny Guzman's request for relief vis-a-vis the tool box, without prejudice to his right to bring a separate civil action to compel its return.   See United States v. $8,850, 461 U.S. 555, 569, 103 S.Ct. 2005, 2014, 76 L.Ed.2d 143 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   For aught that appears, Guzman was lawfully prosecuted, justly convicted, and appropriately sentenced. His conviction and sentence must therefore be Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Further details of the failed drug-smuggling operation can be found in our opinion in United States v.

See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 813-15 (1st Cir.1988) (holding that if a defendant identifies record evidence from which a jury could conclude that the defendant was entrapped, the government must bear the burden of proving that no entrapment occurred)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There is some controversy in the circuits over whether this procedural matrix applies unreservedly both to interlocutory review of double jeopardy claims and to direct appeals following convictions.

See also Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d at 229 n. 17 (noting the uncertainty).

Discerning neither a constitutional flaw nor any other significant error, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment in this case arises out of an aborted drug smuggle that took the appellant by sea from Puerto Rico to the island of St. Maarten in the Netherlands Antilles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  According to the appellant's uncontradicted allegations, Victor Ayala, an agent of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), followed the LEE MARY (captained by the appellant) to St. Maarten in August 1990, and then surveilled it for two days.   At this juncture Dutch authorities boarded the ship, searched her, seized seventy-three kilograms of cocaine, and detained several persons.   The appellant alleges that Ayala joined in the search, but the United States maintains that he merely observed it from his surveillance post.   At any rate, it is undisputed that after the search had begun Ayala informed the Dutch authorities of Guzman's involvement.   Local police ran Guzman to ground nearby and arrested him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dutch government charged Guzman with a crime involving possession of the cocaine stashed on board the LEE MARY.   He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to a ten-year term of immurement in St. Maarten.   He escaped in May of 1992.   Approximately seven months later the DEA arrested him in Puerto Rico when he attempted to sell heroin to an undercover agent.   After being found guilty of that crime he was sentenced to 147 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's troubles were not yet behind him:  in November of 1993, federal authorities in Puerto Rico indicted several individuals (including Guzman) for the attempted smuggle that had occurred in the summer of 1990.   The charges against the appellant included conspiring to possess, with intent to distribute, in excess of five kilograms of cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846;  attempting to import cocaine into the United States, see id. &#167;&#167; 952, 960, &amp; 963;  and aiding and abetting the commission of certain charged offenses, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season the district court denied motions to dismiss the indictment which posited, inter alia, that the bringing of charges violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend.  V, cl.2, and that the delay in procuring the indictment countervailed the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161-3174.   Rather than entrust his fate to a jury, the appellant entered into a plea agreement with the government pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.   All other charges against him were dropped.   The district court imposed a sentence of seventy months in prison, directing that the term run consecutive to the previously imposed heroin-trafficking sentence.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the double jeopardy claim--which has been extensively briefed by Guzman's appellate counsel--Guzman himself advances four other assignments of error in a supplemental pro se brief.   We address all five claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A. Double Jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that the offense of conviction in this case and the offense for which he was convicted in St. Maarten are one and the same, thus triggering double jeopardy concerns.   Even though both cases involve the appellant's possession of the identical seventy-three kilos of cocaine, destined for importation into the United States via St. Maarten, a towering obstacle looms:  the two sets of charges were brought by different governments.   The black-letter rule is that prosecutions undertaken by separate sovereign governments, no matter how similar they may be in character, do not raise the specter of double jeopardy as that constitutional doctrine is commonly understood.

Under this matrix, the defendant must proffer evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case that the two prosecutions were for the same offense.

See Heath, 474 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 437.   Thus, the defendant must produce some evidence tending to prove that the rule should not apply because one sovereign was a pawn of the other, with the result that the notion of two supposedly independent prosecutions is merely a sham.   If the defendant proffers evidence sufficient to support such a finding--in effect, a prima facie case--the government must shoulder the burden of proving that one sovereign did not orchestrate both prosecutions, or, put another way, that one sovereign was not a tool of the other.   See, e.g., United States v. Harrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551301\"><a href=\"/opinion/551301/united-states-v-jack-eugene-harrison-united-states-of-america-v-gary-don/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 475 (5th Cir.1990) (applying burden-shifting matrix in the Bartkus context).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, it is crystal clear that the appellant did not offer enough evidence to carry his entry-level burden.   Factually, his claim comes down to this:  he asserts that Agent Ayala traveled to St. Maarten, surveilled the LEE MARY, alerted the St. Maarten police to the appellant's presence, participated in the shipboard search (a fact that the United States contests), and testified at the ensuing trial.   Nothing in the appellant's proffer remotely suggests that the Dutch authorities were merely handmaidens of the DEA or that the Dutch prosecution was in reality a prosecution undertaken sub rosa by the United States government.   Even if all the appellant's facts--stripped, of course, of opprobrious epithets and unsupported conclusions--are taken at face value, those facts show nothing more than the rendering of routine intergovernmental assistance.   Cooperative law enforcement efforts between independent sovereigns are commendable, and, without more, such efforts will not furnish a legally adequate basis for invoking the Bartkus exception to the dual sovereign rule.   See Whalers Cove, 954 F.2d at 38;  Paiz, 905 F.2d at 1024.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this legal and factual mise en scene, the indictment in this case did not constitute a second prosecution for the same offense within the purview of the Fifth Amendment.   Consequently, the district court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>B. Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The baseline premise of the Speedy Trial Act is the requirement that a defendant has a right to be tried promptly following his indictment or initial appearance before a judicial officer (whichever first occurs).   See United States v. Staula, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196665\"><a href=\"/opinion/196665/united-states-v-staula/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 600 (1st Cir.1996).   Juxtaposed with this requirement is the requirement that, once arrested, a suspect must be indicted or otherwise formally charged within thirty days of his arrest.   See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b).   The appellant suggests two reasons why the government's actions in this case run afoul of this latter proscription.   Neither reason is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The first iteration of the appellant's speedy trial claim embodies a repullulation of his double jeopardy analysis.   He asseverates that since the United States orchestrated his arrest in St. Maarten, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b) required the United States to indict him within thirty days of that arrest.   This asseveration elevates hope over reason, and we need not linger long in dispatching it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Speedy Trial Act, in terms, applies only to the conduct of the United States.   Because we already have held that the United States did not control, dominate, or manipulate the actions of the Dutch authorities in respect to Guzman's arrest and prosecution in St. Maarten, see supra Part II(A), the claim that the date of that arrest affected the movement of the speedy trial clock in this case is without foundation.   Arrest or indictment by one sovereign does not engage the statutory guarantee of a speedy trial in respect to a subsequent indictment by a different sovereign.   See United States v. MacDonald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110686\"><a href=\"/opinion/110686/united-states-v-macdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 n. 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110686\"><a href=\"/opinion/110686/united-states-v-macdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The second iteration of the appellant's speedy trial claim takes a somewhat divergent slant.   He asserts that, when he was arrested in Puerto Rico for heroin trafficking, the United States knew of his 1990 involvement with the ill-fated cocaine smuggle and, hence, the government was obliged to charge him within thirty days of that arrest, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b), or in the alternative, to seek a detainer from the Bureau of Prisons (which had custody of him at the time), see id. &#167; 3161(j)(1).   This assertion is equally devoid of merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a person arrested for a crime must be charged by indictment or information within thirty days of his arrest \"in connection with such charges.\"   Id. &#167; 3161(b).   In this situation, the heroin-trafficking incident that led to the appellant's December 1992 arrest had no connection with his activity in St. Maarten two-and-one-half years earlier.   It follows, therefore, that since the authorities did not arrest the appellant in 1992 for a crime related to his St. Maarten conduct, the Speedy Trial Act did not require that he be charged with the cocaine-smuggling crime within thirty days of that arrest.

He tells us that the U.S. Attorney's office promised it would not oppose a recommendation for a concurrent sentence, but the prosecutor instead argued successfully for a consecutive sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention is baseless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The plea agreement signed by the appellant specifically, explicitly, and unambiguously states:  \"The United States and the defendant agree that the sentence to be imposed in this case shall run consecutive to any other sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is currently serving.\"   The plea agreement also contains an integration clause that provides:  \"This written agreement constitutes the complete plea agreement between the United States, the defendant, and the defendant's counsel.   The United States has made no promises or representations except as set forth in writing in this plea agreement.\"   The questionnaire that the appellant completed in advance of the change-of-plea colloquy is consistent with these understandings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The appellant has made no allegation that he was coerced into signing the plea agreement, that he was misled as to its contents, or that the questionnaire is bogus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the appellant identifies nothing that would justify an objectively reasonable expectation that the plea agreement meant anything other than what it plainly says.   Since the government abided faithfully by the clear terms of its written agreement, we have no warrant to set aside the sentence imposed by the district court.   See United States v. Hogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515175\"><a href=\"/opinion/515175/united-states-v-mark-hogan-and-patricia-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 388 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant claims that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to (1) file appropriate pretrial motions, (2) notify the sentencing court of health problems afflicting his family, and (3) make a proper request for the return of property.   The rule is firmly settled in this circuit that \"fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions.\"  United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining the rule and collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Natanel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span> (1992), this case does not fall within the isthmian confines of any recognized exception.   Because the appellant did not present this claim of ineffective assistance to the lower court, we decline to consider it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>E. Seizure of Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Criminal Rules, a person deprived of property \"may move the district court for the district in which the property was seized for the return of the property on the ground that such person is entitled to lawful possession of the property.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e).   Acting pro se, Guzman made such a motion below;  in it, he claimed entitlement to certain items allegedly seized from him at the time of his initial arrest in St. Maarten.   He also claimed entitlement to a tool box, together with its contents, alleging that the tool box was inside a car, belonging to his sister, that federal authorities seized in Puerto Rico.   The district court found that the property seized in St. Maarten was taken not by the United States but by the Netherlands Antilles, and that, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to order its return.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  However, the district court did not rule on the appellant's motion insofar as it pertained to the tool box's confiscation.   The appellant did not ask for reconsideration based on this oversight.   He nevertheless attempts to appeal from the court's failure to direct that the tool box be returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's brief misses the appellant's point.   It contends, correctly, that Guzman never made a claim of ownership referable to the car, and thus does not have standing to contest its seizure.   Cf. United States v. One Parcel of Real Property ... Known as Plat 20, Lot 17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580694\"><a href=\"/opinion/580694/nos-91-1681-91-1682/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 206 n. 3 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that a person who does not claim ownership cannot contest the civil forfeiture of property);  United States v. One Parcel of Real Property ... Known as 116 Emerson Street, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566802\"><a href=\"/opinion/566802/united-states-v-one-parcel-of-real-property-with-buildings-appurtenances/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.1991) (same).   But this observation does not in any way trump the appellant's insistence that he owns, and is entitled to the return of, the tool box and its contents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellant's point is arguable, it is separable from, and has no effect upon, the appellant's conviction and sentence.   A defendant may bring an independent civil action for the return of property even if the underlying criminal case has been closed.   See United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703250\"><a href=\"/opinion/703250/united-states-v-daniel-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 19-20 (4th Cir.1995);  United States v. Giraldo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195842\"><a href=\"/opinion/195842/united-states-v-giraldo/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 511 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Giovanelli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610911\"><a href=\"/opinion/610911/united-states-v-federico-giovanelli-aka-fritzy/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span>, 118-19 (2d Cir.1993).   Since such a complaint serves as the functional equivalent of a Rule 41(e) motion, we perceive no need to prolong this case in order to pursue the point (especially in view of the fact that the district court made no findings in regard to the tool box).   We therefore deny Guzman's request for relief vis-a-vis the tool box, without prejudice to his right to bring a separate civil action to compel its return.   See United States v. $8,850, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110936\"><a href=\"/opinion/110936/united-states-v-8850/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 569, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110936\"><a href=\"/opinion/110936/united-states-v-8850/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See, e.g., United States v.
