We have reviewed  carefully the record  in\r                           \r\n\nthis case, including  the trial transcript and the  briefs of\r\n\nthe parties.  We  find no reversible error to  have occurred.\r\n\nWe add only the following.\r\n\n     We  find no  abuse of  discretion in  the trial  court's\r\n\ndenial  of McCabe's request for appointment of counsel.  In a\r\n\ncivil  case,   counsel  is  required  only   in  \"exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances\" where absence of  counsel is \"likely to result\r\n\nin fundamental  unfairness  impinging on  [a litigant's]  due\r\n\nprocess rights.\"  DesRosiers  v.

The  instant  case,  which  did  not  involve\r\n\nparticularly complex  questions of law or  fact, presented no\r\n\nsuch exceptional circumstances.  \r\n\n     Nor  did the  court  abuse its  discretion in  admitting\r\n\ntestimony, pursuant to Fed.

Such\r\n\nevidence  had bearing  on the  correction officers'  state of\r\n\nmind while attempting to remove McCabe from his cell and thus\r\n\nwas relevant to their defense against  McCabe's claim to have\r\n\nbeen  the victim  of constitutionally  excessive force.

The\r                              \r\n\ncourt committed  no error  in determining that  the probative\r\n\nvalue of this testimony  outweighed any prejudicial effect it\r\n\nmight have had on McCabe.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     Finally,  we  find   no  reversible  error  in   defense\r\n\ncounsel's  appeal to the  jurors to \"[p]ut  yourselves in the\r\n\n[shift commander's]  position and  ask, as he  stood, whether\r\n\nhis  decision was  reasonable.\"   Counsel was  not improperly\r\n\nasking the jurors  \"to depart from neutrality  and decide the\r\n\ncase on the basis  of personal interest and bias  rather than\r\n\non the evidence,\"  Forrestal v.

Such\r\n\nan   appeal  to   \"collective   common  sense\"   is  not   an\r\n\ninappropriate invocation of the \"golden rule.\"  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.
