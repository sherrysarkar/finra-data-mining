Appellant Cameron Dodson (\"Dodson\") brought\r                           \r\n\nthis action pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).  Dodson\r                                           \r\n\nwas convicted  of being a  felon in possession of  a firearm.\r\n\nHe  is serving  his sentence  at  the Metropolitan  Detention\r\n\nCenter  in  Guaynabo,  Puerto   Rico  (\"MDC  Guaynabo\");   he\r\n\npreviously  served time on  this conviction in  three federal\r\n\nprisons,  but he  was  moved  to  MDC  Guaynabo  after  being\r\n\nattacked by inmates associated with the  prison gang known as\r\n\nthe \"Aryan Brotherhood\" (\"AB\").\r\n\n     Dodson   has  alleged   several  constitutional   claims\r\n\npertaining to his incarceration, but for the purposes of this\r\n\nappeal, we  are mainly  concerned with two  of them.   First,\r\n\nDodson claims that officials at MDC Guaynabo and  the federal\r\n\nBureau  of  Prisons plan  to  transfer him  to  United States\r\n\nPenitentiary in Marion,  Illinois (\"Marion\") in violation  of\r\n\nthe  Eighth  Amendment.   Second,  he  claims  that  the same\r\n\nofficials  have  deliberately  kept him  at  MDC  Guaynabo to\r\n\nretaliate  against him  and his  family  for writing  various\r\n\nletters protesting  the conditions  of his  confinement.   We\r\n\ndiscuss  these two  claims first  and  then address  Dodson's\r\n\nremaining constitutional claims.\r\n\n     1.  Dodson's Eighth Amendment claim regarding a transfer\r\n\nto Marion  has two  branches.  First,  he claims  that prison\r\n\nofficials  at Marion would  place him in  segregation for the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nremainder of  his prison  term in order  to protect  him from\r\n\nassaults by the numerous AB  members at Marion, and that such\r\n\nsegregation would violate  the Eighth Amendment.   Second, he\r\n\nclaims that  even in segregation,  he would be  assaulted and\r\n\nprobably killed  by AB members.   Dodson  has sought  various\r\n\nremedies based on this claim, including an injunction against\r\n\na transfer to Marion, monetary damages from the officials who\r\n\nplanned to  transfer him, an injunction against a transfer to\r\n\nany federal penitentiary in the United  States, an order that\r\n\nthe  Bureau of  Prisons transfer  him  to a  Washington state\r\n\nfacility, an order  to federal officials to  prosecute prison\r\n\nand federal  officials for  violating his  civil rights,  and\r\n\nmonetary damages for violations of civil rights.\r\n\n     We  are  troubled  by  the  allegations  in  this  case,\r\n\nalthough the record is admittedly underdeveloped.  It appears\r\n\nthat prison officials did seek to transfer  Dodson to Marion,\r\n\neven  though  Marion  typically  houses  prisoners  who  have\r\n\nserious  records  of  institutional   violence  or  otherwise\r\n\nrequire unusually  heightened security, criteria  that Dodson\r\n\napparently  does not  meet.   The government  argues that  it\r\n\nabandoned the  transfer when it became clear  that Marion was\r\n\nnot an appropriate setting for Dodson, but the timing of this\r\n\nabandonment  raises  the possibility  that  the  transfer was\r\n\nabandoned only  upon  Dodson's initiation  of  this  lawsuit.\r\n\nDodson  has   also  made  plausible   albeit  unsubstantiated\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nallegations  that  efforts  to transfer  him  to  Marion will\r\n\nresume  when this  case concludes.   Dodson  alleges that  he\r\n\ncould  add substance  to  these  allegations  if  allowed  to\r\n\nundertake discovery.  \r\n\n     The district court  held that Dodson's  claims regarding\r\n\nMarion were mooted  by the abandonment of the  transfer.  The\r\n\ngovernment has represented  that there are no  existing plans\r\n\nto transfer Dodson to Marion or  to any other facility in the\r\n\nUnited States, and  there is no  substantial evidence to  the\r\n\ncontrary.   We therefore  agree with the  district court that\r\n\nDodson  has  no  live  claim for  an  injunction,  let  alone\r\n\nmonetary damages, regarding a transfer to Marion that did not\r\n\nmaterialize,  and we  do  not reach  the  merits of  Dodson's\r\n\nEighth  Amendment challenges.   The  district  court did  not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in denying discovery.  \r\n\n     Dodson is  free to initiate  his lawsuit again to  bar a\r\n\ntransfer  to Marion  if the  government  renews its  transfer\r\n\neffort.   We note that we would view  it as bad faith for the\r\n\ngovernment to resume its attempt to transfer Dodson to Marion\r\n\nwithout giving him  notice and an opportunity  to reapply for\r\n\nan injunction.   The  district court's  dismissal is  plainly\r\n\nwithout prejudice to a new lawsuit if the threat is renewed.\r\n\n     2.   Dodson's  retaliation claim  rests  on a  different\r\n\nfactual  predicate.   Dodson claims  that  federal Bureau  of\r\n\nPrisons  officials  have  been  retaliating  against  him for\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nwriting letters  complaining of his treatment  throughout his\r\n\nincarceration.  He  claims this retaliation has  occurred not\r\n\nin  the form of  the proposed transfer  to Marion  but in the\r\n\nform of  continued detention at  MDC Guaynabo and  refusal to\r\n\ntransfer him to a facility in the continental  United States.\r\n\nSpecifically,  Dodson  has  repeatedly requested  that  he be\r\n\ntransferred to  a facility  in Washington so  that he  can be\r\n\nnear his family.\r\n\n     The  district  court   did  not  directly  address   the\r\n\nretaliation  claim and apparently treated it as a due process\r\n\nclaim  unsoundly premised  on the  notion that  Dodson had  a\r\n\nright to  choose his place of incarceration.   This confusion\r\n\nis understandable because Dodson's original complaint did not\r\n\nexpressly state a claim of retaliation.  However,  given that\r\n\nDodson  apparently  argued  the retaliation  claim  below  in\r\n\ndetail  and in  light of  our obligation  to construe  pro se\r                                                                         \r\n\npleadings liberally,  see Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520\r                                                      \r\n\n(1972),  we  will  treat Dodson's  complaint  as  amended and\r\n\naddress the retaliation claim here.\r\n\n     As the district court stated, there is no constitutional\r\n\nright to be incarcerated in a particular facility.   However,\r\n\nDodson may state  a constitutional claim if  his requests for\r\n\ntransfers were denied  in retaliation for activity  protected\r\n\nby the First  Amendment.   See Sandin v.  Conner, 115 S.  Ct.\r                                                            \r\n\n2293, 2302 n.11 (1995); McDonald  v. Hall, 610 F.2d 16, 17-18\r                                                     \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1979).  In order to defeat summary judgment, Dodson\r\n\nmust  produce some admissible evidence that indicates that he\r\n\nis being kept  in Puerto Rico in retaliation  for his letter-\r\n\nwriting.\r\n\n     Here, Dodson has made factual allegations that, if true,\r\n\nwould certainly  prove that prison officials harbor animosity\r\n\ntoward  him.    However,  Dodson  has  made no  showing  that\r\n\nsuggests that  this animosity is  what is keeping him  at MDC\r\n\nGuaynabo.    Dodson's   strongest  evidence  is  an   alleged\r\n\nstatement by MDC Guaynabo's Assistant Warden Tombone that, if\r\n\nhe did not stop writing  letters, the Bureau of Prisons would\r\n\n\"spin\" him  (i.e., transfer  him through  several prisons  in\r                             \r\n\nrapid succession).   There  is no  indication that  this ever\r\n\nhappened.   The connection between this hearsay expression of\r\n\nretaliatory motive  and Dodson's  continued incarceration  at\r\n\nGuaynabo is tenuous at best.\r\n\n     Dodson's further  allegations  that MDC  Guaynabo  is  a\r\n\npretrial  facility and that no other long-term prisoners have\r\n\nremained there  over  a  year  are,  in  this  case,  largely\r\n\nirrelevant to  the issue  of retaliatory  motive.   Given the\r\n\nprior  attacks  on  Dodson elsewhere  in  the  prison system,\r\n\nunusual measures  were obviously  necessary.   Indeed, it  is\r\n\nquite plausible to conclude that  Dodson has been kept at MDC\r\n\nGuaynabo in order to protect him from AB attacks.\r                                        \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n     Of  course, Dodson's  lack  of  evidence of  retaliatory\r\n\nmotive is partly due to the district court's refusal to allow\r\n\nDodson to  undertake discovery.    Although this  is a  close\r\n\nissue,  we hold  that the  district court  did not  abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion  in denying  further discovery on  the retaliation\r\n\nclaim.  See Mattoon v. City of Pittsfield, 980 F.2d 1, 8 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1992).   We therefore affirm the district  court, but in\r\n\nview of his pro se status modify the judgment to reflect that\r                              \r\n\nthe dismissal is without prejudice.\r\n\n     3.  Dodson  also raises certain other claims,  which the\r\n\ndistrict court  correctly dismissed with  prejudice.   Dodson\r\n\nclaims that keeping him at MDC Guaynabo violates due  process\r\n\nand  equal  protection  principles because  most  inmates are\r\n\nSpanish-speaking, there are few programs that are relevant to\r\n\nhis rehabilitation, and it is located thousands of miles from\r\n\nhis  family in Washington  State.  However,  Eighth Amendment\r\n\nlimitations aside, an inmate  has no general right to  demand\r\n\nthat  his  incarceration  meet  particular  conditions.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMeachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 224-25 (1976).\r                           \r\n\n     Dodson  also   seeks  monetary   damages  from   federal\r\n\nofficials for failing  to protect him from  previous assaults\r\n\nby AB members while  he was in federal custody.   However, he\r\n\nhas not named any defendants who would have  been responsible\r\n\nfor his placement  in the general population of prisons where\r\n\nthese assaults  took place.   Dodson  cannot sue  supervisory\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nofficials of the Bureau of  Prisons on a theory of respondeat\r\n\nsuperior.    See Gutierrez-Rodriguez  v. Cartagena,  882 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n553, 562 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\n     Finally, Dodson claims  the right to physical  access to\r\n\nthe MDC Guaynabo prison law  library.  It appears that Dodson\r\n\nhas access to  the library through  written requests for  law\r\n\nbooks; the  prison has  security regulations  barring inmates\r\n\nfrom physical  access at  will.   An inmate  does not  have a\r\n\nright to access a  law library unless restrictions  on access\r\n\nimpair his ability to assert  legal challenges.  See Lewis v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCasey, 116 S.  Ct. 2174, 2182 (1996).   Similarly, this court\r                 \r\n\nhas no authority to appoint counsel in this civil suit.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMallard v. United States District Court, 490 U.S. 296 (1989).\r                                                   \r\n\n     To  conclude:  the dismissal as  moot of Dodson's Eighth\r\n\nAmendment claim for  injunctive relief against a  transfer to\r\n\nMarion is affirmed on the understanding that the dismissal is\r                              \r\n\nwithout prejudice as to reassertion of the claim in the event\r\n\nof  a new  threat to  transfer  him.   Dismissal of  Dodson's\r\n\nretaliation  claim is also  affirmed without prejudice  as to\r                                                \r\n\nreassertion  if Dodson  obtains  evidence  of  a  retaliatory\r\n\nmotive  for  keeping him  at  MDC  Guaynabo.   In  all  other\r\n\nrespects  the district  court's  judgment  of dismissal  with\r\n\nprejudice is affirmed.\r                                 \r\n\n     It is so ordered. \r                                 \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n",

Dodson\r                                           \r\n\nwas convicted  of being a  felon in possession of  a firearm.\r\n\nHe  is serving  his sentence  at  the Metropolitan  Detention\r\n\nCenter  in  Guaynabo,  Puerto   Rico  (\"MDC  Guaynabo\");   he\r\n\npreviously  served time on  this conviction in  three federal\r\n\nprisons,  but he  was  moved  to  MDC  Guaynabo  after  being\r\n\nattacked by inmates associated with the  prison gang known as\r\n\nthe \"Aryan Brotherhood\" (\"AB\").\r\n\n     Dodson   has  alleged   several  constitutional   claims\r\n\npertaining to his incarceration, but for the purposes of this\r\n\nappeal, we  are mainly  concerned with two  of them.   First,\r\n\nDodson claims that officials at MDC Guaynabo and  the federal\r\n\nBureau  of  Prisons plan  to  transfer him  to  United States\r\n\nPenitentiary in Marion,  Illinois (\"Marion\") in violation  of\r\n\nthe  Eighth  Amendment.   Second,  he  claims  that  the same\r\n\nofficials  have  deliberately  kept him  at  MDC  Guaynabo to\r\n\nretaliate  against him  and his  family  for writing  various\r\n\nletters protesting  the conditions  of his  confinement.   We\r\n\ndiscuss  these two  claims first  and  then address  Dodson's\r\n\nremaining constitutional claims.\r\n\n     1.  Dodson's Eighth Amendment claim regarding a transfer\r\n\nto Marion  has two  branches.  First,  he claims  that prison\r\n\nofficials  at Marion would  place him in  segregation for the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nremainder of  his prison  term in order  to protect  him from\r\n\nassaults by the numerous AB  members at Marion, and that such\r\n\nsegregation would violate  the Eighth Amendment.   Second, he\r\n\nclaims that  even in segregation,  he would be  assaulted and\r\n\nprobably killed  by AB members.   Dodson  has sought  various\r\n\nremedies based on this claim, including an injunction against\r\n\na transfer to Marion, monetary damages from the officials who\r\n\nplanned to  transfer him, an injunction against a transfer to\r\n\nany federal penitentiary in the United  States, an order that\r\n\nthe  Bureau of  Prisons transfer  him  to a  Washington state\r\n\nfacility, an order  to federal officials to  prosecute prison\r\n\nand federal  officials for  violating his  civil rights,  and\r\n\nmonetary damages for violations of civil rights.\r\n\n     We  are  troubled  by  the  allegations  in  this  case,\r\n\nalthough the record is admittedly underdeveloped.  It appears\r\n\nthat prison officials did seek to transfer  Dodson to Marion,\r\n\neven  though  Marion  typically  houses  prisoners  who  have\r\n\nserious  records  of  institutional   violence  or  otherwise\r\n\nrequire unusually  heightened security, criteria  that Dodson\r\n\napparently  does not  meet.   The government  argues that  it\r\n\nabandoned the  transfer when it became clear  that Marion was\r\n\nnot an appropriate setting for Dodson, but the timing of this\r\n\nabandonment  raises  the possibility  that  the  transfer was\r\n\nabandoned only  upon  Dodson's initiation  of  this  lawsuit.\r\n\nDodson  has   also  made  plausible   albeit  unsubstantiated\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nallegations  that  efforts  to transfer  him  to  Marion will\r\n\nresume  when this  case concludes.   Dodson  alleges that  he\r\n\ncould  add substance  to  these  allegations  if  allowed  to\r\n\nundertake discovery.  \r\n\n     The district court  held that Dodson's  claims regarding\r\n\nMarion were mooted  by the abandonment of the  transfer.  The\r\n\ngovernment has represented  that there are no  existing plans\r\n\nto transfer Dodson to Marion or  to any other facility in the\r\n\nUnited States, and  there is no  substantial evidence to  the\r\n\ncontrary.   We therefore  agree with the  district court that\r\n\nDodson  has  no  live  claim for  an  injunction,  let  alone\r\n\nmonetary damages, regarding a transfer to Marion that did not\r\n\nmaterialize,  and we  do  not reach  the  merits of  Dodson's\r\n\nEighth  Amendment challenges.   The  district  court did  not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in denying discovery.  \r\n\n     Dodson is  free to initiate  his lawsuit again to  bar a\r\n\ntransfer  to Marion  if the  government  renews its  transfer\r\n\neffort.   We note that we would view  it as bad faith for the\r\n\ngovernment to resume its attempt to transfer Dodson to Marion\r\n\nwithout giving him  notice and an opportunity  to reapply for\r\n\nan injunction.   The  district court's  dismissal is  plainly\r\n\nwithout prejudice to a new lawsuit if the threat is renewed.\r\n\n     2.   Dodson's  retaliation claim  rests  on a  different\r\n\nfactual  predicate.   Dodson claims  that  federal Bureau  of\r\n\nPrisons  officials  have  been  retaliating  against  him for\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nwriting letters  complaining of his treatment  throughout his\r\n\nincarceration.  He  claims this retaliation has  occurred not\r\n\nin  the form of  the proposed transfer  to Marion  but in the\r\n\nform of  continued detention at  MDC Guaynabo and  refusal to\r\n\ntransfer him to a facility in the continental  United States.\r\n\nSpecifically,  Dodson  has  repeatedly requested  that  he be\r\n\ntransferred to  a facility  in Washington so  that he  can be\r\n\nnear his family.\r\n\n     The  district  court   did  not  directly  address   the\r\n\nretaliation  claim and apparently treated it as a due process\r\n\nclaim  unsoundly premised  on the  notion that  Dodson had  a\r\n\nright to  choose his place of incarceration.   This confusion\r\n\nis understandable because Dodson's original complaint did not\r\n\nexpressly state a claim of retaliation.  However,  given that\r\n\nDodson  apparently  argued  the retaliation  claim  below  in\r\n\ndetail  and in  light of  our obligation  to construe  pro se\r                                                                         \r\n\npleadings liberally,  see Haines v. Kerner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108432\"><a href=\"/opinion/108432/haines-v-kerner/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520\r                                                      \r\n\n(1972),  we  will  treat Dodson's  complaint  as  amended and\r\n\naddress the retaliation claim here.\r\n\n     As the district court stated, there is no constitutional\r\n\nright to be incarcerated in a particular facility.   However,\r\n\nDodson may state  a constitutional claim if  his requests for\r\n\ntransfers were denied  in retaliation for activity  protected\r\n\nby the First  Amendment.   See Sandin v.  Conner, 115 S.  Ct.\r                                                            \r\n\n2293, 2302 n.11 (1995); McDonald  v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371947\"><a href=\"/opinion/371947/anthony-f-mcdonald-v-frank-a-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17-18\r                                                     \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1979).  In order to defeat summary judgment, Dodson\r\n\nmust  produce some admissible evidence that indicates that he\r\n\nis being kept  in Puerto Rico in retaliation  for his letter-\r\n\nwriting.\r\n\n     Here, Dodson has made factual allegations that, if true,\r\n\nwould certainly  prove that prison officials harbor animosity\r\n\ntoward  him.    However,  Dodson  has  made no  showing  that\r\n\nsuggests that  this animosity is  what is keeping him  at MDC\r\n\nGuaynabo.    Dodson's   strongest  evidence  is  an   alleged\r\n\nstatement by MDC Guaynabo's Assistant Warden Tombone that, if\r\n\nhe did not stop writing  letters, the Bureau of Prisons would\r\n\n\"spin\" him  (i.e., transfer  him through  several prisons  in\r                             \r\n\nrapid succession).   There  is no  indication that  this ever\r\n\nhappened.   The connection between this hearsay expression of\r\n\nretaliatory motive  and Dodson's  continued incarceration  at\r\n\nGuaynabo is tenuous at best.\r\n\n     Dodson's further  allegations  that MDC  Guaynabo  is  a\r\n\npretrial  facility and that no other long-term prisoners have\r\n\nremained there  over  a  year  are,  in  this  case,  largely\r\n\nirrelevant to  the issue  of retaliatory  motive.   Given the\r\n\nprior  attacks  on  Dodson elsewhere  in  the  prison system,\r\n\nunusual measures  were obviously  necessary.   Indeed, it  is\r\n\nquite plausible to conclude that  Dodson has been kept at MDC\r\n\nGuaynabo in order to protect him from AB attacks.\r                                        \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n     Of  course, Dodson's  lack  of  evidence of  retaliatory\r\n\nmotive is partly due to the district court's refusal to allow\r\n\nDodson to  undertake discovery.    Although this  is a  close\r\n\nissue,  we hold  that the  district court  did not  abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion  in denying  further discovery on  the retaliation\r\n\nclaim.  See Mattoon v. City of Pittsfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595475\"><a href=\"/opinion/595475/kimberly-mattoon-v-city-of-pittsfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1992).   We therefore affirm the district  court, but in\r\n\nview of his pro se status modify the judgment to reflect that\r                              \r\n\nthe dismissal is without prejudice.\r\n\n     3.  Dodson  also raises certain other claims,  which the\r\n\ndistrict court  correctly dismissed with  prejudice.   Dodson\r\n\nclaims that keeping him at MDC Guaynabo violates due  process\r\n\nand  equal  protection  principles because  most  inmates are\r\n\nSpanish-speaking, there are few programs that are relevant to\r\n\nhis rehabilitation, and it is located thousands of miles from\r\n\nhis  family in Washington  State.  However,  Eighth Amendment\r\n\nlimitations aside, an inmate  has no general right to  demand\r\n\nthat  his  incarceration  meet  particular  conditions.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMeachum v. Fano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109510\"><a href=\"/opinion/109510/meachum-v-fano/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224-25 (1976).\r                           \r\n\n     Dodson  also   seeks  monetary   damages  from   federal\r\n\nofficials for failing  to protect him from  previous assaults\r\n\nby AB members while  he was in federal custody.   However, he\r\n\nhas not named any defendants who would have  been responsible\r\n\nfor his placement  in the general population of prisons where\r\n\nthese assaults  took place.   Dodson  cannot sue  supervisory\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nofficials of the Bureau of  Prisons on a theory of respondeat\r\n\nsuperior.    See Gutierrez-Rodriguez  v. Cartagena,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527780\"><a href=\"/opinion/527780/carlos-a-gutierrez-rodriguez-v-desiderio-cartagena-and-domingo-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r                                                              \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\n     Finally, Dodson claims  the right to physical  access to\r\n\nthe MDC Guaynabo prison law  library.  It appears that Dodson\r\n\nhas access to  the library through  written requests for  law\r\n\nbooks; the  prison has  security regulations  barring inmates\r\n\nfrom physical  access at  will.   An inmate  does not  have a\r\n\nright to access a  law library unless restrictions  on access\r\n\nimpair his ability to assert  legal challenges.  See Lewis v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCasey, 116 S.  Ct. 2174, 2182 (1996).   Similarly, this court\r                 \r\n\nhas no authority to appoint counsel in this civil suit.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMallard v.

Dismissal of  Dodson's\r\n\nretaliation  claim is also  affirmed without prejudice  as to\r                                                \r\n\nreassertion  if Dodson  obtains  evidence  of  a  retaliatory\r\n\nmotive  for  keeping him  at  MDC  Guaynabo.   In  all  other\r\n\nrespects  the district  court's  judgment  of dismissal  with\r\n\nprejudice is affirmed.\r                                 \r\n\n     It is so ordered. \r                                 \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n</pre>",
