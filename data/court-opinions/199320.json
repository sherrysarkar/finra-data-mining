Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n                   Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Francis M. Jackson on brief for appellant.\n     Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, Charlotte J.\nHardnett, Acting General Counsel, Frank V. Smith, III, Acting\nPrincipal Deputy General Counsel, John M. Sacchetti, Associate\nGeneral Counsel for Program Litigation, and Etzion Brand,\nSupervisory Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Social\nSecurity Administration, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          March 16, 2001\n\f      Per   Curiam.     Appellant        Harold       Dudley    appeals    from    the\n\njudgment of the district court that it lacked jurisdiction over\n\nhis   (appellant's)         appeal      from     a    final     decision    of    the\n\nCommissioner      of   Social      Security.          The   Commissioner's       final\n\ndecision – made by the Appeals Council – was that appellant's\n\napplication for disability benefits was barred by res judicata.\n\nIn particular, appellant had filed a prior application, which\n\nconcerned the same issues and the same time period, and had\n\nfailed to seek Appeals Council review of the determination of\n\nthe   administrative        law    judge    (ALJ)      that    appellant    was   not\n\ndisabled.      Due     to   appellant's        omission,       this   determination\n\nbecame final and binding.\n\n      It is well-settled that the denial of an application for\n\ndisability benefits based on res judicata is not subject to\n\njudicial review.        See Torres v. Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices, 845 F.2d 1136, 1138 (1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam);\n\nMatos v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 581 F.2d\n\n282, 285-86 (1st Cir. 1978).               Appellant nonetheless raises two\n\narguments    in    support        of   finding       jurisdiction.        His    first\n\nargument is that where there has been a reopening of the prior\n\napplication, the Commissioner is estopped from invoking res\n\njudicata.    This is not availing here because even though the ALJ\n\nhad decided that the prior application should be reopened, the\n\fAppeals Council nullified this decision.                       See Tobak v. Apfel,\n\n195 F.3d 183 (3rd Cir. 1999).                  Thus, as the district court\n\nfound, there has been no reopening.\n\n      Appellant's second argument is based on the exception to the\n\nrule of unreviewability where a claimant raises a \"colorable\"\n\nconstitutional claim regarding an administrative decision based\n\non res judicata.         See Torres, 845 F.2d at 1138; Matos, 581 F.2d\n\nat   286   n.6.     A    common      claim,    in   this       context,    is    that   a\n\nclaimant's mental impairment, and lack of legal representation,\n\nprevented    him    or       her    from   timely       pursuing    administrative\n\nremedies concerning the claimant's prior application.                           This is\n\nthe claim appellant raises and the district court rejected it as\n\nnot \"colorable.\"        We agree for essentially the reasons stated in\n\nthe recommended decision of the magistrate judge, which the\n\ndistrict judge adopted.             We add only the following comments.\n\n      First, even assuming that appellant was unrepresented at the\n\nrelevant    time,       he   does    not   dispute       the     Appeals    Council's\n\ndescription of the 1992-1993 treatment notes from the Eastport\n\nHealth Center.      According to the Council, these notes did not\n\nmention anything unusual about appellant's mental condition and\n\nthus did not support the conclusion that claimant was mentally\n\nunable to pursue his administrative remedies during this time.\n\nSecond,    appellant         does   not    point    to    any     medical       evidence\n\nconcerning    the       specific     effects       of    his    depression       on   his\n\n\n                                           3\n\fabilities to understand and follow administrative procedures.\n\nThat is, appellant cites to no evidence that, for instance, he\n\nwas    confused,     had   a   thought   disorder        or    poor       intellectual\n\nfunctioning, or was not capable of functioning responsibly.\n\nThat Drs. DiTullio and Pasternak concluded that appellant was\n\n\"disabled\" is not enough, standing alone, to show that appellant\n\nwas incapable of comprehending or pursuing his administrative\n\nremedies.     Cf. Torres v. Secretary of Health, Education, and\n\nWelfare, 475 F.2d 466, 468-69 (1st Cir. 1973) (remanding to the\n\nSecretary    for    further      proceedings    concerning           the    effect    of\n\nclaimant's    mental       impairment    on   his   ability          to    follow    his\n\nadministrative       remedies,     but   noting     that       the    finding       that\n\nclaimant    was    disabled      based   on   his   nerves       only      meant    that\n\nclaimant was \"occupationally disabled\" within the meaning of the\n\nSocial Security Act; \"one may be so disabled and yet retain the\n\nawareness and mental capacity to understand and pursue one's\n\nrights\").\n\n       Finally, we note that the fact that the Commissioner did not\n\nfile the entire administrative record below does not require a\n\nremand in this case.           Appellant cites to no authority requiring\n\nsuch    a   filing     where     jurisdiction       is        contested      and     the\n\nCommissioner does not file an answer.               See 42 U.S.C. § 405(g).\n\nOur comments in Torres are not to the contrary.                      See 845 F.2d at\n\n1137 n.1.    And, although appellant alluded below to the absence\n\n\n                                         4\n\fof the complete record, he never filed a motion specifically\n\nrequesting the district court to order the Commissioner to\n\nsubmit the record.   As a result, this objection is not well\n\ntaken.\n\n    The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             5\n\f",
