Cohen, with whom Merita A. Hopkins, Corporation\nCounsel, Diane Diianni, Special Assistant Corporation Counsel, Hill &\nBarlow and Adam N. Lewis, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          February 5, 2001\n\f          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge. This petition involves the difficult\n\nquestion of whether a sitting district court judge should have recused\n\nherself after commenting publicly on a pending matter. Because we find\n\nthat it was, in this case, an abuse of discretion for the judge not to\n\nrecuse herself based on an appearance of partiality, we grant the writ\n\nof mandamus. In so doing, we emphasize that such a grant in no way\n\nindicates a finding of actual bias or prejudice, nor does it suggest\n\nthat the trial judge abdicated any of her ethical responsibilities.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          We briefly summarize the procedural history of the case in\n\norder to place the motion for recusal and the petition for the writ of\n\nmandamus in context.\n\n          Petitioners filed suit challenging Boston's elementary school\n\nstudent assignment process on June 21, 1999, claiming that they had\n\nbeen deprived of preferred school assignments based on their race, in\n\nviolation of state and federal law. The case was assigned to District\n\nJudge Nancy Gertner. On May 19, 2000, the district court addressed a\n\nmotion to dismiss in which defendants argued that \"plaintiffs lack\n\nstanding to sue because they would not have received their preferred\n\nschool assignments anyway, even if racial preferences were not used\" in\n\nthe assignment formula. The district court found that five of the ten\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\findividual plaintiffs1 had not applied to change schools for the 1999-\n\n2000 school year, and thus lacked standing to seek injunctive relief. 2\n\nBoston's Children First v. City of Boston, 98 F. Supp. 2d 111, 114 (D.\n\nMass. 2000) [hereinafter Boston's Children, Standing Order]. The court\n\nallowed the remaining plaintiffs to conduct further discovery prior to\n\ndetermining whether they had standing. The court found that because\n\nall of the plaintiffs \"may have a claim for damages,\" it could not\n\ndismiss any of the damages claims on standing grounds.\n\n           Petitioners also sought class certification. In a June 20,\n\n2000 status conference the court indicated that it would not rule on\n\nclass certification until it had received a written motion (which had\n\nnot yet been submitted) that analyzed how the alleged class complied\n\nwith the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. The court\n\nalso offered petitioners a choice: it would either rule on their\n\npending motion for a preliminary injunction at that time, despite the\n\n\"relatively truncated record,\" or it would defer the motion until\n\nfurther discovery had occurred. Petitioners chose to conduct further\n\ndiscovery, and the motion for a preliminary injunction remains pending.3\n\n\n1 The other plaintiff-petitioner, Boston's Children First, is a \"self-\ndescribed membership and advocacy organization.\"\n2 The five individual plaintiffs who were denied standing to sue for\ninjunctive relief have pursued an interlocutory appeal which is\ncurrently pending before this Court.\n3 The district court had denied petitioners' previous motion for a\npreliminary injunction. Boston's Children First v. City of Boston, 62\n\n                                  -3-\n\fIn a procedural order dated June 29, 2000, the district court set the\n\ncourse of future litigation: it would allow further discovery on the\n\nissue of standing, it would determine standing, and if any of the\n\nplaintiffs had standing, class discovery and a hearing with respect to\n\nclass certification would follow. Boston's Children First v. City of\n\nBoston, C.A. No. 99-11330-NG (D. Mass., June 29, 2000) (procedural\n\norder).\n\n            Despite the schedule proposed in this procedural order,\n\npetitioners filed a motion for class certification dated July 26, 2000.\n\nThe motion noted the similarity between the present case and Mack v.\n\nSuffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000), a case in which class\n\ncertification had been granted prior to the resolution of standing\n\nissues. Also on July 26, the Boston Herald printed an article in which\n\ncounsel for petitioners decried the district court's failure to\n\nimmediately certify a class. Counsel made the provocative claim that\n\n\"[i]f you get strip-searched in jail, you get more rights than a child\n\nwho is of the wrong color,\" a reference to the facts of the Mack case.\n\nDave Wedge, Lawyer Fights School Ruling, Boston Herald, July 26, 2000,\n\nat 5.     The article said that:\n\n            According to [counsel's] motion, Gertner refused\n            to hear arguments to expand the school suit to a\n            class action because the affected students may no\n            longer have standing in the case. But in the\n\n\nF. Supp. 2d 247, 248 (D. Mass. 2000) [hereinafter, Boston's Children,\nDenial of Preliminary Injunction].\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            strip-search case [ Mack], Gertner held just the\n            opposite opinion.\n\nId. The article then noted that \"Gertner could not be reached for\n\ncomment.\"    Id.\n\n            In a July 28, 2000 letter to the Herald (with copies sent to\n\nboth parties), Judge Gertner responded to what she viewed as\n\ninaccuracies in the July 26 article. She noted, correctly, that she\n\nhad not denied class certification, but had postponed ruling on class\n\ncertification until further discovery had occurred. She also noted\n\nthat, as of the date of the reporter's interview with counsel, counsel\n\nfor petitioners had not yet filed the motion in question.4 She included\n\nwith the letter a copy of her procedural order providing for a hearing\n\non class certification after the issue of standing had been resolved.\n\n            On August 4, 2000, the Herald published a follow-up article,\n\nwhich, based on a telephone interview with Judge Gertner, quoted her as\n\nsaying:\n\n            In the [Mack] case, there was no issue as to\n            whether [the plaintiffs] were injured. It was\n            absolutely clear every woman had a claim. This\n            is a more complex case.\n\nDave Wedge, Race-based Admissions Case To Be Heard, Boston Herald,\n\nAugust 4, 2000, at 24.     It is not entirely clear from the record\n\nwhether Judge Gertner called the Herald reporter, or merely returned an\n\n4 The motion was not filed until July 26 at 12:20 p.m., after that\nday's edition of the Herald had been published, and accordingly after\nthe interview reported in that edition had taken place.\n\n                                  -5-\n\foutstanding phone call, neither party was made aware of her comments\n\nprior to their August 4 publication. See Boston's Children First v.\n\nCity of Boston, 123 F. Supp. 2d 34, 36 (D. Mass 2000) [hereinafter\n\nBoston's Children, Motion to Recuse] (\"[W]hen asked about the source of\n\ncounsel's criticism . . . I noted that the cases were different, the\n\nschool case 'more complex.'\").\n\n          Based on Judge Gertner's comments as reported in the August\n\n4 article, petitioners then moved that the judge recuse herself because\n\nher \"impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 455(a).\n\nSpecifically, petitioners claimed that the ex parte conversation\n\nbetween Judge Gertner and the Herald reporter, in which she described\n\nthe current proceeding as \"more complex\" than Mack, was \"specifically\n\nproscribed by the Code of Judicial Conduct,\" constituted a comment on\n\nthe merits of a pending motion, and meant that the court had \"placed\n\nitself in the apparent position of advising the defendants.\"\n\n          Judge Gertner denied the motion. Boston's Children, Motion\n\nto Recuse, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 36. She acknowledged that she had made\n\nthe reported statements, characterizing them as attempts to correct a\n\nrecord suffering from gross misrepresentation by counsel for the\n\npetitioners. Id. She noted that \"[n]othing in the Code of Judicial\n\nConduct\" made such a correction improper; moreover, that it was her\n\n\"obligation to make certain that people receive accurate information\n\nregarding the proceedings over which [she] preside[s].\" Id. at 37. As\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fto the specific comment about the complexity of the instant case, Judge\n\nGertner admitted that a conversation had taken place, but said:\n\n           My comments in court, in the myriad decisions\n           since the inception of the case, reflected\n           precisely that theme--that the case raised\n           complex questions of standing and liability, and\n           that it deserved careful and thoughtful\n           consideration.\n\nId. at 36. As a result, Judge Gertner concluded that she had simply\n\ncomplied with the judicial canon allowing judges to explain \"for public\n\ninformation the procedures of the court.\"        Id. at 37.\n\n\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n           We begin, as we must, with the statute.      Section 455(a)\n\nrequires \"[a]ny justice, judge or magistrate of the United States [to]\n\ndisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might\n\nreasonably be questioned.\" This statute seeks to balance two competing\n\npolicy considerations: first, that \"courts must not only be, but seem\n\nto be, free of bias or prejudice,\" In re United States, 158 F.3d 26, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (quoting In re United States, 666 F.2d 690, 694 (1st\n\nCir. 1981)); and second, the fear that recusal on demand would provide\n\nlitigants with a veto against unwanted judges, id.        We have thus\n\nconsidered disqualification appropriate only when the charge is\n\nsupported by a factual basis,5 and when the facts asserted \"provide what\n\n5 We have refused to require recusal based on misrepresentations or\nfalsehoods made by third parties, even when such falsehoods are widely\n\n                                  -7-\n\fan objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a\n\nreasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.\" In re United\n\nStates, 666 F.2d at 695. Moreover, we allow district court judges a\n\n\"range of discretion\" in the decision not to recuse. Id. However, we\n\nnote that the district court should exercise that discretion with the\n\nunderstanding that, \"if the question of whether ยง 455(a) requires\n\ndisqualification is a close one, the balance tips in favor of recusal.\"\n\nNichols v. Alley, 71 F.3d 347, 352 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\n          Moreover, a petition for a writ of mandamus raises additional\n\nhurdles for the party seeking recusal. We have held that at least\n\n\"[w]hen the issue of partiality has been broadly publicized, and the\n\nclaim of bias cannot be labeled as frivolous,\" In re United States, 666\n\nF.2d at 694, judicial disqualification may be one of the \"unusual\n\nsituations\" appropriate for the writ, In re Martรญnez-Cรกtala, 129 F.3d\n\n213, 217 (1st Cir. 1997). Even when such an unusual situation exists,\n\nhowever, we have counseled that the jurisprudence of mandamus requires\n\nthat \"an applicant for the writ . . . show both that there is a clear\n\nentitlement to the relief requested, and that irreparable harm will\n\nlikely occur if the writ is withheld.\" In re United States, 158 F.3d\n\nat 30 (quoting In re Cargill, Inc., 66 F.3d 1256, 1260 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n\nreported and might theoretically cause the \"appearance of partiality.\"\nSee In re United States, 666 F.2d at 695. Because Judge Gertner has\nacknowledged that she made the statement at issue here, the factual\nbasis of the allegations is not under challenge. The only question\nhere is whether that basis is sufficient to mandate recusal.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f1995)). Mandamus thus requires \"a case not merely close to the line,\n\nbut clearly over it.\"     Martรญnez-Cรกtala, 129 F.3d at 218.6\n\n          The crux of petitioner's complaint is that Judge Gertner's\n\nstatement - that the present case is \"more complex\" than Mack because\n\nin Mack \"there was no issue as to whether [the plaintiffs] were\n\ninjured\" - could be construed as a comment on the merits of the pending\n\nmotions for preliminary injunction and class certification. In other\n\nwords, by calling this case \"more complex,\" Judge Gertner arguably\n\nsuggested that the petitioner's claims for certification and temporary\n\ninjunctive relief were less than meritorious; by comparing the case\n\n(less than favorably) to Mack, Judge Gertner signaled that relief was\n\nunlikely to be forthcoming. Petitioners also argue that Gertner's\n\ncomments provided defendants with a ready-made argument with which to\n\ndistinguish the instant case from Mack.7 Given that Judge Gertner's\n\n\n6 We note that in a Government petition for mandamus in a criminal\ncase, these concerns have been found less pressing because of the\npossibility that, absent the writ, double jeopardy considerations will\neliminate any avenue of appeal. In re United States, 158 F.3d at 30-\n31. That is clearly not the case here, in a civil action allowing the\nfull slate of appellate remedies upon a final judgment.\n7 This last argument is somewhat of a stretch. Attempts to distinguish\ncases are basic litigation strategy, and, in fact, defendants had\nalready suggested this particular distinction in earlier motions. See,\ne.g., Boston's Children, Standing Order, 98 F. Supp. 2d at 113.\n\n  We also note that petitioners, in their appellate brief and in oral\nargument, spent significant time discussing the procedural history of\nthe case and detailing the rulings against them which (in their\nopinion) are suggestive of bias. We reject this argument: not only did\nJudge Gertner provide ample legal support for every decision issued in\n\n                                 -9-\n\fcomments could be construed in this context, petitioners argue that\n\nregardless of her intent,8 the appearance of partiality created by her\n\npublic statement required her to recuse herself pursuant to ยง 455(a).\n\n           Although Canon 3(A)(6) of the Code of Judicial Conduct\n\ninstructs that \"[a] judge should avoid public comment on the merits of\n\na pending or impending action,\" it does not extend this proscription to\n\n\"public statements made in the course of the judge's official duties,\n\nto the explanation of court procedures, or to a scholarly presentation\n\nmade for purposes of legal education.\" 175 F.R.D. 364, 367 (1998).\n\nThe commentary to the Code also \"counsels that 'particular care' be\n\ntaken\" if a case from the judge's own court is involved, so that the\n\ncomment \"does not denigrate public confidence in the integrity and\n\nimpartiality of the judiciary in violation of Canon 2A.\" Id. at 370-\n\n71.\n\n          Although the \"goal sought to be served by the Canon informs\n\nour analysis,\" we do not decide the case solely on that basis. United\n\nStates v. Cooley, 1 F.3d 985, 995 n.8 (10th Cir. 1993). First, it is\n\n\n\nthis case, but \"judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid\nbasis for a bias or partiality motion . . . . Almost invariably, they\nare proper grounds for appeal, not for recusal.\" Liteky v. United\nStates, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994). This may be true even when the\njudicial rulings in question are erroneous. In the Matter of\nSheffield, 465 So.2d 350, 357 (Ala. 1985).\n8 In her memorandum refusing recusal, Judge Gertner has characterized\nher aims as explanatory and educational. Boston's Children, Motion to\nRecuse, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 37.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fnot at all clear that Judge Gertner was commenting on the merits of\n\npetitioner's motion. She understood her own comments as entirely\n\nethical explanations of the reasons behind court procedures. Judge\n\nGertner felt, reasonably, that such explanation was warranted given the\n\nlikelihood that the Herald's readers would misunderstand the\n\nprocedurally complex issues of standing and class certification -\n\nissues particularly difficult for those not legally trained. See\n\nBoston's Children, Motion to Recuse, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 37 (\"Rather, I\n\nchose to correct the record. Nothing in the Code of Judicial Conduct\n\nsuggests that I may not do so.\"). Second, both this Court and other\n\ncourts have indicated that the Code of Judicial Conduct does not\n\noverlap perfectly with ยง 455(a): it is possible to violate the Code\n\nwithout creating an appearance of partiality; likewise, it is possible\n\nfor a judge to comply with the Code yet still be required to recuse\n\nherself. See In re Cargill, 66 F.3d at 1262 n.5 (not deciding the\n\npoint, but noting the \"strong argument\" that \"not all instances of\n\nnoncompliance\" with the Code require automatic disqualification); In re\n\nBarry, 946 F.2d 913, 914 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (per curiam). But see id. at\n\n916 (Edwards, J., dissenting) (suggesting that breach of this canon\n\n\"will   almost   always   give   rise    to   a   legitimate   claim   for\n\ndisqualification under section 455(a)\"). Third, we must consider the\n\ncomments in the context in which they were issued: as a response to\n\nstatements by counsel that were, at minimum, provocative attempts to\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\finfluence public opinion, and that could have been considered\n\nmisrepresentations that potentially violated professional ethics. Cf.\n\nTown of Norfolk v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 968 F.2d 1438, 1460\n\n(noting importance of context of statements, both within the course of\n\nindividual litigation and with reference to the history of underlying\n\nsubject matter).\n\n          We have little guidance on when public comments, even those\n\non the merits of a pending action, create an appearance of partiality\n\nfor which ยง 455(a) recusal is the appropriate remedy.9 Judges are\n\ngenerally loath to discuss pending proceedings with the media, even\n\nwhen litigants may have engaged in misrepresentation. See Cooley, 1\n\nF.3d at 995 (\"[Discussing the case with the media] was an unusual thing\n\nfor a judge to do.\"). Thus few reported cases deal with recusal on\n\nthis basis. The Tenth Circuit has provided at least one example of\n\nwhen media contact mandated judicial disqualification. In Cooley, a\n\nfederal district judge who had issued a preliminary injunction\n\npreventing abortion protesters from blocking a Kansas clinic \"became\n\n'adamant and vocal' in stating that his order was going to be obeyed\"\n\nupon learning that protesters intended to willfully violate his orders.\n\n\n\n9 In contrast, myriad cases indicate that courts are loath to require\nrecusal based on statements made in a judicial context (e.g., in a\nstatus hearing or a decision rendered from the bench), even when such\nstatements might suggest, to some extent, pre-determination of the\nmerits. See, e.g., United States v. Grinnell, 384 U.S. 563, 581-82\n(1966); United States v. Lรณpez, 944 F.2d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fId. at 988. As part of his \"campaign\" to ensure that his orders would\n\nbe enforced, the judge appeared on \"Nightline,\" where he stated that\n\n\"these people are breaking the law.\" Id. at 990. Five defendants\n\narrested for blocking access to the clinic sought recusal of the\n\ndistrict court judge, which he refused to grant.\n\n          The Tenth Circuit noted that, in refusing to grant the motion\n\nfor recusal, the district court had maintained that it \"knew nothing\n\nabout the facts of [the defendants'] cases, and had no predisposition\n\nas to their guilt or innocence of the charges.\" Id. at 995. The court\n\nof appeals saw no reason to find otherwise. Id. at 996 (\"[T]he record\n\nof the proceedings below . . . discloses no bias. To the contrary, it\n\nappears that the district judge was courteous to the defendants and\n\nsedulously protected their rights.\"). But the court continued to\n\nexplain why recusal was necessary nonetheless:\n\n            ยง 455(a) asks a broader question which, on\n          these facts, makes it impossible to take these\n          cases out of context. . . .\n\n             Two messages were conveyed by the judge's\n          appearance on national television in the midst of\n          these events. One message consisted of the words\n          actually spoken regarding the protesters'\n          apparent plan to bar access to the clinics, and\n          the judge's resolve to see his order prohibiting\n          such actions enforced. The other was the judge's\n          expressive conduct in deliberately making the\n          choice to appear in such a forum at a sensitive\n          time to deliver strong views on matters which\n          were likely to be ongoing before him. Together,\n          these messages unmistakenly conveyed an uncommon\n          interest and degree of personal involvement in\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f           the subject matter. It was an unusual thing for\n           a judge to do, and it unavoidably created the\n           appearance that the judge had become an active\n           participant in bringing law and order to bear on\n           the protesters, rather than remaining as a\n           detached adjudicator.\n\n             We conclude that at least after the judge's\n           volunteer appearance on national television to\n           state his views regarding the ongoing protests,\n           the protesters, and his determination that his\n           injunction was going to be obeyed, a reasonable\n           person would harbor a justified doubt as to his\n           impartiality in the case involving these\n           defendants.\n\nId. at 995.\n\n           Although the media contact in this case was less inflammatory\n\nthan that in Cooley, we see the same factors at work, albeit on a\n\nsmaller scale. First, the Boston school assignment program is a matter\n\nof significant local concern, generating at least two prominent\n\narticles in the Boston Herald. Judge Gertner viewed this prominence as\n\nall the more reason to correct misrepresentations by petitioners'\n\ncounsel.   However, Cooley counsels that in newsworthy cases where\n\ntensions may be high, judges should be particularly cautious about\n\ncommenting on pending litigation. Interested members of the public\n\nmight well consider Judge Gertner's actions as expressing an undue\n\ndegree of interest in the case, and thus pay special attention to the\n\nlanguage of her comments. With such public attention to a matter, even\n\nambiguous comments may create the appearance of impropriety that\n\nยง 455(a) is designed to address. In fact, the very rarity of such\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fpublic statements, and the ease with which they may be avoided, make it\n\nmore likely that a reasonable person will interpret such statements as\n\nevidence of bias. See In re Allied Signal Inc., 891 F.2d 967, 971 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (\"[O]ther things being equal, the more common a potentially\n\nbiasing circumstance and the less easily avoidable it seems, the less\n\nthat circumstance will appear to a knowledgeable observer as a sign of\n\npartiality.\").\n\n          Second, the \"appearance of partiality\" at issue here, as in\n\nCooley, stems from the real possibility that a judge's statements may\n\nbe misinterpreted because of the ambiguity of those statements. In\n\nboth cases, the judge's public comments could easily be characterized\n\nas legitimate efforts to explain operative law. For example, the judge\n\nin Cooley could be understood merely as reminding potential law-\n\nbreakers of the binding nature of a judicial order, and the potential\n\nfor punishment that may accrue upon its violation. Similarly, Judge\n\nGertner's comments can be understood as a reflection of language in her\n\nprior orders, i.e., that class certification could not yet issue\n\nbecause the standing questions were more difficult (\"more complex\")\n\nthan those in Mack.      Still, in both cases the comments were\n\nsufficiently open to misinterpretation so as to create the appearance\n\nof partiality, even when no actual prejudice or bias existed. In\n\nCooley, a reasonable person might interpret the comments as an\n\naffirmative effort to enforce the law, and an indication that a guilty\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fverdict would be forthcoming.      Here, a reasonable person might\n\ninterpret Judge Gertner's comments as a preview of a ruling on the\n\nmerits of petitioner's motion for class certification, despite the fact\n\nthat defendants had not yet filed a response to that motion.\n\n          Although the Tenth Circuit based its finding in Cooley on the\n\ndistrict judge's \"active participa[tion] in bringing law and order to\n\nbear on the protesters,\" other courts have agreed that under some\n\ncircumstances a judge's defense of her own orders, prior to the\n\nresolution of appeal, may create the appearance of partiality. See,\n\ne.g., Broadman v. Comm'n on Judicial Performance, 18 Cal. 4th 1079,\n\n1104 (Cal. 1998) (\"By making public comments in an attempt to justify\n\nand defend his decisions while those decisions were pending on appeal,\n\npetitioner adopted the role of an advocate. Such actions would appear\n\nto an objective observer to be 'prejudicial to public esteem for the\n\njudicial office.'\"). To the extent that Judge Gertner's comments might\n\nbe interpreted as a defense of her procedural approach to this\n\nlitigation, this proscription is well taken. We believe that this\n\nappearance of partiality created by defense of a judge's own orders is\n\nequally (if not more) troubling in the midst of litigation than when a\n\ncase is remanded to a judge upon appeal.\n\n          The fact that Judge Gertner's comments were made in response\n\nto what could be characterized as an attack by counsel on the\n\nprocedures of her court did not justify any comment by Judge Gertner\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fbeyond an explanation of those procedures.      See In re Conard, 944\n\nS.W.2d 191 (Mo. 1997) (holding that a statement as to charges possible\n\nagainst potential defendant \"reflected a pre-judging of the merits of\n\ncriminal charges that might have been filed . . . [and] was not\n\njustified by the attacks [on the court]\"); Sheffield, 465 So.2d at 354\n\n(concerning a judicial response to a letter, criticizing the court,\n\nwhich appeared to have been \"unfounded and factually incorrect\").\n\nWhether counsel for petitioners misrepresented the facts or not is\n\nirrelevant: the issue here is whether a reasonable person could have\n\ninterpreted Judge Gertner's comments as doing more than correcting\n\nthose misrepresentations and creating an appearance of partiality. We\n\nfeel that, on these facts, a reasonable person could do so.\n\n          Again, we underscore that this ruling in no way intimates any\n\nactual bias or prejudice on the part of Judge Gertner. See In re Sch.\n\nAsbestos Lit., 977 F.2d 764, 782 (3d Cir. 1992).        \"The problem,\n\nhowever, is that regardless of [a judge's] actual impartiality, a\n\nreasonable person might perceive bias to exist, and this cannot be\n\npermitted.\" Id. \"Such a stringent rule may sometimes bar trial by\n\njudges who have no actual bias and who would do their best to weigh the\n\nscales of justice equally between contending parties.\"           In re\n\nMurchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955). We have every confidence that\n\nJudge Gertner is one such judge. \"But to perform its high function in\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fthe best way, 'justice must satisfy the appearance of justice,'\" id.,\n\nand thus we must grant the writ.\n\n          Writ of mandamus granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f",
