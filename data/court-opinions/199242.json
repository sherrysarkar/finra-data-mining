Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Friedrich Lu on brief pro se.\n     Merita A. Hopkins, Corporation Counsel, and Andrea W.\nMcCarthy, Assistant Corporation Counsel, City of Boston Law\nDepartment, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       January 22, 2001\n\f         Per Curiam.      After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm the dismissal of\n\nCount I with prejudice, but we vacate the dismissal of Count\n\nII and direct the district court to remand that count to the\n\nstate court.\n\n         As to Count I, we do not rest on the grounds stated\n\nby the district court.       Although the district court read\n\nappellant Friedrich Lu’s (“Lu’s”) complaint as if Lu claimed\n\nthat St. Francis House Shelter, a private entity, acted\n\nimproperly toward him, it appears to us that Lu alleges that\n\n“the defendant” – i.e., the Emergency Shelter Commission\n\n(“the Commission”) – acted improperly.        Further, the lower\n\ncourt went on to conclude that the Commission (through the\n\nCity of Boston (“the City”)) had no authority over the St.\n\nFrancis House, and as a result, the City was not a proper\n\nparty to this lawsuit.       But it was inappropriate for the\n\nlower court to rely on the City’s unsupported assertions on\n\na motion to dismiss.        Compare Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.        See\n\nClorox Co. Puerto Rico v. Proctor & Gamble Comm’l Co., 228\n\nF.3d 24, 20 (1st Cir. 2000); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).\n\n         Still, Count I of the Complaint was subject to\n\ndismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).              “As is well\n\nestablished,   §   1983   creates   no   independent   substantive\n\frights, but rather provides a cause of action by which\n\nindividuals    may   seek   money    damages   for   governmental\n\nviolations of rights protected by federal law.”        Cruz-Erazo\n\nv. Rivera-Montanez, 212 F.3d 617, 621 (1st Cir. 2000).        The\n\nComplaint fails to state a due process claim because it\n\nfails to allege any specific liberty or property interest\n\nwhich was threatened by the alleged wrongdoing, and because\n\nit does not allege any actions which approach the “shocks\n\nthe conscience” standard.     Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3,\n\n6 (1st Cir. 1999).   Further, to the extent Count I attempts\n\nto set out a procedural due process claim, it fails because\n\nany alleged wrongdoing may be remedied through an action\n\nunder the state public records law.        “[A] procedural due\n\nprocess claim is not actionable unless, inter alia, no\n\nadequate ‘post-deprivation remedy’ is available under state\n\nlaw.”    See Perez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guillen, 25 F.3d 40, 42 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n           To the extent Count I claims a violation of Lu’s\n\nFirst Amendment rights, that claim is inadequate as a matter\n\nof law, too.     See Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U.S. 1, 9\n\n(1978)    (Burger, C.J., plurality) (“This Court has never\n\nintimated a First Amendment guarantee of a right of access\n\nto all sources of information within government control.”);\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fEl Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon, 963 F.2d 488, 495 & n. 8\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (no authority for first amendment right of\n\naccess to information outside criminal justice context)\n\n(citing Houchins).\n\n           That leaves only the state law claim.            The claim\n\nis not properly before the federal court, since to the\n\nextent Lu seeks declaratory or injunctive relief under the\n\nstate law, “[a] federal court may not order state officials\n\nto   conform   their   behavior      to   state   law.”   Quintero    de\n\nQuintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 230 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(citing Pennhurst State School & Hosp. V. Halderman, 465\n\nU.S. 89, 106 (1984)).      But we cannot tell whether the claim\n\nis   subject   to   dismissal   on    other   grounds.    Though     the\n\nCommission apparently is only an arm of the City and so not\n\nseparately subject to suit, it seems at this early stage of\n\nthe litigation, a simple amendment to the pleadings would\n\naddress that problem.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).         We will\n\nnot affirm the dismissal of Count II with prejudice on this\n\nground.\n\n           We thus vacate the dismissal on the merits of Count\n\nII and direct the district court to remand this state law\n\nclaim to the state court from whence it had been removed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f         The judgment of the district court is affirmed in\n\npart and vacated in part; the dismissal of Count I with\n\nprejudice is affirmed; the dismissal of Count II is vacated,\n\nand the district court is directed to remand the Count to\n\nthe state court.\n\n\n\n\n                            -5-\n\f",
