STAHL, Circuit Judge.  Plaintiffs Julio Diaz, Ruben Diaz,\r\nJeffrey Duenes, Guillermo Plaza, Amilcar Rodriguez, and Andre\r\nRosado brought civil rights and common law claims for damages and\r\nequitable relief against the City of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and\r\nseveral officers of the Fitchburg Police Department.  They alleged,\r\ninter alia, that their custodial arrest for offending a city\r\nordinance punishable only by a fine was unconstitutional and/or\r\ncontrary to Massachusetts public policy.  Plaintiffs appeal from\r\nthe district court's sua sponte award of summary judgment to\r\ndefendants.  We affirm.\r\n                     I.\r\nBecause this is an appeal from a grant of summary\r\njudgment to defendants, we recite the facts in the light most\r\nfavorable to plaintiffs.  See Aponte Matos v. Toledo Davila, 135\r\nF.3d 182, 185 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nSince 1993, the City of Fitchburg has had in effect an\r\nordinance that prohibits obstruction of public passages within the\r\ncity (\"Ordinance\").  See Fitchburg, Mass., Code art. III,  132-34\r\n(1994).  A violation of the Ordinance is punishable only by a $300\r\nfine.  See id.\r\nOn the evening of October 14, 1993, the Fitchburg Police\r\nDepartment and its Special Response Team (\"SRT\") executed a search\r\nwarrant at a private residence.  The SRT is a special unit of the\r\npolice department comprised of officers trained to respond to high-\r\nrisk situations.  SRT officers dress in black uniforms and hooded\r\nmasks which do not bear any identifying insignia.  Perhaps because\r\nof the SRT's garb, plaintiffs refer to the team as a \"paramilitary\"\r\nunit.\r\nAfter observing the raid and as they were leaving the\r\nscene following the search, Captain Mark Louney and Sergeant John\r\nO'Leary noticed plaintiffs congregated outside a nearby residence. \r\nThe two officers stopped and ordered the group to move.  Plaintiffs\r\ndid not comply with this directive.  Several minutes later,\r\napparently with the understanding that plaintiffs were violating\r\nthe Ordinance, Captain Louney summoned the SRT, which had returned\r\nto a nearby police station, to arrest plaintiffs.  Within minutes\r\nand without a warrant, approximately ten members of the team\r\narrived in an unmarked van and exited with guns drawn.   Plaintiffs\r\nclaim that they then were forced to the ground, frisked,\r\nhandcuffed, and thrown face down in the van on top of one another. \r\nPlaintiffs further allege that, en route to the police station,\r\nthey were threatened, punched, stepped and spit on, and subjected\r\nto racial insults.\r\nPlaintiffs were charged with violating the Ordinance,\r\nprocessed, and jailed until released on bail.  Criminal complaints\r\nwere filed against them.  Complaints against two plaintiffs were\r\ncontinued without a finding to August 19, 1994, although these two\r\nplaintiffs were ordered to pay $50 in court costs.  Complaints\r\nagainst the remaining plaintiffs were dismissed after the City\r\nfailed to comply with a court order to disclose the names of the\r\nSRT members who participated in the arrest.\r\nOn September 9, 1994, plaintiffs filed a complaint in\r\nMassachusetts Superior Court.  They asserted claims under 42 U.S.C.\r\n1983 and a number of pendent state law theories.  Defendants\r\nremoved the case to federal court on the basis of federal question\r\njurisdiction.  Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint stating\r\neight causes of action.  Count II of the amended complaint, the\r\nbasis of this appeal, sought a declaratory judgment that custodial\r\narrest for a fine-only ordinance in the absence of exigent\r\ncircumstances violates the United States Constitution, the\r\nMassachusetts Constitution, and Massachusetts public policy. \r\nPlaintiffs moved for summary judgment with respect to\r\nCount II.  The district court referred the motion to Magistrate\r\nJudge Swartwood for a report and recommendation.  On September 26,\r\n1997, the magistrate judge recommended that, inter alia,\r\nplaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on Count II be denied. \r\nActing sua sponte, he also recommended that summary judgment be\r\nentered for defendants on Count II.  On October 24, 1997, the\r\ndistrict court adopted the report and recommendation.\r\nIn December 1997, the parties consented to having\r\nMagistrate Judge Swartwood try the case and enter final judgment. \r\nSee 28 U.S.C.  636(c).  Plaintiffs then filed a second amended\r\ncomplaint, which alleged that the use of a paramilitary unit to\r\neffect a custodial arrest for a fine-only ordinance in the absence\r\nof exigent circumstances is unlawful.  Following the amendment to\r\ntheir complaint, plaintiffs never sought summary judgment or\r\njudgment as a matter of law on this new allegation.\r\nIn April 1998, a jury returned a verdict for defendants\r\non all counts including, inter alia, excessive force, false arrest,\r\nfalse imprisonment, and assault and battery.  Plaintiffs\r\nsubsequently filed a motion for a new trial, which the district\r\ncourt denied.  On June 30, 1998, Magistrate Judge Swartwood entered\r\nfinal judgment for defendants on all counts.\r\n                    II.\r\nOn appeal, plaintiffs advance one preserved argument:  in\r\nthe absence of exigent circumstances, a custodial arrest for an\r\noffense punishable only by a fine is, as a matter of law, violative\r\nof the Fourth Amendment, Article Fourteen of the Massachusetts\r\nConstitution, and Massachusetts public policy.\r\nA. Fourth Amendment\r\nPlaintiffs have framed their Fourth Amendment argument in\r\nvery broad terms.  As we have indicated, plaintiffs ask us to\r\ndeclare that a custodial arrest made in the absence of \"exigent\r\ncircumstances\" for violation of an ordinance punishable only by a\r\nfine always violates the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness\r\nrequirement.  Yet plaintiffs have provided us with little basis for\r\nissuing so sweeping a ruling.\r\nWe start with fundamental principles.  Where warrantless\r\narrests for criminal offenses are concerned, the Fourth Amendment\r\nis satisfied if the arresting officer had probable cause and the\r\narrest was \"reasonable\" under the totality of the circumstances. \r\nSee Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1985).  In determining\r\nreasonableness, the United States Supreme Court has \"consistently\r\neschewed bright-line rules,\" and insisted instead on an evaluation\r\nof all of the circumstances of a particular case.  Ohio v.\r\nRobinette, 519 U.S. 33, 39 (1996) (holding that the Fourth\r\nAmendment does not inevitably require that a lawfully-seized\r\ndefendant be advised of his freedom to leave before his consent to\r\nsearch will be recognized as voluntary) (citations omitted). \r\nThis litigation demonstrates why the Supreme Court has\r\nfavored the case-by-case approach over bright-line rules.  The\r\nOrdinance (the constitutionality of which is not here challenged)\r\nis violated only after the offender has refused a police officer's\r\norder to move along.  See supra note 1.  In other words, the\r\nOrdinance only comes into play when a person unlawfully obstructing\r\na highway or other public passage persists in his or her violation. \r\nThus, a Fitchburg police officer confronting a person in violation\r\nof the Ordinance has limited options: the officer may either allow\r\nthe criminal obstruction to continue (perhaps issuing the offender\r\na citation, as plaintiff's counsel suggested at oral argument) or\r\nend it by seizing the offender and removing him or her from the\r\nscene of the offense.  If the officer always were obligated to\r\nallow the criminal obstruction to continue, he or she would be\r\nunable to satisfy the Ordinance's apparent purpose of assuring\r\npublic convenience and safety except in exigent circumstances. \r\nPlaintiffs, however, have not even attempted to establish the\r\ncontours of their proposed \"exigent circumstances\" exception.  If\r\nthe concept were understood to encompass only emergency situations,\r\nas it is understood in other contexts, an officer seemingly could\r\nnot clear the obstructed passage merely to ensure public\r\nconvenience.  This strikes us as sufficient reason to reject a per\r\nse rule.\r\nOf course, there may be circumstances when it would be\r\nunreasonable to subject an offender of a fine-only ordinance to\r\ncustodial arrest and interrogation.  Indeed, an arrest for\r\nviolation of this ordinance may, in some circumstances, be\r\nunreasonable.  But as we have just explained, a custodial arrest\r\nfor violation of a fine-only ordinance is not inevitably\r\nunreasonable.  We therefore reject plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment\r\nclaim.\r\nB. State Claims\r\nPlaintiffs additionally argue that Article Fourteen of\r\nthe Massachusetts Constitution and Massachusetts public policy\r\nprohibit custodial arrests for fine-only offenses absent exigent\r\ncircumstances.  In support of their Article Fourteen claim,\r\nplaintiffs point to Massachusetts cases affording a more expansive\r\nsweep to Article Fourteen than the United States Supreme Court has\r\ngiven to the Fourth Amendment.  They do not, however, direct us to\r\nany on-point Massachusetts authority.\r\nIn any event, we think it sufficient to observe that both\r\nfederal courts and Massachusetts courts train their focus on\r\nwhether the government has acted in a reasonable manner.  See Mass.\r\nConst. part I, art. XIV (\"[e]very subject has a right to be secure\r\nfrom all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his\r\nhouses, his papers, and all his possessions\").  And for the very\r\nsame reasons that lead us to reject a per se rule under the Fourth\r\nAmendment, see supra at 6-9, we believe that the Massachusetts\r\nSupreme Judicial Court would reject a per se rule under Article\r\nFourteen.  In so ruling, we recognize that, in marginal cases,\r\nthere are differences between the manner in which the federal\r\ncourts and the Massachusetts courts have assessed constitutional\r\nreasonableness.  We simply do not believe that this is a marginal\r\ncase.\r\nWith respect to plaintiffs' somewhat cryptic public\r\npolicy argument, which appears to be presented as an alternative\r\nbasis for plaintiffs' proposed per se rule (in the event we find\r\nplaintiffs' Fourth Amendment and Article Fourteen arguments\r\nunconvincing), we think it sufficient to predict that, for reasons\r\nalready stated, the Massachusetts courts would not impose such a\r\nrule absent binding constitutional or statutory authority directing\r\nthem to do so.  We therefore summarily reject this argument.\r\n                              III.\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's judgment in all respects.  \r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellees.\n",

They alleged, inter alia, that their custodial arrest for offending a city ordinance punishable only by a fine was unconstitutional and/or contrary to Massachusetts public policy.  Plaintiffs appeal from the district court's sua sponte award of summary judgment to defendants.

See Aponte Matos v. Toledo Davila, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197772\"><a href=\"/opinion/197772/aponte-matos-v-toledo-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 185 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1993, the City of Fitchburg has had in effect an ordinance that prohibits obstruction of public passages within the city (\"Ordinance\").  See Fitchburg, Mass., Code art.  III, &#167; 132-34 (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  A violation of the Ordinance is punishable only by a $300 fine.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of October 14, 1993, the Fitchburg Police Department and its Special Response Team (\"SRT\") executed a search warrant at a private residence.  The SRT is a special unit of the police department comprised of officers trained to respond to high-risk situations.  SRT officers dress in black uniforms and hooded masks which do not bear any identifying insignia.  Perhaps because of the SRT's garb, plaintiffs refer to the team as a \"paramilitary\" unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After observing the raid and as they were leaving the scene following the search, Captain Mark Louney and Sergeant John O'Leary noticed plaintiffs congregated outside a nearby residence.  The two officers stopped and ordered the group to move.  Plaintiffs did not comply with this directive.  Several minutes later, apparently with the understanding that plaintiffs were violating the Ordinance, Captain Louney summoned the SRT, which had returned to a nearby police station, to arrest plaintiffs.  Within minutes and without a warrant, approximately ten members of the team arrived in an unmarked van and exited with guns drawn.  Plaintiffs claim that they then were forced to the ground, frisked, handcuffed, and thrown face down in the van on top of one another.  Plaintiffs further allege that, en route to the police station, they were threatened, punched, stepped and spit on, and subjected to racial insults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs were charged with violating the Ordinance, processed, and jailed until released on bail.  Criminal complaints were filed against them.  Complaints against two plaintiffs were continued without a finding to August 19, 1994, although these two plaintiffs were ordered to pay $50 in court costs.  Complaints against the remaining plaintiffs were dismissed after the City failed to comply with a court order to disclose the names of the SRT members who participated in the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 9, 1994, plaintiffs filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court.  They asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and a number of pendent state law theories.  Defendants removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint stating eight causes of action.  Count II of the amended complaint, the basis of this appeal, sought a declaratory judgment that custodial arrest for a fine-only ordinance in the absence of exigent circumstances violates the United States Constitution, the Massachusetts Constitution, and Massachusetts public policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment with respect to Count II.  The district court referred the motion to Magistrate Judge Swartwood for a report and recommendation.  On September 26, 1997, the magistrate judge recommended that, inter alia, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on Count II be denied.  Acting sua sponte, he also recommended that summary judgment be entered for defendants on Count II.  On October 24, 1997, the district court adopted the report and recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1997, the parties consented to having Magistrate Judge Swartwood try the case and enter final judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c).  Plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint, which alleged that the use of a paramilitary unit to effect a custodial arrest for a fine-only ordinance in the absence of exigent circumstances is unlawful.  Following the amendment to their complaint, plaintiffs never sought summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law on this new allegation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1998, a jury returned a verdict for defendants on all counts including, inter alia, excessive force, false arrest, false imprisonment, and assault and battery.  Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, which the district court denied.  On June 30, 1998, Magistrate Judge Swartwood entered final judgment for defendants on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs advance one preserved argument:  in the absence of exigent circumstances, a custodial arrest for an offense punishable only by a fine is, as a matter of law, violative of the Fourth Amendment, Article Fourteen of the Massachusetts Constitution, and Massachusetts public policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>A. Fourth Amendment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs have framed their Fourth Amendment argument in very broad terms.  As we have indicated, plaintiffs ask us to declare that a custodial arrest made in the absence of \"exigent circumstances\" for violation of an ordinance punishable only by a fine always violates the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement.  Yet plaintiffs have provided us with little basis for issuing so sweeping a ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with fundamental principles.  Where warrantless arrests for criminal offenses are concerned, the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the arresting officer had probable cause and the arrest was \"reasonable\" under the totality of the circumstances.  See Tennessee v. Garner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111397\"><a href=\"/opinion/111397/tennessee-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111397\"><a href=\"/opinion/111397/tennessee-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1985).  In determining reasonableness, the United States Supreme Court has \"consistently eschewed bright-line rules,\" and insisted instead on an evaluation of all of the circumstances of a particular case.  Ohio v. Robinette, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118066\"><a href=\"/opinion/118066/ohio-v-robinette/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118066\"><a href=\"/opinion/118066/ohio-v-robinette/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (1996) (holding that the Fourth Amendment does not inevitably require that a lawfully-seized defendant be advised of his freedom to leave before his consent to search will be recognized as voluntary) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This litigation demonstrates why the Supreme Court has favored the case-by-case approach over bright-line rules.  The Ordinance (the constitutionality of which is not here challenged) is violated only after the offender has refused a police officer's order to move along.  See supra note 1. In other words, the Ordinance only comes into play when a person unlawfully obstructing a highway or other public passage persists in his or her violation.  Thus, a Fitchburg police officer confronting a person in violation of the Ordinance has limited options:  the officer may either allow the criminal obstruction to continue (perhaps issuing the offender a citation, as plaintiff's counsel suggested at oral argument) or end it by seizing the offender and removing him or her from the scene of the offense.  If the officer always were obligated to allow the criminal obstruction to continue, he or she would be unable to satisfy the Ordinance's apparent purpose of assuring public convenience and safety except in exigent circumstances.  Plaintiffs, however, have not even attempted to establish the contours of their proposed \"exigent circumstances\" exception.  If the concept were understood to encompass only emergency situations, as it is understood in other contexts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> an officer seemingly could not clear the obstructed passage merely to ensure public convenience. This strikes us as sufficient reason to reject a per se rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there may be circumstances when it would be unreasonable to subject an offender of a fine-only ordinance to custodial arrest and interrogation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Indeed, an arrest for violation of this ordinance may, in some circumstances, be unreasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  But as we have just explained, a custodial arrest for violation of a fine-only ordinance is not inevitably unreasonable.  We therefore reject plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. State Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs additionally argue that Article Fourteen of the Massachusetts Constitution and Massachusetts public policy prohibit custodial arrests for fine-only offenses absent exigent circumstances.  In support of their Article Fourteen claim, plaintiffs point to Massachusetts cases affording a more expansive sweep to Article Fourteen than the United States Supreme Court has given to the Fourth Amendment.  They do not, however, direct us to any on-point Massachusetts authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, we think it sufficient to observe that both federal courts and Massachusetts courts train their focus on whether the government has acted in a reasonable manner.  See Mass.  Const. part I, art.  XIV (\"[e]very subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions\").  And for the very same reasons that lead us to reject a per se rule under the Fourth Amendment, see supra at 561-562, we believe that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would reject a per se rule under Article Fourteen.  In so ruling, we recognize that, in marginal cases, there are differences between the manner in which the federal courts and the Massachusetts courts have assessed constitutional reasonableness.  We simply do not believe that this is a marginal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiffs' somewhat cryptic public policy argument, which appears to be presented as an alternative basis for plaintiffs' proposed per se rule (in the event we find plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment and Article Fourteen arguments unconvincing), we think it sufficient to predict that, for reasons already stated, the Massachusetts courts would not impose such a rule absent binding constitutional or statutory authority directing them to do so.  We therefore summarily reject this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court's judgment in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
