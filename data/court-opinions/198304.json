Brown, Baker &amp; Hostetler, LLP, Arturo Trias, Miguel R.\r\nGaray Auban, Trias, Melendez &amp; Garay, and Michael Avery.\r\n\nJanuary 25, 1999\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  Puerto Rico Governor Pedro\r\nRossello and other members of his administration (collectively,\r\n\"the Defendants\") seek to raise a qualified immunity defense to a\r\nclaim that they violated the constitutional rights of plaintiff-\r\nappellee El Dia, Inc. (\"El Dia\").  Specifically, the Defendants\r\nargue that they did not violate \"clearly established\" First\r\nAmendment law by allegedly withdrawing substantial government\r\nadvertising from a newspaper to punish the paper for criticizing\r\nthe Rossello administration.  On this interlocutory appeal, we\r\naffirm the district court's denial of the Defendants' motion to\r\ndismiss on qualified immunity grounds.\r\n                          I.\r\nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss, we accept all well-\r\npleaded facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor\r\nof the plaintiff.  See Aybar v. Crispin Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  El Dia owns, operates, and publishes El Nueva Dia, a\r\ndaily Spanish-language newspaper circulated in Puerto Rico. \r\nBeginning in January 1997, El Nueva Dia published a series of\r\narticles alleging patterns of fraud and waste in the Rossello\r\nAdministration.  On April 13, 1997, El Nueva Dia published an\r\narticle critical of Governor Rossello's first one hundred days of\r\nhis second term in office.  On April 14, 1997, eighteen government\r\nagencies that had routinely advertised in El Nueva Dia terminated\r\nadvertising contracts with the newspaper.  El Dia alleges that the\r\nDefendants ordered withdrawal of the advertising in retaliation for\r\nthe critical articles.  El Dia also alleges that, in a series of\r\nmeetings over several months, the Defendants subsequently offered\r\nto return the advertising to El Dia if the newspaper wrote\r\nfavorable editorials regarding certain of the government's\r\ninitiatives. \r\nOn December 9, 1997, El Dia filed a three-count civil\r\nrights complaint under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Count one, the only count\r\nthat is the subject of this appeal, requested both damages and\r\ninjunctive relief for violations of El Dia's First Amendment rights\r\npredicated on the allegedly retaliatory withdrawal of advertising. \r\nOn January 28, 1998, the Defendants moved to dismiss all claims\r\nseeking to recover money damages against them in their individual\r\ncapacities on grounds of qualified immunity.  On August 28, 1998,\r\nthe district court denied the motion to dismiss.  The court found\r\nthat the acts alleged in count one, if proven, would violate\r\n\"clearly established\" law and that the qualified immunity defense\r\nwas therefore unavailable.  The Defendants now bring an\r\ninterlocutory challenge to this ruling.                              II.\r\nThis court reviews a district court's denial of a motion\r\nto dismiss on qualified immunity grounds de novo.  See Elder v.\r\nHolloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994); Rivera-Ramos v. Roman, 156 F.3d\r\n276, 279 (1st Cir. 1998).  \r\nUnder the doctrine of qualified immunity, public\r\nofficials \"generally are shielded from liability for civil damages\r\ninsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\r\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\r\nwould have known.\"  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). \r\nThe doctrine protects such officials from liability for mere\r\n\"mistaken judgments\" about the legality of their actions.  Malleyv. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 343 (1986).  \r\nTo determine whether a public official has violated\r\nclearly established law, a court must evaluate the objective\r\nreasonableness of the alleged conduct in light of legal precedent. \r\nSee Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818.  \"The contours of the right must be\r\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that\r\nwhat he is doing violates that right.\"  Anderson v. Creighton, 483\r\nU.S. 635, 640 (1987).  We therefore focus our analysis on specific\r\nfacts and not on the right in the abstract, see Rivera-Ramos, 156\r\nF.3d at 279-80, but \"the very action in question [need not] ha[ve]\r\npreviously been held unlawful,\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640; see alsoMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 535 n.12 (1985) (\"We do not\r\nintend to suggest that an official is always immune from liability\r\nor suit for a warrantless search merely because the warrant\r\nrequirement has never explicitly been held to apply to a search\r\nconducted in identical circumstances.\"); accord St. Hilaire v. City\r\nof Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1995).  Rather, \"a general\r\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\r\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question,\r\neven though the very action in question has [not] previously been\r\nheld unlawful.\"  United States v. Lanier, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 1227\r\n(1997) (alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nThus, all that is needed is that, \"in the light of the preexisting\r\nlaw[,] the unlawfulness must [have] be[en] apparent.\"  Anderson,\r\n483 U.S. at 640.                              III.\r\nIt would seem obvious that using government funds to\r\npunish political speech by members of the press and to attempt to\r\ncoerce commentary favorable to the government would run afoul of\r\nthe First Amendment.  See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the\r\nUniv. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 830 (1995) (\"[I]deologically driven\r\nattempts to suppress a particular point of view are presumptively\r\nunconstitutional in funding, as in other contexts.\"); New York\r\nTimes Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 723-24 (1971) (\"The\r\ndominant purpose of the First Amendment was to prohibit the\r\nwidespread practice of governmental suppression of embarrassing\r\ninformation.\") (Douglas, J., concurring); Grosjean v. American\r\nPress Co., 297 U.S. 233, 250 (1936) (government action constituting\r\n\"a deliberate and calculated device . . . to limit the circulation\r\nof information\" is unconstitutional).  The Defendants argue,\r\nhowever, that there is no \"clearly established\" law prohibiting\r\nsuch conduct.  Moreover, the Defendants assert that the withdrawal\r\nof the advertising itself constitutes speech, and that, when acting\r\nas speaker, the government may make content-based choices.  Neither\r\nargument is persuasive: the first we reject and the second is\r\npremature.\r\nClearly established law prohibits the government from\r\nconditioning the revocation of benefits on a basis that infringes\r\nconstitutionally protected interests, see Perry v. Sindermann, 408\r\nU.S. 593, 597 (1972), and from terminating an independent\r\ncontractor such as El Dia in retaliation for exercising its First\r\nAmendment rights, see Board of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S.\r\n668, 685 (1996); Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,\r\n964 F.2d 32, 40-41 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that denial of land use\r\npermit in unjustifiable retaliation for applicant's political\r\nexpression is a First Amendment violation).  Indeed, in the words\r\nof the Supreme Court in Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640, \"the very action\r\nin question has previously been held unlawful.\"  See, e.g., North\r\nMississippi Communications, Inc. v. Jones, 792 F.2d 1330, 1337 (5th\r\nCir. 1986) (government's withdrawal of advertisements from\r\nnewspaper in retaliation for critical editorials and news violates\r\nthe First Amendment); Frissell v. Rizzo, 597 F.2d 840, 845 (3d Cir.\r\n1979) (dicta); see also Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 673 (citing North\r\nMississippi Communications, Inc. with approval).  This is not a\r\ncase of \"mistaken judgment[]\" for which the Defendants ought to be\r\nimmune from liability.  Malley, 475 U.S. at 343.  Because the law\r\nwas clearly established at the time the Defendants allegedly\r\nwithdrew the advertising, the Defendants are not entitled to\r\nqualified immunity.  See Harlow, 457 U.S. at 819 (\"Where an\r\nofficial could be expected to know that certain conduct would\r\nviolate statutory or constitutional rights, he should be made to\r\nhesitate; and a person who suffers injury caused by such conduct\r\nmay have a cause of action.\").\r\nThe Defendants' second and related argument, that the\r\ngovernment was acting as a speaker and therefore may make content-\r\nbased choices, must be rejected for a different reason: it rests on\r\na factual premise we cannot now accept.  In assessing whether a Fed\r\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion was properly denied, we confine our\r\nanalysis to the pleadings, as did the district court.  See Doyle v.\r\nHasbro, Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 190 (1st Cir. 1996).  Nowhere in the\r\ncomplaint is there a hint that the Defendants were \"trying to\r\nadvance [their] own speech interests\" by withdrawing the\r\nadvertisements.  Rather, the complaint alleges that the Defendants\r\npunished El Dia for asserting its speech interests.  Discovery may\r\nyet show the Defendants were only, or at least primarily,\r\ninterested in \"ensuring that the force and credibility of its\r\nadvertising messages [we]re not undermined by the surrounding\r\neditorial context.\"  Br. of Defendants at 16.  If so, the qualified\r\nimmunity question may well be cast in a different light.  Cf.Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 685 (giving the government the opportunity to\r\n\"persuade the District Court that [its] legitimate interests as\r\ncontractor, deferentially viewed, outweigh the free speech\r\ninterests at stake\"); see also Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299,\r\n307 (1996) (permitting the qualified immunity defense to be raised\r\nat subsequent stages in the same case, even where it has been\r\npreviously rejected).  Because the second argument is based on\r\nassertions not found in the complaint, we must decline to consider\r\nit on this appeal.\r\n                         IV.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\r\ndenial of the Defendants' motion to dismiss on qualified immunity\r\ngrounds.\r\nAffirmed.

Mills, 836 F.2d 659, 668-69 (1st Cir.1987), the Defendants argue that law from outside this circuit, standing on its own, cannot constitute clearly established law for the purposes of the qualified immunity defense.  We do not read Knight to establish such a broad proposition.  The question in that case was one explicitly reserved by the Supreme Court.  In any event, the decisions we have cited hardly stand on their own.  See, e.g., Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 673, 685, 116 S.Ct. 2342;  Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc., 964 F.2d at 40-41;  cf., e.g., Ackerley Com. of Mass., Inc. v. City of Somerville, 878 F.2d 513, 521 (1st Cir.1989) (municipality may not use protected speech as a basis on which to decide whether advertisers will be permitted to continue to post billboard advertisements that do not conform with current law);  Packish v. McMurtrie, 697 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1983) (selectmen may not retaliate against fireman's political speech by refusing him discretionary indemnification for medical expenses).  Moreover, we are not inclined to adopt either a hard-and-fast rule that precedent from another circuit is always determinative of whether a law is clearly established, see Romero v. Kitsap County, 931 F.2d 624, 629 (9th Cir.1991), or a rule that such precedent is always irrelevant, cf.  Ohio Civil Serv.  Employees Ass'n v. Seiter, 858 F.2d 1171, 1177 (6th Cir.1988) (other courts relevant only in \"extraordinary case\").  Among other factors, the location and level of the precedent, its date, its persuasive force, and its level of factual similarity to the facts before this Court may all be pertinent to whether a particular precedent \"clearly establishes\" law for the purposes of a qualified immunity analysis.

(\"El Dia\").  Specifically, the Defendants argue that they did not violate \"clearly established\" First Amendment law by allegedly withdrawing substantial government advertising from a newspaper to punish the paper for criticizing the Rossello administration.  On this interlocutory appeal, we affirm the district court's denial of the Defendants' motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a motion to dismiss, we accept all well-pleaded facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.

El Dia owns, operates, and publishes El Nueva Dia, a daily Spanish-language newspaper circulated in Puerto Rico.  Beginning in January 1997, El Nueva Dia published a series of articles alleging patterns of fraud and waste in the Rossello Administration.  On April 13, 1997, El Nueva Dia published an article critical of Governor Rossello's first one hundred days of his second term in office.  On April 14, 1997, eighteen government agencies that had routinely advertised in El Nueva Dia terminated advertising contracts with the newspaper.  El Dia alleges that the Defendants ordered withdrawal of the advertising in retaliation for the critical articles.  El Dia also alleges that, in a series of meetings over several months, the Defendants subsequently offered to return the advertising to El Dia if the newspaper wrote favorable editorials regarding certain of the government's initiatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 9, 1997, El Dia filed a three-count civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  Count one, the only count that is the subject of this appeal, requested both damages and injunctive relief for violations of El Dia's First Amendment rights predicated on the allegedly retaliatory withdrawal of advertising.  On January 28, 1998, the Defendants moved to dismiss all claims seeking to recover money damages against them in their individual capacities on grounds of qualified immunity.  On August 28, 1998, the district court denied the motion to dismiss.  The court found that the acts alleged in count one, if proven, would violate \"clearly established\" law and that the qualified immunity defense was therefore unavailable.

Because the law was clearly established at the time the Defendants allegedly withdrew the advertising, the Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.  See Harlow, 457 U.S. at 819, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In assessing whether a Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion was properly denied, we confine our analysis to the pleadings, as did the district court.  See Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197138\"><a href=\"/opinion/197138/boyle-v-hasbro-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 190 (1st Cir.1996).  Nowhere in the complaint is there a hint that the Defendants were \"trying to advance [their] own speech interests\" by withdrawing the advertisements.  Rather, the complaint alleges that the Defendants punished El Dia for asserting its speech interests.  Discovery may yet show the Defendants were only, or at least primarily, interested in \"ensuring that the force and credibility of its advertising messages [we]re not undermined by the surrounding editorial context.\"   Br. of Defendants at 16.  If so, the qualified immunity question may well be cast in a different light.  Cf. Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 685, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118059\"><a href=\"/opinion/118059/board-of-commrs-wabaunsee-cty-v-umbehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2342</span></a></span> (giving the government the opportunity to \"persuade the District Court that [its] legitimate interests as contractor, deferentially viewed, outweigh the free speech interests at stake\");  see also Behrens v. Pelletier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 307, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In some circumstances, as when an earlier case expressly leaves open whether a general rule applies to the particular type of conduct at issue, a very high degree of prior factual particularity may be necessary....  But general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning....  [T]he easiest cases don't even arise.  There has never been ... a section 1983 case accusing welfare officials of selling foster children into slavery;  it does not follow that if such a case arose, the officials would be immune from damages [or criminal] liability.</p>\n        <p>Lanier, 117 S.Ct. at 1227-28 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted;  last alteration and last ellipsis in original).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Citing Knight v.

We do not read Knight to establish such a broad proposition.  The question in that case was one explicitly reserved by the Supreme Court.  In any event, the decisions we have cited hardly stand on their own.  See, e.g., Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 673, 685, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118059\"><a href=\"/opinion/118059/board-of-commrs-wabaunsee-cty-v-umbehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2342</span></a></span>;  Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc., 964 F.2d at 40-41;  cf., e.g., Ackerley Com. of Mass., Inc. v. City of Somerville, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525551\"><a href=\"/opinion/525551/ackerley-communications-of-massachusetts-inc-v-city-of-somerville/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 521 (1st Cir.1989) (municipality may not use protected speech as a basis on which to decide whether advertisers will be permitted to continue to post billboard advertisements that do not conform with current law);  Packish v. McMurtrie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"412700\"><a href=\"/opinion/412700/george-w-packish-v-heather-mcmurtrie/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1983) (selectmen may not retaliate against fireman's political speech by refusing him discretionary indemnification for medical expenses).  Moreover, we are not inclined to adopt either a hard-and-fast rule that precedent from another circuit is always determinative of whether a law is clearly established, see Romero v. Kitsap County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559960\"><a href=\"/opinion/559960/john-romero-dean-harvey-david-seaver-philip-r-holt-steven-l-holt-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 629 (9th Cir.1991), or a rule that such precedent is always irrelevant, cf.  Ohio Civil Serv.  Employees Ass'n v. Seiter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512622\"><a href=\"/opinion/512622/ohio-civil-service-employees-association-v-richard-p-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1171</span></a></span>, 1177 (6th Cir.1988) (other courts relevant only in \"extraordinary case\").  Among other factors, the location and level of the precedent, its date, its persuasive force, and its level of factual similarity to the facts before this Court may all be pertinent to whether a particular precedent \"clearly establishes\" law for the purposes of a qualified immunity analysis.  See Johnson-El v. Schoemehl, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525636\"><a href=\"/opinion/525636/tyrone-antonio-johnson-el-arnold-fredrick-hamilton-el-david-scott-hill-el/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1043</span></a></span>, 1049 (8th Cir.1989)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
