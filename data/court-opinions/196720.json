Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r                                                      \r\n               Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r                                                          \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nMaximiliano Amparo Concepcion on brief pro se.\r                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  We agree with  the district court that\r                                \r\n\nplaintiff's allegations with respect to his  dental treatment\r\n\nwere  insufficient to  state a  constitutional claim,  and we\r\n\naffirm  the   dismissal  of  that  claim.     Plaintiff  also\r\n\ncontended, however, that the correctional facility has no law\r\n\nlibrary and outlined a denial of access to courts claim.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court did not address  this claim when it dismissed\r\n\nplaintiff's action.  We conclude that plaintiff stated enough\r\n\nto survive a  sua sponte  dismissal of the  access to  courts\r\n\nclaim  and therefore  vacate  the judgment  of dismissal  and\r\n\nremand  for further  consideration  of the  access to  courts\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n     Vacated and remanded.\r                                     \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
