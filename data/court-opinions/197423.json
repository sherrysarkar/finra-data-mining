Two of the men are guilty, having pled so.  The third,\r\n\nFernando Montilla-Rivera  (\"Montilla\"),  asserts that  he  is\r\n\ninnocent.    He  trusted his  fate  to  a  jury,  and he  was\r\n\nconvicted  of aiding and abetting  the crime, in violation of\r\n\n21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1)  and 860(a), and  18 U.S.C.    2.  On\r\n\nappeal, Montilla argues that the government's evidence showed\r\n\nno  more than that he  was present during  the sale, and that\r\n\nthis \"mere presence\" is  insufficient to support the verdict.\r\n\nHe also  argues that the  trial judge erred in  denying him a\r\n\nnew  trial  when,  a  year  after  his  conviction,  Montilla\r\n\npresented affidavits  from the  other two men,  each swearing\r\n\nthat Montilla was innocent.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     We  recite the facts  as the jury  could have reasonably\r\n\nfound  them.  United  States v. Andrade,  94 F.3d 9,  10 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1996).   On  March 22,  1995,  Eladio Valerio,  a  Drug\r\n\nEnforcement Agency confidential informant,  made a phone call\r\n\nin  search of  drugs.   He  called Miguel  Calder n-Salmiento\r\n\n(\"Calder n\"), who  would later  become a codefendant  in this\r\n\ncase.   In  a  taped conversation,  which  was clearly  about\r\n\narranging a drug purchase, Calder n told the informant, \"Come\r\n\non down here to . . . to go over to the mechanic at 12.\"  The\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ninformant explained that he could not \"come on down\" that day\r\n\nbecause the funds were  not ready.  There were  several other\r\n\ntaped  conversations  about the  deal.    At that  time,  the\r\n\nmechanic  working at  the mechanic's  shop to  which Calder n\r\n\nreferred was Montilla.  \r\n\n     A  few days  later,  on March  24, 1995,  the informant,\r\n\nwired and accompanied by  DEA Agent Domingo Carrasquillo, did\r\n\nmeet with Calder n.  The informant and Calder n initially met\r\n\nat a service station, where Calder n invited the informant to\r\n\ngo \"see the  mechanic.\"   The informant  understood that  \"by\r\n\nseeing the mechanic,\" Calder n meant they would go \"where the\r\n\nmaterial  or the drug was.\"  Agent Carrasquillo went ahead to\r\n\na shopping  center where he expected the  drug transaction to\r\n\ntake place.  \r\n\n     Calder n  drove the  informant to  an auto  repair shop,\r\n\nbehind  the Metreza night club in San Ant n, which was within\r\n\none thousand  feet of a public school.  The shop was a wooden\r\n\nstructure  attached at one  end to the  club and open  at the\r\n\nother.  There was  a small room inside  the shop; the  repair\r\n\nwork took place outside of this room.  \r\n\n     At the shop, the informant  saw Ram n Zorrilla, who also\r\n\nlater became a codefendant  in this case, and Montilla.   The\r\n\ninformant  shook  hands  with  them, but  did  not  speak  to\r\n\nMontilla.   Montilla  wore  overalls and  had  grease on  his\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nclothes;  Zorrilla did not.  The  four men then went into the\r\n\nsmall room.\r\n\n     Once inside,  the dealing  began in earnest  between the\r\n\ninformant,    Calder n,   and   Zorrilla.      During   these\r\n\nnegotiations,  Montilla was  ten  to twelve  feet away,  just\r\n\ninside the  entrance to  the room, \"watching  [and] looking.\"\r\n\nThe  informant and the other  two negotiated and  agreed on a\r\n\nprice  of $12,100 per kilogram of cocaine.  As Montilla stood\r\n\nat the entrance, still  watching, the three other men  agreed\r\n\nthat  if the quality of  the initial two  kilograms was high,\r\n\nfour more would be purchased.  At that point, Zorrilla made a\r\n\ncall from the room to have the cocaine delivered to the shop,\r\n\nrequesting \"two shoes.\"   The informant called his \"partner,\"\r\n\nin  reality  DEA  Agent  Carrasquillo,  to  arrange  for  the\r\n\nexchange of the cocaine for cash.  While they waited  for the\r\n\ndelivery, and  with Montilla still at  the entrance, Calder n\r\n\nloudly commented on the quality of the cocaine: \"[H]ell, pure\r\n\ncocaine.\" (\"Diablo, coca na  pura.\") \r\n\n     The  drugs  were delivered  to  the shop.    As Montilla\r\n\nwatched, the informant tasted the cocaine and pronounced that\r\n\nit was good  and that the \"deal was on.\"   The informant went\r\n\noff  with  Calder n  to  the  shopping  center  to  meet  the\r\n\ninformant's  partner,  who  had  the  money.    Montilla  and\r\n\nZorrilla stayed behind with the cocaine at the shop.  \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n     At the shopping center,  the partner showed Calder n the\r\n\ncash.    The men agreed  that Calder n would  return alone to\r\n\nthe repair  shop, and that  ten minutes later,  the informant\r\n\nand his partner would bring the money for the exchange.  Back\r\n\nat  the shop, the \"partner\"  agent told the  informant to get\r\n\nout of the  car, go into the  mechanic's shop, and bring  out\r\n\nthe  people involved in the  transaction.  The informant went\r\n\ninto the  small room,  told Montilla, Zorrilla,  and Calder n\r\n\nthat \"someone was waiting for them in the car, [and] for them\r\n\nto  take the material and give them the money.\"  Zorrilla and\r\n\nthe informant  approached the  car and asked  the partner  to\r\n\ncome into the shop, where they would make the  exchange.  The\r\n\npartner refused and said the delivery should be made outside.\r\n\nZorrilla  complied and  went back  into the  shop to  get the\r\n\ndrugs.   The three men -- Calder n, Zorrilla, and Montilla --\r\n\ncame  back  toward the  street,  with  Calder n carrying  the\r\n\ndrugs.  Montilla and  Zorrilla had moved to where  they could\r\n\nwatch  the transaction  from  the front  of  the shop,  about\r\n\nthirty feet away from the partner's car.  \r\n\n     All  three  men  were  arrested where  they  stood  when\r\n\nCalder n  made the delivery.   At the time  of arrest, others\r\n\nwere in the shop, including the shop owner and a visitor.  At\r\n\nno time during the transaction did the informant see Montilla\r\n\nworking on a car. \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n     As the  government conceded,  its videotape of  the drug\r\n\ndelivery and  arrest did not show Montilla; nor do any of the\r\n\naudiotapes   of  the   transactions  contain   recordings  of\r\n\nMontilla's voice.  In fact, the government at trial described\r\n\nMontilla as  a minor  participant, but a  knowing participant\r\n\nnonetheless, who had acted as a lookout.\r\n\n     Montilla's  defense was mistaken identity, that Zorrilla\r\n\nwas the  \"mechanic\" referred to in  the initial conversation.\r\n\nZorrilla was a mechanic and had worked at this shop some four\r\n\nmonths earlier.  Calder n was not a mechanic.  \r\n\n     Montilla did not  testify at trial.  His  first witness,\r\n\nthe shop  owner, testified that  Montilla had worked  for him\r\n\nthere for  about a month, that Zorrilla,  not Montilla, lived\r\n\nin the  room at  the shop,  and that  Montilla had  just been\r\n\ndoing his job, repairing a car  that was to be picked up that\r\n\nday.  The owner also said that Zorrilla had worked for him at\r\n\nthe shop for over a year, but had not worked there during the\r\n\nprevious four months.   The owner explained that just  before\r\n\nMontilla  went outside to the front of  the shop where he was\r\n\narrested, Montilla had  said that he was stepping  outside to\r\n\nhave a soft drink  and to smoke.  Montilla's  second witness,\r\n\nwho was visiting the shop during the incident, testified that\r\n\nhe  had seen  Montilla  working on  a  car until  he  stepped\r\n\noutside to have  a cigarette  since the owner  did not  allow\r\n\nsmoking inside the shop.  The jury convicted Montilla, and he\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nwas  sentenced to  five years  in prison  and eight  years of\r\n\nsupervised release.\r\n\n     Montilla originally  planned to call  both Zorrilla  and\r\n\nCalder n  as witnesses.  The two entered guilty pleas on June\r\n\n27, 1995.   On June 29, 1995, Montilla filed a motion to have\r\n\nthe Marshal's  Service produce  his codefendants  to testify.\r\n\nThe  court  granted  the  motion, but  the  two  codefendants\r\n\ninformed the court, on advice  of and through their  counsel,\r\n\nthat  they would  not testify  for Montilla.     Montilla was\r\n\nconvicted  on July 1, 1995.   Calder n and  Zorrilla were not\r\n\nsentenced until September 26, 1995.  \r\n\n     On  July 17,  1996, Montilla  filed a  motion for  a new\r\n\ntrial under  Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.  The motion attached nearly\r\n\nidentical affidavits from Zorrilla  and Calder n.  Zorrilla's\r\n\naffidavit said in relevant part:\r\n\n          I never knew Mr. Fernando Montilla as qa [sic] drug\r\n     dealer nor that  he was  or has been  involved in  drugs\r\n     [sic]  dealing but  as  a good  har  [sic] worker  as  a\r\n     mechanic.\r\n\n          I state that Mr.  Fernando Montilla was not involve\r\n     [sic]  in the  drugs [sic]  transaction occurred  on the\r\n     date of my arrest and for which I pled guilty.\r\n\nCalder n's affidavit stated in part:\r\n\n          At  no  time,  I  have [sic]  been  aware  that Mr.\r\n     Fernando  Montilla  has  been  involved in  any  illegal\r\n     activity  like  the  one  for which  he  was  convicted,\r\n     possession with intent to  distribute cocaine.  In other\r\n     words, Mr.  Fernando Montilla  was not involve  [sic] in\r\n     the offense for which I pled guilty.\r\n\n          At all time [sic] I knew Mr. Fernando Montilla as a\r\n     hard mechanic worker and anything [sic] else.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nCiting United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 116 S. Ct. 2554 (1995), the district court denied the\r                  \r\n\nnew trial motion on the grounds that the witnesses were known\r\n\nand available at  the time of  trial.  Thus,  in the  court's\r\n\nview, Montilla did not meet the requirements of Fed. R. Crim.\r\n\nP. 33.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n     In our sufficiency of  the evidence review, we determine\r\n\nwhether,   drawing   all   reasonable   inferences   in   the\r\n\ngovernment's favor, a rational jury could find guilt beyond a\r\n\nreasonable doubt.  Andrade, 94 F.3d at 12.\r                                      \r\n\n     Montilla argues that the jury was faced with two equally\r\n\nlikely scenarios, one of which was  that he was innocent.  He\r\n\nasserts  that under United States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16 (1st\r                                                        \r\n\nCir.  1995), this  is insufficient  to meet  the government's\r\n\nburden  of   proof  of  guilt  beyond   a  reasonable  doubt.\r\n\nMontilla's  statement of  the  law is  correct.   Id.  at  22\r                                                                 \r\n\n(\"When  a  jury is  confronted . . . with  equally persuasive\r\n\ntheories of  guilt and  innocence, it cannot  rationally find\r\n\nguilt  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.\").    However,  Montilla\r\n\nunderstates the case against him.\r\n\n     The guilt  of Zorrilla and  Calder n is admitted.   When\r\n\nCalder n and Zorrilla were negotiating the deal at  the shop,\r\n\nMontilla  was constantly  present.  Criminal  conspirators do\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nnot often \"welcome  innocent nonparticipants as witnesses  to\r\n\ntheir crimes.\"   United  States v. Batista-Polanco,  927 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n14, 18 (1st  Cir. 1991);  see also United  States v.  Cuevas-\r                                                                         \r\n\nEsquivel, 905  F.2d 510, 515 (1st Cir.  1990).  No effort was\r                    \r\n\nmade  to keep the illicit deal from Montilla's ears.  Indeed,\r\n\nZorrilla loudly  bragged about the  purity of the  cocaine in\r\n\nfront of Montilla. \r\n\n     Still,  mere  association  with  a   principal  or  mere\r\n\npresence while  criminal activity is  going on around  one is\r\n\nnot  enough  to  establish  aiding and  abetting,  even  when\r\n\ncombined  with knowledge that a crime will be committed.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States  v. Luciano-Mosquera,  63 F.3d 1142,  1150 (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir.  1995),  cert.  denied, 116  S.  Ct.  1879  (1996).   As\r                                       \r\n\nMontilla points out, this was a crime-ridden neighborhood and\r\n\nknowledge by  Montilla that those around  him were committing\r\n\ncrimes  does  not necessarily  mean  that he  was  aiding and\r\n\nabetting those crimes.  \r\n\n     While knowledge is certainly  an element of the offense,\r\n\nid.,  (and  the  facts   here  abundantly  show   knowledge),\r               \r\n\nsomething  more, some action to assist the crimes, is needed.\r\n\nSee  id.   To convict  Montilla of  aiding and  abetting, the\r                    \r\n\ngovernment had  to prove that his  codefendants committed the\r\n\ncrime,  and  that  Montilla  associated  himself   with,  and\r\n\nparticipated in  the drug transaction as  something he wished\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nto bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\r\n\nUnited States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1499 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                                 \r\n\n     The  government says  that  the something  more is  that\r\n\nMontilla  acted as  a lookout.   Several inferences  from the\r\n\nevidence  support the  government's position.   The  first is\r\n\nthat Montilla was at the entrance to  the small room where he\r\n\ncould  act as a lookout while the drug deal negotiations were\r\n\nbeing conducted and was  not in the shop repairing cars.  The\r\n\nsecond is that, when the  informant told the men it was  time\r\n\nto deliver the drugs to his partner, all three men, including\r\n\nMontilla, left  the small room to go out toward the car.  The\r\n\nthird is that Montilla,  who did not have the  drugs, stopped\r\n\njust outside the shop, and from that vantage watched.  He was\r\n\nwell-situated to  act as  a lookout,  and an  arresting agent\r\n\nthought that was exactly what Montilla was doing.\r\n\n     The evidence is thin,  but not so thin as  to invalidate\r\n\nthe jury's reasonable assessment that Montilla is guilty.\r\n\nNew Trial Motion\r                            \r\n\n     The  district  court's denial  of the  motion for  a new\r\n\ntrial  is reviewable only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\r\n\nAndrade, 94 F.3d at 14.   A district court's power to order a\r                   \r\n\nnew trial  is greater than  its power  to grant a  motion for\r\n\nacquittal.  Ruiz, 105 F.3d at 1500.\r                            \r\n\n     Rule  33  of the  Federal  Rules  of Criminal  Procedure\r\n\nauthorizes a district court to grant a new trial \"if required\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nin the interest of justice.\"1  Where, as here,  the motion is\r\n\nbased   on  new  or   previously  unavailable  evidence,  the\r\n\ndefendant  has  to  establish  that \"the  evidence  was:  (i)\r\n\nunknown or unavailable at the time of trial, (ii) despite due\r\n\ndiligence, (iii)  material, and (iv)  likely to result  in an\r\n\nacquittal upon retrial.\"  Tibolt, 72 F.3d at 971. \r                                            \r\n\n     Although the new statements by the two principals of the\r\n\ndrug transaction that Montilla is innocent appear facially to\r\n\nsatisfy the third and fourth elements of the test,2 our focus\r\n\nis  on the  first element  of the test.   The  district court\r\n\ndenied  the motion on the  ground that the  evidence was both\r\n\nknown and available.   Similarly, the government,  apparently\r\n\nconceding  the third  and  fourth elements,  argues that  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 states in relevant part:\r\n     The  court on a motion  of a defendant  may grant a\r\n     new  trial to  that  defendant if  required in  the\r\n     interest  of justice. . . .    A motion  for a  new\r\n     trial  based  on  the  ground  of  newly discovered\r\n     evidence  may be  made  only before  or within  two\r\n     years  after final  judgment, but  if an  appeal is\r\n     pending  the court  may  grant the  motion only  on\r\n     remand of the case.\r\n\n2.  The  statements are material and appear to give rise to a\r\n\"reasonable\" probability  of acquittal upon retrial.   United\r                                                                         \r\nStates v.  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1216, 1229 (1st Cir. 1993).  In\r                                \r\nsaying  this, we  are  taking account  of  the ambiguity  and\r\nthinness  of  the inculpatory  evidence  and  are taking  the\r\nexculpatory  statements at  face value.   Whether  the latter\r\nwould  retain  their  force  after  close  examination  is  a\r\ndifferent  question; as we note below, a hearing might cast a\r\ndifferent light on these statements.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ntestimony  was neither  unknown,  nor unavailable.   It  also\r\n\nasserts that Montilla did not exercise due diligence.  \r\n\n     In  this  lies  the  problem.    Both  the  government's\r\n\narguments   and  the  district  court's  ruling  assume  that\r\n\nZorrilla  and  Calder n  were   \"available\"  to  testify   at\r\n\nMontilla's trial.   But  Montilla, who, it  facially appears,\r\n\nhad diligently attempted to  secure their testimony,3 did not\r\n\nhave the  power to  compel them  to testify  at his trial  in\r\n\nlight of  their Fifth Amendment privileges  once they changed\r\n\ntheir minds about testifying.\r\n\n     Montilla's  trial commenced on  June 27, 1995.   On that\r\n\nsame day, Calder n  and Zorrilla entered pleas  of guilty and\r\n\nthe  court  accepted  their  pleas.    Their  sentencing  was\r\n\ndeferred until  September, 1995.   Calder n's  and Zorrilla's\r\n\ncounsel  each advised his client not  to testify for Montilla\r\n\nbecause the  testimony might incriminate them  with regard to\r\n\nother transactions  and  because the  men still  had to  face\r\n\nsentencing proceedings.   Exercising their  privilege against\r\n\nself-incrimination,  Calder n and Zorrilla informed the court\r\n\nthat they would not testify, and they were excused.   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  According  to  Montilla's   trial  attorney's   affidavit\r\nsubmitted in support of the motion for a new trial, he  tried\r\non two separate occasions to interview Zorrilla and Calder n,\r\nbut they refused to  give him any information.  (The dates of\r\nthese  attempts  are  unclear).    Despite  not  knowing  the\r\ncontents of their testimony, the trial attorney moved to have\r\nZorrilla  and Calder n  subpoenaed  to testify.   His  client\r\nMontilla  insisted that  the  testimony would  exculpate  him\r\nrather than hurt him.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n     We have recognized that an unsentenced defendant who has\r\n\npled guilty retains a legitimate protectable  Fifth Amendment\r\n\ninterest  as  to  matters  that could  affect  his  sentence.\r\n\nUnited States v.  De La Cruz,  996 F.2d 1307, 1312  (1st Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1993); see United  States v.

Further,   the  potential\r\n\nimportance of  the presentence phase  of criminal proceedings\r\n\nto a defendant is highlighted by Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e) which\r\n\nexpressly  permits  a defendant  to  withdraw  a guilty  plea\r\n\nbefore  a sentence is imposed  by showing \"any  fair and just\r\n\nreason.\"   It was an error  of law for the  district court to\r\n\nhold that the testimony of these witnesses was  available per\r\n\nse.  \r\n\n     This  then  poses  a  legal  question,  not   explicitly\r\n\naddressed  by the  government.   Rule  33  permits new  trial\r\n\nmotions to be filed  within two years only if the evidence is\r\n\n\"newly  discovered.\"     If   the  evidence  is   not  \"newly\r\n\ndiscovered,\" and  the  motion was not filed within  the seven\r\n\ndays  otherwise  required,  then  the  district  court  lacks\r\n\njurisdiction to hear  the motion.

These courts\r\n\nhave  held that such testimony is not newly discovered.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., United States v.

This circuit  has, for almost twenty years,  held\r\n\nthat the  \"newly discovered\" language of  Rule 33 encompasses\r\n\nevidence  that  was \"unavailable.\"    See  Vega Pelegrina  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nUnited States, 601 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1979).  In this, our\r                         \r\n\ntest has differed from  that of other circuits, as  the cases\r\n\ncited  above demonstrate.    Indeed, in  Vega Pelegrina,  the\r                                                                   \r\n\nnewly discovered evidence was  the testimony of a codefendant\r\n\nwho  had refused  to testify  for defendant  at trial,  or to\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nrecant  a prior  inculpatory statement  until the  statute of\r\n\nlimitations had run.

This panel is not  free, on its own, to alter circuit\r\n\nprecedent absent  some intervening  reason such as  a Supreme\r\n\nCourt decision or new legislation.  \r\n\n     Furthermore, given the  \"[i]n the interests of  justice\"\r\n\nstandard  of  Fed.   R.  Crim.  P.  33,  there  seems  little\r\n\ndistinction  between evidence  which  a defendant  could  not\r\n\npresent because he  did not know of it  and evidence which he\r\n\ncould not present because the witness was unavailable despite\r\n\nexercising due diligence.   At least in the context  of newly\r\n\navailable evidence from  one not a codefendant,  at least two\r\n\ncircuits  appear to agree.  See United States v. Garland, 991\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  328, 335  (6th  Cir. 1993)  (ordering  new trial  where\r\n\n\"although the  defense knew of  [witness's] existence  before\r\n\nand during  the trial,  [the witness]  was not located  until\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nafter the trial.\"); United  States v.

It is true that there is a\r\n\ngreater need for caution in considering Rule 33 motions where\r\n\nthe   new  evidence   comes  from   a  codefendant   who  was\r\n\n\"unavailable\"  at  trial because  he  chose  to exercise  his\r\n\nprivilege.   See DiBernardo, 880 F.2d at  1224; United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Jacobs, 475 F.2d 270, 286 n.33 (2d Cir. 1973).   It is not\r                     \r\n\nunusual for the obviously guilty codefendant to try to assume\r\n\nthe  entire guilt.  United States v. Alejandro, 527 F.2d 423,\r                                                          \r\n\n428 (5th Cir. 1976).  A convicted,  sentenced codefendant has\r\n\nlittle  to  lose  (and perhaps  something  to  gain)  by such\r\n\ntestimony.  United States  v. Freeman, 77 F.3d 812,  817 (5th\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1996).   \"Such  testimony  [by sentenced  codefendants]\r\n\nwould be untrustworthy and should not be encouraged.\"  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

On its face, the proffered testimony in the\r\n\naffidavits is material, and the testimony, if believed, could\r\n\nlead  to a  different  outcome, especially  in  light of  the\r\n\ngovernment's  sufficient,  but  underwhelming,  case  against\r\n\nMontilla.  See  Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d at 383 (\"It is true\r                                           \r\n\nthat  where  the  trial  evidence was  noticeably  thin,  new\r\n\nexculpatory evidence may be  of increased importance.\").  The\r\n\nnew  testimony, while it may  not be true,  is not inherently\r\n\nimplausible.    And we  note  that  Montilla has  steadfastly\r\n\nmaintained his  innocence, even through  sentencing, at  some\r\n\ncost.    Because  he  refused  to  acknowledge  that  he  had\r\n\ncommitted  a crime,  Montilla  was  ineligible  for  sentence\r\n\nreductions for  acceptance of  responsibility under  the U.S.\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines.\r\n\n     The term  \"on its face\"  is used  deliberately here  and\r\n\nwith no  suggestion  that the  codefendants' newly  available\r\n\ntestimony  is true.  That  the codefendants waited  a year to\r\n\ncome  forward   hardly  supports   the   strength  of   their\r\n\nassertions.  But there is enough to commit the matter back to\r\n\nthe  district   court,  which  is  itself,   under  the  law,\r\n\nresponsible for weighing the factors under Rule 33:\r\n\n     Motions  for  new   trial  are   directed  to   the\r\n     discretion of the trial court.  In considering such\r\n     a motion,  the court has  broad power to  weigh the\r\n     evidence  and assess  the credibility  of both  the\r\n     witnesses who  testified at trial  and those  whose\r\n     testimony constitutes \"new\" evidence.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nWright, 625 F.2d at 1019.

United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Kearney, 682  F.2d 214, 218 (D.C. Cir.  1982).  Had\r                             \r\n\nthe district  court itself  ruled otherwise on  the issue  of\r\n\nunavailability, it might have  chosen to have a hearing.   We\r\n\nthink  it wiser  here for the  district court to  hold such a\r\n\nhearing given the unusual  combination of circumstances here.\r\n\nMontilla's conviction rests almost entirely  on the testimony\r\n\nof  the  DEA  informant.    Neither  the  videotape  nor  the\r\n\naudiotape directly  incriminate Montilla.   The reference  on\r\n\nthe  audiotape   to  the  mechanic  could   equally  well  be\r\n\nunderstood  to refer to the location of  the deal, and not to\r\n\nthe role of the mechanic.   Only the informant places him  in\r\n\nthe  small  room;  Montilla's  other  witnesses  say  he  was\r\n\nrepairing  a car.    A hearing  will  be helpful4  where  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  In   different  contexts,   such  as   reported  improper\r\ncommunications   with  jurors,  hearings  have  been  thought\r\nnecessary before there  is a  ruling on a  new trial  motion.\r\nRemmer  v.

The  credibility of  the witnesses  is important.\r\n\nNeither Calder n nor Zorrilla testified before -- this is not\r\n\na recantation of  testimony situation where the court has had\r\n\nan opportunity to assess credibility.5\r\n\n     We believe  the district court should,  after a hearing,\r\n\nreconsider whether,  as Rule  33 provides, \"the  interests of\r\n\njustice require a new trial.\"  See Ouimette, 753 F.2d at 192-\r                                                       \r\n\n93  (remanding to the district court for hearing on new trial\r\n\nmotion where affidavit presented new testimony going to issue\r\n\nof defendant's guilt); Lyles v.

United States v.\r                                                                      \r\nCrooker,  729 F.2d 889, 890 (1st Cir. 1984); United States v.\r                                                                      \r\nFournier, 594 F.2d 276, 279 (1st Cir. 1979).\r                    \r\n\n5.  Some courts have  concluded that  affidavits from  others\r\nrecanting their  earlier testimony  may be deemed  inherently\r\nnot credible.   See, e.g.,  United States  v. Leibowitz,  919\r                                                                   \r\nF.2d 482, 483 (7th Cir. 1990) (only partial hearing conducted\r\non new trial motion).  \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n     As  already  observed, we  disagree  with  the decisions\r\n\ntreating the  belated  statements of  codefendants  aimed  at\r\n\nexculpating the moving defendant as per se insufficient under\r\n\nRule 33.   But  we  share the  general skepticism  concerning\r\n\nthose statements, and the present opinion by no means confers\r\n\nany automatic right in such a case to  a new trial or even to\r\n\na hearing.   Our judgment here turns on unusual circumstances\r\n\nincluding the  weakness of the government's  case against the\r\n\ndefendant, significant  efforts to procure  the codefendants'\r\n\ntestimony  before  his  own  conviction,  and  the  plausible\r\n\nexplanation as to why the evidence was not available earlier.\r\n\n     The  case is  remanded for  proceedings  consistent with\r                                       \r\n\nthis opinion.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n",

He trusted his fate to a jury, and he was convicted of aiding and abetting the crime, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;  &#167; 841(a)(1) and 860(a), and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.

United States v. Andrade, 94 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir.1996).  On March 22, 1995, Eladio Valerio, a Drug Enforcement Agency confidential informant, made a phone call in search of drugs.  He called Miguel Caldern-Salmiento (\"Caldern\"), who would later become a codefendant in this case.  In a taped conversation, which was clearly about arranging a drug purchase, Caldern told the informant, \"Come on down here to ... to go over to the mechanic at 12.\"   The informant explained that he could not \"come on down\" that day because the funds were not ready.  There were several other taped conversations about the deal.  At that time, the mechanic working at the mechanic's shop to which Caldern referred was Montilla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, on March 24, 1995, the informant, wired and accompanied by DEA Agent Domingo Carrasquillo, did meet with Caldern.  The informant and Caldern initially met at a service station, where Caldern invited the informant to go \"see the mechanic.\"   The informant understood that \"by seeing the mechanic,\" Caldern meant they would go \"where the material or the drug was.\"   Agent Carrasquillo went ahead to a shopping center where he expected the drug transaction to take place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldern drove the informant to an auto repair shop, behind the Metreza night club in San Antn, which was within one thousand feet of a public school.  The shop was a wooden structure attached at one end to the club and open at the other.  There was a small room inside the shop;  the repair work took place outside of this room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the shop, the informant saw Ramn Zorrilla, who also later became a codefendant in this case, and Montilla.  The informant shook hands with them, but did not speak to Montilla.  Montilla wore overalls and had grease on his clothes;  Zorrilla did not.  The four men then went into the small room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once inside, the dealing began in earnest between the informant, Caldern, and Zorrilla.  During these negotiations, Montilla was ten to twelve feet away, just inside the entrance to the room, \"watching [and] looking.\"   The informant and the other two negotiated and agreed on a price of $12,100 per kilogram of cocaine.  As Montilla stood at the entrance, still watching, the three other men agreed that if the quality of the initial two kilograms was high, four more would be purchased.  At that point, Zorrilla made a call from the room to have the cocaine delivered to the shop, requesting \"two shoes.\"   The informant called his \"partner,\" in reality DEA Agent Carrasquillo, to arrange for the exchange of the cocaine for cash.  While they waited for the delivery, and with Montilla still at the entrance, Caldern loudly commented on the quality of the cocaine:  \"[H]ell, pure cocaine.\"  (\"Diablo, cocana pura.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drugs were delivered to the shop.  As Montilla watched, the informant tasted the cocaine and pronounced that it was good and that the \"deal was on.\"   The informant went off with Caldern to the shopping center to meet the informant's partner, who had the money.  Montilla and Zorrilla stayed behind with the cocaine at the shop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the shopping center, the partner showed Caldern the cash.  The men agreed that Caldern would return alone to the repair shop, and that ten minutes later, the informant and his partner would bring the money for the exchange.  Back at the shop, the \"partner\" agent told the informant to get out of the car, go into the mechanic's shop, and bring out the people involved in the transaction.  The informant went into the small room, told Montilla, Zorrilla, and Caldern that \"someone was waiting for them in the car, [and] for them to take the material and give them the money.\"   Zorrilla and the informant approached the car and asked the partner to come into the shop, where they would make the exchange.  The partner refused and said the delivery should be made outside.  Zorrilla complied and went back into the shop to get the drugs.  The three men--Caldern, Zorrilla, and Montilla--came back toward the street, with Caldern carrying the drugs.  Montilla and Zorrilla had moved to where they could watch the transaction from the front of the shop, about thirty feet away from the partner's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three men were arrested where they stood when Caldern made the delivery.  At the time of arrest, others were in the shop, including the shop owner and a visitor.  At no time during the transaction did the informant see Montilla working on a car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government conceded, its videotape of the drug delivery and arrest did not show Montilla;  nor do any of the audiotapes of the transactions contain recordings of Montilla's voice.  In fact, the government at trial described Montilla as a minor participant, but a knowing participant nonetheless, who had acted as a lookout.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla's defense was mistaken identity, that Zorrilla was the \"mechanic\" referred to in the initial conversation.  Zorrilla was a mechanic and had worked at this shop some four months earlier.  Caldern was not a mechanic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla did not testify at trial.  His first witness, the shop owner, testified that Montilla had worked for him there for about a month, that Zorrilla, not Montilla, lived in the room at the shop, and that Montilla had just been doing his job, repairing a car that was to be picked up that day.  The owner also said that Zorrilla had worked for him at the shop for over a year, but had not worked there during the previous four months.  The owner explained that just before Montilla went outside to the front of the shop where he was arrested, Montilla had said that he was stepping outside to have a soft drink and to smoke.  Montilla's second witness, who was visiting the shop during the incident, testified that he had seen Montilla working on a car until he stepped outside to have a cigarette since the owner did not allow smoking inside the shop.  The jury convicted Montilla, and he was sentenced to five years in prison and eight years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla originally planned to call both Zorrilla and Caldern as witnesses.  The two entered guilty pleas on June 27, 1995.  On June 29, 1995, Montilla filed a motion to have the Marshal's Service produce his codefendants to testify.  The court granted the motion, but the two codefendants informed the court, on advice of and through their counsel, that they would not testify for Montilla.  Montilla was convicted on July 1, 1995.  Caldern and Zorrilla were not sentenced until September 26, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1996, Montilla filed a motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.  The motion attached nearly identical affidavits from Zorrilla and Caldern.  Zorrilla's affidavit said in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I never knew Mr. Fernando Montilla as qa [sic] drug dealer nor that he was or has been involved in drugs [sic] dealing but as a good har [sic] worker as a mechanic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I state that Mr. Fernando Montilla was not involve [sic] in the drugs [sic] transaction occurred on the date of my arrest and for which I pled guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Caldern's affidavit stated in part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At no time, I have [sic] been aware that Mr. Fernando Montilla has been involved in any illegal activity like the one for which he was convicted, possession with intent to distribute cocaine.  In other words, Mr. Fernando Montilla was not involve [sic] in the offense for which I pled guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At all time [sic] I knew Mr. Fernando Montilla as a hard mechanic worker and anything [sic] else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2554, 135 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1996), the district court denied the new trial motion on the grounds that the witnesses were known and available at the time of trial.  Thus, in the court's view, Montilla did not meet the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our sufficiency of the evidence review, we determine whether, drawing all reasonable inferences in the government's favor, a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Andrade, 94 F.3d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla argues that the jury was faced with two equally likely scenarios, one of which was that he was innocent.  He asserts that under United States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16 (1st Cir.1995), this is insufficient to meet the government's burden of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Montilla's statement of the law is correct.  Id. at 22 (\"When a jury is confronted ... with equally persuasive theories of guilt and innocence, it cannot rationally find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\").  However, Montilla understates the case against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guilt of Zorrilla and Caldern is admitted.  When Caldern and Zorrilla were negotiating the deal at the shop, Montilla was constantly present.  Criminal conspirators do not often \"welcome innocent nonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.\"  United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Cuevas-Esquivel, 905 F.2d 510, 515 (1st Cir.1990).  No effort was made to keep the illicit deal from Montilla's ears.  Indeed, Zorrilla loudly bragged about the purity of the cocaine in front of Montilla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, mere association with a principal or mere presence while criminal activity is going on around one is not enough to establish aiding and abetting, even when combined with knowledge that a crime will be committed.  See United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1150 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1879, 135 L.Ed.2d 174 (1996).  As Montilla points out, this was a crime-ridden neighborhood and knowledge by Montilla that those around him were committing crimes does not necessarily mean that he was aiding and abetting those crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While knowledge is certainly an element of the offense, id., (and the facts here abundantly show knowledge), something more, some action to assist the crimes, is needed.  See id.   To convict Montilla of aiding and abetting, the government had to prove that his codefendants committed the crime, and that Montilla associated himself with, and participated in the drug transaction as something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.  United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1499 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that the something more is that Montilla acted as a lookout.  Several inferences from the evidence support the government's position.  The first is that Montilla was at the entrance to the small room where he could act as a lookout while the drug deal negotiations were being conducted and was not in the shop repairing cars.  The second is that, when the informant told the men it was time to deliver the drugs to his partner, all three men, including Montilla, left the small room to go out toward the car.  The third is that Montilla, who did not have the drugs, stopped just outside the shop, and from that vantage watched.  He was well-situated to act as a lookout, and an arresting agent thought that was exactly what Montilla was doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence is thin, but not so thin as to invalidate the jury's reasonable assessment that Montilla is guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>New Trial Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of the motion for a new trial is reviewable only for a manifest abuse of discretion.  Andrade, 94 F.3d at 14.   A district court's power to order a new trial is greater than its power to grant a motion for acquittal.  Ruiz, 105 F.3d at 1500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure authorizes a district court to grant a new trial \"if required in the interest of justice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Where, as here, the motion is based on new or previously unavailable evidence, the defendant has to establish that \"the evidence was:  (i) unknown or unavailable at the time of trial, (ii) despite due diligence, (iii) material, and (iv) likely to result in an acquittal upon retrial.\"  Tibolt, 72 F.3d at 971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the new statements by the two principals of the drug transaction that Montilla is innocent appear facially to satisfy the third and fourth elements of the test,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> our focus is on the first element of the test.  The district court denied the motion on the ground that the evidence was both known and available.  Similarly, the government, apparently conceding the third and fourth elements, argues that the testimony was neither unknown, nor unavailable.  It also asserts that Montilla did not exercise due diligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this lies the problem.  Both the government's arguments and the district court's ruling assume that Zorrilla and Caldern were \"available\" to testify at Montilla's trial.  But Montilla, who, it facially appears, had diligently attempted to secure their testimony,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> did not have the power to compel them to testify at his trial in light of their Fifth Amendment privileges once they changed their minds about testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla's trial commenced on June 27, 1995.  On that same day, Caldern and Zorrilla entered pleas of guilty and the court accepted their pleas.  Their sentencing was deferred until September, 1995.  Caldern's and Zorrilla's counsel each advised his client not to testify for Montilla because the testimony might incriminate them with regard to other transactions and because the men still had to face sentencing proceedings.  Exercising their privilege against self-incrimination, Caldern and Zorrilla informed the court that they would not testify, and they were excused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that an unsentenced defendant who has pled guilty retains a legitimate protectable Fifth Amendment interest as to matters that could affect his sentence.  United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307, 1312 (1st Cir.1993);  see United States v. Zirpolo, 704 F.2d 23, 25 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1983);  see also Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454, 461-63, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 1872-73, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981) (state's efforts to compel criminal defendant to testify at sentencing phase of capital trial would contravene Fifth Amendment).  Further, the potential importance of the presentence phase of criminal proceedings to a defendant is highlighted by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e) which expressly permits a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea before a sentence is imposed by showing \"any fair and just reason.\"   It was an error of law for the district court to hold that the testimony of these witnesses was available per se.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This then poses a legal question, not explicitly addressed by the government.  Rule 33 permits new trial motions to be filed within two years only if the evidence is \"newly discovered.\"   If the evidence is not \"newly discovered,\" and the motion was not filed within the seven days otherwise required, then the district court lacks jurisdiction to hear the motion.  United States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1250 n. 12 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1109, 137 L.Ed.2d 310 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal question is whether exculpatory affidavits from codefendants who did not testify at trial because they exercised their Fifth Amendment privileges may ever qualify as \"newly discovered\" evidence within the meaning of Rule 33.  Most other circuits have expressed hostility to this notion, usually on the ground that the defendant was aware of the potential testimony at trial, even if that testimony was unavailable due to assertions of privilege.  These courts have held that such testimony is not newly discovered.  See, e.g., United States v. Theodosopoulos, 48 F.3d 1438, 1448-50 (7th Cir.1995), United States v. Muldrow, 19 F.3d 1332, 1339 (10th Cir.1994);  United States v. Dale, 991 F.2d 819, 838-39 (D.C.Cir.1993);  United States v. DiBernardo, 880 F.2d 1216, 1224-25 (11th Cir.1989);  United States v. Metz, 652 F.2d 478, 480-81 (5th Cir.1981), United States v. Diggs, 649 F.2d 731, 739-40 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the question is resolved affirmatively by our precedent.  This circuit has, for almost twenty years, held that the \"newly discovered\" language of Rule 33 encompasses evidence that was \"unavailable.\"   See Vega Pelegrina v. United States, 601 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1979).  In this, our test has differed from that of other circuits, as the cases cited above demonstrate.  Indeed, in Vega Pelegrina, the newly discovered evidence was the testimony of a codefendant who had refused to testify for defendant at trial, or to recant a prior inculpatory statement until the statute of limitations had run.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has adhered to the four part test outlined in United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017 (1st Cir.1980), for almost two decades, saying that the first question is whether the evidence \"was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at time of trial.\"  Id. at 1019 (emphasis added);  see, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d 378, 382 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v. Glantz, 884 F.2d 1483, 1486 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Martin, 815 F.2d 818, 824 (1st Cir.1987).  This panel is not free, on its own, to alter circuit precedent absent some intervening reason such as a Supreme Court decision or new legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, given the \"[i]n the interests of justice\" standard of Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, there seems little distinction between evidence which a defendant could not present because he did not know of it and evidence which he could not present because the witness was unavailable despite exercising due diligence.  At least in the context of newly available evidence from one not a codefendant, at least two circuits appear to agree.  See United States v. Garland, 991 F.2d 328, 335 (6th Cir.1993) (ordering new trial where \"although the defense knew of [witness's] existence before and during the trial, [the witness] was not located until after the trial.\");  United States v. Ouimette, 798 F.2d 47, 51-52 (2d Cir.1986) (ordering hearing on new trial where witness, while known of at trial, was unavailable after police allegedly pressured him not to testify).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the better rule is not to categorically exclude the testimony of a codefendant who asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege at trial under the first prong but to consider it, albeit with great skepticism, in the context of all prongs of our four part test.  It is true that there is a greater need for caution in considering Rule 33 motions where the new evidence comes from a codefendant who was \"unavailable\" at trial because he chose to exercise his privilege.  See DiBernardo, 880 F.2d at 1224;  United States v. Jacobs, 475 F.2d 270, 286 n. 33 (2d Cir.1973).  It is not unusual for the obviously guilty codefendant to try to assume the entire guilt.  United States v. Alejandro, 527 F.2d 423, 428 (5th Cir.1976).  A convicted, sentenced codefendant has little to lose (and perhaps something to gain) by such testimony.  United States v. Freeman, 77 F.3d 812, 817 (5th Cir.1996).  \"Such testimony [by sentenced codefendants] would be untrustworthy and should not be encouraged.\"  United States v. Reyes-Alvarado, 963 F.2d 1184, 1188 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, there is, here, at least a facial showing of compliance with the other prongs sufficient to warrant further inquiry.  On its face, the proffered testimony in the affidavits is material, and the testimony, if believed, could lead to a different outcome, especially in light of the government's sufficient, but underwhelming, case against Montilla.  See Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d at 383 (\"It is true that where the trial evidence was noticeably thin, new exculpatory evidence may be of increased importance.\").  The new testimony, while it may not be true, is not inherently implausible.  And we note that Montilla has steadfastly maintained his innocence, even through sentencing, at some cost.  Because he refused to acknowledge that he had committed a crime, Montilla was ineligible for sentence reductions for acceptance of responsibility under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"on its face\" is used deliberately here and with no suggestion that the codefendants' newly available testimony is true.  That the codefendants waited a year to come forward hardly supports the strength of their assertions.  But there is enough to commit the matter back to the district court, which is itself, under the law, responsible for weighing the factors under Rule 33:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>Motions for new trial are directed to the discretion of the trial court.  In considering such a motion, the court has broad power to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of both the witnesses who testified at trial and those whose testimony constitutes \"new\" evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019.   The judge may, of course, use the knowledge he gained from presiding at the trial, as well as the showing made in the motion.  3 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 557, at 337 (2d ed.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We follow our precedent in United States v. Abou-Saada, 785 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1986), and remand to the district court to reconsider the motion for a new trial and to hear evidence.  There is no suggestion that such hearings are required in the usual course;  they are not.  Cf. United States v. Kearney, 682 F.2d 214, 218 (D.C.Cir.1982).  Had the district court itself ruled otherwise on the issue of unavailability, it might have chosen to have a hearing.  We think it wiser here for the district court to hold such a hearing given the unusual combination of circumstances here.  Montilla's conviction rests almost entirely on the testimony of the DEA informant.  Neither the videotape nor the audiotape directly incriminate Montilla.  The reference on the audiotape to the mechanic could equally well be understood to refer to the location of the deal, and not to the role of the mechanic.  Only the informant places him in the small room;  Montilla's other witnesses say he was repairing a car.  A hearing will be helpful<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> where the matters presented by the proffer are not \"conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records of the case.\"  United States v. Carbone, 880 F.2d 1500, 1502 (1st Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The credibility of the witnesses is important.  Neither Caldern nor Zorrilla testified before--this is not a recantation of testimony situation where the court has had an opportunity to assess credibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the district court should, after a hearing, reconsider whether, as Rule 33 provides, \"the interests of justice require a new trial.\"   See Ouimette, 753 F.2d at 192-93 (remanding to the district court for hearing on new trial motion where affidavit presented new testimony going to issue of defendant's guilt);  Lyles v. United States, 272 F.2d 910, 913 (5th Cir.1959) (on new trial motion, district court \"will be in a better position to exercise its functions\" after holding hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already observed, we disagree with the decisions treating the belated statements of codefendants aimed at exculpating the moving defendant as per se insufficient under Rule 33.  But we share the general skepticism concerning those statements, and the present opinion by no means confers any automatic right in such a case to a new trial or even to a hearing.  Our judgment here turns on unusual circumstances including the weakness of the government's case against the defendant, significant efforts to procure the codefendants' testimony before his own conviction, and the plausible explanation as to why the evidence was not available earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 states in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>The court on a motion of a defendant may grant a new trial to that defendant if required in the interest of justice....

In saying this, we are taking account of the ambiguity and thinness of the inculpatory evidence and are taking the exculpatory statements at face value.  Whether the latter would retain their force after close examination is a different question;  as we note below, a hearing might cast a different light on these statements</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> According to Montilla's trial attorney's affidavit submitted in support of the motion for a new trial, he tried on two separate occasions to interview Zorrilla and Caldern, but they refused to give him any information.  (The dates of these attempts are unclear).  Despite not knowing the contents of their testimony, the trial attorney moved to have Zorrilla and Caldern subpoenaed to testify.  His client Montilla insisted that the testimony would exculpate him rather than hurt him</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In different contexts, such as reported improper communications with jurors, hearings have been thought necessary before there is a ruling on a new trial motion.

On appeal, Montilla argues that the government's evidence showed no more than that he was present during the sale, and that this \"mere presence\" is insufficient to support the verdict.

On March 22, 1995, Eladio Valerio, a Drug Enforcement Agency confidential informant, made a phone call in search of drugs.  He called Miguel Caldern-Salmiento (\"Caldern\"), who would later become a codefendant in this case.  In a taped conversation, which was clearly about arranging a drug purchase, Caldern told the informant, \"Come on down here to ... to go over to the mechanic at 12.\"   The informant explained that he could not \"come on down\" that day because the funds were not ready.  There were several other taped conversations about the deal.  At that time, the mechanic working at the mechanic's shop to which Caldern referred was Montilla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, on March 24, 1995, the informant, wired and accompanied by DEA Agent Domingo Carrasquillo, did meet with Caldern.  The informant and Caldern initially met at a service station, where Caldern invited the informant to go \"see the mechanic.\"   The informant understood that \"by seeing the mechanic,\" Caldern meant they would go \"where the material or the drug was.\"   Agent Carrasquillo went ahead to a shopping center where he expected the drug transaction to take place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldern drove the informant to an auto repair shop, behind the Metreza night club in San Antn, which was within one thousand feet of a public school.  The shop was a wooden structure attached at one end to the club and open at the other.  There was a small room inside the shop;  the repair work took place outside of this room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the shop, the informant saw Ramn Zorrilla, who also later became a codefendant in this case, and Montilla.  The informant shook hands with them, but did not speak to Montilla.  Montilla wore overalls and had grease on his clothes;  Zorrilla did not.  The four men then went into the small room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once inside, the dealing began in earnest between the informant, Caldern, and Zorrilla.  During these negotiations, Montilla was ten to twelve feet away, just inside the entrance to the room, \"watching [and] looking.\"   The informant and the other two negotiated and agreed on a price of $12,100 per kilogram of cocaine.  As Montilla stood at the entrance, still watching, the three other men agreed that if the quality of the initial two kilograms was high, four more would be purchased.  At that point, Zorrilla made a call from the room to have the cocaine delivered to the shop, requesting \"two shoes.\"   The informant called his \"partner,\" in reality DEA Agent Carrasquillo, to arrange for the exchange of the cocaine for cash.  While they waited for the delivery, and with Montilla still at the entrance, Caldern loudly commented on the quality of the cocaine:  \"[H]ell, pure cocaine.\"  (\"Diablo, cocana pura.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drugs were delivered to the shop.  As Montilla watched, the informant tasted the cocaine and pronounced that it was good and that the \"deal was on.\"   The informant went off with Caldern to the shopping center to meet the informant's partner, who had the money.  Montilla and Zorrilla stayed behind with the cocaine at the shop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the shopping center, the partner showed Caldern the cash.  The men agreed that Caldern would return alone to the repair shop, and that ten minutes later, the informant and his partner would bring the money for the exchange.  Back at the shop, the \"partner\" agent told the informant to get out of the car, go into the mechanic's shop, and bring out the people involved in the transaction.  The informant went into the small room, told Montilla, Zorrilla, and Caldern that \"someone was waiting for them in the car, [and] for them to take the material and give them the money.\"   Zorrilla and the informant approached the car and asked the partner to come into the shop, where they would make the exchange.  The partner refused and said the delivery should be made outside.  Zorrilla complied and went back into the shop to get the drugs.  The three men--Caldern, Zorrilla, and Montilla--came back toward the street, with Caldern carrying the drugs.  Montilla and Zorrilla had moved to where they could watch the transaction from the front of the shop, about thirty feet away from the partner's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three men were arrested where they stood when Caldern made the delivery.  At the time of arrest, others were in the shop, including the shop owner and a visitor.  At no time during the transaction did the informant see Montilla working on a car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government conceded, its videotape of the drug delivery and arrest did not show Montilla;  nor do any of the audiotapes of the transactions contain recordings of Montilla's voice.  In fact, the government at trial described Montilla as a minor participant, but a knowing participant nonetheless, who had acted as a lookout.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla's defense was mistaken identity, that Zorrilla was the \"mechanic\" referred to in the initial conversation.  Zorrilla was a mechanic and had worked at this shop some four months earlier.  Caldern was not a mechanic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla did not testify at trial.  His first witness, the shop owner, testified that Montilla had worked for him there for about a month, that Zorrilla, not Montilla, lived in the room at the shop, and that Montilla had just been doing his job, repairing a car that was to be picked up that day.  The owner also said that Zorrilla had worked for him at the shop for over a year, but had not worked there during the previous four months.  The owner explained that just before Montilla went outside to the front of the shop where he was arrested, Montilla had said that he was stepping outside to have a soft drink and to smoke.  Montilla's second witness, who was visiting the shop during the incident, testified that he had seen Montilla working on a car until he stepped outside to have a cigarette since the owner did not allow smoking inside the shop.  The jury convicted Montilla, and he was sentenced to five years in prison and eight years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla originally planned to call both Zorrilla and Caldern as witnesses.  The two entered guilty pleas on June 27, 1995.  On June 29, 1995, Montilla filed a motion to have the Marshal's Service produce his codefendants to testify.  The court granted the motion, but the two codefendants informed the court, on advice of and through their counsel, that they would not testify for Montilla.  Montilla was convicted on July 1, 1995.  Caldern and Zorrilla were not sentenced until September 26, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1996, Montilla filed a motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.

Several inferences from the evidence support the government's position.  The first is that Montilla was at the entrance to the small room where he could act as a lookout while the drug deal negotiations were being conducted and was not in the shop repairing cars.  The second is that, when the informant told the men it was time to deliver the drugs to his partner, all three men, including Montilla, left the small room to go out toward the car.  The third is that Montilla, who did not have the drugs, stopped just outside the shop, and from that vantage watched.

The district court denied the motion on the ground that the evidence was both known and available.

But Montilla, who, it facially appears, had diligently attempted to secure their testimony,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> did not have the power to compel them to testify at his trial in light of their Fifth Amendment privileges once they changed their minds about testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montilla's trial commenced on June 27, 1995.  On that same day, Caldern and Zorrilla entered pleas of guilty and the court accepted their pleas.  Their sentencing was deferred until September, 1995.  Caldern's and Zorrilla's counsel each advised his client not to testify for Montilla because the testimony might incriminate them with regard to other transactions and because the men still had to face sentencing proceedings.  Exercising their privilege against self-incrimination, Caldern and Zorrilla informed the court that they would not testify, and they were excused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that an unsentenced defendant who has pled guilty retains a legitimate protectable Fifth Amendment interest as to matters that could affect his sentence.

The new testimony, while it may not be true, is not inherently implausible.  And we note that Montilla has steadfastly maintained his innocence, even through sentencing, at some cost.

Abou-Saada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465443\"><a href=\"/opinion/465443/united-states-v-assada-abou-saada-united-states-of-america-v-milad-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1986), and remand to the district court to reconsider the motion for a new trial and to hear evidence.  There is no suggestion that such hearings are required in the usual course;  they are not.  Cf. United States v. Kearney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406035\"><a href=\"/opinion/406035/united-states-v-lawrence-kearney/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 218 (D.C.Cir.1982).  Had the district court itself ruled otherwise on the issue of unavailability, it might have chosen to have a hearing.  We think it wiser here for the district court to hold such a hearing given the unusual combination of circumstances here.  Montilla's conviction rests almost entirely on the testimony of the DEA informant.  Neither the videotape nor the audiotape directly incriminate Montilla.  The reference on the audiotape to the mechanic could equally well be understood to refer to the location of the deal, and not to the role of the mechanic.  Only the informant places him in the small room;  Montilla's other witnesses say he was repairing a car.  A hearing will be helpful<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> where the matters presented by the proffer are not \"conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records of the case.\"  United States v.

The credibility of the witnesses is important.  Neither Caldern nor Zorrilla testified before--this is not a recantation of testimony situation where the court has had an opportunity to assess credibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the district court should, after a hearing, reconsider whether, as Rule 33 provides, \"the interests of justice require a new trial.\"   See Ouimette, 753 F.2d at 192-93 (remanding to the district court for hearing on new trial motion where affidavit presented new testimony going to issue of defendant's guilt);  Lyles v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"249580\"><a href=\"/opinion/249580/jack-wayne-lyles-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 913 (5th Cir.1959) (on new trial motion, district court \"will be in a better position to exercise its functions\" after holding hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already observed, we disagree with the decisions treating the belated statements of codefendants aimed at exculpating the moving defendant as per se insufficient under Rule 33.  But we share the general skepticism concerning those statements, and the present opinion by no means confers any automatic right in such a case to a new trial or even to a hearing.  Our judgment here turns on unusual circumstances including the weakness of the government's case against the defendant, significant efforts to procure the codefendants' testimony before his own conviction, and the plausible explanation as to why the evidence was not available earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 states in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>The court on a motion of a defendant may grant a new trial to that defendant if required in the interest of justice....  A motion for a new trial based on the ground of newly discovered evidence may be made only before or within two years after final judgment, but if an appeal is pending the court may grant the motion only on remand of the case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The statements are material and appear to give rise to a \"reasonable\" probability of acquittal upon retrial.

In saying this, we are taking account of the ambiguity and thinness of the inculpatory evidence and are taking the exculpatory statements at face value.  Whether the latter would retain their force after close examination is a different question;  as we note below, a hearing might cast a different light on these statements</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> According to Montilla's trial attorney's affidavit submitted in support of the motion for a new trial, he tried on two separate occasions to interview Zorrilla and Caldern, but they refused to give him any information.  (The dates of these attempts are unclear).  Despite not knowing the contents of their testimony, the trial attorney moved to have Zorrilla and Caldern subpoenaed to testify.  His client Montilla insisted that the testimony would exculpate him rather than hurt him</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In different contexts, such as reported improper communications with jurors, hearings have been thought necessary before there is a ruling on a new trial motion.
