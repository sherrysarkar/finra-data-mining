Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Ana L.

These appeals grow out of an\n\naction brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                   In that action,\n\nplaintiff-appellant         Calixto     Déniz        Márquez     accuses       the\n\nMunicipality of Guaynabo (the Municipality) of confiscating his\n\nproperty without just compensation.                 The district court held\n\nthat the plaintiff's takings claims were unripe and dismissed\n\nthe action.     Déniz Márquez v. Municipality of Guaynabo, 140 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 135, 140 (D.P.R. 2001).              The plaintiff appeals.            We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n                                Background\n\n           Since the district court disposed of this matter on a\n\nRule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, without taking evidence, we\n\naccept    as   true   all   well-pleaded          factual   averments     in   the\n\nplaintiff's     amended     complaint       and     indulge    all    reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom in his favor.                 Valentin v. Hosp. Bella\n\nVista, 254 F.3d 358, 365 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           The plaintiff is a real estate developer who owns two\n\nadjoining parcels of real estate (the Property) in Guaynabo.\n\nOne parcel contains a three-story office building.                   The abutting\n\n(unimproved) parcel serves as a parking lot for that building.\n\n           In or around February of 1999, the plaintiff signed a\n\nconditional agreement to sell the Property for $625,000.                  Before\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe closing date, the would-be buyer visited the municipal\n\noffices and learned that the Municipality intended to take the\n\nProperty by eminent domain.             He promptly withdrew his offer.                 A\n\nsecond potential purchaser backed out for much the same reason.\n\n            The    plaintiff      was    perplexed     because         he    had   heard\n\nnothing from the Municipality concerning an expropriation of the\n\nProperty.         On    March    31,     1999,    he   inquired         whether       the\n\nMunicipality intended to proceed with a condemnation action.\n\nAlmost   two   months      later,      Aurialis    Lozada,       the    director       of\n\nGuaynabo's     legal     division,       responded     to    his       letter.        She\n\ninformed    the    plaintiff      that    the     mayor   of     Guaynabo,         Héctor\n\nO'Neill,    intended      to    take    the    Property     by   eminent       domain.\n\nPresumably to facilitate this plan, Lozada forbade the plaintiff\n\nfrom renewing any of the office building leases.                            Word of the\n\nputative taking spread, and tenants began to quit the premises\n\nlike rats deserting a sinking ship.\n\n            Despite several subsequent conversations between the\n\nplaintiff and Lozada, the Municipality neither designated the\n\nProperty     for       public    use     nor     commenced        eminent          domain\n\nproceedings.       During this hiatus, the plaintiff's income stream\n\ndried up, his mortgage went into default, and the mortgagee\n\nbegan to threaten foreclosure.             Left in a bureaucratic limbo and\n\nconcerned about his financial plight, the plaintiff brought suit\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fin Puerto Rico's federal district court.          His operative pleading\n\n(the amended complaint) named the Municipality, O'Neill, and\n\nLozada as defendants.         It alleged violations of section 1983 and\n\nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.              The gist\n\nof   the   case   was   the   averment   that   the   defendants'   conduct\n\namounted to a de facto taking that unconstitutionally deprived\n\nthe plaintiff of the beneficial use of the Property without just\n\ncompensation.        For good measure, the plaintiff added a due\n\nprocess claim, as well as supplemental claims under local law.\n\n            The suit provoked two motions to dismiss.          The first,\n\nbased upon ripeness considerations, asserted that the district\n\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction.             See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(1).     The second, more substantively oriented, asserted\n\nthat the amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief could be granted.         See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n            For reasons that are not immediately apparent, the\n\ndistrict court first addressed the Rule 12(b)(6) motion and\n\nfound it wanting.        Déniz Márquez, 140 F. Supp. 2d at 138-39.\n\nThe court determined, however, that the Rule 12(b)(1) motion was\n\ndispositive because the plaintiff had an obligation to pursue\n\nthe inverse condemnation remedy available under Puerto Rico law\n\nbefore prosecuting his takings claims under section 1983.               Id.\n\nat 139-40.        Accordingly, the court dismissed the plaintiff's\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ffederal     claims     as       unripe    and     dismissed        the      remaining\n\n(supplemental) claims without prejudice.                      Id. at 140.            The\n\nplaintiff appealed, and the defendants cross-appealed from the\n\ndenial of their Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n                            The Plaintiff's Appeal\n\n            We review de novo the district court's dismissal of the\n\nplaintiff's       federal    claims      as    unripe.       Ernst      &    Young    v.\n\nDepositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nWe begin our inquiry by framing the issue and then proceed to\n\ndiscuss the plaintiff's contentions.\n\n                                          A.\n\n                                Setting the Stage\n\n            42    U.S.C.    §   1983     provides    in    pertinent        part    that\n\n\"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,\n\nregulation, custom, or usage . . . subjects, or causes to be\n\nsubjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the\n\ndeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by\n\nthe   Constitution     and      laws,     shall     be    liable   to       the    party\n\ninjured.\"        This statute \"supplies a private right of action\n\nagainst a person who, under color of state law, deprives another\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fof rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.\"   Evans\n\nv. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1036 (1st Cir. 1996).   For section 1983\n\npurposes, Puerto Rico is deemed equivalent to a state.        See\n\nMartínez v. Colón, 54 F.3d 980, 984 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n         The plaintiff centers his primary section 1983 claim\n\non the allegation that the defendants unlawfully deprived him of\n\nhis rights in the Property without just compensation.       Their\n\nconduct, he alleges, constituted a de facto confiscation and\n\nthereby violated the Takings Clause.   See U.S. Const. amend. V\n\n(prohibiting the taking of private property for public use\n\nwithout just compensation).\n\n         The initial hurdle is easily cleared:    the defendants\n\nare alleged to have acted under color of Puerto Rico law, and\n\nthe Takings Clause applies unreservedly to the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico.   Tenoco Oil Co. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs, 876\n\nF.2d 1013, 1017 n.9 (1st Cir. 1989).      Once past this point,\n\nhowever, insurmountable obstacles loom.   Chief among them is the\n\nquestion of ripeness.\n\n         That question arises out of the plaintiff's decision\n\nto pursue his takings claims directly in federal court.      The\n\nSupreme Court has explained that:\n\n         The Fifth Amendment does not proscribe the\n         taking of property; it proscribes taking\n         without just compensation.   Nor does the\n         Fifth   Amendment   require    that   just\n\n                              -7-\n\f           compensation be paid in advance of, or\n           contemporaneously with, the taking; all that\n           is required is that a \"reasonable, certain,\n           and   adequate   provision   for   obtaining\n           compensation\" exist at the time of the\n           taking.\n\nWilliamson County Reg'l Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473\n\nU.S. 172, 194 (1985) (citations omitted).     Thus, a takings claim\n\nordinarily is considered unripe if the claimant comes directly\n\nto a federal court without first seeking compensation through\n\nstate procedures.    Id. at 194-95.\n\n           To be sure, this rule — like most rules — admits of\n\nexceptions.    One such exception is that a claimant in a takings\n\ncase may be excused for failing to seek recourse from the state\n\ncourts if all potential state remedies are        \"unavailable      or\n\ninadequate.\"    Id. at 196-97.     But this exception is narrowly\n\nconstrued, and the claimant must carry the heavy burden of\n\nshowing   unavailability   or   inadequacy.   Gilbert   v.   City   of\n\nCambridge, 932 F.2d 51, 65 (1st Cir. 1991).        In this operose\n\nendeavor, doubts are to be resolved in favor of exhaustion.\n\nThus, if it is unclear whether a particular state-law remedy\n\npertains, the claimant must attempt to exploit it — and his\n\nfederal takings claim will not be deemed ripe unless and until\n\nhe has pursued, and exhausted, that course.      Id.\n\n           This exception lies at the heart of the plaintiff's\n\nappeal.   The dispositive question here is whether the plaintiff\n\n                                 -8-\n\fhas made a sufficient showing that Puerto Rico law affords him\n\nno   remedy    for    the   alleged   taking.      We   turn   next   to   that\n\nquestion.\n\n                                       B.\n\n         Availability of the Inverse Condemnation Remedy\n\n              The    remedy   of   inverse    condemnation     serves      as   a\n\n\"protection for [landowners] to force the State to comply with\n\nthe constitutional provisions guaranteeing that no person shall\n\nbe deprived of his property without due process of law and\n\nwithout having received compensation.\"             Culebras Enters. Corp.\n\nv. Rivera Rios, 813 F.2d 506, 513 (1st Cir. 1987) (discussing\n\nPuerto Rico law).           Although the remedy is not memorialized in\n\nPuerto Rico's Civil Code, the case law makes clear that inverse\n\ncondemnation is generally available under Puerto Rico law.                  See\n\nOchoa Realty Corp. v. Faria, 815 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir. 1987);\n\nCulebras, 813 F.2d at 513-14; Aner Inv. Corp. v. Junta de\n\nPlanificacíon, 99 TSPR 65, 1999 WL 258578, at *2 (P.R. 1999);\n\nCulebra Enters. Corp. v. Estado Libre Asociado, 143 P.R. Dec.\n\n935, 1997 WL 870831, at *4 (P.R. 1997).\n\n              The    plaintiff     does     not   challenge    the    generic\n\navailability of an inverse condemnation remedy under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw, but, rather, contends that he is precluded from invoking\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthat remedy.   He makes three main points in support of his claim\n\nthat the inverse condemnation remedy is unavailable to him.\n\n          First, he suggests that the inverse condemnation remedy\n\ndoes not extend to a de facto taking.1    The case law is sparse,\n\nbut the authorities tend toward the view that the remedy applies\n\nto de facto takings.   See Aner Inv. Corp., 99 TSPR 65, 1999 WL\n\n258587,   at   *2   (explaining   that   Puerto   Rico's   inverse\n\ncondemnation remedy applies not only to physical occupation and\n\nregulatory taking cases but also to other \"real property rights'\n\ntakings\" which have been effected \"without the state filing\n\nfirst the eminent domain action or having consigned the due\n\ncompensation\"); Culebra Enters., 143 P.R. 935, 1997 WL 870831,\n\nat *4 (observing that the inverse condemnation remedy applies\n\n\"when the state effects a 'de facto' taking,\" albeit linking\n\nthat term to actions \"affecting substantially the property use,\n\nphysically or by regulatory means\").     Since the plaintiff has\n\nfailed to adduce any case law that expressly precludes use of\n\nthe inverse condemnation remedy as a means of redressing a de\n\nfacto taking, the most that can be said is that it remains\n\n\n\n\n    1By \"de facto taking,\" we mean a taking that occurs without\neither a physical occupation, e.g., Loretto v. Teleprompter\nManhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 426 (1982), or some formal\nregulatory action, e.g., Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S.\n1003, 1014 (1992).\n\n                              -10-\n\funclear whether the inverse condemnation remedy applies here.\n\nThat uncertainty undercuts the plaintiff's position.\n\n          Culebras illustrates the point.       There, the plaintiffs\n\nmade much the same argument, asserting that it was at best\n\nunclear whether the Puerto Rico courts would entertain a claim\n\nfor inverse condemnation on the facts at hand.       813 F.2d at 514-\n\n15.   We rejected their \"uncertainty\" argument, explaining that:\n\n          Lack of clarity is not unusual, however,\n          when legal rights are still in process of\n          definition       through     case-by-case\n          adjudication.   The Puerto Rico high court\n          has at least discussed, and has seemingly\n          signaled, the existence of an inverse\n          condemnation remedy. . . . We think [that\n          the appellants] must pursue that remedy\n          before they can maintain a federal damages\n          claim . . . .\n\nId. at 514-15.\n\n          So it is here.    If the plaintiff were to pursue the\n\ninverse condemnation remedy, the local courts would be presented\n\nwith an issue of first impression under Puerto Rico law.        Until\n\nhe travels that road, the availability vel non of the inverse\n\ncondemnation   remedy   remains   open   to   question.   It   is   the\n\nclaimant's burden to prove that the potential state remedy is\n\nunavailable, and uncertainty prevents him from carrying that\n\nburden.    Consequently, his section 1983 takings claims are\n\nunripe.   See Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 64-65 (holding that as long as\n\nthe State provides an arguably adequate process for securing\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcompensation for a taking, federal intervention under section\n\n1983 before the claimant has resorted to that procedure is\n\npremature).\n\n            The plaintiff's second argument focuses on the fact\n\nthat the Property has never been zoned or otherwise officially\n\ndesignated for public use.          Relying upon the logic of negative\n\ninference, the plaintiff posits that all the reported Puerto\n\nRico    inverse    condemnation      cases     have   involved    properties\n\nearmarked for public use.            Building on this foundation, he\n\nreasons that the inverse condemnation remedy is unavailable\n\nwhere, as here, the property is zoned for commercial use.\n\n            As presented, this contention never gets out of the\n\nstarting gate.       The plaintiff presumes to prepare for the race\n\nby embracing a number of opinions authored by the Supreme Court\n\nof Puerto Rico, but he neglects to furnish us with translations\n\nof those opinions.         This oversight not only hampers our ability\n\nto evaluate his claim but also contravenes our local rules.\n\nThose   rules     state,    in   pertinent    part,   that:     \"Whenever   an\n\nopinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is cited in a brief\n\nor oral argument which does not appear in the bound volumes in\n\nEnglish,    an    official,      certified,   or   stipulated    translation\n\nthereof with three conformed copies shall be filed.\"                1st Cir.\n\nR. 30(d).\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f              A violation of Rule 30(d) is serious business. We have\n\ngiven fair warning that we will not permit parties to disregard\n\nthe rule with impunity.          E.g., Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of\n\nSan   Juan,    1    F.3d   74,   77   n.1   (1st    Cir.    1993)   (referencing\n\nprevious version of Rule 30(d)).                   This is as it should be:\n\nattorneys who appear before us are expected to know and follow\n\nthe rules.         Ramos-Baez v. Bossolo-Lopez, 240 F.3d 92, 94 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n              The short of it is that a party who flouts Local Rule\n\n30(d) does so at his peril.           Specifically, he runs the risk that\n\nhe will be deemed to have forfeited arguments if those arguments\n\nare   based    upon    untranslated     opinions      or,    alternatively,   if\n\nperscrutation of untranslated opinions is integral to their\n\nresolution.2        See, e.g., Stein v. Royal Bank, 239 F.3d 389, 393\n\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2001); Gonzalez-Morales v. Hernandez-Arencibia,\n\n221 F.3d 45, 50 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n              Here, the plaintiff's failure to supply the required\n\ntranslations has left us in the lurch.                The absence of English\n\ntranslations (save for two relevant case excerpts provided by\n\nthe defendants) has compounded the seeming uncertainty in the\n\n\n\n      2\n     Parties who fail to satisfy their obligations under Local\nRule 30(d) also run the risk of sanctions, as do their\nattorneys. See Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 478 n.6 (1st Cir.\n1994) (referencing previous version of Rule 30(d)).\n\n                                       -13-\n\frelevant Puerto Rico case law.              Under the circumstances, the\n\nmost appropriate course is to reject the plaintiff's \"public\n\nuse\" argument to the extent that it is based upon untranslated\n\nopinions.\n\n            The upshot of our ruling is that the plaintiff is left\n\nclinging to a single case (for which a translation is available)\n\nin support of his contention that the inverse condemnation\n\nremedy extends only to land that has been zoned or officially\n\ndesignated for public use.           That case, Heftler Int'l, Inc. v.\n\nPlanning    Bd.,   99   P.R.R.   454    (P.R.   1970),   marked   the   first\n\noccasion on which the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico discussed\n\ninverse condemnation.       For our purposes, the court's comments\n\nare elliptical, and, in all events, they are dictum.              See id. at\n\n462-63 (disposing of the case based upon the plaintiff's failure\n\nto exhaust administrative remedies); see also Culebras, 813 F.2d\n\nat 513 (making this point).            It is, then, transparently clear\n\nthat Heftler, unaided, cannot bear the weight that the plaintiff\n\npiles upon it.\n\n            In a final effort to distinguish his case from the mine\n\nrun, the plaintiff alleges that the mortgagee has commenced\n\nforeclosure     proceedings      —     according    to    the     plaintiff,\n\nforeclosure is underway because his tenants have fled, leaving\n\nhim unable to pay the mortgage — and avers that, once he loses\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\ftitle, he also will lose the ability to pursue the inverse\n\ncondemnation remedy.          This construct is fatally flawed.\n\n            The fact of the matter is that the plaintiff has not\n\nyet lost title.        As of the date of oral argument in this court,\n\nforeclosure proceedings had been pending for some time, but had\n\nyet to be consummated.             Therefore, the inverse condemnation\n\nremedy    remains       potentially      available       to   the   plaintiff.3\n\nMoreover,      a    divestiture    of    title   would    not   undermine    the\n\nplaintiff's section 1983 takings claim for damages incurred\n\nwhile he owned the Property.            See United States Olympic Comm. v.\n\nIntelicense Corp., 737 F.2d 263, 268 (2d Cir. 1984) (\"[T]he\n\nowner of an interest in property at the time of [an] alleged\n\ntaking has standing to assert that a taking has occurred.\")\n\n(emphasis supplied); see also United States v. Dow, 357 U.S. 17,\n\n21-22 (1958).        Consequently, the threat of foreclosure does not\n\nserve to ripen the plaintiff's federal claims.\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.                 A plaintiff's\n\nfailure   to       exhaust   the   inverse     condemnation     remedy   renders\n\npremature a section 1983 damages action predicated upon an\n\n\n    3We hasten to add that we have no reason to believe that the\nPuerto Rico courts would limit the inverse condemnation remedy\nto current owners.   The plaintiff cites no apposite cases to\nthat effect, and the law elsewhere is to the contrary. E.g.,\nKlopping v. City of Whittier, 500 P.2d 1345, 1360 (Cal. 1972)\n(allowing claimant who lost property through foreclosure to\npursue inverse condemnation claim).\n\n                                        -15-\n\falleged takings violation.          Ochoa, 815 F.2d at 816-17; Culebras,\n\n813 F.2d at 514-15.\n\n                                          C.\n\n                                Due Process\n\n            There is one final point.             In addition to his takings\n\nclaims, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants' conduct is\n\nimmediately       actionable   as     a    violation      of    the    substantive\n\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThat allegation need not detain us.\n\n            Dressing a takings claim in the raiment of a due\n\nprocess    violation    does    not       serve   to    evade    the    exhaustion\n\nrequirement.       Here as we have said, the inverse condemnation\n\nremedy represents an arguably available and adequate means of\n\nobtaining compensation for the alleged taking.                    See supra Part\n\nII(B).     Thus, no substantive due process claim will lie until\n\nthat remedy is exhausted.       Ochoa, 815 F.2d at 817 n.4; Culebras,\n\n813 F.2d at 515-16.\n\n                                      III.\n\n                      The Defendants' Cross-Appeal\n\n            We need not dwell upon the defendants' cross-appeal.\n\nAlthough    the    district    court       passed      upon,    and    denied,   the\n\ndefendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion, Déniz Márquez, 140 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 138-39, that decision was gratuitous.                  It would be equally\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fgratuitous for us to reach the merits of the cross-appeal, and\n\nwe decline to do so.\n\n          When a court is confronted with motions to dismiss\n\nunder both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), it ordinarily ought to\n\ndecide the former before broaching the latter.         See NE Erectors\n\nAss'n v. Sec'y of Labor, 62 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir. 1995); see\n\nalso Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946) (\"Whether the\n\ncomplaint states a cause of action on which relief could be\n\ngranted is a question of law [which] must be decided after and\n\nnot   before   the   court   has    assumed    jurisdiction   over   the\n\ncontroversy.\").      After all, if the court lacks subject matter\n\njurisdiction, assessment of the merits becomes a matter of\n\npurely academic interest.          Accordingly, we regard the lower\n\ncourt's Rule 12(b)(6) ruling as a nullity and thus dismiss the\n\ndefendants' cross-appeal.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n          We need go no further. The plaintiff's failure to seek\n\nrecompense through Puerto Rico's inverse condemnation remedy\n\nrenders both his takings and substantive due process claims\n\nunripe for federal adjudication.          Hence, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the plaintiff's federal claims for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.         We likewise affirm the court's\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fdismissal without prejudice of the plaintiff's supplemental\n\nclaims under local law.      See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); see also\n\nSerapión v. Martínez, 119 F.3d 982, 993 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting\n\nthe   district   court's   \"substantial   discretion\"   in   regard   to\n\nrelinquishing jurisdiction over supplemental claims after the\n\ndismissal of the linchpin federal claims).       Finally, we dismiss\n\nthe defendants' cross-appeal as non-justiciable.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

In that action, plaintiff-appellant Calixto D&#233;niz M&#225;rquez accuses the Municipality of Guaynabo (the Municipality) of confiscating his property without just compensation. The district court held that the plaintiff's takings claims were unripe and dismissed the action. <i>D&#233;niz M&#225;rquez v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> 140 F.Supp.2d 135, 140 (D.P.R.2001). The plaintiff appeals. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the district court disposed of this matter on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, without taking evidence, we accept as true all well-pleaded factual averments in the plaintiff's amended complaint and indulge all reasonable inferences therefrom in his favor. <i>Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista,</i> 254 F.3d 358, 365 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff is a real estate developer who owns two adjoining parcels of real estate (the Property) in Guaynabo. One parcel contains a three-story office building. The abutting (unimproved) parcel serves as a parking lot for that building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or around February of 1999, the plaintiff signed a conditional agreement to sell the Property for $625,000. Before the closing date, the would-be buyer visited the municipal offices and learned that the Municipality intended to take the Property by eminent domain. He promptly withdrew his offer. A second potential purchaser backed out for much the same reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff was perplexed because he had heard nothing from the Municipality concerning an expropriation of the Property. On March 31, 1999, he inquired whether the Municipality intended to proceed with a condemnation action. Almost two months later, Aurialis Lozada, the director of Guaynabo's legal division, responded to his letter. She informed the plaintiff that the mayor of Guaynabo, H&#233;ctor O'Neill, intended to take the Property by eminent domain. Presumably to facilitate this plan, Lozada forbade the plaintiff from renewing any of the office building leases. Word of the putative taking spread, and tenants began to quit the premises like rats deserting a sinking ship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite several subsequent conversations between the plaintiff and Lozada, the Municipality neither designated the Property for public use nor commenced eminent domain proceedings. During this hiatus, the plaintiff's income stream dried up, his mortgage went into default, and the mortgagee began to threaten foreclosure. Left in a bureaucratic limbo and concerned about his financial plight, the plaintiff brought suit in Puerto Rico's federal district court. His operative pleading (the amended complaint) named the Municipality, O'Neill, and Lozada as defendants. It alleged violations of section 1983 and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The gist of the case was the averment that the defendants' conduct amounted to a de facto taking that unconstitutionally deprived the plaintiff of the beneficial use of the Property without just compensation. For good measure, the plaintiff added a due process claim, as well as supplemental claims under local law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit provoked two motions to dismiss. The first, based upon ripeness considerations, asserted that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). The second, more substantively oriented, asserted that the amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that are not immediately apparent, the district court first addressed the Rule 12(b)(6) motion and found it wanting. <i>D&#233;niz M&#225;rquez,</i> 140 F.Supp.2d at 138-39. The court determined, however, that the Rule 12(b)(1) motion was dispositive because the plaintiff had an obligation to pursue the inverse condemnation remedy available under Puerto Rico law before prosecuting his takings claims under section 1983. <i>Id.</i> at 139-40. Accordingly, the court dismissed the plaintiff's federal claims as unripe and dismissed the remaining (supplemental) claims without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 140. The plaintiff appealed, and the defendants cross-appealed from the denial of their Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Plaintiff's Appeal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's federal claims as unripe. <i>Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp.,</i> 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir.1995). We begin our inquiry by framing the issue and then proceed to discuss the plaintiff's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Setting the Stage</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 provides in pertinent part that \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured.\" This statute \"supplies a private right of action against a person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.\" <i>Evans v. Avery,</i> 100 F.3d 1033, 1036 (1st Cir.1996). For section 1983 purposes, Puerto Rico is deemed equivalent to a state. <i>See Mart&#237;nez v. Col&#243;n,</i> 54 F.3d 980, 984 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff centers his primary section 1983 claim on the allegation that the defendants unlawfully deprived him of his rights in the Property without just compensation. Their conduct, he alleges, constituted a de facto confiscation and thereby violated the Takings Clause. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. V (prohibiting the taking of private property for public use without just compensation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial hurdle is easily cleared: the defendants are alleged to have acted under color of Puerto Rico law, and the Takings Clause applies unreservedly to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. <i>Tenoco Oil Co. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 876 F.2d 1013, 1017 n. 9 (1st Cir.1989). Once past this point, however, insurmountable obstacles loom. Chief among them is the question of ripeness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That question arises out of the plaintiff's decision to pursue his takings claims directly in federal court. The Supreme Court has explained that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment does not proscribe the taking of property; it proscribes taking without just compensation. Nor does the Fifth Amendment require that just compensation be paid in advance of, or contemporaneously with, the taking; all that is required is that a \"reasonable, certain, and adequate provision for obtaining compensation\" exist at the time of the taking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Williamson County Reg'l Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank,</i> 473 U.S. 172, 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985) (citations omitted). Thus, a takings claim ordinarily is considered unripe if the claimant comes directly to a federal court without first seeking compensation through state procedures. <i>Id.</i> at 194-95, 105 S.Ct. 3108.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, this rule &#8212; like most rules &#8212; admits of exceptions. One such exception is that a claimant in a takings case may be excused for failing to seek recourse from the state courts if all potential state remedies are \"unavailable or inadequate.\" <i>Id.</i> at 196-97, 105 S.Ct. 3108. But this exception is narrowly construed, and the claimant must carry the heavy burden of showing unavailability or inadequacy. <i>Gilbert v. City of Cambridge,</i> 932 F.2d 51, 65 (1st Cir.1991). In this operose endeavor, doubts are to be resolved in favor of exhaustion. Thus, if it is unclear whether a particular state-law remedy pertains, the claimant must attempt to exploit it &#8212; and his federal takings claim will not be deemed ripe unless and until he has pursued, and exhausted, that course. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exception lies at the heart of the plaintiff's appeal. The dispositive question here is whether the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that Puerto Rico law affords him <i>no</i> remedy for the alleged taking. We turn next to that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Availability of the Inverse Condemnation Remedy</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remedy of inverse condemnation serves as a \"protection for [landowners] to force the State to comply with the constitutional provisions guaranteeing that no person shall be deprived of his property without due process of law and without having received compensation.\" <i>Culebras Enters. Corp. v. Rivera Rios,</i> 813 F.2d 506, 513 (1st Cir.1987) (discussing Puerto Rico law). Although the remedy is not memorialized in Puerto Rico's Civil Code, the case law makes clear that inverse condemnation is generally available under Puerto Rico law. <i>See Ochoa Realty Corp. v. Faria,</i> 815 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir.1987); <i>Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 513-14; <i>Aner Inv. Corp. v.

Dec. 935, 1997 WL 870831, at *4 (P.R. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff does not challenge the generic availability of an inverse condemnation remedy under Puerto Rico law, but, rather, contends that he is precluded from invoking that remedy. He makes three main points in support of his claim that the inverse condemnation remedy is unavailable to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, he suggests that the inverse condemnation remedy does not extend to a de facto taking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The case law is sparse, but the authorities tend toward the view that the remedy applies to de facto takings. <i>See Aner Inv. Corp.,</i> 99 TSPR 65, 1999 WL 258587, at *2 (explaining that Puerto Rico's inverse condemnation remedy applies not only to physical occupation and regulatory taking cases but also to other \"real property rights' takings\" which have been effected \"without the state filing first the eminent domain action or having consigned the due compensation\"); <i>Culebra Enters.,</i> 143 P.R. 935, 1997 WL 870831, at *4 (observing that the inverse condemnation remedy applies \"when the state effects a `de facto' taking,\" albeit linking that term to actions \"affecting substantially the property use, physically or by regulatory means\"). Since the plaintiff has failed to adduce any case law that expressly precludes use of the inverse condemnation remedy as a means of redressing a de facto taking, the most that can be said is that it remains unclear whether the inverse condemnation remedy applies here. That uncertainty undercuts the plaintiff's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Culebras</i> illustrates the point. There, the plaintiffs made much the same argument, asserting that it was at best unclear whether the Puerto Rico courts would entertain a claim for inverse condemnation on the facts at hand. 813 F.2d at 514-15. We rejected their \"uncertainty\" argument, explaining that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lack of clarity is not unusual, however, when legal rights are still in process of definition through case-by-case adjudication. The Puerto Rico high court has at least discussed, and has seemingly signaled, the existence of an inverse condemnation remedy.... We think [that the appellants] must pursue that remedy before they can maintain a federal damages claim....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 514-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it is here. If the plaintiff were to pursue the inverse condemnation remedy, the local courts would be presented with an issue of first impression under Puerto Rico law. Until he travels that road, the availability <i>vel non</i> of the inverse condemnation remedy remains open to question. It is the claimant's burden to prove that the potential state remedy is unavailable, and uncertainty prevents him from carrying that burden. Consequently, his section 1983 takings claims are unripe. <i>See Gilbert,</i> 932 F.2d at 64-65 (holding that as long as the State provides an arguably adequate process for securing compensation for a taking, federal intervention under section 1983 before the claimant has resorted to that procedure is premature).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's second argument focuses on the fact that the Property has never been zoned or otherwise officially designated for public use. Relying upon the logic of negative inference, the plaintiff posits that all the reported Puerto Rico inverse condemnation cases have involved properties earmarked for public use. Building on this foundation, he reasons that the inverse condemnation remedy is unavailable where, as here, the property is zoned for commercial use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As presented, this contention never gets out of the starting gate. The plaintiff presumes to prepare for the race by embracing a number of opinions authored by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, but he neglects to furnish us with translations of those opinions. This oversight not only hampers our ability to evaluate his claim but also contravenes our local rules. Those rules state, in pertinent part, that: \"Whenever an opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is cited in a brief or oral argument which does not appear in the bound volumes in English, an official, certified, or stipulated translation thereof with three conformed copies shall be filed.\" 1st Cir.R. 30(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A violation of Rule 30(d) is serious business. We have given fair warning that we will not permit parties to disregard the rule with impunity. <i>E.g., Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan,</i> 1 F.3d 74, 77 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993) (referencing previous version of Rule 30(d)). This is as it should be: attorneys who appear before us are expected to know and follow the rules. <i>Ramos-Baez v. Bossolo-Lopez,</i> 240 F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that a party who flouts Local Rule 30(d) does so at his peril. Specifically, he runs the risk that he will be deemed to have forfeited arguments if those arguments are based upon untranslated opinions or, alternatively, if perscrutation of untranslated opinions is integral to their resolution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g., Stein v. Royal Bank,</i> 239 F.3d 389, 393 n. 5 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Gonzalez-Morales v. Hernandez-Arencibia,</i> 221 F.3d 45, 50 n. 4 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiff's failure to supply the required translations has left us in the lurch. The absence of English translations (save for two relevant case excerpts provided by the defendants) has compounded the seeming uncertainty in the relevant Puerto Rico case law. Under the circumstances, the most appropriate course is to reject the plaintiff's \"public use\" argument to the extent that it is based upon untranslated opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot of our ruling is that the plaintiff is left clinging to a single case (for which a translation is available) in support of his contention that the inverse condemnation remedy extends only to land that has been zoned or officially designated for public use. That case, <i>Heftler Int'l, Inc. v. Planning Bd.,</i> 99 P.R.R. 454 (P.R.1970), marked the first occasion on which the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico discussed inverse condemnation. For our purposes, the court's comments are elliptical, and, in all events, they are dictum. <i>See id.</i> at 462-63 (disposing of the case based upon the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies); <i>see also Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 513 (making this point). It is, then, transparently clear that <i>Heftler,</i> unaided, cannot bear the weight that the plaintiff piles upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final effort to distinguish his case from the mine run, the plaintiff alleges that the mortgagee has commenced foreclosure proceedings &#8212; according to the plaintiff, foreclosure is underway because his tenants have fled, leaving him unable to pay the mortgage &#8212; and avers that, once he loses title, he also will lose the ability to pursue the inverse condemnation remedy. This construct is fatally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact of the matter is that the plaintiff has not yet lost title. As of the date of oral argument in this court, foreclosure proceedings had been pending for some time, but had yet to be consummated. Therefore, the inverse condemnation remedy remains potentially available to the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Moreover, a divestiture of title would not undermine the plaintiff's section 1983 takings claim for damages incurred while he owned the Property. <i>See United States Olympic Comm. v. Intelicense Corp.,</i> 737 F.2d 263, 268 (2d Cir.1984) (\"[T]he owner of an interest in property <i>at the time of [an] alleged taking</i> has standing to assert that a taking has occurred.\") (emphasis supplied); <i>see also United States v. Dow,</i> 357 U.S. 17, 21-22, 78 S.Ct. 1039, 2 L.Ed.2d 1109 (1958). Consequently, the threat of foreclosure does not serve to ripen the plaintiff's federal claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. A plaintiff's failure to exhaust the inverse condemnation remedy renders premature a section 1983 damages action predicated upon an alleged takings violation. <i>Ochoa,</i> 815 F.2d at 816-17; <i>Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 514-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Due Process</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one final point. In addition to his takings claims, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants' conduct is immediately actionable as a violation of the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That allegation need not detain us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dressing a takings claim in the raiment of a due process violation does not serve to evade the exhaustion requirement. Here as we have said, the inverse condemnation remedy represents an arguably available and adequate means of obtaining compensation for the alleged taking. <i>See supra</i> Part II(B). Thus, no substantive due process claim will lie until that remedy is exhausted. <i>Ochoa,</i> 815 F.2d at 817 n. 4; <i>Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 515-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Defendants' Cross-Appeal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell upon the defendants' cross-appeal. Although the district court passed upon, and denied, the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion, <i>D&#233;niz M&#225;rquez,</i> 140 F.Supp.2d at 138-39, that decision was gratuitous. It would be equally gratuitous for us to reach the merits of the cross-appeal, and we decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a court is confronted with motions to dismiss under both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), it ordinarily ought to decide the former before broaching the latter. <i>See NE Erectors Ass'n v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 62 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see also Bell v. Hood,</i> 327 U.S. 678, 682, 66(1946) S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946) (\"Whether the complaint states a cause of action on which relief could be granted is a question of law [which] must be decided after and not before the court has assumed jurisdiction over the controversy.\"). After all, if the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, assessment of the merits becomes a matter of purely academic interest. Accordingly, we regard the lower court's Rule 12(b)(6) ruling as a nullity and thus dismiss the defendants' cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>IV.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The plaintiff's failure to seek recompense through Puerto Rico's inverse condemnation remedy renders both his takings and substantive due process claims unripe for federal adjudication. Hence, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's federal claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We likewise affirm the court's dismissal without prejudice of the plaintiff's supplemental claims under local law. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3); <i>see also Serapi&#243;n v. Mart&#237;nez,</i> 119 F.3d 982, 993 (1st Cir.1997) (noting the district court's \"substantial discretion\" in regard to relinquishing jurisdiction over supplemental claims after the dismissal of the linchpin federal claims). Finally, we dismiss the defendants' cross-appeal as non-justiciable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By \"de facto taking,\" we mean a taking that occurs without either a physical occupation,<i>e.g., Loretto v.

Hosp. Bella Vista,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199467\"><a href=\"/opinion/199467/valentin-de-jesus-v-united-healthcare/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 365 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff is a real estate developer who owns two adjoining parcels of real estate (the Property) in Guaynabo. One parcel contains a three-story office building. The abutting (unimproved) parcel serves as a parking lot for that building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or around February of 1999, the plaintiff signed a conditional agreement to sell the Property for $625,000. Before the closing date, the would-be buyer visited the municipal offices and learned that the Municipality intended to take the Property by eminent domain. He promptly withdrew his offer. A second potential purchaser backed out for much the same reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff was perplexed because he had heard nothing from the Municipality concerning an expropriation of the Property. On March 31, 1999, he inquired whether the Municipality intended to proceed with a condemnation action. Almost two months later, Aurialis Lozada, the director of Guaynabo's legal division, responded to his letter. She informed the plaintiff that the mayor of Guaynabo, H&#233;ctor O'Neill, intended to take the Property by eminent domain. Presumably to facilitate this plan, Lozada forbade the plaintiff from renewing any of the office building leases. Word of the putative taking spread, and tenants began to quit the premises like rats deserting a sinking ship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite several subsequent conversations between the plaintiff and Lozada, the Municipality neither designated the Property for public use nor commenced eminent domain proceedings. During this hiatus, the plaintiff's income stream dried up, his mortgage went into default, and the mortgagee began to threaten foreclosure. Left in a bureaucratic limbo and concerned about his financial plight, the plaintiff brought suit in Puerto Rico's federal district court. His operative pleading (the amended complaint) named the Municipality, O'Neill, and Lozada as defendants. It alleged violations of section 1983 and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The gist of the case was the averment that the defendants' conduct amounted to a de facto taking that unconstitutionally deprived the plaintiff of the beneficial use of the Property without just compensation. For good measure, the plaintiff added a due process claim, as well as supplemental claims under local law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit provoked two motions to dismiss. The first, based upon ripeness considerations, asserted that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). The second, more substantively oriented, asserted that the amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that are not immediately apparent, the district court first addressed the Rule 12(b)(6) motion and found it wanting. <i>D&#233;niz M&#225;rquez,</i> 140 F.Supp.2d at 138-39. The court determined, however, that the Rule 12(b)(1) motion was dispositive because the plaintiff had an obligation to pursue the inverse condemnation remedy available under Puerto Rico law before prosecuting his takings claims under section 1983. <i>Id.</i> at 139-40. Accordingly, the court dismissed the plaintiff's federal claims as unripe and dismissed the remaining (supplemental) claims without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 140.

Their conduct, he alleges, constituted a de facto confiscation and thereby violated the Takings Clause. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend.

In this operose endeavor, doubts are to be resolved in favor of exhaustion. Thus, if it is unclear whether a particular state-law remedy pertains, the claimant must attempt to exploit it &#8212; and his federal takings claim will not be deemed ripe unless and until he has pursued, and exhausted, that course. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exception lies at the heart of the plaintiff's appeal.

Corp.,</i> 99 TSPR 65, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">258587</span></span>, at *2 (explaining that Puerto Rico's inverse condemnation remedy applies not only to physical occupation and regulatory taking cases but also to other \"real property rights' takings\" which have been effected \"without the state filing first the eminent domain action or having consigned the due compensation\"); <i>Culebra Enters.,</i> 143 P.R. 935, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">870831</span></span>, at *4 (observing that the inverse condemnation remedy applies \"when the state effects a `de facto' taking,\" albeit linking that term to actions \"affecting substantially the property use, physically or by regulatory means\"). Since the plaintiff has failed to adduce any case law that expressly precludes use of the inverse condemnation remedy as a means of redressing a de facto taking, the most that can be said is that it remains unclear whether the inverse condemnation remedy applies here. That uncertainty undercuts the plaintiff's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Culebras</i> illustrates the point. There, the plaintiffs made much the same argument, asserting that it was at best unclear whether the Puerto Rico courts would entertain a claim for inverse condemnation on the facts at hand. 813 F.2d at 514-15. We rejected their \"uncertainty\" argument, explaining that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lack of clarity is not unusual, however, when legal rights are still in process of definition through case-by-case adjudication. The Puerto Rico high court has at least discussed, and has seemingly signaled, the existence of an inverse condemnation remedy.... We think [that the appellants] must pursue that remedy before they can maintain a federal damages claim....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 514-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it is here. If the plaintiff were to pursue the inverse condemnation remedy, the local courts would be presented with an issue of first impression under Puerto Rico law. Until he travels that road, the availability <i>vel non</i> of the inverse condemnation remedy remains open to question. It is the claimant's burden to prove that the potential state remedy is unavailable, and uncertainty prevents him from carrying that burden. Consequently, his section 1983 takings claims are unripe. <i>See Gilbert,</i> 932 F.2d at 64-65 (holding that as long as the State provides an arguably adequate process for securing compensation for a taking, federal intervention under section 1983 before the claimant has resorted to that procedure is premature).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's second argument focuses on the fact that the Property has never been zoned or otherwise officially designated for public use. Relying upon the logic of negative inference, the plaintiff posits that all the reported Puerto Rico inverse condemnation cases have involved properties earmarked for public use. Building on this foundation, he reasons that the inverse condemnation remedy is unavailable where, as here, the property is zoned for commercial use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As presented, this contention never gets out of the starting gate. The plaintiff presumes to prepare for the race by embracing a number of opinions authored by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, but he neglects to furnish us with translations of those opinions. This oversight not only hampers our ability to evaluate his claim but also contravenes our local rules. Those rules state, in pertinent part, that: \"Whenever an opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is cited in a brief or oral argument which does not appear in the bound volumes in English, an official, certified, or stipulated translation thereof with three conformed copies shall be filed.\" 1st Cir.R. 30(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A violation of Rule 30(d) is serious business. We have given fair warning that we will not permit parties to disregard the rule with impunity. <i>E.g., Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194861\"><a href=\"/opinion/194861/rolon-alvarado-v-municipality-of-sj/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 77 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993) (referencing previous version of Rule 30(d)). This is as it should be: attorneys who appear before us are expected to know and follow the rules. <i>Ramos-Baez v. Bossolo-Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199277\"><a href=\"/opinion/199277/ramos-baez-v-bossolo-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that a party who flouts Local Rule 30(d) does so at his peril. Specifically, he runs the risk that he will be deemed to have forfeited arguments if those arguments are based upon untranslated opinions or, alternatively, if perscrutation of untranslated opinions is integral to their resolution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g., Stein v. Royal Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199275\"><a href=\"/opinion/199275/stein-v-royal-bank-of-canada/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 393 n. 5 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Gonzalez-Morales v. Hernandez-Arencibia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199033\"><a href=\"/opinion/199033/gonzalez-morales-v-hernandez-arencibia/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 50 n. 4 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiff's failure to supply the required translations has left us in the lurch. The absence of English translations (save for two relevant case excerpts provided by the defendants) has compounded the seeming uncertainty in the relevant Puerto Rico case law. Under the circumstances, the most appropriate course is to reject the plaintiff's \"public use\" argument to the extent that it is based upon untranslated opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot of our ruling is that the plaintiff is left clinging to a single case (for which a translation is available) in support of his contention that the inverse condemnation remedy extends only to land that has been zoned or officially designated for public use. That case, <i>Heftler Int'l, Inc. v. Planning Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></span> (P.R.1970), marked the first occasion on which the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico discussed inverse condemnation. For our purposes, the court's comments are elliptical, and, in all events, they are dictum. <i>See id.</i> at 462-63 (disposing of the case based upon the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies); <i>see also Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 513 (making this point). It is, then, transparently clear that <i>Heftler,</i> unaided, cannot bear the weight that the plaintiff piles upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final effort to distinguish his case from the mine run, the plaintiff alleges that the mortgagee has commenced foreclosure proceedings &#8212; according to the plaintiff, foreclosure is underway because his tenants have fled, leaving him unable to pay the mortgage &#8212; and avers that, once he loses title, he also will lose the ability to pursue the inverse condemnation remedy. This construct is fatally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact of the matter is that the plaintiff has not yet lost title. As of the date of oral argument in this court, foreclosure proceedings had been pending for some time, but had yet to be consummated. Therefore, the inverse condemnation remedy remains potentially available to the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Moreover, a divestiture of title would not undermine the plaintiff's section 1983 takings claim for damages incurred while he owned the Property. <i>See United States Olympic Comm. v. Intelicense Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437471\"><a href=\"/opinion/437471/united-states-olympic-committee-v-intelicense-corporation-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 268 (2d Cir.1984) (\"[T]he owner of an interest in property <i>at the time of [an] alleged taking</i> has standing to assert that a taking has occurred.\") (emphasis supplied); <i>see also United States v. Dow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105709\"><a href=\"/opinion/105709/united-states-v-dow/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21-22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105709\"><a href=\"/opinion/105709/united-states-v-dow/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1109</span></a></span> (1958). Consequently, the threat of foreclosure does not serve to ripen the plaintiff's federal claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. A plaintiff's failure to exhaust the inverse condemnation remedy renders premature a section 1983 damages action predicated upon an alleged takings violation. <i>Ochoa,</i> 815 F.2d at 816-17; <i>Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 514-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Due Process</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one final point. In addition to his takings claims, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants' conduct is immediately actionable as a violation of the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That allegation need not detain us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dressing a takings claim in the raiment of a due process violation does not serve to evade the exhaustion requirement. Here as we have said, the inverse condemnation remedy represents an arguably available and adequate means of obtaining compensation for the alleged taking. <i>See supra</i> Part II(B). Thus, no substantive due process claim will lie until that remedy is exhausted. <i>Ochoa,</i> 815 F.2d at 817 n. 4; <i>Culebras,</i> 813 F.2d at 515-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Defendants' Cross-Appeal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell upon the defendants' cross-appeal. Although the district court passed upon, and denied, the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion, <i>D&#233;niz M&#225;rquez,</i> 140 F.Supp.2d at 138-39, that decision was gratuitous. It would be equally gratuitous for us to reach the merits of the cross-appeal, and we decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a court is confronted with motions to dismiss under both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), it ordinarily ought to decide the former before broaching the latter. <i>See NE Erectors Ass'n v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196246\"><a href=\"/opinion/196246/northeast-erectors-v-dol/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see also Bell v.

After all, if the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, assessment of the merits becomes a matter of purely academic interest. Accordingly, we regard the lower court's Rule 12(b)(6) ruling as a nullity and thus dismiss the defendants' cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>IV.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The plaintiff's failure to seek recompense through Puerto Rico's inverse condemnation remedy renders both his takings and substantive due process claims unripe for federal adjudication. Hence, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's federal claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We likewise affirm the court's dismissal without prejudice of the plaintiff's supplemental claims under local law. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3); <i>see also Serapi&#243;n v.
