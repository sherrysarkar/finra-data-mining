William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     MacArthur Denson on brief pro se.\n     Nancy Ankers White, Special Assistant Attorney General, and\nAnn M. McCarthy, Counsel, Department of Correction, on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                      September 29, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam.      Pro se appellant MacArthur Denson is\n\na prisoner confined to the Departmental Disciplinary Unit\n\n(DDU) at M.C.I. Cedar Junction, a Massachusetts correctional\n\ninstitution.      He has sued John Marshall, the Superintendent\n\nof   that     facility,      and     Mark       Powers,    the   Deputy\n\nSuperintendent,           alleging       that    they     violated   his\n\nconstitutional right to the free exercise of his religion by\n\ndenying his request for non-perishable food to enable him to\n\nfast during daylight hours for three days each month.                The\n\ndistrict court granted the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment    and   thereafter    denied      appellant's     motion   for\n\nreconsideration.     Having thoroughly reviewed the record and\n\nthe parties' briefs on appeal, we affirm, substantially for\n\nthe reasons stated by the district court.                 See Denson v.\n\nMarshall, 59 F. Supp.2d 156, 157-59 (D. Ma. 1999).               We add\n\nthe following comments.\n\n            We reject appellant's contention that the district\n\ncourt erroneously resolved genuine issues of material fact\n\nin granting the defendants summary judgment.                The factual\n\nissues that the appellant identifies were not material to\n\nthe resolution of this case.         Even if we credit appellant's\n\nevidence that peanut butter and jelly are readily available\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f at Cedar Junction, it is clear that appellant is seeking\n\n \"special food\" (i.e., items which deviate from the general\n\n menu)     at    a   \"special     time\"    (three   particular   days   each\n\n month).        This particularized accommodation pales in light of\n\n the    avenues      of    religious      expression    that   are   already\n\n available to appellant.               Under these circumstances, the\n\n district court properly deferred to the superintendent's\n\n informed        opinion   that    accommodating       appellant's   request\n\n would create intolerable logistical and security problems.\n\n See, e.g., Kadey v. Jones, 836 F.2d 948, 950-51 (5 th Cir.\n\n 1988); Udey v. Kastner, 805 F.2d 1218, 1220-21 (5 th Cir.\n\n 1986).1        Similarly, although the district court did not\n\n explicitly mention the fourth factor under the Turner test,\n\n we discern no error.           On this record, it is clear that the\n\n court implicitly abjured appellant's contention that his\n\n\n\n\n    1Contrary to appellant's contention on appeal, the fact that\nappellant may not observe the particular fasts in issue without\nthe institution's accommodation is of no moment here. \"'[T]he\nright' in question must be viewed sensibly and expansively.\"\nThornburgh v.   Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 417-18 (1989)(citations\nomitted). Thus, the relevant inquiry under the second Turner\nfactor is whether an inmate has alternative means of expressing\nhis religious beliefs generally, not whether there is an\nalternative means of engaging in the particular religious\npractice in issue.

Walsh, 1\nF.3d 873, 877 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n                                          -3-\n\frequest could be accommodated at a de minimis cost to valid\n\npenological interests.\n\n         Affirmed.
