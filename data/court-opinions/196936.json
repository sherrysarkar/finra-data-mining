These appeals present a hothouse\r                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.\r                                        \r\n\nof efflorescent issues set against a backdrop composed of roughly\r\n\nequal parts of  drugs, money, and mayhem.  Two  of those issues  \r\n\none implicating the Confrontation  Clause and the other involving\r\n\nFed.  R.  Crim. P.  24(c)    raise  important questions  of first\r\n\nimpression in this circuit.  In the pages that follow, we offer a\r\n\nskeletal  outline of the case and then  put flesh on the bones by\r\n\naddressing,  first, the appellants' two flagship claims.  We next\r\n\nconsider  a   series  of  discovery  disputes   and  conclude  by\r\n\ndiscussing, albeit in a more abbreviated fashion, a laundry  list\r\n\nof other asseverations.  In  the end, after careful consideration\r\n\nof  the  parties'  arguments   and  close  perscrutation  of  the\r\n\ncompendious record, we  affirm the judgments below in large part,\r\n\nbut reverse  one defendant's  conviction on three  related counts\r\n\nand bring a contingent sentencing determination to closure.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Overcoming   the  temptation   to  engage   in  Homeric\r\n\nrecitation of the  riveting facts that emerged  during a seventy-\r\n\nday trial, we opt instead to sketch the evidence at this juncture\r\n\nand  reserve  greater  detail  until the  need  arises  to  place\r\n\nspecific issues into  workable context.   We draw  our sketch  in\r\n\ncolors that coordinate with  the jury's verdicts, consistent with\r\n\nrecord support.  See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707,\r                                                            \r\n\n711 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1063 (1993).\r                                           \r\n\n          For  nearly  four  years  Michael  Fitzgerald and  John\r\n\nHoulihan  ran a ruthlessly  efficient drug ring  from an unlikely\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncommand   post:       Kerrigan's   Flower   Shop,    Charlestown,\r\n\nMassachusetts.   The  organization  commanded  the allegiance  of\r\n\nnumerous   distributors,   stationary   and   mobile,   including\r\n\nJennierose Lynch, William \"Bud\" Sweeney, George Sargent, and Alan\r\n\nSkinner.    These  minions,  and  others  like them,  helped  the\r\n\norganization  supply  cocaine  to  hordes of  buyers  through  an\r\n\nelaborate street-level distribution network that arranged most of\r\n\nits  sales with the  aid of electronic  pagers, assigned customer\r\n\ncodes, and preset rendezvous points.\r\n\n          Fitzgerald  and  Houlihan  imposed  a  strict  code  of\r\n\nsilence on all who  came into contact with them,  including their\r\n\nown troops.  They dealt severely with persons who seemed inclined\r\n\nto  talk too freely.  Joseph Nardone, a professional assassin who\r\n\nbragged  that he was the \"headache man\"   when the organization's\r\n\nchieftains had a  headache, Nardone got rid of it    acted as the\r\n\nprincipal  enforcer.   Over  time,  the  gang's targets  included\r\n\nSargent, Sweeney (who survived multiple attempts on his life, but\r\n\nwas left paralyzed  from the  chest down), a  rival drug  dealer,\r\n\nJames Boyden III, and the latter's son and helpmeet, James Boyden\r\n\nIV.\r\n\n          The Fitzgerald-Houlihan axis dominated  the Charlestown\r\n\nscene  through 1993.  Ultimately,  the authorities broke the code\r\n\nof silence and a federal  grand jury indicted twelve  individuals\r\n\n(including  Fitzgerald, Houlihan,  and  Nardone) on  a myriad  of\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ncharges.1  After  trial, the two  ringleaders and their  enforcer\r\n\nwere found guilty of engaging in a racketeering enterprise (count\r\n\n1),  racketeering  conspiracy  (count  2), conspiracy  to  commit\r\n\nmurder in aid of  racketeering (counts 5, 7 &amp;  9), and conspiracy\r\n\nto distribute  cocaine (count 20).   See  18 U.S.C.     1962(c) &amp;\r                                                  \r\n\n(d),  1959(a);  21  U.S.C.     846.    The  jury  also  convicted\r\n\nFitzgerald  and  Houlihan  of  aiding  and  abetting  murder  and\r\n\nattempted murder in  aid of racketeering (counts 6, 8,  11 &amp; 12),\r\n\ninstigating murder  for hire (counts 15, 16  &amp; 17), engaging in a\r\n\ncontinuing  criminal  enterprise  (count  19),  and  distributing\r\n\ncocaine (counts 21 through 29).  See  18 U.S.C.    1959(a), 1958;\r                                              \r\n\n21 U.S.C.    848,  841(a)(1).  The  jury found Nardone guilty  of\r\n\nmurder  and attempted murder in aid of racketeering (counts 6, 8,\r\n\n11  &amp; 12),  see 18  U.S.C.    1959(a), and  using and  carrying a\r                         \r\n\nfirearm  during and in relation to crimes of violence (counts 39,\r\n\n40, 42 &amp;  43), see 18  U.S.C.   924(c).   The jury also  returned\r                            \r\n\nspecial  forfeiture verdicts.  See 18  U.S.C.   1963; 21 U.S.C.  \r                                            \r\n\n853.   The district  court sentenced  each defendant  to multiple\r\n\nterms of life imprisonment.  These appeals blossomed.\r\n\nII.  THE VOICE FROM THE GRAVE\r          II.  THE VOICE FROM THE GRAVE\r\n\n          The district  court admitted over objection portions of\r\n\nhearsay  statements made  by George  Sargent on  the  theory that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Of  these  twelve, only  Fitzgerald, Houlihan,  and Nardone\r\nappear  as appellants  before us.   Three  of their  codefendants\r\n(Skinner, Lynch,  and  Joseph Houlihan)  eventually pled  guilty;\r\nfive others were granted a separate trial; and one (William Herd)\r\nwas   acquitted  by  the  same  jury  that  convicted  the  three\r\nappellants.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nSargent's murder constituted a waiver of the Confrontation Clause\r\n\nvis- -vis the murderers.2   Houlihan and Nardone  assign error to\r\n\nthis order and to a salmagundi of related rulings.\r\n\n                      A.  Setting the Stage.\r                                A.  Setting the Stage.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Sargent  served as  a  distributor for  the Fitzgerald-\r\n\nHoulihan organization.  The police arrested him twice during 1992\r\n\non drug-trafficking charges.   Both times, Sargent made voluntary\r\n\nstatements that inculpated Fitzgerald and Houlihan in a sprawling\r\n\ndrug conspiracy  and tended  to link  them with  several murders.\r\n\nThe statements also furnished  evidence probative of the elements\r\n\nof  the offenses with which Nardone had been charged, but Sargent\r\n\ndid not mention him by name.   On June 28, 1992   within a  month\r\n\nafter  he  gave the  second  statement    police  found Sargent's\r\n\ncorpse in a parking lot.  He had been killed by a bullet wound to\r\n\nthe head inflicted at close range.\r\n\n          The government filed a pretrial motion for an order (1)\r\n\nauthorizing  a  state trooper,  Mark  Lemieux,  to testify  about\r\n\nSargent's  statements following  his March  1992 arrest,  and (2)\r\n\npermitting the jury  to hear a redacted version of  the taped May\r\n\n1992  interview conducted  by Boston police  detectives following\r\n\nSargent's  second  arrest.     The  government  argued  that  the\r\n\nappellants    who had been charged with Sargent's murder   waived\r\n\ntheir rights  to  object to  the  admission of  his  out-of-court\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Because  the  government  did  not prove  to  the  district\r\ncourt's  satisfaction  that Fitzgerald  shared  his codefendants'\r\nintent to forestall Sargent from cooperating with the police, the\r\ncourt ruled that  Sargent's statements could not be  used against\r\nFitzgerald.  The correctness of that ruling is not before us.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nstatements on either Confrontation Clause or hearsay grounds when\r\n\nthey  successfully  conspired  to  execute him  for  the  express\r\n\npurpose of preventing his cooperation with the authorities.   The\r\n\ndistrict court took the motion under advisement and, near the end\r\n\nof  the  government's  case  in chief,  admitted  the  challenged\r\n\nevidence against  Houlihan and  Nardone, but not  Fitzgerald, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nsupra note 2, concluding  that the government had shown  by clear\r               \r\n\nand convincing  evidence that those defendants  conspired to kill\r\n\nSargent at  least in part for the  purpose of preventing him from\r\n\ncooperating  with   the  police,  and  that   such  actions  were\r\n\ntantamount  to a  knowing waiver  of their  confrontation rights.\r\n\nSee United States v. Houlihan, 887 F. Supp. 352, 363-65 (D. Mass.\r                                       \r\n\n1995).3\r\n\n        B.  Waiver by Homicide:  The Confrontation Clause.\r                  B.  Waiver by Homicide:  The Confrontation Clause.\r                                                                   \r\n\n          To resolve Houlihan's and Nardone's main objections, we\r\n\nmust  decide  whether a  defendant  waives his  rights  under the\r\n\nConfrontation Clause by murdering  a potential witness to prevent\r\n\nthat witness  from  turning state's  evidence  and/or  testifying\r\n\nagainst him at trial.  We believe that he does.\r\n\n          It is apodictic that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the\r\n\naccused shall  enjoy the right  . . .  to be confronted  with the\r\n\nwitnesses against  him .  . . .\"   U.S. Const.  Amend. VI.   This\r\n\ntrial right  is  designed to  assure defendants  of a  meaningful\r\n\nopportunity to cross-examine  the witnesses  who testify  against\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The district  court also  published a  preliminary opinion,\r\nUnited States v.

See, e.g., Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1205-07 (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir. 1987) (discussing  exception for spontaneous  exclamations),\r\n\ncert. denied, 485  U.S. 990  (1988).  Moreover,  a defendant  may\r                      \r\n\nwaive  his  right to  confrontation  by  knowing and  intentional\r\n\nrelinquishment.   See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 243 (1969)\r                                                 \r\n\n(holding  that  a  guilty  plea  is  an  express  waiver  of  the\r\n\nconstitutional  right  to  confrontation); see  also  Johnson  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nZerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938).  While a waiver of the right to\r                \r\n\nconfront  witnesses typically is express, the law is settled that\r\n\na defendant also may waive it through his intentional misconduct.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Taylor  v.  United States,  414  U.S. 17,  20  (1973)\r                                               \r\n\n(finding such  a waiver  when a  defendant boycotted  his trial);\r\n\nIllinois  v.

Thus, a defendant  who wrongfully\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nprocures  a  witness's absence  for  the purpose  of  denying the\r\n\ngovernment that  witness's testimony  waives his right  under the\r\n\nConfrontation Clause  to object to  the admission  of the  absent\r\n\nwitness's hearsay statements.

Thus,  they could  not\r\n\nhave been on  notice that they  were waiving a  trial right.   We\r\n\nfind this argument unpersuasive.  Although the reported cases all\r\n\nappear to involve actual  witnesses, see, e.g., United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nThai, 29 F.3d 785, 798 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.

In much the same way, when a defendant murders such a\r\n\nwitness (or procures  his demise)  in order to  prevent him  from\r\n\nassisting an  ongoing criminal  investigation, he is  denying the\r\n\ngovernment  the benefit  of  the witness's  live  testimony at  a\r\n\nfuture trial.  In  short, the two situations are  fair congeners:\r\n\nas long as  it is reasonably  foreseeable that the  investigation\r\n\nwill culminate in the bringing of charges, the mere fact that the\r\n\nhomicide  occurs  at an  earlier step  in  the pavane  should not\r\n\naffect   the  operation  of  the  waiver-by-misconduct  doctrine.\r\n\nIndeed, adopting  the contrary  position urged by  the appellants\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nwould  serve  as a  prod to  the  unscrupulous to  accelerate the\r\n\ntimetable and murder suspected snitches sooner rather than later.\r\n\nWe  see no justification for creating  such a perverse incentive,\r\n\nor  for distinguishing  between  a defendant  who assassinates  a\r\n\nwitness  on  the  eve of  trial  and  a  potential defendant  who\r\n\nassassinates a potential  witness before charges  officially have\r\n\nbeen  brought.  In either case, it  is the intent to silence that\r\n\nprovides notice.\r\n\n          We  therefore hold  that when  a person  who eventually\r\n\nemerges  as   a  defendant  (1)  causes   a  potential  witness's\r\n\nunavailability  (2) by  a wrongful  act (3)  undertaken with  the\r\n\nintention of preventing the  potential witness from testifying at\r\n\na future trial, then  the defendant waives his right to object on\r\n\nconfrontation  grounds   to  the  admission  of  the  unavailable\r\n\ndeclarant's out-of-court statements at trial.\r\n\n          Before applying this  holding to the  case at hand,  we\r\n\nmust  correctly calibrate the quantum of proof.

Houlihan, 887  F. Supp. at 360.  This  sets too high a\r                             \r\n\nstandard.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit, we think that the government\r\n\nneed  only prove such predicate  facts by a  preponderance of the\r\n\nevidence.\r\n\n          The  Thevis  court  compared  the  waiver-by-misconduct\r                               \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nproblem  to the  admissibility of  in-court identifications  that\r\n\nfollow tainted  out-of-court identifications.  See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 240 (1967) (requiring government to\r                        \r\n\nprove by  \"clear and  convincing\" evidence in  such circumstances\r\n\nthat  the   proposed  in-court  identification   has  a  reliable\r\n\nindependent  basis).    With   respect,  we  believe  the  better\r\n\ncomparison is  to the admission of  out-of-court statements under\r\n\nthe coconspirator exception  to the  hearsay rule.   See Fed.

To invoke the  coconspirator exception, the\r\n\nproponent of the statement  must \"show by a preponderance  of the\r\n\nevidence\" certain  predicate  facts, namely,  \"that a  conspiracy\r\n\nembracing both the declarant and the defendant existed,  and that\r\n\nthe declarant uttered  the statement during and in furtherance of\r\n\nthe  conspiracy.\"  United States v.

See Steele, 684  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1203;  United  States v.  White, 838  F.

We therefore align ourselves with the majority of federal\r\n\nappellate courts  that have  considered the question,  see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nMastrangelo,  693  F.2d  at 273;  Steele,  684  F.2d  at 1202-03;\r                                                  \r\n\nBalano, 618 F.2d at 629, and set the government's burden of proof\r                \r\n\nat the preponderance-of-the-evidence level.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n          Measured  against this more conventional benchmark, the\r\n\ndistrict court's findings  easily pass muster.   The record amply\r\n\ndemonstrates that  Houlihan and Nardone knew  when they conspired\r\n\nto  murder Sargent that they  were depriving the  government of a\r\n\npotential witness.   First, the district  court supportably found\r\n\nthat they  believed Sargent was  cooperating with the  police and\r\n\ncould  harm them and the organization by talking.4  See Houlihan,\r                                                                          \r\n\n887 F. Supp. at 363-64.   Second, Sargent was in fact cooperating\r\n\nwith law enforcement officials at the time and made two voluntary\r\n\nstatements  in  which  he   provided  detailed  accounts  of  the\r\n\norganization's  modus operandi,  descriptions of  the principals'\r\n\nroles  in various  murders,  and a  frank  admission of  his  own\r\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy.   While the defendants' perception\r\n\nof  likely cooperation may  well be enough to  meet this prong of\r\n\nthe  test,  the  fact  of Sargent's  cooperation  reinforces  the\r\n\ninference  that the  killers  believed Sargent  was spilling  the\r\n\nbeans and  murdered him on that account.  Last but not least, the\r\n\nconspirators knew  to a certainty  that Sargent had  keen insight\r\n\ninto their felonious  activities both  from his own  work in  the\r\n\ndistribution network and from  sundry conversations in which they\r\n\nspoke  openly to  him    in  retrospect, too  openly    of  their\r\n\nparticipation in serious crimes.\r\n\n          This  evidentiary  foundation  sturdily   supports  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4It  is  noteworthy that,  after  Judge Young  ruled  on the\r\nadmissibility  of Sargent's  statements,  Sweeney testified  that\r\nHoulihan told him, flat out, that Sargent had been killed because\r\nhe \"was talking to the cops.\"\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nconclusion  that  Houlihan  and  Nardone  reasonably  could  have\r\n\nforeseen Sargent becoming  a witness against them  and plotted to\r\n\nkill  him in  order to  deprive the  government of  his firsthand\r\n\ntestimony.  Hence, the  district court did not err  in overruling\r\n\nobjections to  the introduction of portions  of Sargent's out-of-\r\n\ncourt  statements insofar  as those  objections stemmed  from the\r\n\nConfrontation Clause.5\r\n\n         C.  Waiver by Homicide:  The Hearsay Objections.\r                   C.  Waiver by Homicide:  The Hearsay Objections.\r                                                                  \r\n\n          Houlihan  and Nardone  next  argue that,  even if  they\r\n\nwaived their confrontation rights,  the district court should not\r\n\nhave admitted  Sargent's  hearsay statements  because  they  were\r\n\ntinged  with self-interest  (having been  made in  police custody\r\n\nwith  a  stiff  sentence  for distributing  large  quantities  of\r\n\nnarcotics  in  prospect)  and  therefore  lacked  \"circumstantial\r\n\nguarantees of trustworthiness.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(5).  On the\r\n\nfacts  of  this  case, we  agree  with  the  district court,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nHoulihan, 887 F. Supp. at 362, 367, that Houlihan's and Nardone's\r                  \r\n\nmisconduct waived  not only  their confrontation rights  but also\r\n\ntheir  hearsay objections,  thus rendering  a special  finding of\r\n\nreliability superfluous.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5In  a related vein, Houlihan  and Nardone complain that the\r\ndistrict court failed to conduct  an evidentiary hearing prior to\r\nruling  on  the  admissibility  of Sargent's  statements.    This\r\ncomplaint  strikes us  as  a  thinly-veiled  effort to  rehash  a\r\ndiscovery  dispute  that we  discuss infra  Part  IV(B).   In all\r                                                    \r\nevents, the district court heard arguments of counsel and thirty-\r\nseven days of trial testimony before deciding that the statements\r\ncould be utilized.   In  these circumstances, the  court did  not\r\noutstrip the bounds of  its discretion in declining to  convene a\r\nspecial mid-trial evidentiary hearing.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n          The  Supreme Court  has yet to  plot the  crossroads at\r\n\nwhich  the  Confrontation  Clause   and  the  hearsay  principles\r\n\nembedded in the Evidence Rules intersect.  The question is subtly\r\n\nnuanced.   Though the two bodies of law are not coterminous, they\r\n\nhusband essentially the same interests.  See California v. Green,\r                                                                          \r\n\n399 U.S.  149, 155-56 (1976).   Both attempt to  strike a balance\r\n\nbetween  the government's  need  for probative  evidence and  the\r\n\ndefendant's stake in testing the government's case through cross-\r\n\nexamination.  See Ohio v. Roberts, 448  U.S. 56, 65 (1980).  As a\r                                           \r\n\nresult, whether hearsay principles are more or less protective of\r\n\na  defendant's  right  to  cross-examination  than  confrontation\r\n\nprinciples depends on the point at which the balance is struck in\r\n\nany particular instance  (recognizing, however, that  the balance\r\n\ncan  be  struck at  different levels  in  different cases).   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGreen, 399 U.S. at 156.\r               \r\n\n          In this case,  we can take matters a step  further.  In\r\n\nconstructing  the balance the  main interest that  must be offset\r\n\nagainst the government's need for evidence is the accused's right\r\n\nto confrontation (for  this is the right from which  the right to\r\n\ncross-examine springs).   Once the confrontation  right is lifted\r\n\nfrom  the scales  by operation  of the  accused's waiver  of that\r\n\nright,  the balance  tips  sharply  in  favor  of  the  need  for\r\n\nevidence.  See Thai, 29 F.3d at 841 (holding that a defendant who\r                             \r\n\nwaives  his  confrontation   right  by  wrongfully  procuring   a\r\n\nwitness's  silence also waives  hearsay objections vis- -vis that\r\n\nwitness); United States v. Aguiar, 975 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir. 1992)\r                                           \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n(similar);  see  also  Steele,  684  F.2d  at  1201  (noting that\r                                       \r\n\n\"English  and  American  courts  have  consistently  relaxed  the\r\n\nhearsay rule  when the  defendant wrongfully causes  the witness'\r\n\nunavailability\").   Here, then, inasmuch as  Houlihan and Nardone\r\n\nwaived their confrontation right by colloguing to murder Sargent,\r\n\nthey  simultaneously  waived their  right  to  object on  hearsay\r\n\ngrounds to the admission of his out-of-court statements.6  Hence,\r\n\nthe  district  court  appropriately   eschewed  the  request  for\r\n\nfindings under Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(5).\r\n\n          Houlihan and  Nardone have  a fallback position.   They\r\n\nsuggest that the district  court's admission of Sargent's out-of-\r\n\ncourt statements violated their rights to due process because the\r\n\nadmissions  allowed  them   to  be  convicted  on  the  basis  of\r\n\nunreliable evidence.  See Green, 399 U.S. at 163 n.15 (ruminating\r                                         \r\n\nthat  \"considerations  of  due  process, wholly  apart  from  the\r\n\nConfrontation Clause, might prevent  convictions where a reliable\r\n\nevidentiary  basis   is  totally  lacking\").     We  reject  this\r\n\ninitiative.   Whatever criticisms  justifiably might  be levelled\r\n\nagainst Sargent's  statements, the portions  of those  statements\r\n\nthat Judge Young allowed  into evidence are not so  unreliable as\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6We  caution that a waiver  of confrontation rights does not\r\nresult in the automatic  surrender of all evidentiary objections.\r\nFor example, a district court  still should exclude relevant  but\r\nhighly  inflammatory evidence, misconduct notwithstanding, if the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the evidence's\r\nprobative  value.   See  Fed. R.  Evid.  403.   Presumably,  such\r                                 \r\nevidence would have  been excludable on  a non-hearsay ground  if\r\nthe declarant were available to testify, so there is no reason to\r\nadmit   it   when   the   defendant   procures   the  declarant's\r\nunavailability.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nto  raise  due  process  concerns.    Other  evidence  abundantly\r\n\ncorroborates   (and  in  many   instances  replicates)  Sargent's\r\n\naccount.   For  instance, his  description of  the organization's\r\n\nmodus operandi  and his assessment of  Houlihan's leadership role\r\n\nwere confirmed and described in  excruciating detail by a  galaxy\r\n\nof  live witnesses  (e.g.,  Michael Nelson,  Bud Sweeney,  Cheryl\r\n\nDillon).7  No more is exigible.\r\n\n                       D.

United States,  391 U.S. 123, 126 (1968)  (holding that\r                                 \r\n\nthe introduction at a joint trial  of a nontestifying defendant's\r\n\nstatements  that implicate a  codefendant constitutes prejudicial\r\n\nerror).   Houlihan,  887 F. Supp.  at 365.   Houlihan and Nardone\r                            \r\n\nobjected,  contending that  the  editing process  heightened  the\r\n\nforce of Sargent's statements, and that if the interviews were to\r\n\nbe introduced at all, then the  entire text should be fair  game.\r\n\nThe district court overruled the objections.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7Perhaps  the  weakest  link   in  the  chain  is  Sargent's\r\nstatement regarding  a suggestive but ambiguous conversation that\r\nhe had with Houlihan  shortly before the killing of  James Boyden\r\nIII.   But this tale is relevant  principally to the three counts\r\nagainst Houlihan on which we order his convictions reversed.  See\r                                                                           \r\ninfra Part V(B).  Thus, any error in admitting it is harmless.\r               \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\n          On  appeal,  Houlihan  and   Nardone  argue  less  that\r\n\nSargent's  statements   should   have  been   redacted   somewhat\r\n\ndifferently and more that  they should not have been  redacted at\r                                                                           \r\n\nall.8   They assert that  when a defendant  waives his rights  to\r             \r\n\nmake   Confrontation  Clause   and  hearsay   objections  through\r\n\nmisconduct,  the absent  declarant's full  out-of-court statement\r\n\nshould be admissible  at the  behest of either  the proponent  or\r\n\nopponent of the statement.   This assertion rests on  a misguided\r\n\nnotion.\r\n\n          The  cardinal  purpose   of  the   waiver-by-misconduct\r\n\ndoctrine is to ensure that a wrongdoer does not profit in a court\r\n\nof  law by  reason  of his  miscreancy.   By  murdering  Sargent,\r\n\nHoulihan and Nardone  denied the prosecution  the benefit of  his\r\n\nlive  testimony.  To compensate for that denial the court allowed\r\n\nthe  government  to introduce  portions  of  the interviews  that\r\n\nSargent  gave to  the  police.   The  defense, however,  was  not\r\n\nentitled  to any  compensation,  and permitting  it to  introduce\r\n\nadditional hearsay statements (apart from statements necessary to\r\n\nplace the portions  used by  the government into  context and  to\r\n\nrender them not misleading)  would be to reward bloodthirstiness.\r\n\nWe decline to stamp a judicial imprimatur on a calculated murder.\r\n\nThus,  we hold that a  homicidal defendant may  by his misconduct\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Though  the  district  court  applied  the  same  redaction\r\nprinciples to the police officer's testimony concerning the March\r\ninterview (which was not  recorded or transcribed) and  the tape-\r\nrecorded  May interview, the emphasis on appeal is on the latter.\r\nWhile we restrict  our discussion to that recording,  our holding\r\napplies with equal force to the earlier debriefing.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nwaive  his hearsay objections, but that waiver does not strip the\r\n\ngovernment of its right  to lodge hearsay objections.  It is only\r\n\nthe party who wrongfully procures a witness's absence  who waives\r\n\nthe  right to object to  the adverse party's  introduction of the\r\n\nwitness's prior out-of-court statements.  See White, 838 F. Supp.\r                                                             \r\n\nat 625; see also Steele, 684 F.2d at 1202.\r                                 \r\n\n          To sum up, since  courts should not reward  parties for\r\n\ntheir  own misdeeds,  a prior  out-of-court  statement made  by a\r\n\nwitness whose unavailability stems from the wrongful conduct of a\r\n\nparty,  aimed at  least  in part  at  achieving that  result,  is\r\n\nadmissible against that party as long as the statement would have\r\n\nbeen admissible had  the witness  testified.  But  the party  who\r\n\ncauses  the witness's unavailability is  not entitled to the same\r\n\nprophylaxis.  Consequently, under settled jurisprudence governing\r\n\ntotem-pole  hearsay, see Fed. R. Evid. 805, the tape of Sargent's\r                                  \r\n\ninterview itself  constituted first-level hearsay not  within any\r\n\nrecognized exception,  and  the district  court  did not  err  in\r\n\nadmitting some  portions at the government's  urging and refusing\r\n\nto admit the rest of the recording at the appellants' behest.\r\n\n          Houlihan  and Nardone  offer  a second  reason why  the\r\n\ntrial  court   erred  in  excluding  the   balance  of  Sargent's\r\n\nstatements.  This construct  pivots on Evidence Rule 106,  a rule\r\n\nthat codifies  principles of  fairness and completeness.9   Under\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9The rule provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n          When  a  . .  .  recorded  statement or  part\r\n          thereof is introduced by a party, an  adverse\r\n          party  may  require  him   at  that  time  to\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nit, a party  against whom a  fragmentary statement is  introduced\r\n\nmay demand  that the rest of the statement (or so much thereof as\r\n\nis appropriate) be admitted  into evidence in order to  place the\r\n\nexcerpt in context.\r\n\n          It is readily evident that, as the appellants maintain,\r\n\nRule 106  can serve its  proper function only if  the trial court\r\n\nfrom time  to time is prepared to permit the introduction of some\r\n\notherwise inadmissible  evidence.   See United States  v. Sutton,\r                                                                          \r\n\n801  F.2d 1346,  1368  (D.C. Cir.  1986).   Be  that  as it  may,\r\n\ncompleteness,  like beauty,  is  frequently  in  the eye  of  the\r\n\nbeholder.   The trial court is in the best position to assess the\r\n\ncompeting centrifugal  and centripetal  forces that bear  on this\r\n\ncalculus.   Thus, when the trial court, acting in its discretion,\r\n\nfinds  that proffered excerpts,  standing on  their own,  are not\r\n\nmisleading,  its judgment  is  entitled to  great  respect.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.

So it is here.\r                \r\n\n          Houlihan and Nardone  dwell on incompleteness primarily\r\n\nbecause Judge  Young declared two sets  of comments inadmissible.\r\n\n(1) Sargent told the police, inter alia, that James Boyden IV was\r                                                 \r\n\nselling drugs  in Lynch's  territory; that Fitzgerald  warned him\r\n\nand had  him beaten,  but  to no  avail; and  that  he then  told\r\n\nSargent  that  he  would  \"just  have  to kill\"  the  interloper.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          introduce any other part . . . which ought in\r\n          fairness  to be  considered contemporaneously\r\n          with it.\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 106.\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nClaiming that Fitzgerald's remarks to Sargent provided Fitzgerald\r\n\nwith a  different motive  to murder  Sargent, Houlihan  sought to\r\n\nhave  this part  of Sargent's  statement admitted  into evidence.\r\n\nHoulihan   claims  that   omitting  references   to  Fitzgerald's\r\n\ninvolvement in the  murder made  it appear that  he, rather  than\r\n\nFitzgerald, was the mastermind  responsible for that crime.   (2)\r\n\nIn a similar  vein, Nardone  claims that the  court's refusal  to\r\n\npermit  him to introduce  references in the  interviews to Herd's\r\n\nputative involvement in the Boydens' killings made it appear that\r\n\nNardone carried out those murders single-handed.\r\n\n          The  court found that  these incremental  excerpts were\r\n\n\"segregable\"  from  the  portions  of  the  interviews  that  the\r\n\ngovernment had  proffered and denied the  appellants' requests to\r\n\nadmit  them.  Houlihan,  887 F. Supp.  at 366.   In assessing the\r                                \r\n\ncourt's  rulings,  three  facts are  worthy  of  note:   (1)  the\r\n\ninterview segments  admitted into evidence contained  no explicit\r\n\nreference whatever to the  Boydens' murders; (2) neither Houlihan\r\n\nnor Nardone were charged with the slaying of James Boyden IV; and\r\n\n(3)  Sargent  never mentioned  Nardone  by name  anywhere  in the\r\n\ncourse of either  debriefing.   Bearing these facts  in mind,  we\r\n\nconclude  that  the lower  court acted  within  the realm  of its\r\n\ndiscretion in refusing to invoke Rule 106.\r\n\n          Houlihan and  Nardone also claim that  the court should\r\n\nhave admitted  other portions of Sargent's  interviews to impeach\r\n\nhis  credibility.   See  Fed. R.  Evid.  806 (providing  that the\r                                 \r\n\ncredibility of  a hearsay declarant \"may be attacked . . . by any\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nevidence which would  be admissible for  those purposes if  [the]\r\n\ndeclarant  had testified  as  a witness\").

Supp. at 368.   Having reviewed the items,  we discern no\r\n\nerror in their exclusion.\r\n\n          Trial  courts  have  considerable  leeway  in  imposing\r\n\noutside limits on  cross-examination.  See Van Arsdall,  475 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\nat  679;  Laboy-Delgado,  84  F.3d  at  28.    Here,  the  record\r                                 \r\n\ndemonstrates that the appellants had a full and fair  opportunity\r\n\nduring  their cross-examination of  the officers  who interviewed\r\n\nSargent to cast doubts upon his  veracity.  They made the most of\r\n\nthis opportunity.10   By  contrast, the  extra material that  the\r\n\nappellants wished to introduce  lacked genuine impeachment  value\r\n\nand  promised to  add  virtually nothing  of  consequence to  the\r\n\ngrueling cross-examination.   Thus, we cannot  fault the district\r\n\ncourt for excluding this exiguous material.  See Van Arsdall, 475\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 679 (stating  that cross-examination appropriately may be\r\n\nlimited if redundant or marginally relevant); Boylan, 898 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n255-56 (similar).\r\n\n          To  say  more would  be  supererogatory.

The record reveals none.\r\n\n          Because the  prosecution must  show the existence  of a\r\n\nconspiracy to prove a conspiracy charge, evidence implicating one\r\n\ncoconspirator is  likely to be  directly relevant to  the charges\r\n\nagainst  his codefendants.   See United  States v.  O'Bryant, 998\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  21,  26 (1st  Cir. 1993).   Even  if  it is  not, mistrials\r\n\ngrounded  on  spillover  prejudice are  rare.    As  long as  the\r\n\ndistrict court limits the admission of the challenged evidence to\r\n\na particular defendant or defendants, the other defendants cannot\r\n\nrewardingly complain  unless the  impact of  the  evidence is  so\r\n\ndevastating  that, realistically,  instructions  from  the  bench\r\n\ncannot be expected to repair the damage.  See  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 1184.\r\n\n          Silhouetted against  this set of  rules, the flimsiness\r\n\nof  Fitzgerald's claim come into  bold relief.   What excites the\r\n\nemotions in one  case may  be routine evidence  in another  case.\r\n\nThe material  distilled from  Sargent's statements    which would\r\n\nhave stood out like a  sore thumb in a prosecution rooted  in the\r\n\nrelative  gentility  of  white-collar   crime     does  not  seem\r\n\nespecially  sensational when  evaluated  in light  of the  other,\r\n\nplainly admissible evidence that permeated this seventy-day  saga\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nof nonstop violence.  Moreover, the district court instructed the\r\n\njurors  on  the spot  that they  were  not to  consider Sargent's\r\n\nstatements  in deciding  Fitzgerald's fate.   To  complement that\r\n\ndirective, the  court redacted all references  to Fitzgerald from\r\n\nthe  portions of  those statements  that the  jury heard,  and it\r\n\nrepeated  its  prophylactic  instruction  on  several  occasions.\r\n\nUnder these circumstances, the presumption that jurors follow the\r\n\ncourt's  instructions is  intact.   Ergo, Fitzgerald  suffered no\r\n\nunfair prejudice.\r\n\nIII.  ALTERNATE JURORS\r          III.  ALTERNATE JURORS\r\n\n          The  appellants calumnize  the district  court because,\r\n\ndespite their repeated objections, the court refused to discharge\r\n\nthe  alternate jurors once deliberations commenced and compounded\r\n\nits   obduracy  by   allowing  the   alternate  jurors   to  have\r\n\nintermittent contact with the  regular jurors during the currency\r\n\nof jury deliberations.  This argument requires us to address, for\r\n\nthe first time, the interplay between violations of Fed. R. Crim.\r\n\nP. 24(c) and the applicable test for harmless error.\r\n\n          The imperative of Rule  24(c) is clear and categorical:\r\n\n\"An alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be\r\n\ndischarged after the jury retires to consider its verdict.\"  Fed.\r\n\nR. Crim. P. 24(c).   The rule reflects the abiding  concern that,\r\n\nonce a criminal case has been submitted, the jury's deliberations\r\n\nshall  remain private  and  inviolate.11   See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11Notwithstanding  that  Criminal  Rule  23(b)  permits  the\r\nremaining  eleven  jurors   to  return  a  valid  verdict   if  a\r\ndeliberating juror is excused for cause, the wisdom of Rule 24(c)\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nVirginia Erection Corp., 335 F.2d 868, 872 (4th Cir. 1964).\r                                 \r\n\n          Here, the  appellants' claim of error  is well founded.\r\n\nRule  24(c)   brooks  no  exceptions,  and   the  district  court\r\n\ntransgressed  its  letter  by  retaining  the   alternate  jurors\r\n\nthroughout  the deliberative  period.   The  lingering  question,\r\n\nhowever, is  whether the infraction requires us to invalidate the\r\n\nconvictions.  The appellants say that it does.  In  their view, a\r\n\nviolation of  Rule 24(c)  automatically necessitates a  new trial\r\n\nwhere, as  here, the defendants  preserved their claim  of error,\r\n\nor, at least, the continued contact between regular and alternate\r\n\njurors that transpired  in this  case demands that  result.   The\r\n\ngovernment  endeavors to  parry  this thrust  by classifying  the\r\n\nerror as benign.  We find that the Rule 24(c) violation caused no\r\n\ncognizable harm, and we deny relief on that basis.\r\n\n          The watershed  case in this recondite corner of the law\r\n\nis United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993).   There the trial\r                                   \r\n\ncourt  permitted  alternate jurors,  while under  instructions to\r\n\nrefrain from engaging personally  in the deliberative process, to\r\n\nremain  in  the   jury  room  and   audit  the  regular   jurors'\r\n\ndeliberations.  See id. at 727-29.  The jury found the defendants\r                                 \r\n\nguilty.   The court of appeals, terming the presence of alternate\r\n\njurors  in   the  jury  room  during   deliberations  \"inherently\r\n\nprejudicial,\"  granted  them new  trials  although  they had  not\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nremains  debatable.    We   can  understand  a  district  judge's\r\nreluctance, following  a long,  complicated, and  hotly contested\r\ntrial,  to release alternate jurors before a verdict is obtained.\r\nBut courts, above all other institutions, must obey the rules.\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nlodged contemporaneous  objections.  United States  v. Olano, 934\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 1425, 1428 (9th Cir. 1991).  The Supreme Court demurred.  It\r\n\nnoted  that  unless  an  unpreserved  error  affects  defendants'\r\n\n\"substantial rights,\" Fed.  R. Crim. P.  52(b), the error  cannot\r\n\nserve as a fulcrum  for overturning their convictions.   507 U.S.\r\n\nat  737.   The  Court then  declared that  the mere  \"presence of\r\n\nalternate jurors during  jury deliberations  is not  the kind  of\r\n\nerror  that `affect[s]  substantial  rights'  independent of  its\r\n\nprejudicial  impact.\"   Id.   Instead,  the  critical inquiry  is\r                                     \r\n\nwhether  the presence of the  alternates in the  jury room during\r\n\ndeliberations actually  prejudiced the defendants.   See   id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n739.\r\n\n          The  Justices conceded  that, as a  theoretical matter,\r\n\nthe presence of any outsider,  including an alternate juror,  may\r\n\ncause  prejudice if  he  or  she  actually  participates  in  the\r\n\ndeliberations either \"verbally\" or through \"body language,\" or if\r\n\nhis   or  her  attendance  were  somehow  to  chill  the  jurors'\r\n\ndeliberations.    Id.   The  Court  recognized, however,  that  a\r                               \r\n\njudge's cautionary  instructions to alternates  (e.g., to refrain\r\n\nfrom injecting themselves into  the deliberations) can operate to\r\n\nlessen or eliminate  these risks.  See id. at 740 (remarking \"the\r                                                    \r\n\nalmost invariable assumption  of the law that jurors follow their\r\n\ninstructions\") (quoting  Richardson v.  Marsh, 481 U.S.  200, 206\r                                                       \r\n\n(1987)).  Thus, absent  a \"specific showing\" that the  alternates\r\n\nin fact participated in, or otherwise chilled, deliberations, the\r\n\ntrial  court's instructions to the alternates not to intervene in\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nthe jury's deliberations precluded a finding of plain error.  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 741.\r\n\n          This  case presents  a  variation on  the Olano  theme.\r                                                                   \r\n\nHere, unlike in Olano, the appellants  contemporaneously objected\r                               \r\n\nto the district court's retention  of the alternate jurors,  thus\r\n\nrelegating  plain  error  analysis  to  the  scrap  heap.    This\r\n\ncircumstance denotes two things.   First, here, unlike  in Olano,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthe  government,   not  the  defendants,  bears   the  devoir  of\r\n\npersuasion with  regard to  the existence  vel non  of prejudice.\r                                                            \r\n\nSecond,  we must today answer the precise question that the Olano\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt  reserved for  later  decision.    See  id.    Withal,  the\r                                                           \r\n\nframework  of the inquiry in all other respects remains the same.\r\n\nSee id. at  734 (noting  that, apart from  the allocation of  the\r                 \r\n\nburden of  proof, a claim of  error under Fed.

We do  not discount  the\r\n\nsignificance of this  solitary difference, see, e.g., id.  at 742\r                                                                   \r\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (commenting  that it is \"most difficult\r\n\nfor  the Government  to  show  the  absence of  prejudice\"),  but\r\n\n\"difficult\" does not mean \"impossible.\"  Since Olano teaches that\r                                                              \r\n\na violation of Rule 24(c) is  not reversible error per se,12  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at 737, we must  undertake a particularized inquiry directed\r             \r\n\nat  whether the instant  violation, in the  circumstances of this\r\n\ncase,  \"prejudiced  [the   defendants],  either  specifically  or\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12On   this  score,   Olano   confirmed   what  this   court\r                                          \r\nanticipated.

See, e.g., id. at 734; Kotteakos v. United States, 328\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 750,  758-65 (1946).   In performing this task,  we find the\r\n\nCourt's  reasoning in Olano instructive.  Cf. Lee v. Marshall, 42\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  1296, 1299 (9th Cir. 1994) (finding Olano Court's reasoning\r                                                         \r\n\ntransferable to  harmless error  analysis in  habeas case).   The\r\n\nrisks  that  were  run  here  by  retaining  the  alternates were\r\n\nidentical  to  the risks  that  were run  at the  trial  level in\r\n\nOlano,13  and  the  district   judge's  ability  to  minimize  or\r               \r\n\neliminate those risks was the same in both situations.\r\n\n          The  operative  facts are  as  follows.   Although  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  retained  the  alternates,  subsequent  physical\r\n\ncontact  between  them  and  the  regular  jurors  occurred  only\r\n\nsporadically   confined mostly to the beginning of each day (when\r\n\nall  the jurors  assembled  prior to  the  commencement of  daily\r\n\ndeliberations) and lunch time  (when court security officers were\r\n\ninvariably  present).14   Judge  Young  at  no time  allowed  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13In  one respect, treating this case as comparable to Olano\r                                                                           \r\ntilts matters in  the appellants' favor.  There, the undischarged\r\nalternates actually stayed in the jury room during deliberations.\r\n507 U.S.  at 729-30.   Here, they  did not;  indeed, the  regular\r\njurors  and the  undischarged alternates  were never  in physical\r\nproximity while the deliberative process was ongoing.\r\n\n     14On one occasion  when the  regular jurors were  on a  mid-\r\nmorning break, an alternate juror retrieved a plate of delicacies\r\nfrom  the jury room.   Defense counsel brought  this interlude to\r\nJudge  Young's attention,  and  the judge  immediately agreed  to\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nalternates to come within earshot of the deliberating jurors.\r\n\n          Equally as  important, the  court did not  leave either\r\n\nset  of venirepersons  uninstructed.   At  the  beginning of  his\r\n\ncharge, Judge  Young  told  the alternates  not  to  discuss  the\r\n\nsubstance of the case either among themselves or with the regular\r\n\njurors.   He then directed the  regular jurors not to discuss the\r\n\ncase with the alternates.  Near the end of the  charge, the judge\r\n\nadmonished  all the talesmen that \"if [the regular jurors are] in\r\n\nthe  presence  of the  alternates or  the  alternates are  in the\r\n\npresence of  the jurors,  [there is to  be] no talking  about the\r\n\ncase,  no  deliberating about  the  case.\"   The  regular  jurors\r\n\nretired  to  the  jury  room  for  their  deliberations, and  the\r\n\nundischarged  alternates retired  to an  anteroom in  the judge's\r\n\nchambers  (which  remained  their  base  of  operations  for  the\r\n\nduration of the deliberations).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ninstruct  the  alternates to  stay out  of  the jury  room during\r\nbreaks (except  for retrieving  snacks from  the  jury room  when\r\ncourt security  officers confirmed that a  break in deliberations\r\nhad occurred).\r\n       On another  occasion defense counsel voiced suspicion that\r\na  note from  the jury  to the  judge (requesting  transcripts of\r\nseveral witnesses' testimony) had been written in the presence of\r\nthe  alternates.  At counsels' urging, Judge Young, in the course\r\nof responding to the note in open court, asked each juror whether\r\n\"the alternates and the deliberating jurors, or vice versa, [had]\r\ndiscussed the  substance of the  case\" during the  pertinent time\r\nframe.  All the jurors responded in the negative, and Judge Young\r\nreinstructed  the regular jurors not to discuss the case with, or\r\ndeliberate  in  the  presence  of,  the  alternate  jurors.   The\r\ndefendants took no exception either to the form of the inquiry or\r\nto the instructions that the court gave.\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          The deliberations lasted eleven  days.15  Each morning,\r\n\nJudge Young asked the regular jurors and the alternate jurors, on\r\n\npenalty of perjury, whether  they had spoken about the  case with\r\n\nanyone  since the previous day's  adjournment.  On each occasion,\r\n\nall the jurors (regular and alternate) responded in the negative.\r\n\nThe  judge reiterated  his instructions  to both the  regular and\r\n\nalternate  jurors  at  the close  of  every  court  session.   In\r\n\naddition,  he  routinely  warned   the  venire  that,  when  they\r\n\nassembled the next morning  before deliberations resumed, \"no one\r\n\nis to talk about the case.\"\r\n\n          On this record, we believe that the regular jurors were\r\n\nwell  insulated  from the  risks posed  by  the retention  of the\r\n\nalternates.   The judge repeatedly instructed the jurors   in far\r\n\ngreater  detail  than  in  Olano    and  those  instructions were\r                                          \r\n\ndelicately   phrased  and   admirably   specific.     Appropriate\r\n\nprophylactic instructions are a means of preventing the potential\r\n\nharm  that hovers when a  trial court fails  to dismiss alternate\r\n\njurors on schedule.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 740-41; United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Sobamowo, 892  F.2d 90,  97 (D.C.

Franklin, 471  U.S.  307,  324  n.9\r                                                \r\n\n(1985), and that they follow those instructions.\r\n\n          Here, we  have more than the usual presumption that the\r\n\njury understood the  instructions and followed  them.  The  court\r\n\ninterrogated the  entire panel   regular  jurors and undischarged\r\n\nalternates   on a daily basis, and received an unbroken string of\r\n\nassurances  that the  regular  jurors  had  not spoken  with  the\r\n\nalternates concerning the substance of  the case, and vice versa.\r\n\nJust  as it is  fitting for appellate  courts to presume,  in the\r\n\nabsence  of a  contrary indication,  that jurors  follow  a trial\r\n\njudge's instructions, so, too, it is fitting for appellate courts\r\n\nto  presume, in the absence of a contrary indication, that jurors\r\n\nanswer a trial judge's questions honestly.\r\n\n          One  last observation is  telling.  Over  and above the\r\n\nplenitude  of instructions, there  is another  salient difference\r\n\nbetween this case and Ottersburg (the only reported criminal case\r                                          \r\n\nin which a federal  appellate court invalidated a verdict  due to\r\n\nthe trial court's failure to discharge alternate jurors).   Here,\r\n\nunlike  in  Ottersburg, 76  F.3d  at 139,  the judge  at  no time\r                                \r\n\npermitted the alternates  to sit in on, or  listen to, the jury's\r\n\ndeliberations (even  as mute  observers).  Hence,  the alternates\r\n\nhad  no  opportunity to  participate  in  the deliberations,  and\r\n\nnothing  in the  record  plausibly suggests  that they  otherwise\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\ninfluenced  the jury's actions.   If the mere  presence of silent\r\n\nalternates in  the jury room during  ongoing deliberations cannot\r                                                                    \r\n\nin  and of  itself  be deemed  to  chill discourse  or  establish\r\n\nprejudice,  see Olano,  507 U.S.  at 740-41,  it  is surpassingly\r                               \r\n\ndifficult to imagine how absent (though undischarged) alternates,\r\n\nproperly   instructed,  could   have  a   toxic  effect   on  the\r\n\ndeliberative process.16\r\n\n          We will  not paint  the lily.   Given  the lack  of any\r\n\ncontact  between  regular  and alternate  jurors  during  ongoing\r\n\ndeliberations,  the  trial   judge's  careful  and   oft-repeated\r\n\ninstructions,   the  venire's  unanimous   disclaimers  that  any\r\n\ndiscussions about the case took place between the  two subgroups,\r\n\nthe overall  strength of the prosecution's  evidence on virtually\r\n\nall  the counts of  conviction, and the  discriminating nature of\r\n\nthe  verdicts that  were returned  (e.g., the jury  acquitted the\r\n\nappellants  on  sundry  counts  and  also  acquitted  the  fourth\r\n\ndefendant, Herd,  outright), we conclude that  the government has\r\n\ncarried its burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial\r\n\nwould  have  been  precisely  the  same  had  the  district court\r\n\ndismissed the  alternate jurors  when the  jury first  retired to\r\n\ndeliberate.   It follows that because  the appellants suffered no\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16In Cabral v.

We first deal\r\n\nwith a  claim that implicates  the scope  of the  Jencks Act,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.       3500,  and   then   treat   the  appellants'   other\r\n\nasseverations.\r\n\n                   A.

That right is subject to  a temporal condition:  it\r\n\ndoes   not  vest  until  the  witness  takes  the  stand  in  the\r\n\ngovernment's case  and completes  his direct  testimony.   Id.   \r                                                                        \r\n\n3500(a).    It  is  also subject  to  categorical,  content-based\r\n\nrestrictions delineated in  the statute: a statement is  not open\r\n\nto production under the Jencks  Act unless it (i) relates  to the\r\n\nsame subject  matter as  the  witness's direct  testimony, id.   \r                                                                        \r\n\n3500(b), and  (ii) either comprises  grand jury testimony,  id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n3500(e)(3),  or  falls  within  one  of  two  general classes  of\r\n\nstatements, namely,\r\n\n          (1) a written statement made by [the] witness\r\n          and signed or  otherwise adopted or  approved\r\n          by him;\r\n          (2)  a stenographic,  mechanical, electrical,\r\n          or  other  recording,   or  a   transcription\r\n          thereof,  which  is a  substantially verbatim\r\n          recital  of an  oral  statement made  by said\r\n          witness  and recorded  contemporaneously with\r\n\n                                34\r\r\n\n          the making of such oral statement . . . .\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3500(e)(1)-(2).\r\n\n          In  this  case,  the  government  agents  who  led  the\r\n\ninvestigation instructed  all but the most  senior prosecutors to\r\n\nrefrain  from  taking  notes  during pretrial  interviews.    The\r\n\nappellants decried this practice in the district court, but Judge\r\n\nYoung  found  that  even  the  deliberate  use  of  investigatory\r\n\ntechniques designed to minimize the production of written reports\r\n\nwould  not violate  the Jencks  Act.   Before us,  the appellants\r\n\nrenew their challenge.  We, too, think that it lacks force.\r\n\n          The  Jencks  Act  does  not  impose  an  obligation  on\r\n\ngovernment  agents to record witness interviews  or to take notes\r\n\nduring  such  interviews.   After all,  the  Act applies  only to\r\n\nrecordings,  written statements,  and  notes  that  meet  certain\r\n\ncriteria, not to items that never came into being (whether or not\r\n\na  prudent investigator     cynics might  say an  unsophisticated\r\n\ninvestigator    would  have  arranged things  differently).   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.

It has been suggested  that if there\r\n\nwere evidence  that lawmen  \"engaged in manipulative  or coercive\r\n\n                                35\r\r\n\nconduct\"  during  the course  of  an audience  with  a particular\r\n\nwitness, the failure to  record that event might  give rise to  a\r\n\nJencks Act violation.  Lieberman, 608 F.2d at  897 (dictum).  But\r                                          \r\n\nthis dictum, even if it might be of  some moment in a proper case\r\n\n(a  matter  on which  we take  no view)  is  cold comfort  to the\r\n\nappellants.   There is no  proof of such a  scenario here,17 and,\r\n\nwithout  such  proof,  government interviews  with  witnesses are\r\n\n\"presumed to have been conducted with regularity.\"  Id.\r                                                                 \r\n\n          In the absence of a  contrary legislative command   and\r\n\nnone currently exists    the choice among available investigatory\r\n\ntechniques is,  within wide limits,  for the Executive  Branch in\r\n\ncontradistinction  to   the  Judicial  Branch.     The   practice\r\n\nchallenged here is  not beyond  the pale.   Accordingly, we  hold\r\n\nthat the government did not violate the Jencks Act by instructing\r\n\nagents to minimize note-taking.18\r\n\n          Still,  we do  not mean  to imply  that we  endorse the\r\n\npractice.  Eschewing tape recordings and ordering law enforcement\r\n\nagents  not to  take notes  during pretrial  interviews is  risky\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     17The appellants  claim that instructing agents  not to take\r\nnotes  constitutes  a  deliberate  strategy   to  manipulate  the\r\nquantity of discoverable material.   But, this is simply  not the\r\nsort of manipulation to which the panel referred in Lieberman.\r                                                                       \r\n\n     18In  a related  vein,  we likewise  reject the  appellants'\r\nassertion that the government violated the Jencks Act by parading\r\nlaw  enforcement officers rather than percipient witnesses before\r\nthe  grand jury.  \"Hearsay evidence is  a sufficient basis for an\r\nindictment,\" and  the mere  fact that  the government  chooses to\r\nrely  on hearsay evidence in  presenting its case  before a grand\r\njury raises \"no hint of government misconduct.\"  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\nFont-Ramirez,  944 F.2d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502\r                                                                      \r\nU.S. 1065 (1992).\r\n\n                                36\r\r\n\nbusiness      and  not  guaranteed  to  redound   either  to  the\r\n\nsovereign's credit or  to its  benefit.  By  adopting a \"what  we\r\n\ndon't  create can't come back to  haunt us\" approach, prosecutors\r\n\ndemean  their primary mission:  to see  that justice is done.  In\r\n\nmore parochial terms, the government also loses  the advantage of\r\n\nrecords  that  it  may  subsequently need  to  safeguard  against\r\n\nwitnesses  changing  their  stories or  to  refresh recollections\r\n\ndimmed by  the passage  of time.   By  and large,  the legitimate\r\n\ninterests  of law  enforcement  will be  better  served by  using\r\n\nrecording equipment and/or taking  accurate notes than by playing\r\n\nhide-and-seek.\r\n\n                     B.  Delayed Disclosures.\r                               B.  Delayed Disclosures.\r                                                      \r\n\n          The appellants also  complain that delays  attributable\r\n\nto governmental  foot-dragging unfairly hampered their ability to\r\n\ncross-examine witnesses.   The  centerpiece of this  complaint is\r\n\nthe appellants' insistence that, in addition to going very slowly\r\n\nin  creating potentially discoverable  materials, the prosecutors\r\n\nwithheld extant materials, such  as existing notes, under various\r\n\npretexts, claiming that the notes comprised attorney work-product\r\n\nand that they did not  contain substantially verbatim recitals of\r\n\nwitnesses' statements.\r\n\n          The appellants' complaint is unproductive.  Acting with\r\n\ncommendable  thoroughness, the  district court  reviewed all  the\r\n\nprosecutors' notes  and kindred materials in  camera to determine\r\n\nwhich documents (or portions  of documents) were producible under\r\n\nthe  Jencks Act.    The government  turned  over what  the  court\r\n\n                                37\r\r\n\nordered  it  to produce  at the  time(s)  when the  court ordered\r\n\nproduction to be made.\r\n\n          In all events, we have held with a regularity bordering\r\n\non the  echolalic that \"delayed disclosure  claims cannot succeed\r\n\nunless the  aggrieved  defendant demonstrates  prejudice  arising\r\n\nfrom the delay.\"  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1179  (citing cases); see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso  United  States v.

In  this context,\r                              \r\n\ndemonstrating prejudice demands  red meat and strong  drink   but\r\n\nthe  appellants have  served  up much  less  hearty fare.    They\r\n\narticulate  how the delayed  disclosures supposedly impeded their\r\n\nability to  cross-question witnesses largely by  reference to two\r\n\nexamples.  Neither example is compelling.\r\n\n          First, the appellants suggest  that they were  unfairly\r\n\nsurprised  because,  after  Nardone's henchman,  Michael  Nelson,\r\n\ntestified  at  trial that  Fitzgerald alone  had given  Nardone a\r\n\ncontract on the life of James Boyden III, they obtained the grand\r\n\njury  testimony  of  a  subsequent  witness  (a  law  enforcement\r\n\nofficer) which  indicated that Nardone, in  chatting with Nelson,\r\n\nimplicated both  Houlihan and  Fitzgerald in ordering  the hit.19\r                         \r\n\nThe appellants claim that the inconsistency between the officer's\r\n\ngrand jury testimony,  on one hand, and Nelson's trial testimony,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     19When this inconsistency surfaced, the government contended\r\nthat  the grand jury witness  simply made a  mistake, and pointed\r\nout that, according  to the prosecutors' notes,  Nelson stated in\r\nhis  pretrial interview  that Fitzgerald alone issued  the order.\r\nAt  this juncture the court directed  the prosecutors to disclose\r\nthe  summary prepared by a government attorney for the use of the\r\nofficer who appeared before the grand jury.\r\n\n                                38\r\r\n\non  the other hand, could have been exploited to discredit Nelson\r\n\non  cross-examination.   We  are skeptical;  given that  Nelson's\r\n\nstatements during his pretrial interview, see supra note  19, and\r                                                             \r\n\nat  trial were consistent, this tidbit would have been of dubious\r\n\nvalue for impeachment purposes.  Moreover, while Nelson was still\r                                                                           \r\n\non the  witness stand,  the appellants  had  possession of  other\r                               \r\n\ndocuments  that  revealed  the  same inconsistency.    For  these\r\n\nreasons,  we are fully satisfied that any delay in the disclosure\r\n\nof the  law enforcement  officer's grand  jury testimony  did not\r\n\naffect the  outcome of  the  trial.   Consequently, the  incident\r\n\nfails to prove the  appellants' point.  See, e.g.,  United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Devin, 918 F.2d  280, 290-91 (1st Cir. 1990)  (explaining that\r                  \r\n\ndelayed disclosure  of  impeachment  material  does  not  warrant\r\n\nreversal if the material would not have altered the verdict).\r\n\n          The second vignette concerns a prosecutor's note to the\r\n\neffect that Nardone told  Nelson that there were two  reasons why\r                                                              \r\n\nSargent  had to  be killed:   first,  because Houlihan  felt that\r\n\nSargent  \"was a risk\" and \"could hurt [Houlihan] by talking\"; and\r\n\nsecond,  \"as a showing of  respect to the  Murrays\" (a bookmaking\r\n\ngroup  to whom  Sargent  was heavily  indebted).   Regarding  the\r\n\nsecond  reason,  Nelson  explained that  Fitzgerald  and Houlihan\r\n\nasked the Murrays  to post  $50,000 bail for  Bobby Levallee,  an\r\n\norganization  stalwart, in  exchange for  having Sargent  killed.\r\n\nBecause  the government  did  not reveal  this  note until  after\r\n\nNelson had completed his  testimony, the appellants' thesis runs,\r\n\nthey were unable to cross-examine him efficaciously.\r\n\n                                39\r\r\n\n          This  proffer, too,  is wide  of the  mark.   Under any\r\n\ncircumstances, the  note has  only marginal evidentiary  value in\r\n\nlight  of the  extensive  proof confirming  Houlihan's desire  to\r\n\nsilence  Sargent in order to keep him from telling the government\r\n\nwhat he  knew   a desire that the note itself acknowledges.  Even\r\n\nmore  important,  the appellants  had  sufficient  notice of  the\r\n\nalternative \"gambling  debts\" motive well before  Nelson left the\r\n\nstand.    Nelson himself  testified  on  direct examination  that\r\n\nFitzgerald and Houlihan wanted  Sargent killed for \"two reasons\":\r\n\nbecause they believed that the police had coopted him and because\r                                                                   \r\n\nthey were concerned about \"all [Sargent's] gambling debts.\"  And,\r\n\nmoreover,  the record indicates that the  appellants had the rest\r\n\nof  the   prosecutors'  notes   (some  of  which   discussed  the\r\n\nalternative  motivation) in  hand  before  Nelson  completed  his\r                                                   \r\n\ntestimony; indeed,  Houlihan's counsel  relied on those  notes to\r\n\nelicit  information on  cross-examination about  Sargent's gaming\r\n\ndebts   and  his  connection   to  the  Murrays.     Under  these\r\n\ncircumstances,   no  reversible  error   inhered.

With  one exception, the sole ground on  which these\r\n\nchallenges rest is the allegation that the prosecution fell short\r\n\nof establishing the requisite nexus between the use of interstate\r\n\nfacilities  and  the  defendants'  biocidal  activities.21    The\r\n\nchallenge fails.\r\n\n          The  controlling legal  standard is  prosaic.   \"When a\r\n\ncriminal defendant undertakes  a sufficiency  challenge, all  the\r\n\nevidence,  direct and  circumstantial,  must be  viewed from  the\r\n\ngovernment's  coign of  vantage, and the  viewer must  accept all\r\n\nreasonable  inferences  from  it  that are  consistent  with  the\r\n\nverdict.\"   United States  v.

If a rational  jury, indulging all  credibility calls in\r\n\nfavor of the  verdict, could  find the defendant  guilty on  this\r\n\nbasis,  then the inquiry terminates.  See United States v.

In this case,\r\n\nthe prosecution  sought to convict  by proving, inter  alia, that\r                                                                     \r\n\nthe plotters  used telephone  calls as  a means of  accomplishing\r\n\ntheir ends.

Hence, if the government proves that one of\r\n\nthe participants used the telephone or some comparable interstate\r\n\nfacility  in  furtherance  of   the  scheme,  then  the  required\r\n\nfacilitative nexus is established as to all participants.\r\n\n          In this case,  we think that the  jury rationally could\r\n\nfind a facilitative nexus  between the use of telephones  and the\r\n\ncriminal  activities underlying  the  counts of  conviction.   By\r\n\nMarch  of  1992,  Fitzgerald,  a parole  violator,  had  taken up\r\n\ninvoluntary  residence  in a  state  penitentiary.   The  record,\r\n\ntogether  with  reasonable   inferences  extractable   therefrom,\r\n\npermitted the jury  to find  that he made  daily telephone  calls\r\n\nfrom  prison  to  an  indicted coconspirator,  John  Doherty,  at\r\n\nKerrigan's Flower Shop; and  that Doherty, acting as Fitzgerald's\r\n\ninternuncio, supplied  Nardone with the weaponry  needed to mount\r\n\nthe  attacks.   Telephone records  introduced into  evidence also\r\n\nindicate that Fitzgerald called  Nardone several times at Lynch's\r\n\napartment in and around  the dates on  which the murders were  to\r\n\noccur.   Since the jury reasonably could regard the various calls\r\n\nas  an  important link  in the  communicative  chain that  led to\r\n\n                                46\r\r\n\nmurder   and  attempted   murder,   the   appellants'   challenge\r\n\nfounders.22\r\n\n               B.

His major theme is  that the\r\n\ngovernment failed to  link him  to the murder  in any  meaningful\r\n\nway.  We find merit in this proposition.\r\n\n          To convict Houlihan for conspiring to murder in aid  of\r\n\nracketeering,  see  18 U.S.C.     1959(a),  or for  abetting  the\r                            \r\n\nmurder,  see  id.,  the government  had  to  prove  that (1)  the\r                           \r\n\norganization  masterminded by Fitzgerald and Houlihan constituted\r\n\na  racketeering enterprise;  (2)  that, depending  on the  count,\r\n\nHoulihan conspired to commit, or aided and abetted the commission\r\n\nof,  the  murder;  and  (3)  that Houlihan  participated  in  the\r\n\narrangement \"for  the purpose of maintaining  or increasing [his]\r\n\nposition  in a [racketeering] enterprise.\"   Id.   By like token,\r                                                          \r\n\nunder the murder-for-hire statute the government had to prove (1)\r\n\nthat  Houlihan joined  in  causing the  killing  of another,  (2)\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     22Although not  an element  of the  offense, it is  pellucid\r\nthat  the jury  easily could  have believed  Fitzgerald's actions\r\nvis- -vis  Sargent and  Sweeney were  undertaken with  Houlihan's\r\nknowledge  and consent.    To  cite  just one  example,  Houlihan\r\npersonally paid Nardone his  $5,000 \"headache elimination\" fee at\r\nKerrigan's Flower Shop  on the day after  Nardone ended Sargent's\r\nlife.  Further examples are unnecessary.  It suffices to say that\r\nextensive evidence pointed to  the conclusion that Fitzgerald and\r\nHoulihan   jointly  orchestrated   both  Sargent's   slaying  and\r\nSweeney's travails.\r\n\n                                47\r\r\n\npaying a  price or  other  consideration, (3)  with the  specific\r\n\nintent to  commit the  substantive crime  (murder), and  (4) that\r\n\ninterstate  facilities   were  used  by   one  or  more   of  the\r\n\nparticipants in the  course of  perpetrating the crime.   See  18\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.   1958.\r\n\n          A  common thread runs through all three counts.  In one\r\n\nform  or another, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt  that in the spring  of 1992 Houlihan  \"conspired to murder\r\n\nJames Boyden III\" (count  5), and/or \"aided, abetted, counselled,\r\n\ncommanded  [or]  induced\"  that  murder (count  6),  and/or  used\r\n\n\"facilities  in  interstate   commerce  .  .  .   to  hire  other\r\n\nindividuals and  to arrange the  intended murder of  James Boyden\r\n\nIII\" (count 15).   Under each of these counts, the government had\r\n\nto  show at a  bare minimum that Houlihan  intended the murder of\r\n\nJames  Boyden III  to  take place  and  that he  acted  upon that\r\n\nintent.  See,  e.g., United  States v. Santiago,  872 F.2d  1073,\r                                                         \r\n\n1079  (1st Cir.) (explaining  that proof of  a charged conspiracy\r\n\nrequires, inter alia,  proof of intent to  commit the substantive\r                              \r\n\noffense),  cert.  denied, 492  U.S. 910  &amp;  493 U.S.  832 (1989);\r                                  \r\n\nUnited States v.

In other words, as Judge\r\n\nYoung  instructed  the  jury, the  government  had  to show  that\r\n\nHoulihan \"intentionally  arranged for the murder  of James Boyden\r\n\n                                48\r\r\n\nIII  by Joseph Nardone,\" or  \"aided and abetted  that crime,\" and\r\n\nthat he had the \"specific intent\" of causing the murder.\r\n\n          We  have combed  the  record in  light  of this  highly\r\n\nspecific subset  of charges  to determine whether  the government\r\n\nsatisfied  its burden of  proving beyond a  reasonable doubt that\r\n\nHoulihan perpetrated  these three  interrelated crimes.   We have\r\n\ncome  up empty.  In  our judgment there  is insufficient evidence\r\n\nthat Houlihan,  whatever other atrocities he  may have committed,\r\n\nintended to bring  about the  execution of James  Boyden III,  or\r\n\nthat he participated  in any  culpable way in  the commission  of\r\n\nthat crime.\r\n\n          The evidence  depicts Fitzgerald  as the leader  of the\r\n\norganization  and  Houlihan   as  his  second-in-command.     The\r\n\ngovernment's theory is that Nardone  killed Boyden III, and  that\r\n\nFitzgerald and Houlihan jointly  directed him to do so.   But the\r\n\ngovernment's star  witness, Nelson, testified that,  according to\r\n\nNardone, Fitzgerald alone ordered the murder.23\r\n\n          This  seems reasonable  in view  of the  fact that  the\r\n\nmurder grew out  of events surrounding  the assassination of  the\r\n\nvictim's  son   (Boyden  IV).     The  younger   Boyden,  against\r\n\nFitzgerald's explicit  warning, had continued to  sell cocaine in\r\n\nthe \"sales territory\" assigned  to Jennierose Lynch (Fitzgerald's\r\n\nparamour).  After several violent encounters, Boyden IV turned up\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     23Indeed,  when it was pointed out that a grand jury witness\r\nhad  testified  otherwise,  the  government  protested  that  the\r\nwitness had made a  mistake.  See supra note 19.   The grand jury\r                                                 \r\ntestimony was not admitted at the trial.\r\n\n                                49\r\r\n\ndead.  The government  charged Fitzgerald, Lynch, and Herd    but\r\n\nnot Houlihan   with that murder.  As recounted earlier, the judge\r\n\ngranted Fitzgerald's motion for a mistrial on those  charges (and\r\n\nhe presumably remains  subject to retrial); the judge ordered the\r\n\ncharges against Lynch dropped as part of an overall plea bargain;\r\n\nand the jury acquitted Herd.\r\n\n          The record strongly suggests  that the son's murder set\r\n\nthe stage for  the father's  murder, and that  the killings  were\r\n\nrelated.  The government makes no effort to implicate Houlihan in\r\n\nthe former crime, and there is  only a tenuous set of  inferences\r\n\nlinking him to the latter crime.\r\n\n          Virtually the  only intimation that  Houlihan may  have\r\n\nplayed  a role in the killing of  Boyden III comes from Sargent's\r\n\ntape-recorded  statement  during  which  the  following  colloquy\r\n\ntranspired (references  in the colloquy to \"Boyden, Sr.\" refer to\r\n\nJames Boyden III):\r\n\n          SARGENT:   I was  having a couple  of drinks,\r                    SARGENT:\r\n          and [Houlihan]  mentioned .  . . that    that\r\n          there's two . . . that's going to go.\r\n\n                          *     *     *\r\n\n          . . .

From the\r\n\ndialogue that we have quoted, the government suggests that a jury\r\n\ncould plausibly infer that Houlihan was referring to the upcoming\r\n\nmurder of James Boyden III in his \"two .  . . that's going to go\"\r\n\ncomment; and that, from this  inference, the jury could plausibly\r\n\ninfer  that Houlihan  intended  to bring  about  that murder  and\r\n\nparticipated in it in  some meaningful way.   This is simply  too\r\n\ngreat a stretch.   Houlihan did not mention  James Boyden III  in\r\n\nhis  conversation with  Sargent, and  it is  not even  clear that\r\n\nSargent  understood Houlihan  to be  referring to  any particular\r\n\nindividuals.  Rather, the import of Sargent's comment seems to be\r\n\nthat succeeding  events filled in  the blanks.   And  even if  we\r\n\naccept  the first  suggested  inference, the  record hardly  will\r\n\nsupport the further inference that Houlihan had a specific intent\r\n\nto murder James Boyden III, or that he abetted the ensuing crime.\r\n\nAt  most, the  conversation suggests  an awareness  of  a planned\r\n\n                                51\r\r\n\nslaying, not necessarily participation in it.\r\n\n          The   government  tries  to   buttress  these  strained\r\n\ninferences  by  pointing  to  Sargent's parroting  of  Houlihan's\r\n\nstatement  that  he  \"could   have  somebody  kill  anybody\"  and\r\n\nlabelling this as evidence  that Houlihan directed the commission\r\n\nof  this particular murder.   But that argument  proves too much.\r\n\nOn the  government's reasoning, Houlihan could  have been charged\r\n\nand  convicted of  any murder.   The  government also  points out\r                                \r\n\nthat, on  the day after the murder,  Nardone collected his fee at\r\n\nKerrigan's Flower Shop.   Because this  bore some resemblance  to\r\n\nthe  method  of  payment  that Houlihan  employed  after  Nardone\r\n\nmurdered  Sargent, see supra note  22, the government  asks us to\r                                      \r\n\ninfer that Houlihan  also must  have arranged this  payment.   We\r\n\nthink  for two reasons  that the suggested  inference is dubious.\r\n\nFirst, the  difference in payment methodology is significant:  on\r\n\nthe  latter occasion  (Sargent's murder),  the government  proved\r\n\nthat Houlihan personally paid  the fee to Nardone; on  the former\r\n\noccasion  (Boyden the elder's murder),  it did not.   Second, the\r\n\nrecord shows that Fitzgerald not only ordered the murder of James\r\n\nBoyden III but also, though imprisoned, remained in daily contact\r\n\nwith Doherty, and that  Doherty (who was based at  Kerrigan's) or\r\n\nany of several other underlings could have arranged the payment.\r\n\n          Even   so,  given  the   working  relationship  between\r\n\nHoulihan  and Fitzgerald and their use of Nardone as a triggerman\r\n\nin connection with Sargent's murder and the attempts on Sweeney's\r\n\nlife, the question of  evidentiary sufficiency is close.   In the\r\n\n                                52\r\r\n\nend, however, we do  not think that  the evidence measures up  to\r\n\nthe requirement   which we apply de novo   that a reasonable jury\r\n\nbe able  to find each  element of the  crime to have  been proven\r\n\nbeyond  a  reasonable  doubt.    Given   Nelson's  uncontradicted\r\n\ntestimony that only one individual   Fitzgerald    sanctioned the\r\n\nexecution of James Boyden  III, and also given the  nexus between\r\n\nthe Boydens' murders,  we believe  that the  chain of  inferences\r\n\nforged by the prosecution is too loose (albeit by the slimmest of\r\n\nmargins) to hold Houlihan  criminally responsible for the charged\r\n\ncrimes.\r\n\n                          C.  Severance.\r                                    C.  Severance.\r                                                 \r\n\n          The  reader will  recall  that the  indictment  charged\r\n\nHerd, Lynch, and Fitzgerald   but not Houlihan and Nardone   with\r\n\noffenses related to the murder of James Boyden  IV.  Houlihan and\r\n\nNardone contend that the  court had an obligation to  sever their\r\n\ntrials from  the trial of  the counts  relating to the  Boyden IV\r\n\nmurder.24  We disagree.\r\n\n          When   several  defendants  are   named  in  a  unified\r\n\nindictment,  there is  a strong presumption  that they  should be\r\n\ntried together.  See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S.  534, 538-\r                                                      \r\n\n39 (1993); O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25.  To obtain a severance under\r                             \r\n\nsuch   circumstances,  a   defendant  must   demonstrate  extreme\r\n\nprejudice, such as by showing a \"serious risk that a joint  trial\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     24Ironically, none of the counts related to this murder bore\r\nfruit:  the jury found Herd not guilty; the court  relieved Lynch\r\nof  responsibility when she  pleaded guilty to  other counts; and\r\nthe court granted Fitzgerald a mistrial.\r\n\n                                53\r\r\n\nwould compromise  a specific trial right,\" or  would \"prevent the\r\n\njury from making  a reliable judgment about  guilt or innocence.\"\r\n\nZafiro, 506 U.S. at 539.\r                \r\n\n          Houlihan and Nardone cannot scale these heights.  Their\r\n\ncentral thesis  is that the government's  evidence concerning the\r\n\nBoyden IV murder tended  to show that the victim  was slaughtered\r\n\nin an  organization-related turf battle, and therefore threatened\r\n\nto infect the  jury's consideration  of other counts.   But  they\r\n\ndress this  thesis in the  gossamer vestments of  speculation and\r\n\nsurmise.  That is not enough.  \"There is always some prejudice in\r\n\nany  trial  where more  than one  offense  or offender  are tried\r\n\ntogether   but such `garden variety' prejudice, in and of itself,\r\n\nwill not suffice\" as a basis for obligatory severance.

In\r\n\nthe vast majority  of those cases, however, the  severance battle\r\n\nis conclusively won or lost in the district court.  See O'Bryant,\r                                                                          \r\n\n998 F.2d at 25  (explaining that the court of  appeals ordinarily\r\n\nshould defer to the district  court's evaluation of the necessity\r\n\nfor separate trials); United States v.

This  case falls  within the  sweep  of that\r\n\ngenerality, not within the  long-odds exception to it.

Prior  to  each witness's  testimony Judge  Young\r\n\nadmonished  the  jury  that  the testimony  was  admissible  only\r\n\nagainst  Fitzgerald, Herd, and Lynch, and not against Houlihan or\r\n\nNardone.   Notwithstanding these limiting  instructions, Houlihan\r\n\nand  Nardone asked to cross-examine Ford and McDonald.  The court\r\n\nblocked that maneuver.   Houlihan and Nardone press the  point in\r\n\nthis  venue,  alleging that  the  court's  ruling violated  their\r\n\nconfrontation   rights  and  otherwise  constituted  an  improper\r\n\nexercise of discretion.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     25The   court  enhanced   the  efficacy   of   the  limiting\r\ninstructions by  insisting  that all  the  government's  evidence\r\nrelating  to this murder be presented compactly at the same point\r\nin  the trial.   This is a  salutary practice, and  we commend it\r\ngenerally to trial courts confronted with analogous situations.\r\n\n                                55\r\r\n\n          To demonstrate a violation of the Confrontation Clause,\r\n\na  defendant must show that  he was \"prohibited  from engaging in\r\n\notherwise  appropriate  cross-examination   designed  to  show  a\r\n\nprototypical form  of bias  on the  part  of the  witness.\"   Van\r                                                                           \r\n\nArsdall, 475  U.S. at 680.  Here, there was no abridgement of the\r                 \r\n\ndefendants'  constitutional  rights.   The  Confrontation  Clause\r\n\ndemands that a  defendant have  the opportunity  to confront  and\r\n\ncross-examine  the witnesses against him; at least in the absence\r                                                  \r\n\nof special circumstances   and none appear here   the Clause does\r\n\nnot  create  a right  to  confront or  cross-examine  persons who\r\n\nappear  as  witnesses exclusively  against  others  (even if  the\r\n\nothers  are codefendants in a joint trial).  Because neither Ford\r\n\nnor McDonald was  a witness \"against\" either Houlihan or Nardone,\r\n\nthe constitutional claim is stillborn.\r\n\n          Absent  a  constitutional violation,  \"appellate courts\r\n\nwill grant  relief from  the shackling of  cross-examination only\r\n\nfor manifest  abuse of discretion.\"  Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254.  We\r                                                     \r\n\ndiscern no trace of abuse in  this instance.  Despite the lack of\r\n\ncross-examination,26  the  limiting instructions  fully protected\r\n\nHoulihan's  and  Nardone's  legitimate  interests.   Furthermore,\r\n\nallowing counsel  for Houlihan and Nardone  to cross-examine Ford\r\n\nand  McDonald could well have had a boomerang effect, leading the\r\n\njury to believe that, contrary  to the judge's instructions,  the\r\n\ntestimony  had  some  relevance  to  the  charges  against  their\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     26Of course, these witnesses did not emerge unscathed.

Before us, Fitzgerald claims that\r\n\nthe  testimony  had no  relevance  to the  surviving  counts, and\r\n\nincluded details  about the  slaying of  the younger  Boyden that\r\n\nmight well have horrified the jurors and prejudiced  them against\r\n\nhim.\r\n\n          We  review  the district  court's  ruling  to admit  or\r\n\nexclude particular  evidence for abuse of discretion.

The same  standard pertains to\r                \r\n\nmotions to  strike evidence previously admitted.   See Sepulveda,\r                                                                          \r\n\n15 F.3d at  1184.  Here,  the district court styled  the disputed\r\n\ntestimony as being \"probative . . . of other counts in the case,\"\r\n\nand   denied  the  motion  to  strike  on  that  basis.    Having\r\n\nscrutinized  the  testimony in  light  of  the surviving  charges\r\n\nagainst  Fitzgerald,  we   are  persuaded  that,  as   Fitzgerald\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     27The witnesses in question  are Veronica Boyden (the mother\r\nof  James  Boyden IV),  Marie  Boyden-Connors  (his sister),  and\r\nFrances Hannigan (a former owner of Kerrigan's Flower Shop).\r\n\n                                57\r\r\n\nmaintains, it was prejudicial  to some degree.

Thus, our inquiry must proceed.\r\n\n          Fitzgerald  cast  the  motion  to  strike  in  \"all  or\r\n\nnothing\"  terms.   In ruling  on it,  the  district court  had to\r\n\ncompose  a balance between the probative value of the evidence as\r\n\na whole and the risk of unfair prejudice attendant to  keeping it\r\n\nbefore the jury.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403.  And though the evidence\r                               \r\n\nwas  prejudicial in  a sense,  it was  also plainly  probative of\r\n\nFitzgerald's role  as the kingpin  in the  organization and  bore\r\n\ndirectly on the remaining charges against him.28\r\n\n          While  the  question  is   admittedly  close,  we   are\r\n\nunprepared to say that the evidence's unfairly prejudicial impact\r\n\nsubstantially outweighed its probative worth.  \"Only rarely   and\r\n\nin extraordinarily  compelling circumstances   will  we, from the\r\n\nvista  of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-\r\n\nthe-spot judgment concerning the relative weighting of  probative\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     28A  few  examples  may assist  in  giving  texture to  this\r\nconclusion.   Veronica Boyden testified that  she heard Lynch, an\r\nindicted coconspirator,  threaten  to call  Fitzgerald  if  James\r\nBoyden  IV continued to poach on her sales territory.  Similarly,\r\nBoyden-Connors testified  that Fitzgerald himself  warned her  to\r\nkeep  her  brother  away  from  Lynch's  territory.    Hannigan's\r\ntestimony, overall,  related more to the  structure and operating\r\npractices of the Fitzgerald-Houlihan organization and less to the\r\nslaying of James  Boyden IV.   By way  of illustration,  Hannigan\r\ntestified at  length  about Fitzgerald's  presence at  Kerrigan's\r\nFlower  Shop,  his  meetings  there  with  other  members of  the\r\nconspiracy, and  his daily  telephone calls to  Doherty from  his\r\nprison cell during the period of his immurement.\r\n\n                                58\r\r\n\nvalue and unfair effect.\"  Freeman v.

It\r\n\nfollows that the  lower court  did not misuse  its discretion  in\r\n\ndenying both  Fitzgerald's motion  to strike and  his alternative\r\n\nmotion to declare an across-the-board mistrial.\r\n\n                 F.

The  district court severed  the armed robbery\r\n\ncounts  before trial.    When Nelson  (one  of Nardone's  alleged\r\n\ncoconspirators) testified, Houlihan's counsel cross-examined him.\r\n\nIn the  course of the  cross-examination, the lawyer  proffered a\r\n\ncopy  of Nelson's cooperation agreement with  the government.  No\r\n\nobjection   appearing,  the  court  admitted  the  document  into\r\n\nevidence.   Appended  to the  cooperation agreement  (now a  full\r\n\nexhibit)  was a copy of  the information that  the government had\r\n\nfiled against Nelson (which  contained, inter alia, a  count that\r                                                            \r\n\ndescribed an  alleged Nelson/Nardone  armed robbery).   Four days\r\n\nlater, Nardone's counsel  asked the district court  to delete all\r\n\nreferences to  him from the exhibit  before it went to  the jury.\r\n\nThe court refused.  Nardone assigns error.  We uphold the ruling.\r\n\n          There  is danger  in  delay,  and  the  contemporaneous\r\n\nobjection rule is, for  the most part, strictly enforced  in this\r\n\ncircuit.  See, e.g.,  United States v.  Taylor, 54 F.3d 967,  972\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1995); United States  v.

While  it is true\r                                  \r\n\nin  this  case that  Nardone's  attorney  ultimately objected,  a\r\n\n                                59\r\r\n\nbelated objection does not cure the original default.\r\n\n          To be sure,  we might  be impelled to  intervene if  we\r\n\nthought that,  despite the  lack of a  contemporaneous objection,\r\n\nthe district court  committed plain error  by refusing to  redact\r\n\nthe references to Nardone which appeared in the information.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at  732-37 (discussing dimensions of plain  error\r               \r\n\nreview); see also  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 52(b).   But here, no  plain\r                           \r\n\nerror looms.  During cross-examination of Nelson   two days after\r                                                                           \r\n\nHoulihan's  counsel  introduced  the cooperation  agreement  into\r\n\nevidence without objection and  two days before Nardone's counsel\r                                                         \r\n\nbroached the  idea of  redaction    the latter  questioned Nelson\r\n\nextensively about the armed robbery and drug conspiracy described\r\n\nin  the  information.   Although  these  questions were  artfully\r\n\nphrased   to  avoid   any   explicit   reference   to   Nardone's\r\n\nparticipation in  those crimes, we  believe that this  harping on\r\n\nthe  contents of  the information  bolsters the  district court's\r\n\ndecision not to  excuse the lack of a  contemporaneous objection.\r\n\nWe  conclude,   therefore,  that  the  court   acted  within  its\r\n\ndiscretion  in declining to relax the usual rule and in rejecting\r\n\nNardone's tardy request for redaction.29\r\n\n                      G.

For one  thing, the  jury\r\nacquitted Nardone on several counts, so it is impossible to argue\r\nconvincingly  that  the   unredacted  information   irretrievably\r\npoisoned  the jurors against him.   For another  thing, given the\r\npowerful  evidentiary strands  that tied  Nardone tightly  to two\r\nbrutal  murders and several other murder  attempts, we doubt that\r\nthe  references about  which he  now complains  could conceivably\r\nhave altered the jury's verdicts.\r\n\n                                60\r\r\n\n          The appellants  posit that the district  court's charge\r\n\ndid  not impart the degree of participation required to convict a\r\n\ndefendant of conspiracy  charges under  the Racketeer  Influenced\r\n\nand  Corrupt Organizations  Act (RICO),  18 U.S.C.     1961-1969.\r\n\nThe  RICO statute criminalizes  \"conduct[ing] or participat[ing],\r\n\ndirectly  or  indirectly, in  the  conduct  of [an]  enterprise's\r\n\naffairs\" through a pattern of racketeering activity.  18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1962(c).   To  convey this  element of  the RICO  offenses, Judge\r\n\nYoung instructed the jury that  the prosecution must prove beyond\r\n\na reasonable doubt,\r\n\n          that by engaging in a pattern of racketeering\r\n          activity  the specific individual accused . .\r\n          . conducted or participated in the conduct of\r\n          the  enterprise's affairs.   The term conduct\r\n          and   participate  in   the  conduct   of  an\r\n          enterprise includes the performance  of acts,\r\n          functions or  duties which are related to the\r\n          operation of the enterprise.  A person may be\r\n          found to  participate in  the conduct  of the\r\n          enterprise even though he  has no part in the\r\n          management or control of the enterprise.\r\n\n          The appellants fault  this instruction because it  told\r\n\nthe jury  that a defendant could  be found guilty even  if he did\r\n\nnot participate \"in the management or control of the enterprise.\"\r\n\nIn their view, the Court's opinion in Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 507\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  170 (1993), signifies the opposite.   But this asseveration\r\n\nmisconstrues  Reves.   There,  the  Court  interpreted the  words\r                             \r\n\n\"conduct or participate\" as they  appear in section 1962(c),  and\r\n\ndetermined that those  words require a defendant's  participation\r\n\nin either \"the operation or management of the enterprise itself.\"\r\n\nId. at  185.  But because  the defendant in Reves  was an outside\r                                                           \r\n\n                                61\r\r\n\naccounting firm that had only a contractual relationship with the\r\n\nallegedly corrupt  enterprise   it  audited the books  and issued\r\n\nfinancial  reports,  but neither  controlled  the  enterprise nor\r\n\nparticipated  in  either  its  operation  or  management     RICO\r\n\nliability did not attach.

The  evidence supports  the view\r\nthat  Nardone was an insider.  He maintained regular contact with\r\nFitzgerald   and  Houlihan   throughout  the   duration   of  the\r\nconspiracy; he obtained his armaments directly  from them; and he\r\ntook orders from them.  Indeed, Nardone's description  of himself\r\nas the  organization's \"hit  man\" and \"headache  man\" belies  his\r\nmore recently manufactured \"independent contractor\" label.\r\n\n                                62\r\r\n\nelaboration.31\r\n\n                         H.

The government\r\n\nlodged the forfeiture count  under 18 U.S.C.   1963(a)32  and the\r\n\njury  found in  its favor.   The  property had  been deeded  by a\r\n\nthird-party  seller to  Francis Jackson  (Houlihan's uncle),  and\r\n\nHoulihan's contention  is that, because title  stood in Jackson's\r\n\nname, the property could  not be forfeited in consequence  of his\r\n\n(Houlihan's) peccadilloes.\r\n\n          \"[C]riminal forfeiture is a punishment, not a  separate\r\n\ncriminal  offense.\"    Saccoccia, 58  F.3d  at  783.

Judge Young chose instead to incorporate\r\nby  reference his correct definition  of a RICO enterprise (given\r\nto the  jury earlier in  the charge); and,  in the same  vein, he\r\nspecifically  informed the  jury  that, as  to all  racketeering-\r\nrelated  counts, they  must find the  existence of  an enterprise\r\nmeeting the statutory criteria as an element of each offense.  In\r\nlight  of the perfectly sensible  course taken by  the judge, the\r\nappellants'  claim  is  unfounded.    A  trial  court  has  broad\r\ndiscretion to formulate jury instructions as it sees fit, as long\r\nas it  touches all the bases.  See United States v.

In\r                                                             \r\n\nthis  instance  we  conclude  without  serious  question  that  a\r\n\nrational factfinder could  determine    as this jury  did    that\r\n\nHoulihan  was the de  facto owner of  the house, and  that it had\r\n\nbeen   purchased   with   proceeds  derived   from   racketeering\r\n\nactivity.33\r\n\n          Real estate  agents testified  that they  took Houlihan\r\n\nand  his wife,  along  with Jackson,  on  tours of  the  dwelling\r\n\nseveral  times during 1993; that  Houlihan told them  that he was\r\n\n\"interested\" in  buying it;  that Houlihan attended  the pre-sale\r\n\ninspection  and the two closings that proved to be necessary; and\r\n\nthat the property was  purchased entirely for cash (approximately\r\n\n$195,000).  And,  moreover, both  Houlihan and his  wife were  in\r\n\nresidence at the premises  when the authorities arrested Houlihan\r\n\nin October of 1993.\r\n\n          These pieces of evidence combine to form a picture that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     33The district court instructed the jury that the government\r\nhad the  burden of  proving entitlement  to  forfeiture beyond  a\r\nreasonable doubt.  The  proof here is capable of  satisfying that\r\nstandard.  We note, however   although we leave the question open\r\n  that the government may have conceded too much.

Then, too, the evidence\r\n\nis  reinforced by the utter  absence of any  proof indicating how\r\n\nJackson  might have acquired so  large an amount  of cash.  Given\r\n\nthe  totality of the circumstances, the jury was entitled to find\r\n\nthat  the   house  was  forfeitable  as  a  fruit  of  Houlihan's\r\n\nracketeering.  See id.  (\"Jurors, after all, are not  expected to\r                                \r\n\nresist common-sense  inferences based  on the realities  of human\r\n\nexperience.\").\r\n\n                         I.

The sole  exception relates  to\r\n\ncount  20.   That count  charged Fitzgerald  and  Houlihan, among\r\n\nothers,  with  conspiracy  to distribute  a  controlled substance\r\n\n(cocaine) in violation of 21 U.S.C.    846.  As to Fitzgerald and\r\n\nHoulihan,  Judge  Young  imposed  contingent  sentences  of  life\r\n\nimprisonment,  to take effect \"only  if the sentence  on count 19\r\n\n[which charged  a continuing criminal enterprise  in violation of\r\n\n18  U.S.C.   848] is reversed [or] otherwise dismissed.\"  Because\r\n\nwe  affirm  the   conviction  and  sentence  on   count  19,  the\r\n\ncontingency  that Judge  Young envisioned  has  not materialized.\r\n\nHence, we now vacate  Fitzgerald's and Houlihan's convictions and\r\n\nsentences on count 20.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          If an indictment charges a defendant with participating\r\n\nin both a conspiracy and a  continuing criminal enterprise (CCE),\r\n\nand if the former is used as a predicate act to prove the latter,\r\n\n                                65\r\r\n\nthen the conspiracy is in actuality a lesser-included offense  of\r\n\nthe CCE charge, and  the defendant may not lawfully  be sentenced\r\n\nfor  both crimes.  See United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n148, 152-53  (1st  Cir.),  cert. denied,  502  U.S.  862  (1991);\r                                                 \r\n\nStratton v.

Thus,  our  affirmance  of\r\n\nFitzgerald's and Houlihan's convictions and sentences on count 19\r\n\nnecessitates the  vacation of their convictions  and sentences on\r\n\ncount 20.  See Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 153 (holding that the\r                                        \r\n\nDouble  Jeopardy  Clause  requires  vacation  of  conviction  and\r\n\nsentence on conspiracy  count when a  defendant is convicted  and\r\n\nsentenced on both conspiracy and CCE counts).\r\n\nVI.

Two of those issues--one implicating the Confrontation Clause and the other involving Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)--raise important questions of first impression in this circuit.  In the pages that follow, we offer a skeletal outline of the case and then put flesh on the bones by addressing, first, the appellants' two flagship claims.  We next consider a series of discovery disputes and conclude by discussing, albeit in a more abbreviated fashion, a laundry list of other asseverations.  In the end, after careful consideration of the parties' arguments and close perscrutation of the compendious record, we affirm the judgments below in large part, but reverse one defendant's conviction on three related counts and bring a contingent sentencing determination to closure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Overcoming the temptation to engage in Homeric recitation of the riveting facts that emerged during a seventy-day trial, we opt instead to sketch the evidence at this juncture and reserve greater detail until the need arises to place specific issues into workable context.  We draw our sketch in colors that coordinate with the jury's verdicts, consistent with record support.  See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1063, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For nearly four years Michael Fitzgerald and John Houlihan ran a ruthlessly efficient drug ring from an unlikely command post:  Kerrigan's Flower Shop, Charlestown, Massachusetts.  The organization commanded the allegiance of numerous distributors, stationary and mobile, including Jennierose Lynch, William \"Bud\" Sweeney, George Sargent, and Alan Skinner.  These minions, and others like them, helped the organization supply cocaine to hordes of buyers through an elaborate street-level distribution network that arranged most of its sales with the aid of electronic pagers, assigned customer codes, and preset rendezvous points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzgerald and Houlihan imposed a strict code of silence on all who came into contact with them, including their own troops.  They dealt severely with persons who seemed inclined to talk too freely.  Joseph Nardone, a professional assassin who bragged that he was the \"headache man\"--when the organization's chieftains had a headache, Nardone got rid of it--acted as the principal enforcer.  Over time, the gang's targets included Sargent, Sweeney (who survived multiple attempts on his life, but was left paralyzed from the chest down), a rival drug dealer, James Boyden III, and the latter's son and helpmeet, James Boyden IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fitzgerald-Houlihan axis dominated the Charlestown scene through 1993.  Ultimately, the authorities broke the code of silence and a federal grand jury indicted twelve individuals (including Fitzgerald, Houlihan, and Nardone) on a myriad of charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After trial, the two ringleaders and their enforcer were found guilty of engaging in a racketeering enterprise (count 1), racketeering conspiracy (count 2), conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering (counts 5, 7 &amp; 9), and conspiracy to distribute cocaine (count 20).  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1962(c) &amp; (d), 1959(a);  21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.  The jury also convicted Fitzgerald and Houlihan of aiding and abetting murder and attempted murder in aid of racketeering (counts 6, 8, 11 &amp; 12), instigating murder for hire (counts 15, 16 &amp; 17), engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (count 19), and distributing cocaine (counts 21 through 29).  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1959(a), 1958;  21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 848, 841(a)(1).  The jury found Nardone guilty of murder and attempted murder in aid of racketeering (counts 6, 8, 11 &amp; 12), see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a), and using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to crimes of violence (counts 39, 40, 42 &amp; 43), see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).  The jury also returned special forfeiture verdicts.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963;  21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.  The district court sentenced each defendant to multiple terms of life imprisonment.  These appeals blossomed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE VOICE FROM THE GRAVE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court admitted over objection portions of hearsay statements made by George Sargent on the theory that Sargent's murder constituted a waiver of the Confrontation Clause vis-a-vis the murderers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Houlihan and Nardone assign error to this order and to a salmagundi of related rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A. Setting the Stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent served as a distributor for the Fitzgerald-Houlihan organization.  The police arrested him twice during 1992 on drug-trafficking charges.  Both times, Sargent made voluntary statements that inculpated Fitzgerald and Houlihan in a sprawling drug conspiracy and tended to link them with several murders.  The statements also furnished evidence probative of the elements of the offenses with which Nardone had been charged, but Sargent did not mention him by name.  On June 28, 1992--within a month after he gave the second statement--Sargent was ambushed outside his dwelling and was shot several times.  He died as a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a pretrial motion for an order (1) authorizing a state trooper, Mark Lemieux, to testify about Sargent's statements following his March 1992 arrest, and (2) permitting the jury to hear a redacted version of the taped May 1992 interview conducted by Boston police detectives following Sargent's second arrest.  The government argued that the appellants--who had been charged with Sargent's murder--waived their rights to object to the admission of his out-of-court statements on either Confrontation Clause or hearsay grounds when they successfully conspired to execute him for the express purpose of preventing his cooperation with the authorities.  The district court took the motion under advisement and, near the end of the government's case in chief, admitted the challenged evidence against Houlihan and Nardone, but not Fitzgerald, see supra note 2, concluding that the government had shown by clear and convincing evidence that those defendants conspired to kill Sargent at least in part for the purpose of preventing him from cooperating with the police, and that such actions were tantamount to a knowing waiver of their confrontation rights.  See United States v. Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. 352, 363-65 (D.Mass.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>B. Waiver by Homicide:  The Confrontation Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve Houlihan's and Nardone's main objections, we must decide whether a defendant waives his rights under the Confrontation Clause by murdering a potential witness to prevent that witness from turning state's evidence and/or testifying against him at trial.  We believe that he does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apodictic that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him....\"  U.S. Const. Amend.  VI.  This trial right is designed to assure defendants of a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses who testify against them, see, e.g., Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 678, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1434, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986);   United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.1996), thereby enhancing the jury's ability to separate fact from fiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the Confrontation Clause is a cornerstone of our adversary system of justice, it is not an absolute;  there are circumstances in which the prosecution may introduce an unsworn out-of-court statement without procuring the declarant's presence at trial.  See, e.g., Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1205-07 (1st Cir.1987) (discussing exception for spontaneous exclamations), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 990, 108 S.Ct. 1297, 99 L.Ed.2d 506 (1988).  Moreover, a defendant may waive his right to confrontation by knowing and intentional relinquishment.  See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1712, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969) (holding that a guilty plea is an express waiver of the constitutional right to confrontation);  see also Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).  While a waiver of the right to confront witnesses typically is express, the law is settled that a defendant also may waive it through his intentional misconduct.  See, e.g., Taylor v. United States, 414 U.S. 17, 20, 94 S.Ct. 194, 196, 38 L.Ed.2d 174 (1973) (finding such a waiver when a defendant boycotted his trial);   Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1060, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970) (ruling that a defendant waives the right to confrontation by engaging in disruptive behavior requiring his removal from the courtroom during the trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, courts will not suffer a party to profit by his own wrongdoing.  Thus, a defendant who wrongfully procures a witness's absence for the purpose of denying the government that witness's testimony waives his right under the Confrontation Clause to object to the admission of the absent witness's hearsay statements.  See Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S.  (8 Otto) 145, 158, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878) (holding that the defendant's refusal to disclose the whereabouts of a witness constituted such a waiver);   Steele v. Taylor, 684 F.2d 1193, 1201-02 (6th Cir.1982) (holding that a defendant who silences a witness by exploiting an intimate relationship waives the right to confrontation), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1053, 103 S.Ct. 1501, 1502, 75 L.Ed.2d 932 (1983);   United States v. Balano, 618 F.2d 624, 629 (10th Cir.1979) (concluding that a defendant waives his confrontation right by threatening a witness's life and bringing about the witness's silence), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 840, 101 S.Ct. 118, 66 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980);   United States v. Carlson, 547 F.2d 1346, 1358-60 (8th Cir.1976) (similar), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 914, 97 S.Ct. 2174, 53 L.Ed.2d 224 (1977).  Moreover, it is sufficient in this regard to show that the evildoer was motivated in part by a desire to silence the witness;  the intent to deprive the prosecution of testimony need not be the actor's sole motivation.  Cf. United States v. Thomas, 916 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1990) (stating that the obstruction of justice statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1503, requires proof that the defendant's conduct was \"prompted, at least in part,\" by the requisite corrupt motive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone argue, however, that the waiver-by-misconduct doctrine, even if good law, should not be employed here because Sargent was not an actual witness--no charges had been lodged against Houlihan or Nardone at the time of Sargent's murder, and no grand jury had as yet been convened--but at most a turncoat cooperating with the police.  Thus, they could not have been on notice that they were waiving a trial right.  We find this argument unpersuasive.  Although the reported cases all appear to involve actual witnesses, see, e.g., United States v. Thai, 29 F.3d 785, 798 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 456, 130 L.Ed.2d 364 &amp; --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 496, 130 L.Ed.2d 406 (1994);   United States v. Mastrangelo, 693 F.2d 269, 271-72 (2d Cir.1982), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1204, 104 S.Ct. 2385, 81 L.Ed.2d 343 (1984), we can discern no principled reason why the waiver-by-misconduct doctrine should not apply with equal force if a defendant intentionally silences a potential witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant murders an individual who is a percipient witness to acts of criminality (or procures his demise) in order to prevent him from appearing at an upcoming trial, he denies the government the benefit of the witness's live testimony.  In much the same way, when a defendant murders such a witness (or procures his demise) in order to prevent him from assisting an ongoing criminal investigation, he is denying the government the benefit of the witness's live testimony at a future trial.  In short, the two situations are fair congeners:  as long as it is reasonably foreseeable that the investigation will culminate in the bringing of charges, the mere fact that the homicide occurs at an earlier step in the pavane should not affect the operation of the waiver-by-misconduct doctrine.  Indeed, adopting the contrary position urged by the appellants would serve as a prod to the unscrupulous to accelerate the timetable and murder suspected snitches sooner rather than later.  We see no justification for creating such a perverse incentive, or for distinguishing between a defendant who assassinates a witness on the eve of trial and a potential defendant who assassinates a potential witness before charges officially have been brought.  In either case, it is the intent to silence that provides notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore hold that when a person who eventually emerges as a defendant (1) causes a potential witness's unavailability (2) by a wrongful act (3) undertaken with the intention of preventing the potential witness from testifying at a future trial, then the defendant waives his right to object on confrontation grounds to the admission of the unavailable declarant's out-of-court statements at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before applying this holding to the case at hand, we must correctly calibrate the quantum of proof.  The lower court, paying obeisance to  United States v. Thevis, 665 F.2d 616, 629-30 (5th Cir.  Unit B), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 1008, 102 S.Ct. 2300, 73 L.Ed.2d 1303 (1982), adopted the minority view and decided that the government must prove the predicate facts essential to the waiver by \"clear and convincing\" evidence.   Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 360.   This sets too high a standard.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit, we think that the government need only prove such predicate facts by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The  Thevis court compared the waiver-by-misconduct problem to the admissibility of in-court identifications that follow tainted out-of-court identifications.  See, e.g., United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 240, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1939, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) (requiring government to prove by \"clear and convincing\" evidence in such circumstances that the proposed in-court identification has a reliable independent basis).  With respect, we believe the better comparison is to the admission of out-of-court statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.  See Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  To invoke the coconspirator exception, the proponent of the statement must \"show by a preponderance of the evidence\" certain predicate facts, namely, \"that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"   United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994);  see also Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 175-76, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2778-79, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proving the conditions precedent to the applicability of the coconspirator exception is analytically and functionally identical to proving that a defendant's wrongdoing waives his rights under the Confrontation Clause.  See Steele, 684 F.2d at 1203;   United States v. White, 838 F.Supp. 618, 624 (D.D.C.1993).  We therefore align ourselves with the majority of federal appellate courts that have considered the question, see, e.g., Mastrangelo, 693 F.2d at 273;   Steele, 684 F.2d at 1202-03;   Balano, 618 F.2d at 629, and set the government's burden of proof at the preponderance-of-the-evidence level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Measured against this more conventional benchmark, the district court's findings easily pass muster.  The record amply demonstrates that Houlihan and Nardone knew when they conspired to murder Sargent that they were depriving the government of a potential witness.  First, the district court supportably found that they believed Sargent was cooperating with the police and could harm them and the organization by talking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 363-64.   Second, Sargent was in fact cooperating with law enforcement officials at the time and made two voluntary statements in which he provided detailed accounts of the organization's modus operandi, descriptions of the principals' roles in various murders, and a frank admission of his own involvement in the conspiracy.  While the defendants' perception of likely cooperation may well be enough to meet this prong of the test, the fact of Sargent's cooperation reinforces the inference that the killers believed Sargent was spilling the beans and murdered him on that account.  Last but not least, the conspirators knew to a certainty that Sargent had keen insight into their felonious activities both from his own work in the distribution network and from sundry conversations in which they spoke openly to him--in retrospect, too openly--of their participation in serious crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidentiary foundation sturdily supports the conclusion that Houlihan and Nardone reasonably could have foreseen Sargent becoming a witness against them and plotted to kill him in order to deprive the government of his firsthand testimony.  Hence, the district court did not err in overruling objections to the introduction of portions of Sargent's out-of-court statements insofar as those objections stemmed from the Confrontation Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>C. Waiver by Homicide:  The Hearsay Objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone next argue that, even if they waived their confrontation rights, the district court should not have admitted Sargent's hearsay statements because they were tinged with self-interest (having been made in police custody with a stiff sentence for distributing large quantities of narcotics in prospect) and therefore lacked \"circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5).  On the facts of this case, we agree with the district court, see Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 362, 367, that Houlihan's and Nardone's misconduct waived not only their confrontation rights but also their hearsay objections, thus rendering a special finding of reliability superfluous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has yet to plot the crossroads at which the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay principles embedded in the Evidence Rules intersect.  The question is subtly nuanced.  Though the two bodies of law are not coterminous, they husband essentially the same interests.  See California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 155-56, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1933-34, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970).  Both attempt to strike a balance between the government's need for probative evidence and the defendant's stake in testing the government's case through cross-examination.  See Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 65, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2538, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).  As a result, whether hearsay principles are more or less protective of a defendant's right to cross-examination than confrontation principles depends on the point at which the balance is struck in any particular instance (recognizing, however, that the balance can be struck at different levels in different cases).  See Green, 399 U.S. at 156, 90 S.Ct. at 1934.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we can take matters a step further.  In constructing the balance the main interest that must be offset against the government's need for evidence is the accused's right to confrontation (for this is the right from which the right to cross-examine springs).  Once the confrontation right is lifted from the scales by operation of the accused's waiver of that right, the balance tips sharply in favor of the need for evidence.  See Thai, 29 F.3d at 814 (holding that a defendant who waives his confrontation right by wrongfully procuring a witness's silence also waives hearsay objections vis-a-vis that witness);   United States v. Aguiar, 975 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir.1992) (similar);  see also Steele, 684 F.2d at 1201 (noting that \"English and American courts have consistently relaxed the hearsay rule when the defendant wrongfully causes the witness' unavailability\").  Here, then, inasmuch as Houlihan and Nardone waived their confrontation right by colloguing to murder Sargent, they simultaneously waived their right to object on hearsay grounds to the admission of his out-of-court statements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Hence, the district court appropriately eschewed the request for findings under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone have a fallback position.  They suggest that the district court's admission of Sargent's out-of-court statements violated their rights to due process because the admissions allowed them to be convicted on the basis of unreliable evidence.  See Green, 399 U.S. at 163 n. 15, 90 S.Ct. at 1938 n. 15 (ruminating that \"considerations of due process, wholly apart from the Confrontation Clause, might prevent convictions where a reliable evidentiary basis is totally lacking\").  We reject this initiative.  Whatever criticisms justifiably might be levelled against Sargent's statements, the portions of those statements that Judge Young allowed into evidence are not so unreliable as to raise due process concerns.  Other evidence abundantly corroborates (and in many instances replicates) Sargent's account.  For instance, his description of the organization's modus operandi and his assessment of Houlihan's leadership role were confirmed and described in excruciating detail by a galaxy of live witnesses (e.g., Michael Nelson, Bud Sweeney, Cheryl Dillon).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>D. The Redactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After ruling that portions of Sargent's out-of-court statements were admissible against Houlihan and Nardone, the court limited the May 30, 1992 statements to those that \"would have been competent and admissible evidence had the declarant been able to testify in person,\" and also excluded those portions that \"directly or through innuendo\" might offend the rule of  Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 1622, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (holding that the introduction at a joint trial of a nontestifying defendant's statements that implicate a codefendant constitutes prejudicial error).   Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 365.   Houlihan and Nardone objected, contending that the editing process heightened the force of Sargent's statements, and that if the interviews were to be introduced at all, then the entire text should be fair game.  The district court overruled the objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Houlihan and Nardone argue less that Sargent's statements should have been redacted somewhat differently and more that they should not have been redacted at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  They assert that when a defendant waives his rights to make Confrontation Clause and hearsay objections through misconduct, the absent declarant's full out-of-court statement should be admissible at the behest of either the proponent or opponent of the statement.  This assertion rests on a misguided notion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cardinal purpose of the waiver-by-misconduct doctrine is to ensure that a wrongdoer does not profit in a court of law by reason of his miscreancy.  By murdering Sargent, Houlihan and Nardone denied the prosecution the benefit of his live testimony.  To compensate for that denial the court allowed the government to introduce portions of the interviews that Sargent gave to the police.  The defense, however, was not entitled to any compensation, and permitting it to introduce additional hearsay statements (apart from statements necessary to place the portions used by the government into context and to render them not misleading) would be to reward bloodthirstiness.  We decline to stamp a judicial imprimatur on a calculated murder.  Thus, we hold that a homicidal defendant may by his misconduct waive his hearsay objections, but that waiver does not strip the government of its right to lodge hearsay objections.  It is only the party who wrongfully procures a witness's absence who waives the right to object to the adverse party's introduction of the witness's prior out-of-court statements.  See White, 838 F.Supp. at 625;  see also Steele, 684 F.2d at 1202.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, since courts should not reward parties for their own misdeeds, a prior out-of-court statement made by a witness whose unavailability stems from the wrongful conduct of a party, aimed at least in part at achieving that result, is admissible against that party as long as the statement would have been admissible had the witness testified.  But the party who causes the witness's unavailability is not entitled to the same prophylaxis.  Consequently, under settled jurisprudence governing totem-pole hearsay, see Fed.R.Evid. 805, the tape of Sargent's interview itself constituted first-level hearsay not within any recognized exception, and the district court did not err in admitting some portions at the government's urging and refusing to admit the rest of the recording at the appellants' behest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone offer a second reason why the trial court erred in excluding the balance of Sargent's statements.  This construct pivots on Evidence Rule 106, a rule that codifies principles of fairness and completeness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Under it, a party against whom a fragmentary statement is introduced may demand that the rest of the statement (or so much thereof as is appropriate) be admitted into evidence in order to place the excerpt in context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is readily evident that, as the appellants maintain, Rule 106 can serve its proper function only if the trial court from time to time is prepared to permit the introduction of some otherwise inadmissible evidence.  See United States v. Sutton, 801 F.2d 1346, 1368 (D.C.Cir.1986).  Be that as it may, completeness, like beauty, is frequently in the eye of the beholder.  The trial court is in the best position to assess the competing centrifugal and centripetal forces that bear on this calculus.  Thus, when the trial court, acting in its discretion, finds that proffered excerpts, standing on their own, are not misleading, its judgment is entitled to great respect.  See United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 256-57 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849, 111 S.Ct. 139, 112 L.Ed.2d 106 (1990).  So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone dwell on incompleteness primarily because Judge Young declared two sets of comments inadmissible.  (1) Sargent told the police, inter alia, that James Boyden IV was selling drugs in Lynch's territory;  that Fitzgerald warned him and had him beaten, but to no avail;  and that he then told Sargent that he would \"just have to kill\" the interloper.  Claiming that Fitzgerald's remarks to Sargent provided Fitzgerald with a different motive to murder Sargent, Houlihan sought to have this part of Sargent's statement admitted into evidence.  Houlihan claims that omitting references to Fitzgerald's involvement in the murder made it appear that he, rather than Fitzgerald, was the mastermind responsible for that crime.  (2) In a similar vein, Nardone claims that the court's refusal to permit him to introduce references in the interviews to Herd's putative involvement in the Boydens' killings made it appear that Nardone carried out those murders single-handed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that these incremental excerpts were \"segregable\" from the portions of the interviews that the government had proffered and denied the appellants' requests to admit them.   Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 366.   In assessing the court's rulings, three facts are worthy of note:  (1) the interview segments admitted into evidence contained no explicit reference whatever to the Boydens' murders;  (2) neither Houlihan nor Nardone were charged with the slaying of James Boyden IV;  and (3) Sargent never mentioned Nardone by name anywhere in the course of either debriefing.  Bearing these facts in mind, we conclude that the lower court acted within the realm of its discretion in refusing to invoke Rule 106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone also claim that the court should have admitted other portions of Sargent's interviews to impeach his credibility.  See Fed.R.Evid. 806 (providing that the credibility of a hearsay declarant \"may be attacked ... by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if [the] declarant had testified as a witness\").  The district court rejected this claim because it found the additional excerpts \"too convoluted, collateral, or cumulative to be admitted.\"   Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 368.   Having reviewed the items, we discern no error in their exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial courts have considerable leeway in imposing outside limits on cross-examination.  See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. at 1435;   Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d at 28.   Here, the record demonstrates that the appellants had a full and fair opportunity during their cross-examination of the officers who interviewed Sargent to cast doubts upon his veracity.  They made the most of this opportunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  By contrast, the extra material that the appellants wished to introduce lacked genuine impeachment value and promised to add virtually nothing of consequence to the grueling cross-examination.  Thus, we cannot fault the district court for excluding this exiguous material.  See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. at 1435 (stating that cross-examination appropriately may be limited if redundant or marginally relevant);   Boylan, 898 F.2d at 255-56 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory.  Because our painstaking review of the record reveals no solid grounding for the claim that the district court flouted Rule 106 in any respect, we refuse to meddle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>E. Prejudicial Spillover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one last leg to this phase of our journey.  Fitzgerald alleges that the admission of Sargent's statements resulted in unfair prejudice to him.  The record reveals none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the prosecution must show the existence of a conspiracy to prove a conspiracy charge, evidence implicating one coconspirator is likely to be directly relevant to the charges against his codefendants.  See United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1993).  Even if it is not, mistrials grounded on spillover prejudice are rare.  As long as the district court limits the admission of the challenged evidence to a particular defendant or defendants, the other defendants cannot rewardingly complain unless the impact of the evidence is so devastating that, realistically, instructions from the bench cannot be expected to repair the damage.  See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1184.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silhouetted against this set of rules, the flimsiness of Fitzgerald's claim comes into bold relief.  What excites the emotions in one case may be routine evidence in another case.  The material distilled from Sargent's statements--which would have stood out like a sore thumb in a prosecution rooted in the relative gentility of white-collar crime--does not seem especially sensational when evaluated in light of the other, plainly admissible evidence that permeated this seventy-day saga of nonstop violence.  Moreover, the district court instructed the jurors on the spot that they were not to consider Sargent's statements in deciding Fitzgerald's fate.  To complement that directive, the court redacted all references to Fitzgerald from the portions of those statements that the jury heard, and it repeated its prophylactic instruction on several occasions.  Under these circumstances, the presumption that jurors follow the court's instructions is intact.  Ergo, Fitzgerald suffered no unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ALTERNATE JURORS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants calumnize the district court because, despite their repeated objections, the court refused to discharge the alternate jurors once deliberations commenced and compounded its obduracy by allowing the alternate jurors to have intermittent contact with the regular jurors during the currency of jury deliberations.  This argument requires us to address, for the first time, the interplay between violations of Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c) and the applicable test for harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The imperative of Rule 24(c) is clear and categorical:  \"An alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c).  The rule reflects the abiding concern that, once a criminal case has been submitted, the jury's deliberations shall remain private and inviolate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See United States v. Virginia Erection Corp., 335 F.2d 868, 872 (4th Cir.1964).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellants' claim of error is well founded.  Rule 24(c) brooks no exceptions, and the district court transgressed its letter by retaining the alternate jurors throughout the deliberative period.  The lingering question, however, is whether the infraction requires us to invalidate the convictions.  The appellants say that it does.  In their view, a violation of Rule 24(c) automatically necessitates a new trial where, as here, the defendants preserved their claim of error, or, at least, the continued contact between regular and alternate jurors that transpired in this case demands that result.  The government endeavors to parry this thrust by classifying the error as benign.  We find that the Rule 24(c) violation caused no cognizable harm, and we deny relief on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The watershed case in this recondite corner of the law is  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  There the trial court permitted alternate jurors, while under instructions to refrain from engaging personally in the deliberative process, to remain in the jury room and audit the regular jurors' deliberations.  See id. at 727-29, 113 S.Ct. at 1774-75.   The jury found the defendants guilty.  The court of appeals, terming the presence of alternate jurors in the jury room during deliberations \"inherently prejudicial,\" granted them new trials although they had not lodged contemporaneous objections.   United States v. Olano, 934 F.2d 1425, 1428 (9th Cir.1991).  The Supreme Court demurred.  It noted that unless an unpreserved error affects defendants' \"substantial rights,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), the error cannot serve as a fulcrum for overturning their convictions.  507 U.S. at 737, 113 S.Ct. at 1779.   The Court then declared that the mere \"presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations is not the kind of error that 'affect[s] substantial rights' independent of its prejudicial impact.\"   Id.  Instead, the critical inquiry is whether the presence of the alternates in the jury room during deliberations actually prejudiced the defendants.  See id. at 739, 113 S.Ct. at 1780.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Justices conceded that, as a theoretical matter, the presence of any outsider, including an alternate juror, may cause prejudice if he or she actually participates in the deliberations either \"verbally\" or through \"body language,\" or if his or her attendance were somehow to chill the jurors' deliberations.   Id.  The Court recognized, however, that a judge's cautionary instructions to alternates (e.g., to refrain from injecting themselves into the deliberations) can operate to lessen or eliminate these risks.  See id. at 740, 113 S.Ct. at 1781 (remarking \"the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\") (quoting  Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1707, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987)).  Thus, absent a \"specific showing\" that the alternates in fact participated in, or otherwise chilled, deliberations, the trial court's instructions to the alternates not to intervene in the jury's deliberations precluded a finding of plain error.   Id. at 741, 113 S.Ct. at 1781.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents a variation on the  Olano theme.  Here, unlike in  Olano, the appellants contemporaneously objected to the district court's retention of the alternate jurors, thus relegating plain error analysis to the scrap heap.  This circumstance denotes two things.  First, here, unlike in  Olano, the government, not the defendants, bears the devoir of persuasion with regard to the existence vel non of prejudice.  Second, we must today answer the precise question that the  Olano Court reserved for later decision.  See id.   Withal, the framework of the inquiry in all other respects remains the same.  See id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777 (noting that, apart from the allocation of the burden of proof, a claim of error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) ordinarily requires the same type of prejudice-determining inquiry as does a preserved error).  We do not discount the significance of this solitary difference, see, e.g., id. at 742, 113 S.Ct. at 1782 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (commenting that it is \"most difficult for the Government to show the absence of prejudice\"), but \"difficult\" does not mean \"impossible.\"   Since  Olano teaches that a violation of Rule 24(c) is not reversible error per se,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> see id. at 737, 113 S.Ct. at 1779, we must undertake a particularized inquiry directed at whether the instant violation, in the circumstances of this case, \"prejudiced [the defendants], either specifically or presumptively.\"   Id. at 739, 113 S.Ct. at 1780.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task, then, is to decide if the government has made a sufficiently convincing case that the district court's failure to observe the punctilio of Rule 24(c) did not affect the verdicts.  See, e.g., id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777;   Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 758-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1244-48, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).  In performing this task, we find the Court's reasoning in  Olano instructive.  Cf. Lee v. Marshall, 42 F.3d 1296, 1299 (9th Cir.1994) (finding  Olano Court's reasoning transferable to harmless error analysis in habeas case).  The risks that were run here by retaining the alternates were identical to the risks that were run at the trial level in  Olano,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and the district judge's ability to minimize or eliminate those risks was the same in both situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The operative facts are as follows.  Although the district court retained the alternates, subsequent physical contact between them and the regular jurors occurred only sporadically--confined mostly to the beginning of each day (when all the jurors assembled prior to the commencement of daily deliberations) and lunch time (when court security officers were invariably present).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Judge Young at no time allowed the alternates to come within earshot of the deliberating jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally as important, the court did not leave either set of venirepersons uninstructed.  At the beginning of his charge, Judge Young told the alternates not to discuss the substance of the case either among themselves or with the regular jurors.  He then directed the regular jurors not to discuss the case with the alternates.  Near the end of the charge, the judge admonished all the talesmen that \"if [the regular jurors are] in the presence of the alternates or the alternates are in the presence of the jurors, [there is to be] no talking about the case, no deliberating about the case.\"   The regular jurors retired to the jury room for their deliberations, and the undischarged alternates retired to an anteroom in the judge's chambers (which remained their base of operations for the duration of the deliberations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deliberations lasted eleven days.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Each morning, Judge Young asked the regular jurors and the alternate jurors, on penalty of perjury, whether they had spoken about the case with anyone since the previous day's adjournment.  On each occasion, all the jurors (regular and alternate) responded in the negative.  The judge reiterated his instructions to both the regular and alternate jurors at the close of every court session.  In addition, he routinely warned the venire that, when they assembled the next morning before deliberations resumed, \"no one is to talk about the case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we believe that the regular jurors were well insulated from the risks posed by the retention of the alternates.  The judge repeatedly instructed the jurors--in far greater detail than in  Olano--and those instructions were delicately phrased and admirably specific.  Appropriate prophylactic instructions are a means of preventing the potential harm that hovers when a trial court fails to dismiss alternate jurors on schedule.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 740-41, 113 S.Ct. at 1781-82;   United States v. Sobamowo, 892 F.2d 90, 97 (D.C.Cir.1989) (Ginsburg, J.)  (attaching great importance to trial court's prophylactic instructions in holding failure to discharge alternate jurors harmless);  cf. United States v. Ottersburg, 76 F.3d 137, 139 (7th Cir.1996) (setting aside verdict and emphasizing trial court's failure to provide such instructions).  Courts must presume \"that jurors, conscious of the gravity of their task, attend closely the particular language of the trial court's instructions in a criminal case,\"  Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 324 n. 9, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 1976 n. 9, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985), and that they follow those instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we have more than the usual presumption that the jury understood the instructions and followed them.  The court interrogated the entire panel--regular jurors and undischarged alternates--on a daily basis, and received an unbroken string of assurances that the regular jurors had not spoken with the alternates concerning the substance of the case, and vice versa.  Just as it is fitting for appellate courts to presume, in the absence of a contrary indication, that jurors follow a trial judge's instructions, so, too, it is fitting for appellate courts to presume, in the absence of a contrary indication, that jurors answer a trial judge's questions honestly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One last observation is telling.  Over and above the plenitude of instructions, there is another salient difference between this case and  Ottersburg (the only reported criminal case in which a federal appellate court invalidated a verdict due to the trial court's failure to discharge alternate jurors).  Here, unlike in  Ottersburg, 76 F.3d at 139, the judge at no time permitted the alternates to sit in on, or listen to, the jury's deliberations (even as mute observers).  Hence, the alternates had no opportunity to participate in the deliberations, and nothing in the record plausibly suggests that they otherwise influenced the jury's actions.  If the mere presence of silent alternates in the jury room during ongoing deliberations cannot in and of itself be deemed to chill discourse or establish prejudice, see Olano, 507 U.S. at 740-41, 113 S.Ct. at 1781-82, it is surpassingly difficult to imagine how absent (though undischarged) alternates, properly instructed, could have a toxic effect on the deliberative process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Given the lack of any contact between regular and alternate jurors during ongoing deliberations, the trial judge's careful and oft-repeated instructions, the venire's unanimous disclaimers that any discussions about the case took place between the two subgroups, the overall strength of the prosecution's evidence on virtually all the counts of conviction, and the discriminating nature of the verdicts that were returned (e.g., the jury acquitted the appellants on sundry counts and also acquitted the fourth defendant, Herd, outright), we conclude that the government has carried its burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial would have been precisely the same had the district court dismissed the alternate jurors when the jury first retired to deliberate.  It follows that because the appellants suffered no prejudice in consequence of the court's bevue, they are not entitled to return to square one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. DISCOVERY DISPUTES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants stridently protest a series of government actions involving document discovery.  We first deal with a claim that implicates the scope of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500, and then treat the appellants' other asseverations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>A. Scope of the Jencks Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Jencks Act provides criminal defendants, for purposes of cross-examination, with a limited right to obtain certain witness statements that are in the government's possession.  That right is subject to a temporal condition:  it does not vest until the witness takes the stand in the government's case and completes his direct testimony.   Id. &#167; 3500(a).  It is also subject to categorical, content-based restrictions delineated in the statute:  a statement is not open to production under the Jencks Act unless it (i) relates to the same subject matter as the witness's direct testimony,  id. &#167; 3500(b), and (ii) either comprises grand jury testimony,  id. &#167; 3500(e)(3), or falls within one of two general classes of statements, namely,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>(1) a written statement made by [the] witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>(2) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500(e)(1)-(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government agents who led the investigation instructed all but the most senior prosecutors to refrain from taking notes during pretrial interviews.  The appellants decried this practice in the district court, but Judge Young found that even the deliberate use of investigatory techniques designed to minimize the production of written reports would not violate the Jencks Act.  Before us, the appellants renew their challenge.  We, too, think that it lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Jencks Act does not impose an obligation on government agents to record witness interviews or to take notes during such interviews.  After all, the Act applies only to recordings, written statements, and notes that meet certain criteria, not to items that never came into being (whether or not a prudent investigator--cynics might say an unsophisticated investigator--would have arranged things differently).  See United States v. Lieberman, 608 F.2d 889, 897 (1st Cir.1979) (rejecting a claim that the government has \"a duty to create Jencks Act material by recording everything a potential witness says\"), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1019, 100 S.Ct. 673, 62 L.Ed.2d 649 (1980);  accord United States v. Bernard, 625 F.2d 854, 859 (9th Cir.1980);  United States v. Head, 586 F.2d 508, 511-12 (5th Cir.1978);   United States v. Feilbogen, 494 F.Supp. 806, 814 (S.D.N.Y.1980), aff'd, 657 F.2d 265 (2d Cir.1981) (table).  It has been suggested that if there were evidence that lawmen \"engaged in manipulative or coercive conduct\" during the course of an audience with a particular witness, the failure to record that event might give rise to a Jencks Act violation.   Lieberman, 608 F.2d at 897 (dictum).  But this dictum, even if it might be of some moment in a proper case (a matter on which we take no view) is cold comfort to the appellants.  There is no proof of such a scenario here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and, without such proof, government interviews with witnesses are \"presumed to have been conducted with regularity.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of a contrary legislative command--and none currently exists--the choice among available investigatory techniques is, within wide limits, for the Executive Branch in contradistinction to the Judicial Branch.  The practice challenged here is not beyond the pale.  Accordingly, we hold that the government did not violate the Jencks Act by instructing agents to minimize note-taking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we do not mean to imply that we endorse the practice.  Eschewing tape recordings and ordering law enforcement agents not to take notes during pretrial interviews is risky business--and not guaranteed to redound either to the sovereign's credit or to its benefit.  By adopting a \"what we don't create can't come back to haunt us\" approach, prosecutors demean their primary mission:  to see that justice is done.  In more parochial terms, the government also loses the advantage of records that it may subsequently need to safeguard against witnesses changing their stories or to refresh recollections dimmed by the passage of time.  By and large, the legitimate interests of law enforcement will be better served by using recording equipment and/or taking accurate notes than by playing hide-and-seek.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>B. Delayed Disclosures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants also complain that delays attributable to governmental foot-dragging unfairly hampered their ability to cross-examine witnesses.  The centerpiece of this complaint is the appellants' insistence that, in addition to going very slowly in creating potentially discoverable materials, the prosecutors withheld extant materials, such as existing notes, under various pretexts, claiming that the notes comprised attorney work-product and that they did not contain substantially verbatim recitals of witnesses' statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' complaint is unproductive.  Acting with commendable thoroughness, the district court reviewed all the prosecutors' notes and kindred materials in camera to determine which documents (or portions of documents) were producible under the Jencks Act.  The government turned over what the court ordered it to produce at the time(s) when the court ordered production to be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we have held with a regularity bordering on the echolalic that \"delayed disclosure claims cannot succeed unless the aggrieved defendant demonstrates prejudice arising from the delay.\"   Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1179 (citing cases);  see also United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 781 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996).  In this context, demonstrating prejudice demands red meat and strong drink--but the appellants have served up much less hearty fare.  They articulate how the delayed disclosures supposedly impeded their ability to cross-question witnesses largely by reference to two examples.  Neither example is compelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the appellants suggest that they were unfairly surprised because, after Nardone's henchman, Michael Nelson, testified at trial that Fitzgerald alone had given Nardone a contract on the life of James Boyden III, they obtained the grand jury testimony of a subsequent witness (a law enforcement officer) which indicated that Nardone, in chatting with Nelson, implicated both Houlihan and Fitzgerald in ordering the hit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  The appellants claim that the inconsistency between the officer's grand jury testimony, on one hand, and Nelson's trial testimony, on the other hand, could have been exploited to discredit Nelson on cross-examination.  We are skeptical;  given that Nelson's statements during his pretrial interview, see supra note 19, and at trial were consistent, this tidbit would have been of dubious value for impeachment purposes.  Moreover, while Nelson was still on the witness stand, the appellants had possession of other documents that revealed the same inconsistency.  For these reasons, we are fully satisfied that any delay in the disclosure of the law enforcement officer's grand jury testimony did not affect the outcome of the trial.  Consequently, the incident fails to prove the appellants' point.  See, e.g., United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 290-91 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that delayed disclosure of impeachment material does not warrant reversal if the material would not have altered the verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second vignette concerns a prosecutor's note to the effect that Nardone told Nelson that there were two reasons why Sargent had to be killed:  first, because Houlihan felt that Sargent \"was a risk\" and \"could hurt [Houlihan] by talking\";  and second, \"as a showing of respect to the Murrays\" (a bookmaking group to whom Sargent was heavily indebted).  Regarding the second reason, Nelson explained that Fitzgerald and Houlihan asked the Murrays to post $50,000 bail for Bobby Levallee, an organization stalwart, in exchange for having Sargent killed.  Because the government did not reveal this note until after Nelson had completed his testimony, the appellants' thesis runs, they were unable to cross-examine him efficaciously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This proffer, too, is wide of the mark.  Under any circumstances, the note has only marginal evidentiary value in light of the extensive proof confirming Houlihan's desire to silence Sargent in order to keep him from telling the government what he knew--a desire that the note itself acknowledges.  Even more important, the appellants had sufficient notice of the alternative \"gambling debts\" motive well before Nelson left the stand.  Nelson himself testified on direct examination that Fitzgerald and Houlihan wanted Sargent killed for \"two reasons\":  because they believed that the police had coopted him and because they were concerned about \"all [Sargent's] gambling debts.\"   And, moreover, the record indicates that the appellants had the rest of the prosecutors' notes (some of which discussed the alternative motivation) in hand before Nelson completed his testimony;  indeed, Houlihan's counsel relied on those notes to elicit information on cross-examination about Sargent's gaming debts and his connection to the Murrays.  Under these circumstances, no reversible error inhered.  See, e.g., Saccoccia, 58 F.3d at 781 (finding no prejudice from delay when defense counsel obtained information in time to prepare cross-examination);   United States v. Hodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d 607, 609 (1st Cir.1991) (finding no prejudice from late delivery of documents when the prosecutor's opening statement alerted the defense to the same information).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed--and we doubt that it is--the sockdolager is the district court's volunteered ruling that the appellants could recall Nelson during their case for further cross-examination on the basis of the information disclosed in the note.  The appellants chose to let this opportunity pass.  The rule is clear that a defendant's failure to recall a witness, despite permission to do so, undermines a claim of prejudice based on a disclosure that materialized after the witness finished testifying (but before the trial ended).  See United States v. Arboleda, 929 F.2d 858, 864 (1st Cir.1991);   United States v. Dunn, 841 F.2d 1026, 1030 (10th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>C. Supervisory Power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to right a sinking ship, the appellants embrace a dictum contained in  United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 763 (1st Cir.1991) (\"When confronted with extreme misconduct and prejudice as a result of delayed disclosure, this court will consider invoking its supervisory powers to secure enforcement of better prosecutorial practice and reprimand of those who fail to observe it.\")  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Based on this dictum, they ask that we unleash our supervisory power and vacate their convictions as an object lesson to the government.  In the bargain, they suggest that we issue a blanket rule prohibiting prosecutors from instructing their colleagues in law enforcement not to take notes during witness interviews.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts should refrain from dismissing charges or overturning convictions merely as a device to conform executive conduct to judicially favored norms.  Rather, the courts' supervisory power should be used in this way only if plain prosecutorial misconduct is coupled with cognizable prejudice to a particular defendant.  See United States v. Santana, 6 F.3d 1, 10-11 (1st Cir.1993);   United States v. Pacheco-Ortiz, 889 F.2d 301, 310 (1st Cir.1989);  see also United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 507, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1979, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (holding that when prosecutorial misconduct constitutes no more than harmless error, no relief is warranted under supervisory power).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, both prerequisites for judicial intervention are wanting.  First and foremost, the tactics complained of--if improper at all--fall far short of a showing of egregious misconduct that might impel a federal court to consider the drastic step of vacating a conviction as a sanction against overzealous prosecutors.  Second, the delayed disclosures did not harm the defendants' substantial rights.  See United States v. Walsh, 75 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1996) (demonstrating prejudice requires more than mere \"assertions that the defendant would have conducted cross-examination differently\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  The supervisory power is strong medicine and, as we have said, \"[p]otent elixirs should not be casually dispensed.\"   Santana, 6 F.3d at 10.   There is no reason to write such a prescription in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.

With one exception, the sole ground on which these challenges rest is the allegation that the prosecution fell short of establishing the requisite nexus between the use of interstate facilities and the defendants' biocidal activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  The challenge fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The controlling legal standard is prosaic.  \"When a criminal defendant undertakes a sufficiency challenge, all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, must be viewed from the government's coign of vantage, and the viewer must accept all reasonable inferences from it that are consistent with the verdict.\"   United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.1995).  Though each element of the offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the government's burden \"may be satisfied by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or any combination thereof.\"   United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir.1994).  If a rational jury, indulging all credibility calls in favor of the verdict, could find the defendant guilty on this basis, then the inquiry terminates.  See United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 730 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1046, 112 S.Ct. 908, 116 L.Ed.2d 809 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving from the general to the specific, the murder-for-hire statute makes it unlawful to use or cause another person to use \"any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent that a murder be committed ... as consideration for ... anything of pecuniary value.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1958.  In this case, the prosecution sought to convict by proving, inter alia, that the plotters used telephone calls as a means of accomplishing their ends.  The appellants did not claim below, and do not now claim, that telephone lines fall outside the rubric of \"facilities in interstate commerce.\"   We therefore assume that point in the government's favor, see United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\");   United States v.

See United States v. Edelman, 873 F.2d 791, 794 (5th Cir.1989) (explaining that Travel Act jurisprudence is a proper referent because \"the obvious purpose\" of the murder-for-hire statute is \"to supplement\" the Travel Act);  see also S.Rep.

Arruda, 715 F.2d 671 (1st Cir.1983), a Travel Act case, we stated:  \"There is no requirement that the use of the interstate facilities be essential to the scheme:  it is enough that the ... use of interstate facilities makes easier or facilitates the unlawful activity.\"   Id. at 681-82 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  This is the commonly held view, see, e.g., United States v. Lozano, 839 F.2d 1020, 1022 (4th Cir.1988);   United States v. Smith, 789 F.2d 196, 203 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1017, 107 S.Ct. 668, 93 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986), and we confirm today that the non-essentiality principle announced in  Arruda is embodied in the murder-for-hire statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key, then, is whether the jury plausibly could have found that the appellants actually used a telephone to facilitate Sargent's and Boyden the elder's deaths and the attempts on Sweeney's life.  We hasten to add, however, that there is no requirement that each accused use a facility in interstate commerce, or that each accused intend such a facility to be used, or even that each accused know that such a facility probably will be used.  See Edelman, 873 F.2d at 795;  see also United States v. Heacock, 31 F.3d 249, 255 n. 10 (5th Cir.1994) (applying identical principle under Travel Act);   United States v.

Hence, if the government proves that one of the participants used the telephone or some comparable interstate facility in furtherance of the scheme, then the required facilitative nexus is established as to all participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we think that the jury rationally could find a facilitative nexus between the use of telephones and the criminal activities underlying the counts of conviction.  By March of 1992, Fitzgerald, a parole violator, had taken up involuntary residence in a state penitentiary.  The record, together with reasonable inferences extractable therefrom, permitted the jury to find that he made daily telephone calls from prison to an indicted coconspirator, John Doherty, at Kerrigan's Flower Shop;  and that Doherty, acting as Fitzgerald's internuncio, supplied Nardone with the weaponry needed to mount the attacks.  Telephone records introduced into evidence also indicate that Fitzgerald called Nardone several times at Lynch's apartment in and around the dates on which the murders were to occur.  Since the jury reasonably could regard the various calls as an important link in the communicative chain that led to murder and attempted murder, the appellants' challenge founders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>B. The Murder of James Boyden III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan asserts that his convictions on count 5 (conspiring to murder James Boyden III in aid of racketeering), count 6 (abetting that murder), and count 15 (hiring another to perform that murder) cannot stand.  His major theme is that the government failed to link him to the murder in any meaningful way.  We find merit in this proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict Houlihan for conspiring to murder in aid of racketeering, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a), or for abetting the murder, see id., the government had to prove that (1) the organization masterminded by Fitzgerald and Houlihan constituted a racketeering enterprise;  (2) that, depending on the count, Houlihan conspired to commit, or aided and abetted the commission of, the murder;  and (3) that Houlihan participated in the arrangement \"for the purpose of maintaining or increasing [his] position in a [racketeering] enterprise.\"   Id.  By like token, under the murder-for-hire statute the government had to prove (1) that Houlihan joined in causing the killing of another, (2) paying a price or other consideration, (3) with the specific intent to commit the substantive crime (murder), and (4) that interstate facilities were used by one or more of the participants in the course of perpetrating the crime.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1958.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A common thread runs through all three counts.  In one form or another, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that in the spring of 1992 Houlihan \"conspired to murder James Boyden III\" (count 5), and/or \"aided, abetted, counselled, commanded [or] induced\" that murder (count 6), and/or used \"facilities in interstate commerce ... to hire other individuals and to arrange the intended murder of James Boyden III\" (count 15).  Under each of these counts, the government had to show at a bare minimum that Houlihan intended the murder of James Boyden III to take place and that he acted upon that intent.  See, e.g., United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir.)  (explaining that proof of a charged conspiracy requires, inter alia, proof of intent to commit the substantive offense), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 910, 109 S.Ct. 3227, 106 L.Ed.2d 576 &amp; 493 U.S. 832, 110 S.Ct. 105, 107 L.Ed.2d 68 (1989);   United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 591 (1st Cir.1994) (stating that an aider and abettor must \"consciously share[ ] the specific criminal intent of the principals\");  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1958 (specifically requiring proof that the defendant acted with \"intent that a murder be committed\").  In other words, as Judge Young instructed the jury, the government had to show that Houlihan \"intentionally arranged for the murder of James Boyden III by Joseph Nardone,\" or \"aided and abetted that crime,\" and that he had the \"specific intent\" of causing the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have combed the record in light of this highly specific subset of charges to determine whether the government satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Houlihan perpetrated these three interrelated crimes.  We have come up empty.  In our judgment there is insufficient evidence that Houlihan, whatever other atrocities he may have committed, intended to bring about the execution of James Boyden III, or that he participated in any culpable way in the commission of that crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence depicts Fitzgerald as the leader of the organization and Houlihan as his second-in-command.  The government's theory is that Nardone killed Boyden III, and that Fitzgerald and Houlihan jointly directed him to do so.  But the government's star witness, Nelson, testified that, according to Nardone, Fitzgerald alone ordered the murder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This seems reasonable in view of the fact that the murder grew out of events surrounding the assassination of the victim's son (Boyden IV).  The younger Boyden, against Fitzgerald's explicit warning, had continued to sell cocaine in the \"sales territory\" assigned to Jennierose Lynch (Fitzgerald's paramour).  After several violent encounters, Boyden IV turned up dead.  The government charged Fitzgerald, Lynch, and Herd--but not Houlihan--with that murder.  As recounted earlier, the judge granted Fitzgerald's motion for a mistrial on those charges (and he presumably remains subject to retrial);  the judge ordered the charges against Lynch dropped as part of an overall plea bargain;  and the jury acquitted Herd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record strongly suggests that the son's murder set the stage for the father's murder, and that the killings were related.  The government makes no effort to implicate Houlihan in the former crime, and there is only a tenuous set of inferences linking him to the latter crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually the only intimation that Houlihan may have played a role in the killing of Boyden III comes from Sargent's tape-recorded statement during which the following colloquy transpired (references in the colloquy to \"Boyden, Sr.\" refer to James Boyden III):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>SARGENT:  I was having a couple of drinks, and [Houlihan] mentioned ... that--that there's two ... that's going to go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>...

From the dialogue that we have quoted, the government suggests that a jury could plausibly infer that Houlihan was referring to the upcoming murder of James Boyden III in his \"two ... that's going to go\" comment;  and that, from this inference, the jury could plausibly infer that Houlihan intended to bring about that murder and participated in it in some meaningful way.  This is simply too great a stretch.  Houlihan did not mention James Boyden III in his conversation with Sargent, and it is not even clear that Sargent understood Houlihan to be referring to any particular individuals.  Rather, the import of Sargent's comment seems to be that succeeding events filled in the blanks.  And even if we accept the first suggested inference, the record hardly will support the further inference that Houlihan had a specific intent to murder James Boyden III, or that he abetted the ensuing crime.  At most, the conversation suggests an awareness of a planned slaying, not necessarily participation in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government tries to buttress these strained inferences by pointing to Sargent's parroting of Houlihan's statement that he \"could have somebody kill anybody\" and labelling this as evidence that Houlihan directed the commission of this particular murder.  But that argument proves too much.  On the government's reasoning, Houlihan could have been charged and convicted of any murder.  The government also points out that, on the day after the murder, Nardone collected his fee at Kerrigan's Flower Shop.  Because this bore some resemblance to the method of payment that Houlihan employed after Nardone murdered Sargent, see supra note 22, the government asks us to infer that Houlihan also must have arranged this payment.  We think for two reasons that the suggested inference is dubious.  First, the difference in payment methodology is significant:  on the latter occasion (Sargent's murder), the government proved that Houlihan personally paid the fee to Nardone;  on the former occasion (Boyden the elder's murder), it did not.  Second, the record shows that Fitzgerald not only ordered the murder of James Boyden III but also, though imprisoned, remained in daily contact with Doherty, and that Doherty (who was based at Kerrigan's) or any of several other underlings could have arranged the payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, given the working relationship between Houlihan and Fitzgerald and their use of Nardone as a triggerman in connection with Sargent's murder and the attempts on Sweeney's life, the question of evidentiary sufficiency is close.  In the end, however, we do not think that the evidence measures up to the requirement--which we apply de novo--that a reasonable jury be able to find each element of the crime to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Given Nelson's uncontradicted testimony that only one individual--Fitzgerald--sanctioned the execution of James Boyden III, and also given the nexus between the Boydens' murders, we believe that the chain of inferences forged by the prosecution is too loose (albeit by the slimmest of margins) to hold Houlihan criminally responsible for the charged crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p>C. Severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reader will recall that the indictment charged Herd, Lynch, and Fitzgerald--but not Houlihan and Nardone--with offenses related to the murder of James Boyden IV.  Houlihan and Nardone contend that the court had an obligation to sever their trials from the trial of the counts relating to the Boyden IV murder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When several defendants are named in a unified indictment, there is a strong presumption that they should be tried together.  See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 538-39, 113 S.Ct. 933, 937-38, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993);   O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25.   To obtain a severance under such circumstances, a defendant must demonstrate extreme prejudice, such as by showing a \"serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right,\" or would \"prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\"   Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539, 113 S.Ct. at 938.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone cannot scale these heights.  Their central thesis is that the government's evidence concerning the Boyden IV murder tended to show that the victim was slaughtered in an organization-related turf battle, and therefore threatened to infect the jury's consideration of other counts.  But they dress this thesis in the gossamer vestments of speculation and surmise.  That is not enough.  \"There is always some prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or offender are tried together--but such 'garden variety' prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice\" as a basis for obligatory severance.   Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there is a gray area in which reasonable people might disagree about the advisability of a severance.  In the vast majority of those cases, however, the severance battle is conclusively won or lost in the district court.  See O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25 (explaining that the court of appeals ordinarily should defer to the district court's evaluation of the necessity for separate trials);   United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 308 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that a denial of severance will only be reversed for a \"manifest abuse of discretion\"), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1079, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992).  This case falls within the sweep of that generality, not within the long-odds exception to it.  Not only is the inference of undue prejudice that the appellants seek to draw somewhat attenuated, but also any possible prejudice was dissipated by the trial court's firm, carefully worded, and oft-repeated instructions to the jurors, forbidding them from considering the evidence anent the murder of Boyden the younger in deciding the charges against either Houlihan or Nardone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  On this record, we are confident that the trial court did not abuse its considerable discretion in denying the requested severance.  See, e.g., O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25;   United States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 859-60 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1074, 111 S.Ct. 801, 112 L.Ed.2d 862 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p>D.

Houlihan and Nardone successfully solicited limiting instructions.  Prior to each witness's testimony Judge Young admonished the jury that the testimony was admissible only against Fitzgerald, Herd, and Lynch, and not against Houlihan or Nardone.  Notwithstanding these limiting instructions, Houlihan and Nardone asked to cross-examine Ford and McDonald.  The court blocked that maneuver.  Houlihan and Nardone press the point in this venue, alleging that the court's ruling violated their confrontation rights and otherwise constituted an improper exercise of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate a violation of the Confrontation Clause, a defendant must show that he was \"prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness.\"   Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 680, 106 S.Ct. at 1436.   Here, there was no abridgement of the defendants' constitutional rights.  The Confrontation Clause demands that a defendant have the opportunity to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him;  at least in the absence of special circumstances--and none appear here--the Clause does not create a right to confront or cross-examine persons who appear as witnesses exclusively against others (even if the others are codefendants in a joint trial).  Because neither Ford nor McDonald was a witness \"against\" either Houlihan or Nardone, the constitutional claim is stillborn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a constitutional violation, \"appellate courts will grant relief from the shackling of cross-examination only for manifest abuse of discretion.\"   Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254.   We discern no trace of abuse in this instance.  Despite the lack of cross-examination,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> the limiting instructions fully protected Houlihan's and Nardone's legitimate interests.  Furthermore, allowing counsel for Houlihan and Nardone to cross-examine Ford and McDonald could well have had a boomerang effect, leading the jury to believe that, contrary to the judge's instructions, the testimony had some relevance to the charges against their clients.  Hence, the restriction on cross-examination was well-tailored to the occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p>E.

Before us, Fitzgerald claims that the testimony had no relevance to the surviving counts, and included details about the slaying of the younger Boyden that might well have horrified the jurors and prejudiced them against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's ruling to admit or exclude particular evidence for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 997 (1st Cir.1995);   United States v. Holmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 163 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1797, 131 L.Ed.2d 724 (1995).  The same standard pertains to motions to strike evidence previously admitted.  See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1184.   Here, the district court styled the disputed testimony as being \"probative ... of other counts in the case,\" and denied the motion to strike on that basis.  Having scrutinized the testimony in light of the surviving charges against Fitzgerald, we are persuaded that, as Fitzgerald maintains, it was prejudicial to some degree.  But that is not the end of the road.  \"[A]ll evidence is meant to be prejudicial;  it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.\"   United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1989) (emphasis in original).

In ruling on it, the district court had to compose a balance between the probative value of the evidence as a whole and the risk of unfair prejudice attendant to keeping it before the jury.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.  And though the evidence was prejudicial in a sense, it was also plainly probative of Fitzgerald's role as the kingpin in the organization and bore directly on the remaining charges against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the question is admittedly close, we are unprepared to say that the evidence's unfairly prejudicial impact substantially outweighed its probative worth.  \"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighting of probative value and unfair effect.\"   Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988).  This is not such an occasion.  It follows that the lower court did not misuse its discretion in denying both Fitzgerald's motion to strike and his alternative motion to declare an across-the-board mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p>F. The Armed Robbery Reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nardone had also been charged with committing several armed robberies.  The district court severed the armed robbery counts before trial.  When Nelson (one of Nardone's alleged coconspirators) testified, Houlihan's counsel cross-examined him.  In the course of the cross-examination, the lawyer proffered a copy of Nelson's cooperation agreement with the government.  No objection appearing, the court admitted the document into evidence.  Appended to the cooperation agreement (now a full exhibit) was a copy of the information that the government had filed against Nelson (which contained, inter alia, a count that described an alleged Nelson/Nardone armed robbery).  Four days later, Nardone's counsel asked the district court to delete all references to him from the exhibit before it went to the jury.  The court refused.  Nardone assigns error.  We uphold the ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is danger in delay, and the contemporaneous objection rule is, for the most part, strictly enforced in this circuit.  See, e.g., United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir.1995);   United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 99-100 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844, 108 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed.2d 94 (1987).  While it is true in this case that Nardone's attorney ultimately objected, a belated objection does not cure the original default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we might be impelled to intervene if we thought that, despite the lack of a contemporaneous objection, the district court committed plain error by refusing to redact the references to Nardone which appeared in the information.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-37, 113 S.Ct. at 1776-80 (discussing dimensions of plain error review);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  But here, no plain error looms.  During cross-examination of Nelson--two days after Houlihan's counsel introduced the cooperation agreement into evidence without objection and two days before Nardone's counsel broached the idea of redaction--the latter questioned Nelson extensively about the armed robbery and drug conspiracy described in the information.  Although these questions were artfully phrased to avoid any explicit reference to Nardone's participation in those crimes, we believe that this harping on the contents of the information bolsters the district court's decision not to excuse the lack of a contemporaneous objection.  We conclude, therefore, that the court acted within its discretion in declining to relax the usual rule and in rejecting Nardone's tardy request for redaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p>G. Jury Instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants posit that the district court's charge did not impart the degree of participation required to convict a defendant of conspiracy charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1961-1969.  The RICO statute criminalizes \"conduct[ing] or participat[ing], directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [an] enterprise's affairs\" through a pattern of racketeering activity.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c).  To convey this element of the RICO offenses, Judge Young instructed the jury that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p>that by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity the specific individual accused ... conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs.  The term conduct and participate in the conduct of an enterprise includes the performance of acts, functions or duties which are related to the operation of the enterprise.  A person may be found to participate in the conduct of the enterprise even though he has no part in the management or control of the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants fault this instruction because it told the jury that a defendant could be found guilty even if he did not participate \"in the management or control of the enterprise.\"   In their view, the Court's opinion in  Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 507 U.S. 170, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993), signifies the opposite.  But this asseveration misconstrues  Reves.   There, the Court interpreted the words \"conduct or participate\" as they appear in section 1962(c), and determined that those words require a defendant's participation in either \"the operation or management of the enterprise itself.\"   Id. at 185, 113 S.Ct. at 1173.   But because the defendant in  Reves was an outside accounting firm that had only a contractual relationship with the allegedly corrupt enterprise--it audited the books and issued financial reports, but neither controlled the enterprise nor participated in either its operation or management--RICO liability did not attach.  See id. at 186, 113 S.Ct. at 1173.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is of a distinctively different stripe.  Unlike the accountants in  Reves, who were classic \"outsiders,\" the appellants here are quintessential \"insiders,\" that is, persons whom the evidence places in the maw of the criminal activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  We have previously held that insiders who are integral to carrying out the enterprise's racketeering activities--and the appellants clearly fit that description--come within the definitional sweep of section 1962(c).  See United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996);   United States v.  Oreto, 37 F.3d 739, 750-51 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1161, 130 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1995).  The instructions given in this case are in all material respects identical to those that we approved in  Hurley and  Oreto.   Consequently, we reject this assignment of error without further elaboration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p>H. Forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan contends that the government failed to produce sufficient evidence to support the forfeiture of a house located at 80 Ferncroft Road, Tewksbury, Massachusetts.  The government lodged the forfeiture count under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> and the jury found in its favor.  The property had been deeded by a third-party seller to Francis Jackson (Houlihan's uncle), and Houlihan's contention is that, because title stood in Jackson's name, the property could not be forfeited in consequence of his (Houlihan's) peccadilloes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[C]riminal forfeiture is a punishment, not a separate criminal offense.\"   Saccoccia, 58 F.3d at 783.   In such a proceeding, the government can satisfy its burden of proof by either direct or circumstantial evidence.  See id. at 782.   In this instance we conclude without serious question that a rational factfinder could determine--as this jury did--that Houlihan was the de facto owner of the house, and that it had been purchased with proceeds derived from racketeering activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Real estate agents testified that they took Houlihan and his wife, along with Jackson, on tours of the dwelling several times during 1993;  that Houlihan told them that he was \"interested\" in buying it;  that Houlihan attended the pre-sale inspection and the two closings that proved to be necessary;  and that the property was purchased entirely for cash (approximately $195,000).  And, moreover, both Houlihan and his wife were in residence at the premises when the authorities arrested Houlihan in October of 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These pieces of evidence combine to form a picture that reveals Houlihan as the actual owner of the home in Tewksbury, with Jackson serving merely as a straw.  Then, too, the evidence is reinforced by the utter absence of any proof indicating how Jackson might have acquired so large an amount of cash.  Given the totality of the circumstances, the jury was entitled to find that the house was forfeitable as a fruit of Houlihan's racketeering.  See id.  (\"Jurors, after all, are not expected to resist common-sense inferences based on the realities of human experience.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p>I. Sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentences imposed by the district court are unremarkable in most respects.  The sole exception relates to count 20.  That count charged Fitzgerald and Houlihan, among others, with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance (cocaine) in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.  As to Fitzgerald and Houlihan, Judge Young imposed contingent sentences of life imprisonment, to take effect \"only if the sentence on count 19 [which charged a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 848] is reversed [or] otherwise dismissed.\"   Because we affirm the conviction and sentence on count 19, the contingency that Judge Young envisioned has not materialized.  Hence, we now vacate Fitzgerald's and Houlihan's convictions and sentences on count 20.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an indictment charges a defendant with participating in both a conspiracy and a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE), and if the former is used as a predicate act to prove the latter, then the conspiracy is in actuality a lesser-included offense of the CCE charge, and the defendant may not lawfully be sentenced for both crimes.  See United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 152-53 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 862, 112 S.Ct. 184, 116 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991);   Stratton v. United States, 862 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1988) (per curiam).  To do otherwise would result in cumulative punishment violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 154-58, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2218-20, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977) (plurality op.);   Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 152-53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not wax longiloquent, for the government, to its credit, concedes the point.  Thus, our affirmance of Fitzgerald's and Houlihan's convictions and sentences on count 19 necessitates the vacation of their convictions and sentences on count 20.  See Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 153 (holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause requires vacation of conviction and sentence on conspiracy count when a defendant is convicted and sentenced on both conspiracy and CCE counts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For the reasons we have discussed at length--perhaps at too much length--we affirm the convictions and sentences of all three appellants in all respects, save only for (a) Houlihan's convictions on counts 5, 6 and 15 (which are reversed), and (b) Fitzgerald's and Houlihan's convictions on count 20 (which are vacated).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So Ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Of these twelve, only Fitzgerald, Houlihan, and Nardone appear as appellants before us.  Three of their codefendants (Skinner, Lynch, and Joseph Houlihan) eventually pled guilty;  five others were granted a separate trial;  and one (William Herd) was acquitted by the same jury that convicted the three appellants</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because the government did not prove to the district court's satisfaction that Fitzgerald shared his codefendants' intent to forestall Sargent from cooperating with the police, the court ruled that Sargent's statements could not be used against Fitzgerald.  The correctness of that ruling is not before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court also published a preliminary opinion,  United States v. Houlihan, 871 F.Supp. 1495 (D.Mass.1994), which is of little moment in regard to these appeals</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It is noteworthy that, after Judge Young ruled on the admissibility of Sargent's statements, Sweeney testified that Houlihan told him, flat out, that Sargent had been killed because he \"was talking to the cops.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In a related vein, Houlihan and Nardone complain that the district court failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to ruling on the admissibility of Sargent's statements.  This complaint strikes us as a thinly-veiled effort to rehash a discovery dispute that we discuss infra Part IV(B).  In all events, the district court heard arguments of counsel and thirty-seven days of trial testimony before deciding that the statements could be utilized.  In these circumstances, the court did not outstrip the bounds of its discretion in declining to convene a special mid-trial evidentiary hearing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We caution that a waiver of confrontation rights does not result in the automatic surrender of all evidentiary objections.  For example, a district court still should exclude relevant but highly inflammatory evidence, misconduct notwithstanding, if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the evidence's probative value.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.  Presumably, such evidence would have been excludable on a non-hearsay ground if the declarant were available to testify, so there is no reason to admit it when the defendant procures the declarant's unavailability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Perhaps the weakest link in the chain is Sargent's statement regarding a suggestive but ambiguous conversation that he had with Houlihan shortly before the killing of James Boyden III.  But this tale is relevant principally to the three counts against Houlihan on which we order his convictions reversed.  See infra Part V(B).  Thus, any error in admitting it is harmless</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Though the district court applied the same redaction principles to the police officer's testimony concerning the March interview (which was not recorded or transcribed) and the tape-recorded May interview, the emphasis on appeal is on the latter.  While we restrict our discussion to that recording, our holding applies with equal force to the earlier debriefing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The rule provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>When a ... recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require him at that time to introduce any other part ... which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.</p>\n        <p>Fed.R.Evid. 106.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> For example, during cross-examination of Detective Harris (who taped and testified about the May 1992 interview), the appellants showed that Sargent had a lengthy criminal record;  that he gave up his confreres while facing the possibility of a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking;  and that he had been promised low bail, among other things, in exchange for cooperation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding that Criminal Rule 23(b) permits the remaining eleven jurors to return a valid verdict if a deliberating juror is excused for cause, the wisdom of Rule 24(c) remains debatable.  We can understand a district judge's reluctance, following a long, complicated, and hotly contested trial, to release alternate jurors before a verdict is obtained.  But courts, above all other institutions, must obey the rules</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> On this score,  Olano confirmed what this court anticipated.

There, the undischarged alternates actually stayed in the jury room during deliberations.  507 U.S. at 729-30, 113 S.Ct. at 1775-76.   Here, they did not;  indeed, the regular jurors and the undischarged alternates were never in physical proximity while the deliberative process was ongoing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> On one occasion when the regular jurors were on a mid-morning break, an alternate juror retrieved a plate of delicacies from the jury room.  Defense counsel brought this interlude to Judge Young's attention, and the judge immediately agreed to instruct the alternates to stay out of the jury room during breaks (except for retrieving snacks from the jury room when court security officers confirmed that a break in deliberations had occurred)</p>\n        <p>On another occasion defense counsel voiced suspicion that a note from the jury to the judge (requesting transcripts of several witnesses' testimony) had been written in the presence of the alternates.  At counsels' urging, Judge Young, in the course of responding to the note in open court, asked each juror whether \"the alternates and the deliberating jurors, or vice versa, [had] discussed the substance of the case\" during the pertinent time frame.  All the jurors responded in the negative, and Judge Young reinstructed the regular jurors not to discuss the case with, or deliberate in the presence of, the alternate jurors.  The defendants took no exception either to the form of the inquiry or to the instructions that the court gave.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> On the third day a regular juror had to be excused.

Sullivan, 961 F.2d 998 (1st Cir.1992), a case that antedated  Olano, we considered a civil analog to Criminal Rule 24(c) and stated that \"[w]hen a trial court allows an ... alternate juror[ ] to deliberate with the regular jurors ... an inherently prejudicial error is committed, and the substantial rights of the parties are violated.\"   Id. at 1002.   In the instant case, unlike in  Cabral, there is neither proof nor reason to suspect that the undischarged alternates participated in the regular jurors' deliberations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The appellants claim that instructing agents not to take notes constitutes a deliberate strategy to manipulate the quantity of discoverable material.

To cite just one example, Houlihan personally paid Nardone his $5,000 \"headache elimination\" fee at Kerrigan's Flower Shop on the day after Nardone ended Sargent's life.  Further examples are unnecessary.  It suffices to say that extensive evidence pointed to the conclusion that Fitzgerald and Houlihan jointly orchestrated both Sargent's slaying and Sweeney's travails</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Indeed, when it was pointed out that a grand jury witness had testified otherwise, the government protested that the witness had made a mistake.  See supra note 19.   The grand jury testimony was not admitted at the trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> Ironically, none of the counts related to this murder bore fruit:  the jury found Herd not guilty;  the court relieved Lynch of responsibility when she pleaded guilty to other counts;  and the court granted Fitzgerald a mistrial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> The court enhanced the efficacy of the limiting instructions by insisting that all the government's evidence relating to this murder be presented compactly at the same point in the trial.  This is a salutary practice, and we commend it generally to trial courts confronted with analogous situations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> Of course, these witnesses did not emerge unscathed.  Ford and McDonald were vigorously cross-examined by counsel for the implicated defendants, Fitzgerald included</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> The witnesses in question are Veronica Boyden (the mother of James Boyden IV), Marie Boyden-Connors (his sister), and Frances Hannigan (a former owner of Kerrigan's Flower Shop)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> A few examples may assist in giving texture to this conclusion.  Veronica Boyden testified that she heard Lynch, an indicted coconspirator, threaten to call Fitzgerald if James Boyden IV continued to poach on her sales territory.  Similarly, Boyden-Connors testified that Fitzgerald himself warned her to keep her brother away from Lynch's territory.  Hannigan's testimony, overall, related more to the structure and operating practices of the Fitzgerald-Houlihan organization and less to the slaying of James Boyden IV.  By way of illustration, Hannigan testified at length about Fitzgerald's presence at Kerrigan's Flower Shop, his meetings there with other members of the conspiracy, and his daily telephone calls to Doherty from his prison cell during the period of his immurement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> As an aside, we note that there is no inkling of any prejudice stemming from this ruling.  For one thing, the jury acquitted Nardone on several counts, so it is impossible to argue convincingly that the unredacted information irretrievably poisoned the jurors against him.  For another thing, given the powerful evidentiary strands that tied Nardone tightly to two brutal murders and several other murder attempts, we doubt that the references about which he now complains could conceivably have altered the jury's verdicts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> Nardone's claim that he was an independent contractor is imaginative but unconvincing.  The evidence supports the view that Nardone was an insider.  He maintained regular contact with Fitzgerald and Houlihan throughout the duration of the conspiracy;  he obtained his armaments directly from them;  and he took orders from them.  Indeed, Nardone's description of himself as the organization's \"hit man\" and \"headache man\" belies his more recently manufactured \"independent contractor\" label</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> The appellants also claim that the district court erred by refusing to repeat its concededly correct definition of what constitutes a racketeering \"enterprise\" in its instructions to the jury on those counts that charged murder and attempted murder in aid of racketeering.  Judge Young chose instead to incorporate by reference his correct definition of a RICO enterprise (given to the jury earlier in the charge);  and, in the same vein, he specifically informed the jury that, as to all racketeering-related counts, they must find the existence of an enterprise meeting the statutory criteria as an element of each offense.  In light of the perfectly sensible course taken by the judge, the appellants' claim is unfounded.  A trial court has broad discretion to formulate jury instructions as it sees fit, as long as it touches all the bases.  See United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995).  Here, taking the charge as an integrated whole, see, e.g., United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 1003 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 913, 108 S.Ct. 259, 98 L.Ed.2d 216 (1987), we find no error</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> Insofar as it is germane to Houlihan's situation, the statute provides in substance that a RICO offender shall forfeit to the government any property interest or thing of value acquired with the proceeds of racketeering activity.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(a)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> The district court instructed the jury that the government had the burden of proving entitlement to forfeiture beyond a reasonable doubt.  The proof here is capable of satisfying that standard.  We note, however--although we leave the question open--that the government may have conceded too much.  Compare United States v. Tanner, 61 F.3d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that criminal forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853 requires a preponderance of the evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 925, 133 L.Ed.2d 854 (1996) and  United States v.

Pelullo, 14 F.3d 881, 906 (3d Cir.1994) (holding that government, in a criminal forfeiture proceeding under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(a), must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the targeted property was derived from the defendant's racketeering activity)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Two of those issues--one implicating the Confrontation Clause and the other involving Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)--raise important questions of first impression in this circuit.  In the pages that follow, we offer a skeletal outline of the case and then put flesh on the bones by addressing, first, the appellants' two flagship claims.  We next consider a series of discovery disputes and conclude by discussing, albeit in a more abbreviated fashion, a laundry list of other asseverations.  In the end, after careful consideration of the parties' arguments and close perscrutation of the compendious record, we affirm the judgments below in large part, but reverse one defendant's conviction on three related counts and bring a contingent sentencing determination to closure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Overcoming the temptation to engage in Homeric recitation of the riveting facts that emerged during a seventy-day trial, we opt instead to sketch the evidence at this juncture and reserve greater detail until the need arises to place specific issues into workable context.  We draw our sketch in colors that coordinate with the jury's verdicts, consistent with record support.  See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 711 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The organization commanded the allegiance of numerous distributors, stationary and mobile, including Jennierose Lynch, William \"Bud\" Sweeney, George Sargent, and Alan Skinner.  These minions, and others like them, helped the organization supply cocaine to hordes of buyers through an elaborate street-level distribution network that arranged most of its sales with the aid of electronic pagers, assigned customer codes, and preset rendezvous points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzgerald and Houlihan imposed a strict code of silence on all who came into contact with them, including their own troops.  They dealt severely with persons who seemed inclined to talk too freely.  Joseph Nardone, a professional assassin who bragged that he was the \"headache man\"--when the organization's chieftains had a headache, Nardone got rid of it--acted as the principal enforcer.  Over time, the gang's targets included Sargent, Sweeney (who survived multiple attempts on his life, but was left paralyzed from the chest down), a rival drug dealer, James Boyden III, and the latter's son and helpmeet, James Boyden IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fitzgerald-Houlihan axis dominated the Charlestown scene through 1993.  Ultimately, the authorities broke the code of silence and a federal grand jury indicted twelve individuals (including Fitzgerald, Houlihan, and Nardone) on a myriad of charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After trial, the two ringleaders and their enforcer were found guilty of engaging in a racketeering enterprise (count 1), racketeering conspiracy (count 2), conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering (counts 5, 7 &amp; 9), and conspiracy to distribute cocaine (count 20).  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1962(c) &amp; (d), 1959(a);  21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.  The jury also convicted Fitzgerald and Houlihan of aiding and abetting murder and attempted murder in aid of racketeering (counts 6, 8, 11 &amp; 12), instigating murder for hire (counts 15, 16 &amp; 17), engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (count 19), and distributing cocaine (counts 21 through 29).  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1959(a), 1958;  21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 848, 841(a)(1).  The jury found Nardone guilty of murder and attempted murder in aid of racketeering (counts 6, 8, 11 &amp; 12), see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a), and using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to crimes of violence (counts 39, 40, 42 &amp; 43), see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).  The jury also returned special forfeiture verdicts.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963;  21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.  The district court sentenced each defendant to multiple terms of life imprisonment.  These appeals blossomed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE VOICE FROM THE GRAVE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court admitted over objection portions of hearsay statements made by George Sargent on the theory that Sargent's murder constituted a waiver of the Confrontation Clause vis-a-vis the murderers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Houlihan and Nardone assign error to this order and to a salmagundi of related rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A. Setting the Stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent served as a distributor for the Fitzgerald-Houlihan organization.  The police arrested him twice during 1992 on drug-trafficking charges.  Both times, Sargent made voluntary statements that inculpated Fitzgerald and Houlihan in a sprawling drug conspiracy and tended to link them with several murders.  The statements also furnished evidence probative of the elements of the offenses with which Nardone had been charged, but Sargent did not mention him by name.  On June 28, 1992--within a month after he gave the second statement--Sargent was ambushed outside his dwelling and was shot several times.  He died as a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a pretrial motion for an order (1) authorizing a state trooper, Mark Lemieux, to testify about Sargent's statements following his March 1992 arrest, and (2) permitting the jury to hear a redacted version of the taped May 1992 interview conducted by Boston police detectives following Sargent's second arrest.  The government argued that the appellants--who had been charged with Sargent's murder--waived their rights to object to the admission of his out-of-court statements on either Confrontation Clause or hearsay grounds when they successfully conspired to execute him for the express purpose of preventing his cooperation with the authorities.  The district court took the motion under advisement and, near the end of the government's case in chief, admitted the challenged evidence against Houlihan and Nardone, but not Fitzgerald, see supra note 2, concluding that the government had shown by clear and convincing evidence that those defendants conspired to kill Sargent at least in part for the purpose of preventing him from cooperating with the police, and that such actions were tantamount to a knowing waiver of their confrontation rights.  See United States v. Houlihan, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></span>, 363-65 (D.Mass.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>B.

See, e.g., Puleio v.

While a waiver of the right to confront witnesses typically is express, the law is settled that a defendant also may waive it through his intentional misconduct.  See, e.g., Taylor v.

Thus, a defendant who wrongfully procures a witness's absence for the purpose of denying the government that witness's testimony waives his right under the Confrontation Clause to object to the admission of the absent witness's hearsay statements.

Thus, they could not have been on notice that they were waiving a trial right.  We find this argument unpersuasive.

In much the same way, when a defendant murders such a witness (or procures his demise) in order to prevent him from assisting an ongoing criminal investigation, he is denying the government the benefit of the witness's live testimony at a future trial.  In short, the two situations are fair congeners:  as long as it is reasonably foreseeable that the investigation will culminate in the bringing of charges, the mere fact that the homicide occurs at an earlier step in the pavane should not affect the operation of the waiver-by-misconduct doctrine.  Indeed, adopting the contrary position urged by the appellants would serve as a prod to the unscrupulous to accelerate the timetable and murder suspected snitches sooner rather than later.  We see no justification for creating such a perverse incentive, or for distinguishing between a defendant who assassinates a witness on the eve of trial and a potential defendant who assassinates a potential witness before charges officially have been brought.

With respect, we believe the better comparison is to the admission of out-of-court statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.  See Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  To invoke the coconspirator exception, the proponent of the statement must \"show by a preponderance of the evidence\" certain predicate facts, namely, \"that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"   United States v.

See Steele, 684 F.2d at 1203;   United States v. White, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span>, 624 (D.D.C.1993).  We therefore align ourselves with the majority of federal appellate courts that have considered the question, see, e.g., Mastrangelo, 693 F.2d at 273;   Steele, 684 F.2d at 1202-03;   Balano, 618 F.2d at 629, and set the government's burden of proof at the preponderance-of-the-evidence level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Measured against this more conventional benchmark, the district court's findings easily pass muster.  The record amply demonstrates that Houlihan and Nardone knew when they conspired to murder Sargent that they were depriving the government of a potential witness.  First, the district court supportably found that they believed Sargent was cooperating with the police and could harm them and the organization by talking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 363-64.   Second, Sargent was in fact cooperating with law enforcement officials at the time and made two voluntary statements in which he provided detailed accounts of the organization's modus operandi, descriptions of the principals' roles in various murders, and a frank admission of his own involvement in the conspiracy.  While the defendants' perception of likely cooperation may well be enough to meet this prong of the test, the fact of Sargent's cooperation reinforces the inference that the killers believed Sargent was spilling the beans and murdered him on that account.  Last but not least, the conspirators knew to a certainty that Sargent had keen insight into their felonious activities both from his own work in the distribution network and from sundry conversations in which they spoke openly to him--in retrospect, too openly--of their participation in serious crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidentiary foundation sturdily supports the conclusion that Houlihan and Nardone reasonably could have foreseen Sargent becoming a witness against them and plotted to kill him in order to deprive the government of his firsthand testimony.  Hence, the district court did not err in overruling objections to the introduction of portions of Sargent's out-of-court statements insofar as those objections stemmed from the Confrontation Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>C.

On the facts of this case, we agree with the district court, see Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 362, 367, that Houlihan's and Nardone's misconduct waived not only their confrontation rights but also their hearsay objections, thus rendering a special finding of reliability superfluous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has yet to plot the crossroads at which the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay principles embedded in the Evidence Rules intersect.  The question is subtly nuanced.  Though the two bodies of law are not coterminous, they husband essentially the same interests.  See California v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108189\"><a href=\"/opinion/108189/california-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 155-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108189\"><a href=\"/opinion/108189/california-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span> (1970).  Both attempt to strike a balance between the government's need for probative evidence and the defendant's stake in testing the government's case through cross-examination.  See Ohio v. Roberts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span> (1980).  As a result, whether hearsay principles are more or less protective of a defendant's right to cross-examination than confrontation principles depends on the point at which the balance is struck in any particular instance (recognizing, however, that the balance can be struck at different levels in different cases).  See Green, 399 U.S. at 156, 90 S.Ct. at 1934.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we can take matters a step further.  In constructing the balance the main interest that must be offset against the government's need for evidence is the accused's right to confrontation (for this is the right from which the right to cross-examine springs).  Once the confrontation right is lifted from the scales by operation of the accused's waiver of that right, the balance tips sharply in favor of the need for evidence.  See Thai, 29 F.3d at 814 (holding that a defendant who waives his confrontation right by wrongfully procuring a witness's silence also waives hearsay objections vis-a-vis that witness);   United States v. Aguiar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590899\"><a href=\"/opinion/590899/united-states-v-andres-aguiar/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 47 (2d Cir.1992) (similar);  see also Steele, 684 F.2d at 1201 (noting that \"English and American courts have consistently relaxed the hearsay rule when the defendant wrongfully causes the witness' unavailability\").  Here, then, inasmuch as Houlihan and Nardone waived their confrontation right by colloguing to murder Sargent, they simultaneously waived their right to object on hearsay grounds to the admission of his out-of-court statements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Hence, the district court appropriately eschewed the request for findings under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone have a fallback position.  They suggest that the district court's admission of Sargent's out-of-court statements violated their rights to due process because the admissions allowed them to be convicted on the basis of unreliable evidence.  See Green, 399 U.S. at 163 n. 15, 90 S.Ct. at 1938 n. 15 (ruminating that \"considerations of due process, wholly apart from the Confrontation Clause, might prevent convictions where a reliable evidentiary basis is totally lacking\").  We reject this initiative.  Whatever criticisms justifiably might be levelled against Sargent's statements, the portions of those statements that Judge Young allowed into evidence are not so unreliable as to raise due process concerns.  Other evidence abundantly corroborates (and in many instances replicates) Sargent's account.  For instance, his description of the organization's modus operandi and his assessment of Houlihan's leadership role were confirmed and described in excruciating detail by a galaxy of live witnesses (e.g., Michael Nelson, Bud Sweeney, Cheryl Dillon).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>D.

Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 365.   Houlihan and Nardone objected, contending that the editing process heightened the force of Sargent's statements, and that if the interviews were to be introduced at all, then the entire text should be fair game.  The district court overruled the objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Houlihan and Nardone argue less that Sargent's statements should have been redacted somewhat differently and more that they should not have been redacted at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  They assert that when a defendant waives his rights to make Confrontation Clause and hearsay objections through misconduct, the absent declarant's full out-of-court statement should be admissible at the behest of either the proponent or opponent of the statement.  This assertion rests on a misguided notion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cardinal purpose of the waiver-by-misconduct doctrine is to ensure that a wrongdoer does not profit in a court of law by reason of his miscreancy.  By murdering Sargent, Houlihan and Nardone denied the prosecution the benefit of his live testimony.  To compensate for that denial the court allowed the government to introduce portions of the interviews that Sargent gave to the police.  The defense, however, was not entitled to any compensation, and permitting it to introduce additional hearsay statements (apart from statements necessary to place the portions used by the government into context and to render them not misleading) would be to reward bloodthirstiness.  We decline to stamp a judicial imprimatur on a calculated murder.  Thus, we hold that a homicidal defendant may by his misconduct waive his hearsay objections, but that waiver does not strip the government of its right to lodge hearsay objections.  It is only the party who wrongfully procures a witness's absence who waives the right to object to the adverse party's introduction of the witness's prior out-of-court statements.  See White, 838 F.Supp. at 625;  see also Steele, 684 F.2d at 1202.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, since courts should not reward parties for their own misdeeds, a prior out-of-court statement made by a witness whose unavailability stems from the wrongful conduct of a party, aimed at least in part at achieving that result, is admissible against that party as long as the statement would have been admissible had the witness testified.  But the party who causes the witness's unavailability is not entitled to the same prophylaxis.  Consequently, under settled jurisprudence governing totem-pole hearsay, see Fed.R.Evid. 805, the tape of Sargent's interview itself constituted first-level hearsay not within any recognized exception, and the district court did not err in admitting some portions at the government's urging and refusing to admit the rest of the recording at the appellants' behest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone offer a second reason why the trial court erred in excluding the balance of Sargent's statements.  This construct pivots on Evidence Rule 106, a rule that codifies principles of fairness and completeness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Under it, a party against whom a fragmentary statement is introduced may demand that the rest of the statement (or so much thereof as is appropriate) be admitted into evidence in order to place the excerpt in context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is readily evident that, as the appellants maintain, Rule 106 can serve its proper function only if the trial court from time to time is prepared to permit the introduction of some otherwise inadmissible evidence.  See United States v. Sutton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476806\"><a href=\"/opinion/476806/united-states-v-robert-b-sutton-united-states-of-america-v-mark-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></a></span>, 1368 (D.C.Cir.1986).  Be that as it may, completeness, like beauty, is frequently in the eye of the beholder.  The trial court is in the best position to assess the competing centrifugal and centripetal forces that bear on this calculus.  Thus, when the trial court, acting in its discretion, finds that proffered excerpts, standing on their own, are not misleading, its judgment is entitled to great respect.  See United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 256-57 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 4<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span>49, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone dwell on incompleteness primarily because Judge Young declared two sets of comments inadmissible.  (1) Sargent told the police, inter alia, that James Boyden IV was selling drugs in Lynch's territory;  that Fitzgerald warned him and had him beaten, but to no avail;  and that he then told Sargent that he would \"just have to kill\" the interloper.  Claiming that Fitzgerald's remarks to Sargent provided Fitzgerald with a different motive to murder Sargent, Houlihan sought to have this part of Sargent's statement admitted into evidence.  Houlihan claims that omitting references to Fitzgerald's involvement in the murder made it appear that he, rather than Fitzgerald, was the mastermind responsible for that crime.  (2) In a similar vein, Nardone claims that the court's refusal to permit him to introduce references in the interviews to Herd's putative involvement in the Boydens' killings made it appear that Nardone carried out those murders single-handed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that these incremental excerpts were \"segregable\" from the portions of the interviews that the government had proffered and denied the appellants' requests to admit them.   Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 366.   In assessing the court's rulings, three facts are worthy of note:  (1) the interview segments admitted into evidence contained no explicit reference whatever to the Boydens' murders;  (2) neither Houlihan nor Nardone were charged with the slaying of James Boyden IV;  and (3) Sargent never mentioned Nardone by name anywhere in the course of either debriefing.  Bearing these facts in mind, we conclude that the lower court acted within the realm of its discretion in refusing to invoke Rule 106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone also claim that the court should have admitted other portions of Sargent's interviews to impeach his credibility.  See Fed.R.Evid. 806 (providing that the credibility of a hearsay declarant \"may be attacked ... by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if [the] declarant had testified as a witness\").  The district court rejected this claim because it found the additional excerpts \"too convoluted, collateral, or cumulative to be admitted.\"   Houlihan, 887 F.Supp. at 368.   Having reviewed the items, we discern no error in their exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial courts have considerable leeway in imposing outside limits on cross-examination.  See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. at 1435;   Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d at 28.   Here, the record demonstrates that the appellants had a full and fair opportunity during their cross-examination of the officers who interviewed Sargent to cast doubts upon his veracity.  They made the most of this opportunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  By contrast, the extra material that the appellants wished to introduce lacked genuine impeachment value and promised to add virtually nothing of consequence to the grueling cross-examination.  Thus, we cannot fault the district court for excluding this exiguous material.  See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. at 1435 (stating that cross-examination appropriately may be limited if redundant or marginally relevant);   Boylan, 898 F.2d at 255-56 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory.  Because our painstaking review of the record reveals no solid grounding for the claim that the district court flouted Rule 106 in any respect, we refuse to meddle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>E. Prejudicial Spillover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one last leg to this phase of our journey.  Fitzgerald alleges that the admission of Sargent's statements resulted in unfair prejudice to him.  The record reveals none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the prosecution must show the existence of a conspiracy to prove a conspiracy charge, evidence implicating one coconspirator is likely to be directly relevant to the charges against his codefendants.  See United States v. O'Bryant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610896\"><a href=\"/opinion/610896/united-states-v-david-s-obryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1993).  Even if it is not, mistrials grounded on spillover prejudice are rare.  As long as the district court limits the admission of the challenged evidence to a particular defendant or defendants, the other defendants cannot rewardingly complain unless the impact of the evidence is so devastating that, realistically, instructions from the bench cannot be expected to repair the damage.  See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1184.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silhouetted against this set of rules, the flimsiness of Fitzgerald's claim comes into bold relief.  What excites the emotions in one case may be routine evidence in another case.  The material distilled from Sargent's statements--which would have stood out like a sore thumb in a prosecution rooted in the relative gentility of white-collar crime--does not seem especially sensational when evaluated in light of the other, plainly admissible evidence that permeated this seventy-day saga of nonstop violence.  Moreover, the district court instructed the jurors on the spot that they were not to consider Sargent's statements in deciding Fitzgerald's fate.  To complement that directive, the court redacted all references to Fitzgerald from the portions of those statements that the jury heard, and it repeated its prophylactic instruction on several occasions.  Under these circumstances, the presumption that jurors follow the court's instructions is intact.  Ergo, Fitzgerald suffered no unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ALTERNATE JURORS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants calumnize the district court because, despite their repeated objections, the court refused to discharge the alternate jurors once deliberations commenced and compounded its obduracy by allowing the alternate jurors to have intermittent contact with the regular jurors during the currency of jury deliberations.  This argument requires us to address, for the first time, the interplay between violations of Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c) and the applicable test for harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The imperative of Rule 24(c) is clear and categorical:  \"An alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c).  The rule reflects the abiding concern that, once a criminal case has been submitted, the jury's deliberations shall remain private and inviolate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See United States v. Virginia Erection Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"265297\"><a href=\"/opinion/265297/united-states-v-virginia-erection-corporation-and-john-p-shields/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span>, 872 (4th Cir.1964).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellants' claim of error is well founded.  Rule 24(c) brooks no exceptions, and the district court transgressed its letter by retaining the alternate jurors throughout the deliberative period.  The lingering question, however, is whether the infraction requires us to invalidate the convictions.  The appellants say that it does.  In their view, a violation of Rule 24(c) automatically necessitates a new trial where, as here, the defendants preserved their claim of error, or, at least, the continued contact between regular and alternate jurors that transpired in this case demands that result.  The government endeavors to parry this thrust by classifying the error as benign.  We find that the Rule 24(c) violation caused no cognizable harm, and we deny relief on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The watershed case in this recondite corner of the law is  United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993).  There the trial court permitted alternate jurors, while under instructions to refrain from engaging personally in the deliberative process, to remain in the jury room and audit the regular jurors' deliberations.  See id. at 727-29, 113 S.Ct. at 1774-75.   The jury found the defendants guilty.  The court of appeals, terming the presence of alternate jurors in the jury room during deliberations \"inherently prejudicial,\" granted them new trials although they had not lodged contemporaneous objections.   United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562307\"><a href=\"/opinion/562307/united-states-v-guy-w-olano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-raymond-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1425</span></a></span>, 1428 (9th Cir.1991).  The Supreme Court demurred.  It noted that unless an unpreserved error affects defendants' \"substantial rights,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), the error cannot serve as a fulcrum for overturning their convictions.  507 U.S. at 737, 113 S.Ct. at 1779.   The Court then declared that the mere \"presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations is not the kind of error that 'affect[s] substantial rights' independent of its prejudicial impact.\"   Id.  Instead, the critical inquiry is whether the presence of the alternates in the jury room during deliberations actually prejudiced the defendants.  See id. at 739, 113 S.Ct. at 1780.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Justices conceded that, as a theoretical matter, the presence of any outsider, including an alternate juror, may cause prejudice if he or she actually participates in the deliberations either \"verbally\" or through \"body language,\" or if his or her attendance were somehow to chill the jurors' deliberations.   Id.  The Court recognized, however, that a judge's cautionary instructions to alternates (e.g., to refrain from injecting themselves into the deliberations) can operate to lessen or eliminate these risks.  See id. at 740, 113 S.Ct. at 1781 (remarking \"the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\") (quoting  Richardson v. Marsh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 206, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1702</span></a></span>, 1707, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span> (1987)).  Thus, absent a \"specific showing\" that the alternates in fact participated in, or otherwise chilled, deliberations, the trial court's instructions to the alternates not to intervene in the jury's deliberations precluded a finding of plain error.   Id. at 741, 113 S.Ct. at 1781.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents a variation on the  Olano theme.  Here, unlike in  Olano, the appellants contemporaneously objected to the district court's retention of the alternate jurors, thus relegating plain error analysis to the scrap heap.  This circumstance denotes two things.  First, here, unlike in  Olano, the government, not the defendants, bears the devoir of persuasion with regard to the existence vel non of prejudice.  Second, we must today answer the precise question that the  Olano Court reserved for later decision.  See id.   Withal, the framework of the inquiry in all other respects remains the same.  See id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777 (noting that, apart from the allocation of the burden of proof, a claim of error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) ordinarily requires the same type of prejudice-determining inquiry as does a preserved error).  We do not discount the significance of this solitary difference, see, e.g., id. at 742, 113 S.Ct. at 1782 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (commenting that it is \"most difficult for the Government to show the absence of prejudice\"), but \"difficult\" does not mean \"impossible.\"   Since  Olano teaches that a violation of Rule 24(c) is not reversible error per se,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> see id. at 737, 113 S.Ct. at 1779, we must undertake a particularized inquiry directed at whether the instant violation, in the circumstances of this case, \"prejudiced [the defendants], either specifically or presumptively.\"   Id. at 739, 113 S.Ct. at 1780.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our task, then, is to decide if the government has made a sufficiently convincing case that the district court's failure to observe the punctilio of Rule 24(c) did not affect the verdicts.  See, e.g., id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777;   Kotteakos v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104321\"><a href=\"/opinion/104321/kotteakos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 758-65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104321\"><a href=\"/opinion/104321/kotteakos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span>, 1244-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104321\"><a href=\"/opinion/104321/kotteakos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1557</span></a></span> (1946).  In performing this task, we find the Court's reasoning in  Olano instructive.  Cf. Lee v. Marshall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684419\"><a href=\"/opinion/684419/john-gregory-lee-v-c-marshall-warden-attorney-general-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>, 1299 (9th Cir.1994) (finding  Olano Court's reasoning transferable to harmless error analysis in habeas case).  The risks that were run here by retaining the alternates were identical to the risks that were run at the trial level in  Olano,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and the district judge's ability to minimize or eliminate those risks was the same in both situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The operative facts are as follows.  Although the district court retained the alternates, subsequent physical contact between them and the regular jurors occurred only sporadically--confined mostly to the beginning of each day (when all the jurors assembled prior to the commencement of daily deliberations) and lunch time (when court security officers were invariably present).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Judge Young at no time allowed the alternates to come within earshot of the deliberating jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally as important, the court did not leave either set of venirepersons uninstructed.  At the beginning of his charge, Judge Young told the alternates not to discuss the substance of the case either among themselves or with the regular jurors.  He then directed the regular jurors not to discuss the case with the alternates.  Near the end of the charge, the judge admonished all the talesmen that \"if [the regular jurors are] in the presence of the alternates or the alternates are in the presence of the jurors, [there is to be] no talking about the case, no deliberating about the case.\"   The regular jurors retired to the jury room for their deliberations, and the undischarged alternates retired to an anteroom in the judge's chambers (which remained their base of operations for the duration of the deliberations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deliberations lasted eleven days.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Each morning, Judge Young asked the regular jurors and the alternate jurors, on penalty of perjury, whether they had spoken about the case with anyone since the previous day's adjournment.  On each occasion, all the jurors (regular and alternate) responded in the negative.  The judge reiterated his instructions to both the regular and alternate jurors at the close of every court session.  In addition, he routinely warned the venire that, when they assembled the next morning before deliberations resumed, \"no one is to talk about the case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we believe that the regular jurors were well insulated from the risks posed by the retention of the alternates.  The judge repeatedly instructed the jurors--in far greater detail than in  Olano--and those instructions were delicately phrased and admirably specific.  Appropriate prophylactic instructions are a means of preventing the potential harm that hovers when a trial court fails to dismiss alternate jurors on schedule.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 740-41, 113 S.Ct. at 1781-82;   United States v. Sobamowo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534173\"><a href=\"/opinion/534173/united-states-v-oliyinka-sobamowo/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 97 (D.C.Cir.1989) (Ginsburg, J.)  (attaching great importance to trial court's prophylactic instructions in holding failure to discharge alternate jurors harmless);  cf. United States v. Ottersburg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712269\"><a href=\"/opinion/712269/united-states-v-thomas-d-ottersburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 139 (7th Cir.1996) (setting aside verdict and emphasizing trial court's failure to provide such instructions).  Courts must presume \"that jurors, conscious of the gravity of their task, attend closely the particular language of the trial court's instructions in a criminal case,\"  Francis v. Franklin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111418\"><a href=\"/opinion/111418/francis-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 324 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111418\"><a href=\"/opinion/111418/francis-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court interrogated the entire panel--regular jurors and undischarged alternates--on a daily basis, and received an unbroken string of assurances that the regular jurors had not spoken with the alternates concerning the substance of the case, and vice versa.  Just as it is fitting for appellate courts to presume, in the absence of a contrary indication, that jurors follow a trial judge's instructions, so, too, it is fitting for appellate courts to presume, in the absence of a contrary indication, that jurors answer a trial judge's questions honestly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One last observation is telling.  Over and above the plenitude of instructions, there is another salient difference between this case and  Ottersburg (the only reported criminal case in which a federal appellate court invalidated a verdict due to the trial court's failure to discharge alternate jurors).  Here, unlike in  Ottersburg, 76 F.3d at 139, the judge at no time permitted the alternates to sit in on, or listen to, the jury's deliberations (even as mute observers).  Hence, the alternates had no opportunity to participate in the deliberations, and nothing in the record plausibly suggests that they otherwise influenced the jury's actions.  If the mere presence of silent alternates in the jury room during ongoing deliberations cannot in and of itself be deemed to chill discourse or establish prejudice, see Olano, 507 U.S. at 740-41, 113 S.Ct. at 1781-82, it is surpassingly difficult to imagine how absent (though undischarged) alternates, properly instructed, could have a toxic effect on the deliberative process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Given the lack of any contact between regular and alternate jurors during ongoing deliberations, the trial judge's careful and oft-repeated instructions, the venire's unanimous disclaimers that any discussions about the case took place between the two subgroups, the overall strength of the prosecution's evidence on virtually all the counts of conviction, and the discriminating nature of the verdicts that were returned (e.g., the jury acquitted the appellants on sundry counts and also acquitted the fourth defendant, Herd, outright), we conclude that the government has carried its burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial would have been precisely the same had the district court dismissed the alternate jurors when the jury first retired to deliberate.  It follows that because the appellants suffered no prejudice in consequence of the court's bevue, they are not entitled to return to square one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

It is also subject to categorical, content-based restrictions delineated in the statute:  a statement is not open to production under the Jencks Act unless it (i) relates to the same subject matter as the witness's direct testimony,  id. &#167; 3500(b), and (ii) either comprises grand jury testimony,  id. &#167; 3500(e)(3), or falls within one of two general classes of statements, namely,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>(1) a written statement made by [the] witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>(2) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500(e)(1)-(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government agents who led the investigation instructed all but the most senior prosecutors to refrain from taking notes during pretrial interviews.  The appellants decried this practice in the district court, but Judge Young found that even the deliberate use of investigatory techniques designed to minimize the production of written reports would not violate the Jencks Act.  Before us, the appellants renew their challenge.  We, too, think that it lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Jencks Act does not impose an obligation on government agents to record witness interviews or to take notes during such interviews.  After all, the Act applies only to recordings, written statements, and notes that meet certain criteria, not to items that never came into being (whether or not a prudent investigator--cynics might say an unsophisticated investigator--would have arranged things differently).

Lieberman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371190\"><a href=\"/opinion/371190/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97167-united-states-of-america-v-benjamin-lieberman/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span>, 897 (1st Cir.1979) (rejecting a claim that the government has \"a duty to create Jencks Act material by recording everything a potential witness says\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It has been suggested that if there were evidence that lawmen \"engaged in manipulative or coercive conduct\" during the course of an audience with a particular witness, the failure to record that event might give rise to a Jencks Act violation.   Lieberman, 608 F.2d at 897 (dictum).  But this dictum, even if it might be of some moment in a proper case (a matter on which we take no view) is cold comfort to the appellants.  There is no proof of such a scenario here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and, without such proof, government interviews with witnesses are \"presumed to have been conducted with regularity.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of a contrary legislative command--and none currently exists--the choice among available investigatory techniques is, within wide limits, for the Executive Branch in contradistinction to the Judicial Branch.  The practice challenged here is not beyond the pale.  Accordingly, we hold that the government did not violate the Jencks Act by instructing agents to minimize note-taking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we do not mean to imply that we endorse the practice.  Eschewing tape recordings and ordering law enforcement agents not to take notes during pretrial interviews is risky business--and not guaranteed to redound either to the sovereign's credit or to its benefit.  By adopting a \"what we don't create can't come back to haunt us\" approach, prosecutors demean their primary mission:  to see that justice is done.  In more parochial terms, the government also loses the advantage of records that it may subsequently need to safeguard against witnesses changing their stories or to refresh recollections dimmed by the passage of time.  By and large, the legitimate interests of law enforcement will be better served by using recording equipment and/or taking accurate notes than by playing hide-and-seek.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>B. Delayed Disclosures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants also complain that delays attributable to governmental foot-dragging unfairly hampered their ability to cross-examine witnesses.  The centerpiece of this complaint is the appellants' insistence that, in addition to going very slowly in creating potentially discoverable materials, the prosecutors withheld extant materials, such as existing notes, under various pretexts, claiming that the notes comprised attorney work-product and that they did not contain substantially verbatim recitals of witnesses' statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' complaint is unproductive.  Acting with commendable thoroughness, the district court reviewed all the prosecutors' notes and kindred materials in camera to determine which documents (or portions of documents) were producible under the Jencks Act.  The government turned over what the court ordered it to produce at the time(s) when the court ordered production to be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we have held with a regularity bordering on the echolalic that \"delayed disclosure claims cannot succeed unless the aggrieved defendant demonstrates prejudice arising from the delay.\"   Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1179 (citing cases);  see also United States v. Saccoccia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196165\"><a href=\"/opinion/196165/united-states-v-saccoccia/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 781 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1322</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></span> (1996).  In this context, demonstrating prejudice demands red meat and strong drink--but the appellants have served up much less hearty fare.  They articulate how the delayed disclosures supposedly impeded their ability to cross-question witnesses largely by reference to two examples.  Neither example is compelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the appellants suggest that they were unfairly surprised because, after Nardone's henchman, Michael Nelson, testified at trial that Fitzgerald alone had given Nardone a contract on the life of James Boyden III, they obtained the grand jury testimony of a subsequent witness (a law enforcement officer) which indicated that Nardone, in chatting with Nelson, implicated both Houlihan and Fitzgerald in ordering the hit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  The appellants claim that the inconsistency between the officer's grand jury testimony, on one hand, and Nelson's trial testimony, on the other hand, could have been exploited to discredit Nelson on cross-examination.  We are skeptical;  given that Nelson's statements during his pretrial interview, see supra note 19, and at trial were consistent, this tidbit would have been of dubious value for impeachment purposes.  Moreover, while Nelson was still on the witness stand, the appellants had possession of other documents that revealed the same inconsistency.  For these reasons, we are fully satisfied that any delay in the disclosure of the law enforcement officer's grand jury testimony did not affect the outcome of the trial.  Consequently, the incident fails to prove the appellants' point.  See, e.g., United States v. Devin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551278\"><a href=\"/opinion/551278/united-states-v-francis-e-devin/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 290-91 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that delayed disclosure of impeachment material does not warrant reversal if the material would not have altered the verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second vignette concerns a prosecutor's note to the effect that Nardone told Nelson that there were two reasons why Sargent had to be killed:  first, because Houlihan felt that Sargent \"was a risk\" and \"could hurt [Houlihan] by talking\";  and second, \"as a showing of respect to the Murrays\" (a bookmaking group to whom Sargent was heavily indebted).  Regarding the second reason, Nelson explained that Fitzgerald and Houlihan asked the Murrays to post $50,000 bail for Bobby Levallee, an organization stalwart, in exchange for having Sargent killed.  Because the government did not reveal this note until after Nelson had completed his testimony, the appellants' thesis runs, they were unable to cross-examine him efficaciously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This proffer, too, is wide of the mark.  Under any circumstances, the note has only marginal evidentiary value in light of the extensive proof confirming Houlihan's desire to silence Sargent in order to keep him from telling the government what he knew--a desire that the note itself acknowledges.  Even more important, the appellants had sufficient notice of the alternative \"gambling debts\" motive well before Nelson left the stand.  Nelson himself testified on direct examination that Fitzgerald and Houlihan wanted Sargent killed for \"two reasons\":  because they believed that the police had coopted him and because they were concerned about \"all [Sargent's] gambling debts.\"   And, moreover, the record indicates that the appellants had the rest of the prosecutors' notes (some of which discussed the alternative motivation) in hand before Nelson completed his testimony;  indeed, Houlihan's counsel relied on those notes to elicit information on cross-examination about Sargent's gaming debts and his connection to the Murrays.  Under these circumstances, no reversible error inhered.  See, e.g., Saccoccia, 58 F.3d at 781 (finding no prejudice from delay when defense counsel obtained information in time to prepare cross-examination);   United States v. Hodge-Balwing, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574885\"><a href=\"/opinion/574885/united-states-v-saver-hodge-balwing-aka-balwin-hodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 609 (1st Cir.1991) (finding no prejudice from late delivery of documents when the prosecutor's opening statement alerted the defense to the same information).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed--and we doubt that it is--the sockdolager is the district court's volunteered ruling that the appellants could recall Nelson during their case for further cross-examination on the basis of the information disclosed in the note.  The appellants chose to let this opportunity pass.  The rule is clear that a defendant's failure to recall a witness, despite permission to do so, undermines a claim of prejudice based on a disclosure that materialized after the witness finished testifying (but before the trial ended).  See United States v. Arboleda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558577\"><a href=\"/opinion/558577/united-states-v-carlos-arboleda-united-states-v-martin-castillo-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>, 864 (1st Cir.1991);   United States v.

Based on this dictum, they ask that we unleash our supervisory power and vacate their convictions as an object lesson to the government.  In the bargain, they suggest that we issue a blanket rule prohibiting prosecutors from instructing their colleagues in law enforcement not to take notes during witness interviews.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts should refrain from dismissing charges or overturning convictions merely as a device to conform executive conduct to judicially favored norms.

First and foremost, the tactics complained of--if improper at all--fall far short of a showing of egregious misconduct that might impel a federal court to consider the drastic step of vacating a conviction as a sanction against overzealous prosecutors.  Second, the delayed disclosures did not harm the defendants' substantial rights.  See United States v.

By March of 1992, Fitzgerald, a parole violator, had taken up involuntary residence in a state penitentiary.  The record, together with reasonable inferences extractable therefrom, permitted the jury to find that he made daily telephone calls from prison to an indicted coconspirator, John Doherty, at Kerrigan's Flower Shop;  and that Doherty, acting as Fitzgerald's internuncio, supplied Nardone with the weaponry needed to mount the attacks.  Telephone records introduced into evidence also indicate that Fitzgerald called Nardone several times at Lynch's apartment in and around the dates on which the murders were to occur.  Since the jury reasonably could regard the various calls as an important link in the communicative chain that led to murder and attempted murder, the appellants' challenge founders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>B.

His major theme is that the government failed to link him to the murder in any meaningful way.

By like token, under the murder-for-hire statute the government had to prove (1) that Houlihan joined in causing the killing of another, (2) paying a price or other consideration, (3) with the specific intent to commit the substantive crime (murder), and (4) that interstate facilities were used by one or more of the participants in the course of perpetrating the crime.

In one form or another, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that in the spring of 1992 Houlihan \"conspired to murder James Boyden III\" (count 5), and/or \"aided, abetted, counselled, commanded [or] induced\" that murder (count 6), and/or used \"facilities in interstate commerce ... to hire other individuals and to arrange the intended murder of James Boyden III\" (count 15).  Under each of these counts, the government had to show at a bare minimum that Houlihan intended the murder of James Boyden III to take place and that he acted upon that intent.

In other words, as Judge Young instructed the jury, the government had to show that Houlihan \"intentionally arranged for the murder of James Boyden III by Joseph Nardone,\" or \"aided and abetted that crime,\" and that he had the \"specific intent\" of causing the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have combed the record in light of this highly specific subset of charges to determine whether the government satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Houlihan perpetrated these three interrelated crimes.  We have come up empty.  In our judgment there is insufficient evidence that Houlihan, whatever other atrocities he may have committed, intended to bring about the execution of James Boyden III, or that he participated in any culpable way in the commission of that crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence depicts Fitzgerald as the leader of the organization and Houlihan as his second-in-command.  The government's theory is that Nardone killed Boyden III, and that Fitzgerald and Houlihan jointly directed him to do so.  But the government's star witness, Nelson, testified that, according to Nardone, Fitzgerald alone ordered the murder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This seems reasonable in view of the fact that the murder grew out of events surrounding the assassination of the victim's son (Boyden IV).  The younger Boyden, against Fitzgerald's explicit warning, had continued to sell cocaine in the \"sales territory\" assigned to Jennierose Lynch (Fitzgerald's paramour).  After several violent encounters, Boyden IV turned up dead.  The government charged Fitzgerald, Lynch, and Herd--but not Houlihan--with that murder.  As recounted earlier, the judge granted Fitzgerald's motion for a mistrial on those charges (and he presumably remains subject to retrial);  the judge ordered the charges against Lynch dropped as part of an overall plea bargain;  and the jury acquitted Herd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record strongly suggests that the son's murder set the stage for the father's murder, and that the killings were related.  The government makes no effort to implicate Houlihan in the former crime, and there is only a tenuous set of inferences linking him to the latter crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually the only intimation that Houlihan may have played a role in the killing of Boyden III comes from Sargent's tape-recorded statement during which the following colloquy transpired (references in the colloquy to \"Boyden, Sr.\" refer to James Boyden III):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>SARGENT:  I was having a couple of drinks, and [Houlihan] mentioned ... that--that there's two ... that's going to go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>...

From the dialogue that we have quoted, the government suggests that a jury could plausibly infer that Houlihan was referring to the upcoming murder of James Boyden III in his \"two ... that's going to go\" comment;  and that, from this inference, the jury could plausibly infer that Houlihan intended to bring about that murder and participated in it in some meaningful way.  This is simply too great a stretch.  Houlihan did not mention James Boyden III in his conversation with Sargent, and it is not even clear that Sargent understood Houlihan to be referring to any particular individuals.  Rather, the import of Sargent's comment seems to be that succeeding events filled in the blanks.  And even if we accept the first suggested inference, the record hardly will support the further inference that Houlihan had a specific intent to murder James Boyden III, or that he abetted the ensuing crime.  At most, the conversation suggests an awareness of a planned slaying, not necessarily participation in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government tries to buttress these strained inferences by pointing to Sargent's parroting of Houlihan's statement that he \"could have somebody kill anybody\" and labelling this as evidence that Houlihan directed the commission of this particular murder.  But that argument proves too much.  On the government's reasoning, Houlihan could have been charged and convicted of any murder.  The government also points out that, on the day after the murder, Nardone collected his fee at Kerrigan's Flower Shop.  Because this bore some resemblance to the method of payment that Houlihan employed after Nardone murdered Sargent, see supra note 22, the government asks us to infer that Houlihan also must have arranged this payment.  We think for two reasons that the suggested inference is dubious.  First, the difference in payment methodology is significant:  on the latter occasion (Sargent's murder), the government proved that Houlihan personally paid the fee to Nardone;  on the former occasion (Boyden the elder's murder), it did not.  Second, the record shows that Fitzgerald not only ordered the murder of James Boyden III but also, though imprisoned, remained in daily contact with Doherty, and that Doherty (who was based at Kerrigan's) or any of several other underlings could have arranged the payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, given the working relationship between Houlihan and Fitzgerald and their use of Nardone as a triggerman in connection with Sargent's murder and the attempts on Sweeney's life, the question of evidentiary sufficiency is close.  In the end, however, we do not think that the evidence measures up to the requirement--which we apply de novo--that a reasonable jury be able to find each element of the crime to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Given Nelson's uncontradicted testimony that only one individual--Fitzgerald--sanctioned the execution of James Boyden III, and also given the nexus between the Boydens' murders, we believe that the chain of inferences forged by the prosecution is too loose (albeit by the slimmest of margins) to hold Houlihan criminally responsible for the charged crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p>C.

Houlihan and Nardone contend that the court had an obligation to sever their trials from the trial of the counts relating to the Boyden IV murder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When several defendants are named in a unified indictment, there is a strong presumption that they should be tried together.  See Zafiro v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112812\"><a href=\"/opinion/112812/zafiro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 538-39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112812\"><a href=\"/opinion/112812/zafiro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To obtain a severance under such circumstances, a defendant must demonstrate extreme prejudice, such as by showing a \"serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right,\" or would \"prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\"   Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539, 113 S.Ct. at 938.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlihan and Nardone cannot scale these heights.  Their central thesis is that the government's evidence concerning the Boyden IV murder tended to show that the victim was slaughtered in an organization-related turf battle, and therefore threatened to infect the jury's consideration of other counts.  But they dress this thesis in the gossamer vestments of speculation and surmise.  That is not enough.  \"There is always some prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or offender are tried together--but such 'garden variety' prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice\" as a basis for obligatory severance.

In the vast majority of those cases, however, the severance battle is conclusively won or lost in the district court.  See O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25 (explaining that the court of appeals ordinarily should defer to the district court's evaluation of the necessity for separate trials);   United States v. Natanel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 308 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that a denial of severance will only be reversed for a \"manifest abuse of discretion\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Not only is the inference of undue prejudice that the appellants seek to draw somewhat attenuated, but also any possible prejudice was dissipated by the trial court's firm, carefully worded, and oft-repeated instructions to the jurors, forbidding them from considering the evidence anent the murder of Boyden the younger in deciding the charges against either Houlihan or Nardone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  On this record, we are confident that the trial court did not abuse its considerable discretion in denying the requested severance.

Houlihan and Nardone successfully solicited limiting instructions.  Prior to each witness's testimony Judge Young admonished the jury that the testimony was admissible only against Fitzgerald, Herd, and Lynch, and not against Houlihan or Nardone.  Notwithstanding these limiting instructions, Houlihan and Nardone asked to cross-examine Ford and McDonald.  The court blocked that maneuver.  Houlihan and Nardone press the point in this venue, alleging that the court's ruling violated their confrontation rights and otherwise constituted an improper exercise of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate a violation of the Confrontation Clause, a defendant must show that he was \"prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness.\"   Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 680, 106 S.Ct. at 1436.   Here, there was no abridgement of the defendants' constitutional rights.  The Confrontation Clause demands that a defendant have the opportunity to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him;  at least in the absence of special circumstances--and none appear here--the Clause does not create a right to confront or cross-examine persons who appear as witnesses exclusively against others (even if the others are codefendants in a joint trial).  Because neither Ford nor McDonald was a witness \"against\" either Houlihan or Nardone, the constitutional claim is stillborn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a constitutional violation, \"appellate courts will grant relief from the shackling of cross-examination only for manifest abuse of discretion.\"   Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254.   We discern no trace of abuse in this instance.  Despite the lack of cross-examination,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> the limiting instructions fully protected Houlihan's and Nardone's legitimate interests.  Furthermore, allowing counsel for Houlihan and Nardone to cross-examine Ford and McDonald could well have had a boomerang effect, leading the jury to believe that, contrary to the judge's instructions, the testimony had some relevance to the charges against their clients.

Here, the district court styled the disputed testimony as being \"probative ... of other counts in the case,\" and denied the motion to strike on that basis.  Having scrutinized the testimony in light of the surviving charges against Fitzgerald, we are persuaded that, as Fitzgerald maintains, it was prejudicial to some degree.  But that is not the end of the road.  \"[A]ll evidence is meant to be prejudicial;  it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.\"   United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 156 (1st Cir.1989) (emphasis in original).  Thus, our inquiry must proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzgerald cast the motion to strike in \"all or nothing\" terms.  In ruling on it, the district court had to compose a balance between the probative value of the evidence as a whole and the risk of unfair prejudice attendant to keeping it before the jury.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.  And though the evidence was prejudicial in a sense, it was also plainly probative of Fitzgerald's role as the kingpin in the organization and bore directly on the remaining charges against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the question is admittedly close, we are unprepared to say that the evidence's unfairly prejudicial impact substantially outweighed its probative worth.  \"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighting of probative value and unfair effect.\"   Freeman v.

This is not such an occasion.  It follows that the lower court did not misuse its discretion in denying both Fitzgerald's motion to strike and his alternative motion to declare an across-the-board mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p>F.

The district court severed the armed robbery counts before trial.  When Nelson (one of Nardone's alleged coconspirators) testified, Houlihan's counsel cross-examined him.  In the course of the cross-examination, the lawyer proffered a copy of Nelson's cooperation agreement with the government.  No objection appearing, the court admitted the document into evidence.  Appended to the cooperation agreement (now a full exhibit) was a copy of the information that the government had filed against Nelson (which contained, inter alia, a count that described an alleged Nelson/Nardone armed robbery).  Four days later, Nardone's counsel asked the district court to delete all references to him from the exhibit before it went to the jury.  The court refused.  Nardone assigns error.  We uphold the ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is danger in delay, and the contemporaneous objection rule is, for the most part, strictly enforced in this circuit.  See, e.g., United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 972 (1st Cir.1995);   United States v.

While it is true in this case that Nardone's attorney ultimately objected, a belated objection does not cure the original default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we might be impelled to intervene if we thought that, despite the lack of a contemporaneous objection, the district court committed plain error by refusing to redact the references to Nardone which appeared in the information.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-37, 113 S.Ct. at 1776-80 (discussing dimensions of plain error review);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  But here, no plain error looms.  During cross-examination of Nelson--two days after Houlihan's counsel introduced the cooperation agreement into evidence without objection and two days before Nardone's counsel broached the idea of redaction--the latter questioned Nelson extensively about the armed robbery and drug conspiracy described in the information.  Although these questions were artfully phrased to avoid any explicit reference to Nardone's participation in those crimes, we believe that this harping on the contents of the information bolsters the district court's decision not to excuse the lack of a contemporaneous objection.  We conclude, therefore, that the court acted within its discretion in declining to relax the usual rule and in rejecting Nardone's tardy request for redaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p>G. Jury Instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants posit that the district court's charge did not impart the degree of participation required to convict a defendant of conspiracy charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1961-1969.  The RICO statute criminalizes \"conduct[ing] or participat[ing], directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [an] enterprise's affairs\" through a pattern of racketeering activity.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c).  To convey this element of the RICO offenses, Judge Young instructed the jury that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p>that by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity the specific individual accused ... conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs.  The term conduct and participate in the conduct of an enterprise includes the performance of acts, functions or duties which are related to the operation of the enterprise.  A person may be found to participate in the conduct of the enterprise even though he has no part in the management or control of the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants fault this instruction because it told the jury that a defendant could be found guilty even if he did not participate \"in the management or control of the enterprise.\"   In their view, the Court's opinion in  Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112826\"><a href=\"/opinion/112826/reves-v-ernst-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112826\"><a href=\"/opinion/112826/reves-v-ernst-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span> (1993), signifies the opposite.  But this asseveration misconstrues  Reves.   There, the Court interpreted the words \"conduct or participate\" as they appear in section 1962(c), and determined that those words require a defendant's participation in either \"the operation or management of the enterprise itself.\"   Id. at 185, 113 S.Ct. at 1173.   But because the defendant in  Reves was an outside accounting firm that had only a contractual relationship with the allegedly corrupt enterprise--it audited the books and issued financial reports, but neither controlled the enterprise nor participated in either its operation or management--RICO liability did not attach.  See id. at 186, 113 S.Ct. at 1173.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is of a distinctively different stripe.  Unlike the accountants in  Reves, who were classic \"outsiders,\" the appellants here are quintessential \"insiders,\" that is, persons whom the evidence places in the maw of the criminal activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  We have previously held that insiders who are integral to carrying out the enterprise's racketeering activities--and the appellants clearly fit that description--come within the definitional sweep of section 1962(c).

The government lodged the forfeiture count under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> and the jury found in its favor.  The property had been deeded by a third-party seller to Francis Jackson (Houlihan's uncle), and Houlihan's contention is that, because title stood in Jackson's name, the property could not be forfeited in consequence of his (Houlihan's) peccadilloes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[C]riminal forfeiture is a punishment, not a separate criminal offense.\"   Saccoccia, 58 F.3d at 783.   In such a proceeding, the government can satisfy its burden of proof by either direct or circumstantial evidence.  See id. at 782.   In this instance we conclude without serious question that a rational factfinder could determine--as this jury did--that Houlihan was the de facto owner of the house, and that it had been purchased with proceeds derived from racketeering activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Real estate agents testified that they took Houlihan and his wife, along with Jackson, on tours of the dwelling several times during 1993;  that Houlihan told them that he was \"interested\" in buying it;  that Houlihan attended the pre-sale inspection and the two closings that proved to be necessary;  and that the property was purchased entirely for cash (approximately $195,000).  And, moreover, both Houlihan and his wife were in residence at the premises when the authorities arrested Houlihan in October of 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These pieces of evidence combine to form a picture that reveals Houlihan as the actual owner of the home in Tewksbury, with Jackson serving merely as a straw.  Then, too, the evidence is reinforced by the utter absence of any proof indicating how Jackson might have acquired so large an amount of cash.  Given the totality of the circumstances, the jury was entitled to find that the house was forfeitable as a fruit of Houlihan's racketeering.  See id.  (\"Jurors, after all, are not expected to resist common-sense inferences based on the realities of human experience.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p>I.

The sole exception relates to count 20.  That count charged Fitzgerald and Houlihan, among others, with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance (cocaine) in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.  As to Fitzgerald and Houlihan, Judge Young imposed contingent sentences of life imprisonment, to take effect \"only if the sentence on count 19 [which charged a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 848] is reversed [or] otherwise dismissed.\"   Because we affirm the conviction and sentence on count 19, the contingency that Judge Young envisioned has not materialized.  Hence, we now vacate Fitzgerald's and Houlihan's convictions and sentences on count 20.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an indictment charges a defendant with participating in both a conspiracy and a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE), and if the former is used as a predicate act to prove the latter, then the conspiracy is in actuality a lesser-included offense of the CCE charge, and the defendant may not lawfully be sentenced for both crimes.

Three of their codefendants (Skinner, Lynch, and Joseph Houlihan) eventually pled guilty;  five others were granted a separate trial;  and one (William Herd) was acquitted by the same jury that convicted the three appellants</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because the government did not prove to the district court's satisfaction that Fitzgerald shared his codefendants' intent to forestall Sargent from cooperating with the police, the court ruled that Sargent's statements could not be used against Fitzgerald.  The correctness of that ruling is not before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court also published a preliminary opinion,  United States v.

This complaint strikes us as a thinly-veiled effort to rehash a discovery dispute that we discuss infra Part IV(B).  In all events, the district court heard arguments of counsel and thirty-seven days of trial testimony before deciding that the statements could be utilized.  In these circumstances, the court did not outstrip the bounds of its discretion in declining to convene a special mid-trial evidentiary hearing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We caution that a waiver of confrontation rights does not result in the automatic surrender of all evidentiary objections.  For example, a district court still should exclude relevant but highly inflammatory evidence, misconduct notwithstanding, if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the evidence's probative value.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.  Presumably, such evidence would have been excludable on a non-hearsay ground if the declarant were available to testify, so there is no reason to admit it when the defendant procures the declarant's unavailability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Perhaps the weakest link in the chain is Sargent's statement regarding a suggestive but ambiguous conversation that he had with Houlihan shortly before the killing of James Boyden III.  But this tale is relevant principally to the three counts against Houlihan on which we order his convictions reversed.  See infra Part V(B).

We can understand a district judge's reluctance, following a long, complicated, and hotly contested trial, to release alternate jurors before a verdict is obtained.  But courts, above all other institutions, must obey the rules</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> On this score,  Olano confirmed what this court anticipated.  See United States v.

There, the undischarged alternates actually stayed in the jury room during deliberations.  507 U.S. at 729-30, 113 S.Ct. at 1775-76.   Here, they did not;  indeed, the regular jurors and the undischarged alternates were never in physical proximity while the deliberative process was ongoing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> On one occasion when the regular jurors were on a mid-morning break, an alternate juror retrieved a plate of delicacies from the jury room.  Defense counsel brought this interlude to Judge Young's attention, and the judge immediately agreed to instruct the alternates to stay out of the jury room during breaks (except for retrieving snacks from the jury room when court security officers confirmed that a break in deliberations had occurred)</p>\n        <p>On another occasion defense counsel voiced suspicion that a note from the jury to the judge (requesting transcripts of several witnesses' testimony) had been written in the presence of the alternates.  At counsels' urging, Judge Young, in the course of responding to the note in open court, asked each juror whether \"the alternates and the deliberating jurors, or vice versa, [had] discussed the substance of the case\" during the pertinent time frame.  All the jurors responded in the negative, and Judge Young reinstructed the regular jurors not to discuss the case with, or deliberate in the presence of, the alternate jurors.  The defendants took no exception either to the form of the inquiry or to the instructions that the court gave.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> On the third day a regular juror had to be excused.  With counsels' consent, Judge Young replaced the lost juror with an alternate and instructed the jurors to begin deliberations anew.

In the instant case, unlike in  Cabral, there is neither proof nor reason to suspect that the undischarged alternates participated in the regular jurors' deliberations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The appellants claim that instructing agents not to take notes constitutes a deliberate strategy to manipulate the quantity of discoverable material.

At this juncture the court directed the prosecutors to disclose the summary prepared by a government attorney for the use of the officer who appeared before the grand jury</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> Respecting, as we do, the coordinate powers of the other two branches of government, we decline to issue any such blanket proscription.  See supra Part IV(A) (discussing particulars of appellants' underlying objection)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The exception relates to count 15, as to which Houlihan offers a wider-ranging sufficiency challenge.  We address that challenge separately.  See infra Part V(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Although not an element of the offense, it is pellucid that the jury easily could have believed Fitzgerald's actions vis-a-vis Sargent and Sweeney were undertaken with Houlihan's knowledge and consent.  To cite just one example, Houlihan personally paid Nardone his $5,000 \"headache elimination\" fee at Kerrigan's Flower Shop on the day after Nardone ended Sargent's life.  Further examples are unnecessary.  It suffices to say that extensive evidence pointed to the conclusion that Fitzgerald and Houlihan jointly orchestrated both Sargent's slaying and Sweeney's travails</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Indeed, when it was pointed out that a grand jury witness had testified otherwise, the government protested that the witness had made a mistake.  See supra note 19.   The grand jury testimony was not admitted at the trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> Ironically, none of the counts related to this murder bore fruit:  the jury found Herd not guilty;  the court relieved Lynch of responsibility when she pleaded guilty to other counts;  and the court granted Fitzgerald a mistrial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> The court enhanced the efficacy of the limiting instructions by insisting that all the government's evidence relating to this murder be presented compactly at the same point in the trial.  This is a salutary practice, and we commend it generally to trial courts confronted with analogous situations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> Of course, these witnesses did not emerge unscathed.  Ford and McDonald were vigorously cross-examined by counsel for the implicated defendants, Fitzgerald included</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> The witnesses in question are Veronica Boyden (the mother of James Boyden IV), Marie Boyden-Connors (his sister), and Frances Hannigan (a former owner of Kerrigan's Flower Shop)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> A few examples may assist in giving texture to this conclusion.  Veronica Boyden testified that she heard Lynch, an indicted coconspirator, threaten to call Fitzgerald if James Boyden IV continued to poach on her sales territory.  Similarly, Boyden-Connors testified that Fitzgerald himself warned her to keep her brother away from Lynch's territory.  Hannigan's testimony, overall, related more to the structure and operating practices of the Fitzgerald-Houlihan organization and less to the slaying of James Boyden IV.  By way of illustration, Hannigan testified at length about Fitzgerald's presence at Kerrigan's Flower Shop, his meetings there with other members of the conspiracy, and his daily telephone calls to Doherty from his prison cell during the period of his immurement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> As an aside, we note that there is no inkling of any prejudice stemming from this ruling.  For one thing, the jury acquitted Nardone on several counts, so it is impossible to argue convincingly that the unredacted information irretrievably poisoned the jurors against him.  For another thing, given the powerful evidentiary strands that tied Nardone tightly to two brutal murders and several other murder attempts, we doubt that the references about which he now complains could conceivably have altered the jury's verdicts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> Nardone's claim that he was an independent contractor is imaginative but unconvincing.  The evidence supports the view that Nardone was an insider.  He maintained regular contact with Fitzgerald and Houlihan throughout the duration of the conspiracy;  he obtained his armaments directly from them;  and he took orders from them.  Indeed, Nardone's description of himself as the organization's \"hit man\" and \"headache man\" belies his more recently manufactured \"independent contractor\" label</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> The appellants also claim that the district court erred by refusing to repeat its concededly correct definition of what constitutes a racketeering \"enterprise\" in its instructions to the jury on those counts that charged murder and attempted murder in aid of racketeering.  Judge Young chose instead to incorporate by reference his correct definition of a RICO enterprise (given to the jury earlier in the charge);  and, in the same vein, he specifically informed the jury that, as to all racketeering-related counts, they must find the existence of an enterprise meeting the statutory criteria as an element of each offense.  In light of the perfectly sensible course taken by the judge, the appellants' claim is unfounded.  A trial court has broad discretion to formulate jury instructions as it sees fit, as long as it touches all the bases.  See United States v. DeStefano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196179\"><a href=\"/opinion/196179/united-states-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1995).  Here, taking the charge as an integrated whole, see, e.g., United States v. Cintolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488517\"><a href=\"/opinion/488517/united-states-v-william-j-cintolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 1003 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(a)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> The district court instructed the jury that the government had the burden of proving entitlement to forfeiture beyond a reasonable doubt.  The proof here is capable of satisfying that standard.  We note, however--although we leave the question open--that the government may have conceded too much.  Compare United States v.
