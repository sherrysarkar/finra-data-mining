William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Lynne Standifird on brief pro se.\n     John J. Davis, John J. Cloherty, III, and Pierce, Davis &\nPerritano, LLP on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       October 16, 2000\n\f       Per Curiam. Plaintiff Lynne Standifird appeals pro se from\n\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendant, Town of Boxborough, on her claim pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C.      §    1983,   arising      out    of    a   traffic       stop    by   one    of\n\ndefendant’s        police      officers.       Review      of   a   district      court’s\n\nsummary judgment order is               de novo.           Soileau v.       Guilford of\n\nMaine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1997).                            Having reviewed\n\nthe    record      in    the   light    most      favorable         to    plaintiff     and\n\nresolving all reasonable inferences in her favor, we conclude,\n\nessentially for the reasons stated by the district court, that\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\ndefendant is entitled to summary judgment.\n\n       Plaintiff also appeals from the district court’s denial of\n\nher motion for default judgment to be entered against defendant\n\nfor untimely filing its notice of removal and answer to the\n\ncomplaint.        Our careful review of the record reveals that the\n\nnotice      of    removal      was    timely      filed,     measured       pursuant     to\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 6(a), within thirty days of defendant’s receipt of\n\nthe complaint. See 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b).                         Defendant filed its\n\nrequest for an enlargement of time to file a responsive pleading\n\nto    the   complaint       seven     days     after    the      time     for   filing    a\n\nresponsive        pleading      had    expired.        See      Fed.R.Civ.P.      81(c).\n\nHowever, the district court has discretion to grant such a\n\frequest for enlargement of time “where the failure to act was\n\nthe result of excusable neglect.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b).                         “The\n\ndistrict court is afforded great leeway in granting or refusing\n\nenlargements and its decisions are reviewable only for abuse of\n\nthat discretion.” Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d\n\n576, 584 (1st Cir. 1994)(citations omitted).                There was no abuse\n\nof discretion here.\n\n    Finally, plaintiff argues on appeal that the district court\n\nerred in failing to address her state-law claims.                  “As a general\n\nprinciple, the unfavorable disposition of a plaintiff’s federal\n\nclaims   at   the    early     stages      of   a   suit,   well    before   the\n\ncommencement    of    trial,      will    trigger    the    dismissal   without\n\nprejudice of any supplemental state-law claims.” Rodriguez v.\n\nDoral Mortgage Co., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir. 1995). Here,\n\nhowever, the district court’s grant of summary judgment makes no\n\nmention of any state-law claims.\n\n    At   this       stage    of   the     proceedings,      plaintiff    cannot\n\nprofitably argue that the district court ought to have remanded\n\nher case to state court because it raised no federal claims.\n\nPlaintiff has waived any such argument by asserting in her\n\nopposition to summary judgment, her motion for reconsideration,\n\nand her appellate brief that there are genuine issues of fact\n\nprecluding summary judgment in defendant’s favor on the Fourth\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fAmendment claim.\n\n    However, plaintiff may be on stronger ground with respect\n\nto her objection to the court’s failure to address her state-law\n\nclaims.   Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, consistently maintained\n\nbelow, as she does on appeal, that she seeks relief pursuant to\n\nstate law (although she has not clearly explained what her\n\nstate-law claims are).   In these circumstances, we think the\n\ndistrict court judgment ought to be without prejudice to any\n\nsupplemental state-law claims.\n\n    The judgment of the district court granting defendant’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment is modified to provide for dismissal\n\nof any state-law claims without prejudice. As modified, the\n\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f-5-\n\f",
