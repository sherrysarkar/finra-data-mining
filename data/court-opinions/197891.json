Indiano and\r\nIndiano, Williams &amp; Weinstein-Bacal, were on brief for appellee\r\nRedondo Construction Corp.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\nApril 3, 1988                   \r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Plaintiff Bethlehem Steel Export\r\nCorporation (\"Bethlehem\") seeks to recover on a construction\r\npayment bond executed by defendants Redondo Construction\r\nCorporation (\"Redondo\") and its surety, American International\r\nInsurance Company of Puerto Rico (\"American International\"),\r\npursuant to Law 388, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 22,  47 et seq., which\r\nrequires every public works contractor to post a bond to secure the\r\npayment of materials used by the general contractor and\r\nsubcontractors.\r\nRedondo, the principal contractor for the construction of\r\na portion of the Expreso de Diego, P.R. Highway 22, between\r\nBarceloneta and Manat (\"Expreso de Diego\"), Puerto Rico, paid\r\nTranscontinental Steel Company (\"Transco\") in full for steel\r\nTransco had acquired from Bethlehem.  On defendants' renewed motion\r\nfor summary judgment, the district court found that Transco was not\r\na subcontractor, but rather a mere material supplier to Redondo\r\nduring the construction of the Expreso de Diego.  Accordingly, the\r\ndistrict court determined that Bethlehem was not entitled to\r\nprotection under Law 388 for certain materials supplied to Transco. \r\nWe affirm.\r\n                I.  BACKGROUND     In October 1990, Redondo entered into a written contract\r\nwith the Puerto Rico Highway Authority for the construction of the\r\nExpreso de Diego.  Redondo and its bonding company, American\r\nInternational, executed and delivered to the Highway Authority a\r\nconstruction payment bond pursuant to Law 388, which was modeled\r\nafter the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C.  270, et seq.  Thereafter, Transco\r\nsupplied Redondo with the structural steel required for the\r\nconstruction project.  Redondo paid Transco in full for the steel. \r\nTransco had originally acquired the fabricated steel from\r\nBethlehem, but it went bankrupt and failed to pay Bethlehem for the\r\nsteel.  Bethlehem seeks payment for the steel under the bond\r\nexecuted by Redondo and American International in accordance with\r\nLaw 388.  The primary issue on appeal is whether Transco was a\r\nsubcontractor of Redondo, thus entitling Bethlehem to the\r\nprotection of Law 388, or simply a material supplier to Redondo,\r\nwhich would leave Bethlehem without recourse to the bond.\r\nPrior to filing the renewed motion for summary judgment\r\nbefore us, defendants had sought summary judgment on two different\r\noccasions, but both times Judge Juan M. Prez-Gimnez had denied\r\nthe motions.  The case was reassigned to Judge Daniel R. Domnguez\r\nand, after further discovery, the district court referred\r\ndefendants' renewed motion for summary judgment to a magistrate\r\njudge.  The magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment\r\nin favor of defendants.  The district court reached the same\r\nconclusion as the magistrate judge, although on different grounds. \r\nThe district court determined that Transco was merely a material\r\nsupplier, and hence Bethlehem was not entitled to protection under\r\nLaw 388. Bethlehem appeals.\r\n               II.  DISCUSSION     We review de novo a district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment.  See Pine Tree Med. Assoc. v. Secretary of HHS, 127 F.3d\r\n118, 120 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nA.   Definition of \"Subcontractor\" Under Law 388\r\nAs a threshold matter, we agree with the district court\r\nthat, although Law 388 was modeled after the federal Miller Act, it\r\ndiffers from the federal statute in one crucial respect:  Puerto\r\nRico's legislation, unlike the Miller Act, expressly defines the\r\nterm \"subcontractor.\"  According to the official English\r\ntranslation of Law 388, \"'subcontractor' -- includes any person or\r\npersons who, as independent contractors, do any part of the work\r\nawarded to the contractor.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 22,  58 (official\r\ntranslation).  The original Spanish version reads,\r\n\"'[s]ubcontratista' -- incluye a cualquier persona o personas que,\r\ncomo contratista independiente, ejecute cualquier parte de la obra\r\nadjudicada al contratista.\"  P.R. Law Ann. tit. 22,  58.\r\nBethlehem argues that the district court erroneously\r\nrelied on the official translation of \"ejecute cualquier parte de\r\nla obra,\" and read the phrase as \"do any part of the work.\" \r\nAccording to Bethlehem, such a reading does not comport with the\r\nmeaning of \"execute,\" the literal translation of \"ejecute,\" and of\r\n\"work\" as defined in Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990). \r\nBethlehem contends that, if the district court had adopted this\r\nintended meaning of the phrase, it would have found that Transco\r\ndid fall within Law 388's definition of subcontractor.  We reject\r\nBethlehem's argument outright.\r\nAs the district court noted, the operative word in the\r\ndefinition of subcontractor is the word \"obra,\" translated as\r\n\"work.\"  The statute explicitly defines \"work\" as \"any\r\nconstruction, reconstruction, alteration, extensions, or\r\nimprovements, made under a contract awarded to a contractor by the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 22,  58\r\n(official translation).  Thus, we need not turn to Black's Law\r\nDictionary or any other secondary source to determine the meaning\r\nof the term.  We can simply look to the definition in the statute. \r\nThe record reflects that Redondo paid Transco not only to supply\r\nthe steel, but also to unload it off the docks onto flatbed\r\ntrailers for delivery to the construction site.  Bethlehem avers\r\nthat, for logistical reasons, Transco did not unload the steel onto\r\nflatbed trucks, but rather placed it directly onto the docks. \r\nHowever, even assuming arguendo that Transco did unload the steel\r\nonto Redondo's trucks, the labor involved in completing the\r\ndelivery of construction materials is not considered \"work\" under\r\nLaw 388.  Transco did not make \"any construction, reconstruction,\r\nalteration, extensions, or improvements,\" id., under Redondo's\r\ngeneral contract with the Highway Authority.  Consequently, under\r\nLaw 388, Transco was a mere materials supplier to Redondo rather\r\nthan a subcontractor.\r\nB.   District Court's Earlier Rulings\r\nBethlehem argues that Judge Domnguez committed\r\nreversible error in failing to follow Judge Prez-Gimnez' prior\r\nrulings on Redondo and American International's motions for summary\r\njudgment.  In short, Bethlehem's contention is that the district\r\ncourt's prior rulings constitute the \"law of the case.\"  However,\r\n\"[i]n this circuit the 'law of the case' doctrine has not been\r\nconstrued as an inflexible straightjacket that invariably requires\r\nrigid compliance with the terms of the mandate.\"  Northeast Util.\r\nServ. Co. v. FERC, 55 F.3d 686, 688 (1st Cir. 1995).  We do not\r\nfind the \"law of the case\" doctrine to preclude any reconsideration\r\nof an issue already settled.  See Prez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guilln, 25\r\nF.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir. 1994).  Even if the doctrine posed an\r\nabsolute bar to reconsideration, in the instant case, the denial of\r\nthe summary judgment motions do not constitute the law of the case. \r\nSee id. (\"[i]nterlocutory orders, including denials of motions to\r\ndismiss, remain open to trial court reconsideration, and do not\r\nconstitute the law of the case\").  Accordingly, Judge Domnguez did\r\nnot err in granting appellees' renewed motion for summary judgment\r\nonce he was assigned the case.\r\n              III.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the opinion and\r\norder of the district court.\n",

Consequently, under Law 388, Transco was a mere materials supplier to Redondo rather than a subcontractor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. District Court's Earlier Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bethlehem argues that Judge Domnguez committed reversible error in failing to follow Judge Perez-Gimenez' prior rulings on Redondo and American International's motions for summary judgment.  In short, Bethlehem's contention is that the district court's prior rulings constitute the \"law of the case.\"   However, \"[i]n this circuit the 'law of the case' doctrine has not been construed as an inflexible straightjacket that invariably requires rigid compliance with the terms of the mandate.\"  Northeast Util.  Serv. Co. v. FERC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196081\"><a href=\"/opinion/196081/northeast-utilities-v-ferc/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 688 (1st Cir.1995).  We do not find the \"law of the case\" doctrine to preclude any reconsideration of an issue already settled.  See Perez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guillen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195400\"><a href=\"/opinion/195400/perez-ruiz-v-crespo-guillen/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1994).  Even if the doctrine posed an absolute bar to reconsideration, in the instant case, the denial of the summary judgment motions do not constitute the law of the case.  See id.  (\"[i]nterlocutory orders, including denials of motions to dismiss, remain open to trial court reconsideration, and do not constitute the law of the case\").  Accordingly, Judge Domnguez did not err in granting appellees' renewed motion for summary judgment once he was assigned the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the opinion and order of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
