Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n               Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n\n                 and Singal,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Nancy S.

In this case, the plaintiff, a\n\ndisappointed job-seeker, charges a failure to hire based on her\n\nrace (the plaintiff is an African-American woman).                      Finding\n\ninsufficient evidence of discrimination, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the prospective employer.\n\nSee Hawkins v. Mary Hitchcock Mem. Hosp., Civ. No. 93-113, slip\n\nop. at 17 (D.N.H. Jan 30, 2001) (unpublished).                  The plaintiff\n\nappeals.\n\n           We   often   have   commented      that   when   a       lower   court\n\naccurately takes the measure of a case, faultlessly applies the\n\nappropriate     legal   standards,      and    propounds        a    convincing\n\nrationale, \"an appellate court should refrain from writing at\n\nlength to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\"\n\nLawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); accord Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381,\n\n383 (1st Cir. 2000); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas, Local 901,\n\n74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); Holders Capital Corp. v. Cal.\n\nUnion Ins. Co. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.),\n\n989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).        This is a paradigmatic example\n\nof such an instance.     Accordingly, we uphold the judgment below\n\nfor substantially the same reasons elucidated in the district\n\ncourt's thoughtful rescript.       We add only a few comments.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            First:     The question here is not, as the plaintiff\n\nassumes, whether she might in fact have been a good prospect for\n\nemployment.     Rather, the question is whether the employer's\n\nreasons for rejecting her three successive applications for a\n\nhousekeeping    position        —   legitimate   on   their     face    —    were\n\npretextual (and, thus, capable of supporting an inference of\n\ndiscriminatory       animus).       See   Feliciano   de   la    Cruz       v.   El\n\nConquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); Smith v. F. W. Morse & Co., 76 F.3d 413, 421 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   We have carefully canvassed the record and have found a\n\ndearth of evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to\n\nduplicity on the employer's part.           A plaintiff cannot carry her\n\nburden of showing pretext merely by questioning the defendant's\n\nstated reasons for acting in a particular way.                   Hoeppner v.\n\nCrotched Mt. Rehab. Ctr., 31 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 1994); Gadson\n\nv. Concord Hosp., 966 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam);\n\nsee also Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(explaining that \"a genuine issue of material fact does not\n\nspring into being simply because a litigant claims that one\n\nexists\").\n\n            Second:     In disparate treatment \"failure to hire\"\n\ncases, plaintiffs typically complain of being treated unfairly.\n\nThis case is no exception.                But an employer can hire one\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\femployee instead of another for any reason, fair or unfair,\n\nwithout running afoul of the anti-discrimination laws so long as\n\nthe employer's stated reason is not pretextual and its choice is\n\nnot driven by race or some other protected characteristic.\n\nSmith, 76 F.3d at 422.              Here, the employer's stated reasons —\n\npoor references, an erratic work history, and the like — are\n\nlegitimate on their face, and the plaintiff's attempt to explain\n\naway those data, whether or not persuasive, does not vitiate the\n\nemployer's right to rely on them.              See Gadson, 966 F.2d at 35.\n\n              Third:     The plaintiff claims that the trial court\n\nshould have inferred racial discrimination from the fact that\n\nthe hospital had very few African-American employees (none in\n\nthe housekeeping department at the crucial time).               We disagree.\n\nWithout   a    statistical      analysis      indicating,   inter   alia,   the\n\nracial composition of the applicant pool, the mere fact that a\n\nparticular minority is not much in evidence in a given work\n\nforce proves nothing.           LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d\n\n836, 848 (1st Cir. 1993).            This is especially so where, as here,\n\nthe   plaintiff        makes   no    meaningful    connection   between     the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fstatistics, the hospital's hiring practices, and her situation.1\n\nSee LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 848; Gadson, 966 F.2d at 35.\n\n         Fourth: Although the plaintiff has identified a number\n\nof factual disputes (e.g., whether or not the unflattering\n\nreferences that the employer received were accurate), none of\n\nthose disputes were material to the dispositive issues in the\n\ncase.   See United States v. One Parcel of Real Prop. (Great\n\nHarbor Neck, New-Shoreham, R.I.), 960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (explaining that a factual dispute, to be material, must\n\nconcern a fact that carries with it the potential to affect the\n\noutcome of the suit under applicable law).   Since the only facts\n\nthat genuinely have been placed in dispute lack the capacity to\n\naffect or alter the outcome of the suit, those disputed facts\n\ncannot derail the summary judgment engine.    See Woods-Leber v.\n\nHyatt Hotels of P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 47, 49 (1st Cir. 1997);\n\nMorris v. Gov't Dev. Bank, 27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n         We need go no further.     We understand the plaintiff's\n\nfrustration at being denied an opportunity to prove herself in\n\nthe workplace — but the body of federal law that protects a job\n\napplicant against racial discrimination in employment does not\n\n\n    1Indeed, the record reveals that the plaintiff thrice\ncompleted the hospital's standard application (which was color-\nblind). On the first two occasions, the hospital rejected her\napplication without an interview and, for aught that appears,\nwithout any knowledge of her race or color.\n\n                              -6-\n\finoculate her against an employer's honest exercise of its\n\nbusiness judgment — whether or not that judgment is mistaken.\n\nSee Gadson, 966 F.2d at 34; see also Morgan v. Mass. Gen. Hosp.,\n\n901 F.2d 186, 191 (1st Cir. 1990) (explicating same principle in\n\na termination of employment case).            Because the district court\n\nrecognized    that   this     record    lacked   significantly    probative\n\nevidence from which an inference of pretext (and, thus, an\n\ninference of discrimination) plausibly could be drawn, Hawkins,\n\nslip   op.   at   17,   the    court    did   not   err   in   granting   the\n\ndefendant's motion for brevis disposition.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f",
