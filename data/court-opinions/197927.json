Jose A. Matos-Arroyo appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), of\r\nhis complaint challenging his separation from the Puerto Rico\r\nNational Guard.   We affirm, although on different grounds than\r\nthose relied upon by the district court.\r\n    \"In the Rule 12(b)(6) milieu, an appellate court operates\r\nunder the same constraints that bind the district court, that\r\nis, we may affirm a dismissal for failure to state a claim only\r\nif it clearly appears, according to the facts alleged, that the\r\nplaintiff cannot recover on any viable theory.  Conley v\r\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-48, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-03, 2 L.Ed.2d 80\r\n(1957); [The] Dartmouth Review [v. Dartmouth College], 889 F.2d\r\n[13,] 16 [(1st Cir. 1989)].  In making that critical\r\ndetermination, we accept plaintiff's well-pleaded factual\r\naverments and indulge every reasonable inference hospitable to\r\nhis case. Gooley, 851 F.2d at 514.\" Correa-Martinez v.\r\nArrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990).  \"In\r\nconducting this tamisage, we are not wedded to the district\r\ncourt's rationale, but remain free to affirm the judgment below\r\non any independently sufficient ground made manifest by the\r\nrecord.\"  Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201,\r\n204 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n    1. Claims for Monetary Relief\r\n    Matos-Arroyo seeks damages for harm resulting from\r\ndefendants' discharge of him in violation of his procedural due\r\nprocess rights under the United States Constitution.  Those\r\nclaims are non-justiciable as the alleged injuries \"'arise out\r\nof or are in the course of activity incident to service.'\"\r\nWright v. Park, 5 F.3d 586, 590 (1st Cir. 1993).  Because we\r\nhave determined that the claims for damages are non-\r\njusticiable, we need not decide whether the district court\r\nerred in ruling that the Eleventh Amendment barred those\r\nclaims.\r\n    2. Claims for Injunctive Relief in the Form of\r\nReinstatement\r\n    Matos-Arroyo also seeks relief in the form of\r\nreinstatement to his military and civilian positions.  We need\r\nnot decide whether the \"bright line rule\" adopted in Wright v.\r\nPark, 5 F.3d 586, 590 (1st Cir. 1993), applies to claims for\r\ninjunctive relief in the form of reinstatement.  In\r\nPenagaricano v. Llenza, 747 F.2d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 1984), this\r\ncourt applied an analysis first stated by the Fifth Circuit in\r\nMindes v. Seaman, 453 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1971), and found\r\nplaintiff's claims, including a claim for reinstatement in the\r\nNational Guard, to be non-justiciable.\r\n    Even if we were to apply the Mindes factors to the facts\r\nof this case, we would conclude, for essentially the same\r\nreasons given in Penagaricano, that the Mindes factors weigh in\r\nfavor of finding that Matos-Arroyo's claims for injunctive\r\nrelief are not justiciable.  See Penagaricano, 747 F.2d at 62\r\n(noting that plaintiff's procedural due process claim was\r\n\"insubstantial\" because plaintiff lacked \"a constitutionally\r\nprotected property interest in continued employment with the\r\nGuard\").  As this court has recently stated,\r\n    [t]he courts have long been reluctant to interfere\r\n    with internal military decisionmaking, including\r\n    personnel decisions.  With only rare exceptions, the\r\n    courts have taken the view that assignments within\r\n    the military structure are matters to be decided by\r\n    the military and not be the courts.  The reasons are\r\n    too obvious to need elaboration.\r\n\nTirado-Acosta v. Puerto Rico National Guard, 118 F.3d 852, 855\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    The district court's Opinion and Order dated November 14,\r\n1997, is summarily affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
