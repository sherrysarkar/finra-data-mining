The\r\n\ngovernment filed an interlocutory appeal from the suppression\r\n\norder.  We reverse.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     In late February  1992, Carmen  Picknally, an  assistant\r\n\ndistrict attorney  in Hampden County,  Massachusetts, applied\r\n\nto  the state Superior Court for a warrant, pursuant to Mass.\r\n\nGen.  Laws ch. 272,   99(F), to authorize the interception of\r\n\ntelephone  calls  to  or  from  two  specified  cellular  car\r\n\ntelephone  numbers.   The  car  telephones  in question  were\r\n\nlocated in  cars controlled  by defendant Rex  W. Cunningham,\r\n\nJr.,  and  the offenses  under  investigation  were suspected\r\n\nviolations of state anti-gambling  statutes.  Mass. Gen. Laws\r\n\nch. 271,   17.\r\n\n     A supporting 109-page affidavit by state trooper Timothy\r\n\nAlben described evidence that  Cunningham had used threats in\r\n\nattempting to  collect gambling  debts for bets  that he  had\r\n\ntaken.   The affidavit also  set forth information  from five\r\n\nconfidential   informants   about   a  large-scale   gambling\r\n\norganization  allegedly  controlled by  Cunningham, including\r\n\nspecifics as  to how the  organization worked,  the names  of\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nemployees, telephone numbers, and the location of records and\r\n\ncash.\r\n\n     On February 28, 1992,  Justice Constance Sweeney, of the\r\n\nstate Superior  Court,  issued  the  requested  warrant,  and\r\n\nsigned ancillary  orders directed  to two carriers.   Several\r\n\nincriminating calls  were intercepted between  Cunningham and\r\n\nothers and were  described in another  affidavit of Alben  in\r\n\nsupport  of a requested  extension sought by  Picknally on or\r\n\nabout March  17, 1992.  Justice Sweeney granted the requested\r\n\nextension.  Surveillance of the two telephones ended on April\r\n\n1, 1992.\r\n\n     On  April 17,  1992, Picknally  applied to  the Superior\r\n\nCourt  for  a  new  warrant,  this  time  (according  to  the\r\n\napplication's caption) \"authorizing the interception  of oral\r\n\ncommunications of  . .  . Cunningham within  an establishment\r\n\nknown as  Dillons (sic) Tavern.\"   The application identified\r\n\nDillon's  Tavern   at  a  street   address  in   Springfield,\r\n\nMassachusetts, and said that it was on property controlled by\r\n\nCunningham  and his  relatives.   Incorporating  a new  Alben\r\n\naffidavit,  the application  referred to  loansharking, Mass.\r\n\nGen.  Laws ch. 271,    49, as well  as gambling, as suspected\r\n\noffenses.\r\n\n     Although  the caption referred  to interception  of oral\r\n\ncommunications  \"within   .  . .  Dillons (sic)  Tavern,\" the\r\n\nfirst  paragraph  described  the  application as  one  for  a\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nwarrant \"to intercept certain wire  and oral communications,\"\r\n\nand there are later references to \"wiretaps\" and, separately,\r\n\nto \"oral communications  . . . within  Dillons (sic) Tavern.\"\r\n\nThe affidavit  also asked  for  authority for  Alben to  make\r\n\nsecret  entries  into Dillon's  Tavern  \"for  the purpose  of\r\n\ninstallation  and activation  of oral  interception devices.\"\r\n\nThis  application, it appears, was  a poorly edited markup of\r\n\nthe original wiretap application.\r\n\n     Immediately below Picknally's  signature was a paragraph\r\n\nsigned by the district  attorney for the county,  saying that\r\n\nhe  had reviewed the  application and affidavit  and that the\r\n\nproposed  use of  electronic  surveillance  relative  to  two\r\n\nspecified   telephone  numbers  was  consistent  with  county\r\n\npolicy.  The  two listed telephone numbers  were the cellular\r\n\ntelephone  numbers  specified  in the  original  application.\r\n\nApparently the  paragraph had  been copied from  the original\r\n\nwarrant application without change.  \r\n\n     The supporting  Alben affidavit,  this time 62  pages in\r\n\nlength  but  attaching  the   original  affidavit  as   well,\r\n\ndescribed  Cunningham's caution  in using  the telephone  and\r\n\nprovided  reasons for  believing that  Cunningham and  others\r\n\nwere using Dillon's  Tavern for meetings  in aid of  gambling\r\n\nand  loansharking.    The  affidavit  described  Cunningham's\r\n\nregular  use of  a  particular table  in  Dillon's Tavern  to\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nconduct   his  business.     It   also  explained   why  oral\r\n\ninterceptions were needed to supplement other evidence.\r\n\n     Alben's affidavit  did not contain  the confusing jumble\r\n\nof references to wiretaps and oral communications that marred\r\n\nthe  Picknally  application.     It  asked  for  approval  to\r\n\nintercept   oral   communications  within   Dillon's  Tavern,\r\n\nspecifying that interception would\r\n\n     be  limited  to  only  such   times  that  physical\r                                      \r\n     surveillances  of this  DILLONS TAVERN  and  Rex W.\r\n     CUNNINGHAM   Jr.   can   reasonable   (sic)   place\r\n     CUNNINGHAM   within   this   location    and   that\r\n     interceptions will  take place only at  or near the\r\n     particular table  within the dining area  which has\r\n     been  identified  within  this  affidavit  as being\r\n     consistently used by CUNNINGHAM or his associates.\r\n\nIt  also asked approval  to enter Dillon's  Tavern to install\r\n\ntechnical equipment to achieve the interceptions.\r\n\n     The  warrant signed  by  Justice Sweeney  had a  caption\r\n\nsimilar   to  the  application,   specifically  referring  to\r\n\ninterception   of   oral   communications;    but--like   the\r\n\napplication--the  warrant also  referred confusingly  to wire\r\n\ncommunications.   It  approved  the secret  entry to  install\r\n\nequipment, and  imposed various safeguards.   The warrant was\r\n\nextended numerous times, and assault and battery was added as\r\n\na suspected offense.  Surveillance ended on November 1, 1992.\r\n\nBy then  125 cassette  tapes had  been  accumulated and  were\r\n\nsealed by the Superior Court.\r\n\n     On April 21,  1995, a federal grand jury  in Springfield\r\n\nindicted Cunningham on RICO violations, loansharking, illegal\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\ngambling activities, and conspiracy to commit those offenses,\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    2,  892, 894, 1955,  and 1962(c) and  (d).  Co-\r\n\ndefendants Brian  Hoyle and  Thomas Ferris were  charged with\r\n\nloansharking  conspiracy.    Most  of  the  evidence  against\r\n\nCunningham,  and   all  of  the  evidence   against  the  co-\r\n\ndefendants, derived from the electronic surveillance and from\r\n\nsearches  conducted  under  state-court  issued  warrants  at\r\n\nvarious sites shortly before the surveillance terminated.\r\n\n     By  joint  motion  filed   on  December  15,  1995,  the\r\n\ndefendants moved to suppress materials acquired by electronic\r\n\nsurveillance under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and\r\n\nSafe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.    2510-20.  That statute\r\n\ngoverns  interception of  both  wire  communication and  oral\r\n\ncommunication, laying down detailed standards and procedures.\r\n\nId.        2516-18.   It  also  provides  for exclusion  from\r               \r\n\nevidence of interceptions taken  in violation of the statute.\r\n\nId.    2515.\r               \r\n\n     After a two-day evidentiary hearing, including testimony\r\n\nfrom Picknally, Alben, and  Hampden County District  Attorney\r\n\nWilliam  Bennett, the  magistrate  judge issued  a report  on\r\n\nMarch 28,  1996.  In  it, he recommended  that the motion  to\r\n\nsuppress  be allowed  as to  all electronic  interceptions of\r\n\nconversations at Dillon's Tavern.  He said that the confusion\r\n\nin  the warrant meant that  it did not  comply with statutory\r\n\nrequirements  as to specificity,   18 U.S.C.   2518(4), nor--\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nassuming a good faith  exception existed--was reliance on the\r\n\nwarrant objectively reasonable.\r\n\n     On  May  17,  1996,  the  district  court  approved  the\r\n\nmagistrate judge's recommendation.  Its analysis tracked that\r\n\nof the magistrate judge  and his rejection of a  \"good faith\"\r\n\ndefense  was adopted by cross reference.   In memoranda dated\r\n\nJune 13 and July  12, 1996, the district court  addressed two\r\n\nsuccessive  government motions for  reconsideration but stood\r\n\nby its earlier conclusion.   The government then brought  the\r\n\ncase to us by interlocutory appeal.  18 U.S.C.   3731.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     On  review  of a  suppression  order,  we defer  to  the\r\n\nfactfinder's findings  of raw fact unless  clearly erroneous,\r\n\nand we  consider issues  of law  de novo.   United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMorris,  977 F.2d  677, 680 (1st  Cir. 1992).   In  the past,\r                  \r\n\nthere  has  been  deference  accorded  to   the  factfinder's\r\n\njudgment in  applying general standards  to particular  known\r\n\nfacts;  but  the  Supreme  Court has  recently  stressed  our\r\n\nresponsibility,  in a  related Fourth  Amendment  context, to\r\n\nreview   \"mixed  questions\"  from   an  independent  vantage.\r\n\nOrnelas  v.  United States,  116  S.  Ct. 1657,  1663  (1996)\r                                      \r\n\n(reasonable suspicion and probable cause).\r\n\n     The  government  offers  two  alternative   reasons  for\r\n\nreversal.     The  first  is  its   claim  that  the  warrant\r\n\nadequately,   although   not   perfectly,   identified   oral\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\ncommunications  as  its   target--especially  since   Justice\r\n\nSweeney and Trooper Alben as executing officer knew that this\r\n\nwas its purpose.   The second argument is that  the so-called\r\n\ngood-faith exception  of United States v. Leon,  468 U.S. 897\r                                                          \r\n\n(1984),  is available  under  the statute  in  this case  and\r\n\napplies on the present facts.  \r\n\n     At the  threshold, defendants object that  neither basis\r\n\nfor appeal  was sufficiently preserved.   Because we consider\r\n\nonly the first ground  on the merits, our discussion  of this\r\n\nthreshold objection  is similarly limited.   To decipher that\r\n\nobjection, it is necessary to understand how the government's\r\n\ndefense  of  its  warrant  evolved   on  the  path  from  the\r\n\nmagistrate judge to the district court and finally to us.\r\n\n     Before the magistrate judge, the government defended its\r\n\nwarrant on the ground that, analyzing the wording  in detail,\r\n\nthe errors were  technical or clerical.   The government  did\r\n\nnot  expressly  assert that  the  personal  knowledge of  the\r\n\nauthorizing  judge and executing officer were pertinent; but,\r\n\nthe magistrate  judge touched obliquely on  the issue, saying\r\n\nthat  the government's  \"excuse\" would,  if accepted,  \"allow\r\n\nagents to  conduct searches so  long as they  understood what\r                                                        \r\n\nwas intended by the orders which their attorneys drafted  for\r                                                  \r\n\nsignatures by the court.\"\r\n\n     In  its  district  court  brief,  the  government  again\r\n\nanalyzed the  warrant's language,  arguing  that it  referred\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nseveral  times  to  interception  of oral  communications  at\r\n\nDillon's  Tavern and that no reasonable officer would read it\r\n\nto approve wiretaps, especially because no telephone  numbers\r\n\nwere listed in the  warrant.  The government did  not mention\r\n\nthe knowledge of  the judge or executing  officer; indeed, in\r\n\nits  first  petition   for  reconsideration,  the  government\r\n\ncomplained  that the  district court  had looked  \"beyond the\r\n\nfour corners of the warrant.\"\r\n\n     The government's first attempt to emphasize what Justice\r\n\nSweeney and Trooper Alben  knew at the time came  only in its\r\n\nappellate brief where, for  the first time, it also  cited to\r\n\nUnited  States v. Bonner, 808  F.2d 864 (1st  Cir. 1986), and\r                                    \r\n\nsimilar cases  making such knowledge relevant.   Whether this\r\n\nnew  emphasis is a separate  \"ground\" or merely  a new twist,\r\n\nthe   government clearly did  not offer it  below and instead\r\n\nsteered  the magistrate  judge  and district  court toward  a\r\n\nstrict linguistic analysis of the  warrant.  If these  judges\r\n\nerred, it was surely error \"invited\" by counsel.\r\n\n     But whether we should ignore Bonner  is a more difficult\r                                                    \r\n\nquestion.    The  government  sought  timely  review  of  the\r\n\nmagistrate judge's ruling, and it filed a timely appeal to us\r\n\nfrom  the district  court's ruling.   True, local  rules warn\r\n\nthat  failing to  list grounds  for reviewing  the magistrate\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\njudge's report may be fatal;1 but we do not read this warning\r\n\nto counsel  as  preventing a  reviewing  court--where  timely\r\n\nreview  is sought  at each  stage--from noticing  on its  own\r\n\narguments not developed below.\r\n\n     The  ability of  a reviewing  court to  decide the  case\r\n\nproperly  is fundamental.  Singleton v.  Wulff, 420 U.S. 106,\r                                                          \r\n\n120-21  (1976).   Indeed,  the rules  expressly preserve  our\r\n\nability  to  notice \"plain  errors\" that  affect \"substantial\r\n\nrights,\" Fed.  R. Crim. P. 52(b), especially where failure to\r\n\ndo so would work  a substantial injustice.  United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nOlano,  507  U.S. 725  (1993);  see  also  Johnson v.

The knowledge  of the state judge and\r\n\nexecuting officer is readily inferred from documents and from\r\n\ntestimony  taken  at  the  magistrate  judge  hearing,  where\r\n\ndefense  counsel cross-examined  the  witnesses.   Defendants\r\n\nhave  not pointed to any evidence lost or foregone due to the\r\n\ngovernment's tardiness in making its knowledge argument. \r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n     Turning  then to  the merits,  we face  at the  outset a\r\n\nstatutory  ban  on  use  in  court  of  the  contents  of  an\r\n\nintercepted wire or oral communication,  or \"evidence derived\r\n\ntherefrom,\"  where disclosure  would violate  Title III.   18\r\n\nU.S.C.   2515.  There is no violation if the interception was\r\n\n\"authorized  by\" Title  III.   Id.    2517.   The authorizing\r                                              \r\n\nprovisions, 18  U.S.C.    2516-18, elaborately  set forth the\r\n\ncrimes  to  be  investigated,  the  application  process  for\r\n\nauthorizing orders, and the standards to be met.\r\n\n     Pertinent  here is  18 U.S.C.    2518(4),  which governs\r\n\neach order authorizing an  interception and requires that the\r\n\norder specify five different items.  Three items (subsections\r\n\n(a), (d)  and (e)) are  not in  dispute: the identity  of the\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ntarget,  the  identity  of  the agency  and  the  authorizing\r\n\nofficial, and the  time period.   The other  two items  which\r\n\nmust be included are as follows:\r\n\n     (b) the nature  and location of  the communications\r\n     facilities  as  to  which,  or   the  place  where,\r\n     authority to intercept is granted; [and]\r\n\n     (c)  a  particular  description   of  the  type  of\r\n     communication  sought  to  be  intercepted,  and  a\r\n     statement  of the  particular offense  to which  it\r\n     relates[.]\r\n\n     The defendants invoked  both provisions; the  magistrate\r\n\njudge  and  the  district  judge focused  upon  (b),  as  the\r\n\ngovernment seeks to  do here.  In  truth, we think  that both\r\n\nprovisions  need   to  be  read  together.     Their  thrust,\r\n\ndisregarding the final clause of (c), is to identify the type\r\n\nof communication and to narrow the targeted communications by\r\n\nlocation  of \"facilities\"  (e.g.,  identifying  a  particular\r                                            \r\n\ntelephone) or \"place\" (e.g.,  where a \"bug\" is to  be located\r                                       \r\n\nto intercept oral communications).\r\n\n     In a literal sense, the warrant does describe both  type\r\n\nand place: it refers expressly  to oral communications and to\r\n\nDillon's Tavern.  But  this is an extreme example  of missing\r\n\nthe  forest for  the trees.   By  referring randomly  to oral\r\n\ncommunications  and  wire  communications  or  wiretaps,  the\r\n\nwarrant is garbled on the very questions posed by subsections\r\n\n(b) and (c).   Taken as a whole--but  taken alone and without\r\n\nextrinsic evidence--the  warrant does not tell  the objective\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nbut  ignorant  reader  just  what  interceptions  are  to  be\r\n\ntargeted.\r\n\n     Now, the extent of confusion is a matter of degree.  Any\r\n\nreader can see that the warrant has been misdrafted;  whether\r\n\na reasonable  (but otherwise uninformed) police officer would\r\n\nsolve  the   puzzle  correctly   is  probably  a   matter  of\r\n\npercentages.  In  all events, the  confusion is serious,  and\r\n\ndespite the government's linguistic acrobatics, this is not a\r\n\nwarrant  that we would  deem adequate if it  were signed by a\r\n\njudge  and  executed  by a  police  officer  having no  other\r\n\nknowledge of the background and objectives.  \r\n\n     The  inadequacy is  not because  of any  high likelihood\r\n\nthat an otherwise uninformed officer would tap a telephone or\r\n\nwould  intercept  Cunningham's  oral  communications  at some\r\n\nother  location than Dillon's.  No  telephone number is given\r\n\nin  the  body  of  the  warrant,  and  no  other  \"place\"  of\r\n\ninterception is mentioned.   Rather, standing alone, the bare\r\n\ninconsistent words  of the warrant fail  to create reasonable\r\n\nassurance  that the signer or reader would know just what was\r\n\nintended.\r\n\n     But this is not the end of the story.  The Supreme Court\r\n\nhas made clear that suppression is not automatically required\r\n\nfor every  Title III violation;  rather, as a  sister circuit\r\n\nsummed up the Supreme Court's precedents in United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nJohnson,  696 F.2d 115, 121  (D.C.

Whether\r\n\nor  not Leon's  good faith  exception should  be interpolated\r                        \r\n\ninto the statute--an issue we do not decide--Fourth Amendment\r\n\nprecedent   is  highly   relevant  in  deciding   whether  an\r\n\nauthorizing order is valid and whether a defect in wording is\r\n\nof a kind that  threatens the central interests sought  to be\r\n\nprotected.  Indeed, the Supreme  Court itself has relied upon\r\n\nFourth Amendment precedent in  implementing Title III.  Dalia\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. United States, 441 U.S. 238, 254-59 (1979).\r                            \r\n\n     A substantial body of Fourth Amendment precedent akin to\r\n\nBonner, representing most circuits, permits a reviewing court\r                  \r\n\nto consider the knowledge  of the officials who  approved the\r\n\nwarrant   and   executed   it.     The   reason   is   fairly\r\n\nstraightforward:  such knowledge  may,  on particular  facts,\r\n\nshow  that there  was in  fact no  real threat  to legitimate\r                                          \r\n\nprivacy interests.  Examples  include the judge approving the\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nwarrant but forgetting to sign, or  the warrant's omission of\r\n\nan address known both to the judge and executing officer.2\r\n\n     In calling such mistakes  \"clerical,\" courts do not mean\r\n\nthat they are all unimportant typographical errors.  What  is\r\n\nmeant  is  that  they  are  wording  mistakes  introduced  by\r\n\naccident  or  lack of  care rather  than  wilfully or  with a\r\n\nsinister  purpose.   Cases  like  Bonner  often involve,  and\r                                                    \r\n\nforgive, very serious  clerical mistakes, depending upon  the\r\n\nrisk  that they posed  in fact.   E.g., Bentley,  825 F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n1109  (personal  knowledge  of  officers  saved  warrant that\r\n\nlisted wrong  office  number).    In  this  sense,  the  term\r\n\n\"clerical\" is highly misleading.\r\n\n     Such an approach  is not  cost free.   In an  individual\r\n\ncase, a  defect may pose no threat (we will show that this is\r\n\nso here); but exclusion  of evidence in that case  will still\r\n\nmake the police more careful next  time and so may prevent  a\r\n\ndifferent  mistake that does pose  such a threat.   But there\r\n\nare  costs  either  way:   excluding  reliable  evidence  and\r\n\npossibly  freeing the guilty is also a  cost.

In\r                  \r\n\nany event, such is the law of this circuit and many others.\r\n\n     In sustaining the warrant in this case, we rely upon two\r\n\nmajor  elements.   First,  the  flaw in  this  case, although\r\n\nserious, was a discrete set of clerical mistakes in a process\r\n\nthat  in  all  other  important respects  complied  with  the\r\n\nstatute.  An application to a judge was made; it demonstrated\r\n\nprobable  cause  and other  requisites for  the interceptions\r\n\nproposed;  it  identified  place  and  type  (although  in  a\r\n\nconfusing   language);  a   warrant   was  signed;   and  the\r\n\nauthorizing judge  and executing officer knew  just what they\r\n\nwere doing. \r\n\n     Second, because the judge and the executing officer knew\r                                \r\n\nwhat  had   been  proposed  and  authorized,   there  was  no\r\n\nsubstantial   threat  that   this  officer   would  intercept\r\n\ncommunications other  than as authorized.   Thus, despite the\r\n\nseriously confusing  language, the error  here presented  far\r\n\nless of a  threat to  civil liberties than,  say, a  facially\r\n\ncoherent warrant  that mistakenly  inverted the numbers  of a\r\n\nstreet address and  was executed  by an officer  who did  not\r\n\nknow the actual address.  \r\n\n     It  is the combination of these two elements that, as in\r\n\nBonner, persuades  us that the  warrant should be  treated as\r                  \r\n\nvalid and,  as in Johnson,  that \"the  statutory purpose  [of\r                                     \r\n\nTitle III]  has been  achieved despite  the violation.\"   696\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nF.2d at 121.  And, as always, substantial compliance and risk\r\n\nfrom error are matters  of degree.  Knowledge would  not save\r\n\nthe  interception if,  for example,  Alben had  made out  the\r\n\naffidavit  but then  neglected to  present it  to a  judge to\r\n\nsecure judicial approval.  Similarly,  nothing in what we say\r\n\noffers any comfort to an officer who fails to comply with the\r\n\ntrue object of the warrant.\r\n\n     It is also worth stressing that the knowledge of Justice\r\n\nSweeney and of Trooper Alben are established by a paper-trail\r\n\nrecord that was  created before the  search.  The  affidavits\r                                           \r\n\nsubmitted  to secure the telephone taps and then to authorize\r\n\noral interceptions show beyond  serious dispute just what the\r\n\njudge  and the  executing  officer understood.   The  hearing\r\n\nrecord before the magistrate judge  does help knit the events\r\n\ntogether, but there is no threat here of  recollections being\r\n\ninvented after the event.\r\n\n     This  hard  evidence  lessens,  although  it  does   not\r\n\neliminate,   the  problems  associated  with  any  resort  to\r\n\npersonal knowledge.  But proof of  the knowledge possessed by\r\n\nthe police is the critical issue for most warrantless arrests\r                                                     \r\n\nand searches, e.g.,  Chambers v. Maroney, 399  U.S. 42, 47-48\r                                                    \r\n\n(1970); and,  of course, knowledge is  scrutinized in warrant\r\n\ncases  as well  where  (for example)  there  is a  charge  of\r\n\nfabrication or of invented information.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\n     The Supreme  Court's cases do express  a special concern\r\n\nwhere   subjective  motivation   rather  than   knowledge  is\r                                                                     \r\n\ninvolved.  Thus,  the Court has held as a  matter of law that\r\n\nmalignant motive is  irrelevant where objectively  reasonable\r\n\nconduct  is proved  to  make out  a  defense of  governmental\r\n\nqualified immunity, Anderson v.  Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641\r                                                      \r\n\n(1987), or  where  probable  cause exists  but  a  search  is\r\n\nchallenged  as pretext.  Whren  v. United States,  116 S. Ct.\r                                                            \r\n\n1769,  1774   (1996).     But  the  special   concerns  about\r\n\noverturning  reasonable conduct  because  of bad  motive have\r\n\nnothing to do with this case.  \r\n\n     One final  word on this  issue is in  order.   Where, as\r\n\nhere,  the government  seeks  to rescue  a defective  warrant\r\n\nbased partly on knowledge of the judge or officer, the burden\r\n\nis upon  it to prove such knowledge--just  as it would be the\r\n\ndefendant's  burden if  the warrant  were facially  valid but\r\n\nsought to be impugned  by proof of perjury.  It  is fortunate\r\n\nfor  the government  that  in  this  case,  the  evidence  is\r\n\noverwhelming and  available from  the existing record.   This\r\n\npiece of luck  does not  make the mishandling  of the  matter\r\n\nlook any more attractive.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n     The   defendants  advance  an   alternative  ground  for\r\n\nupholding the suppression of the Dillon's Tavern tapes.  They\r\n\nclaim  that the government failed  to comply with the sealing\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nrequirement  of  Title  III,  18 U.S.C.     2518(8)(a),  with\r\n\nrespect to the cellular phone tapes.  And, since the Dillon's\r\n\nTavern  surveillance  derived  from  this  allegedly  tainted\r                                                     \r\n\nevidence, defendants say that  it must be suppressed.   Id.  \r                                                                       \r\n\n2515.    The district  court ruled  that  the brief  delay in\r\n\nsealing was not material.\r\n\n     The statute authorizing an  interlocutory appeal from an\r\n\norder  of  suppression,  18  U.S.C.    3731,  gives  only the\r\n\ngovernment  a right  to  appeal, and  for  good reason.    If\r\n\nevidence  is suppressed,  the  government cannot  appeal  the\r\n\nsuppression  order after  trial for double  jeopardy reasons,\r\n\nwhereas the  defendant (if convicted) can  always appeal from\r\n\nthe district court's earlier refusal to suppress.\r\n\n     It is well-established that  appellate courts can uphold\r\n\na  judgment based on a ground rejected by the district court.\r\n\nThis  general  principle has  been  applied  to section  3731\r\n\nappeals.  United States v. Moody, 485  F.2d 531, 534 (3d Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1973).   But  the government  objects in  this case  that the\r\n\ndefendants'  alternative ground  would not  only  support the\r\n\norder  suppressing   the  Dillon's  Tavern  tapes   but  also\r\n\nundermine  the  different  order declining  to  suppress  the\r\n\ncellular phone  tapes.  Thus, it argues  that the alternative\r\n\nground  is   really  a  Trojan-horse  effort   to  review  an\r\n\nunappealable order.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\n     The argument is clever but unpersuasive.   The fact that\r\n\nthe  sealing issue  may have  implications for  two different\r\n\norders does not prevent us from considering that issue so far\r\n\nas it  pertains to a reviewable  order.   The  cases cited by\r\n\nthe government,  e.g., United States v.  Shameizadeh, 41 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n266, 267  (6th Cir. 1994), are  not on point.   Indeed, if we\r                                       \r\n\nthought that the suppression order were clearly valid, but on\r\n\na ground different than that  offered by the district  court,\r\n\nit would be bizarre to overturn it.\r\n\n     In this instance, however,  the magistrate judge and the\r\n\ndistrict court  amply justified their action  in treating the\r\n\nbrief  sealing  delay  as \"satisfactor[ily]  explained.\"   18\r\n\nU.S.C.    2518(8)(a).  See  United States v.  Ojeda Rios, 495\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 257,  265 (1990).  There was no bad faith by the police,\r\n\nno claim of alteration  to the tapes, and no  other prejudice\r\n\neven suggested.  Given these circumstances and the brevity of\r\n\nthe  delay, we think  no extended  discussion is  required in\r\n\nthis case.  \r\n\n     Reversed. \r                          \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n",

The government filed an interlocutory appeal from the suppression order.  We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late February 1992, Carmen Picknally, an assistant district attorney in Hampden County, Massachusetts, applied to the state Superior Court for a warrant, pursuant to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 272, &#167; 99(F), to authorize the interception of telephone calls to or from two specified cellular car telephone numbers.  The car telephones in question were located in cars controlled by defendant Rex W. Cunningham, Jr., and the offenses under investigation were suspected violations of state anti-gambling statutes.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A supporting 109-page affidavit by state trooper Timothy Alben described evidence that Cunningham had used threats in attempting to collect gambling debts for bets that he had taken.  The affidavit also set forth information from five confidential informants about a large-scale gambling organization allegedly controlled by Cunningham, including specifics as to how the organization worked, the names of employees, telephone numbers, and the location of records and cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 28, 1992, Justice Constance Sweeney, of the state Superior Court, issued the requested warrant, and signed ancillary orders directed to two carriers.  Several incriminating calls were intercepted between Cunningham and others and were described in another affidavit of Alben in support of a requested extension sought by Picknally on or about March 17, 1992.  Justice Sweeney granted the requested extension.  Surveillance of the two telephones ended on April 1, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 1992, Picknally applied to the Superior Court for a new warrant, this time (according to the application's caption) \"authorizing the interception of oral communications of ... Cunningham within an establishment known as Dillons (sic) Tavern.\"   The application identified Dillon's Tavern at a street address in Springfield, Massachusetts, and said that it was on property controlled by Cunningham and his relatives.  Incorporating a new Alben affidavit, the application referred to loansharking, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 49, as well as gambling, as suspected offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the caption referred to interception of oral communications \"within ... Dillons (sic) Tavern,\" the first paragraph described the application as one for a warrant \"to intercept certain wire and oral communications,\" and there are later references to \"wiretaps\" and, separately, to \"oral communications ... within Dillons (sic) Tavern.\"   The affidavit also asked for authority for Alben to make secret entries into Dillon's Tavern \"for the purpose of installation and activation of oral interception devices.\"   This application, it appears, was a poorly edited markup of the original wiretap application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately below Picknally's signature was a paragraph signed by the district attorney for the county, saying that he had reviewed the application and affidavit and that the proposed use of electronic surveillance relative to two specified telephone numbers was consistent with county policy.  The two listed telephone numbers were the cellular telephone numbers specified in the original application.  Apparently the paragraph had been copied from the original warrant application without change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supporting Alben affidavit, this time 62 pages in length but attaching the original affidavit as well, described Cunningham's caution in using the telephone and provided reasons for believing that Cunningham and others were using Dillon's Tavern for meetings in aid of gambling and loansharking.  The affidavit described Cunningham's regular use of a particular table in Dillon's Tavern to conduct his business.  It also explained why oral interceptions were needed to supplement other evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alben's affidavit did not contain the confusing jumble of references to wiretaps and oral communications that marred the Picknally application.  It asked for approval to intercept oral communications within Dillon's Tavern, specifying that interception would</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>be limited to only such times that physical surveillances of this DILLONS TAVERN and Rex W. CUNNINGHAM Jr. can reasonable (sic) place CUNNINGHAM within this location and that interceptions will take place only at or near the particular table within the dining area which has been identified within this affidavit as being consistently used by CUNNINGHAM or his associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also asked approval to enter Dillon's Tavern to install technical equipment to achieve the interceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The warrant signed by Justice Sweeney had a caption similar to the application, specifically referring to interception of oral communications;  but--like the application-the warrant also referred confusingly to wire communications.  It approved the secret entry to install equipment, and imposed various safeguards.  The warrant was extended numerous times, and assault and battery was added as a suspected offense.  Surveillance ended on November 1, 1992.  By then 125 cassette tapes had been accumulated and were sealed by the Superior Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 1995, a federal grand jury in Springfield indicted Cunningham on RICO violations, loansharking, illegal gambling activities, and conspiracy to commit those offenses, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 892, 894, 1955, and 1962(c) and (d).  Codefendants Brian Hoyle and Thomas Ferris were charged with loansharking conspiracy.  Most of the evidence against Cunningham, and all of the evidence against the co-defendants, derived from the electronic surveillance and from searches conducted under state-court issued warrants at various sites shortly before the surveillance terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By joint motion filed on December 15, 1995, the defendants moved to suppress materials acquired by electronic surveillance under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-20.  That statute governs interception of both wire communication and oral communication, laying down detailed standards and procedures.  Id. &#167;&#167; 2516-18.  It also provides for exclusion from evidence of interceptions taken in violation of the statute.  Id. &#167; 2515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a two-day evidentiary hearing, including testimony from Picknally, Alben, and Hampden County District Attorney William Bennett, the magistrate judge issued a report on March 28, 1996.  In it, he recommended that the motion to suppress be allowed as to all electronic interceptions of conversations at Dillon's Tavern.  He said that the confusion in the warrant meant that it did not comply with statutory requirements as to specificity, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(4), nor--assuming a good faith exception existed--was reliance on the warrant objectively reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 17, 1996, the district court approved the magistrate judge's recommendation.  Its analysis tracked that of the magistrate judge and his rejection of a \"good faith\" defense was adopted by cross reference.  In memoranda dated June 13 and July 12, 1996, the district court addressed two successive government motions for reconsideration but stood by its earlier conclusion.  The government then brought the case to us by interlocutory appeal.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review of a suppression order, we defer to the factfinder's findings of raw fact unless clearly erroneous, and we consider issues of law de novo.  United States v. Morris, 977 F.2d 677, 680 (1st Cir.1992).  In the past, there has been deference accorded to the factfinder's judgment in applying general standards to particular known facts;  but the Supreme Court has recently stressed our responsibility, in a related Fourth Amendment context, to review \"mixed questions\" from an independent vantage.  Ornelas v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (reasonable suspicion and probable cause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offers two alternative reasons for reversal.  The first is its claim that the warrant adequately, although not perfectly, identified oral communications as its target--especially since Justice Sweeney and Trooper Alben as executing officer knew that this was its purpose.  The second argument is that the so-called good-faith exception of United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), is available under the statute in this case and applies on the present facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, defendants object that neither basis for appeal was sufficiently preserved.  Because we consider only the first ground on the merits, our discussion of this threshold objection is similarly limited.  To decipher that objection, it is necessary to understand how the government's defense of its warrant evolved on the path from the magistrate judge to the district court and finally to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the magistrate judge, the government defended its warrant on the ground that, analyzing the wording in detail, the errors were technical or clerical.  The government did not expressly assert that the personal knowledge of the authorizing judge and executing officer were pertinent;  but the magistrate judge touched obliquely on the issue, saying that the government's \"excuse\" would, if accepted, \"allow agents to conduct searches so long as they understood what was intended by the orders which their attorneys drafted for signatures by the court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its district court brief, the government again analyzed the warrant's language, arguing that it referred several times to interception of oral communications at Dillon's Tavern and that no reasonable officer would read it to approve wiretaps, especially because no telephone numbers were listed in the warrant.  The government did not mention the knowledge of the judge or executing officer;  indeed, in its first petition for reconsideration, the government complained that the district court had looked \"beyond the four corners of the warrant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's first attempt to emphasize what Justice Sweeney and Trooper Alben knew at the time came only in its appellate brief where, for the first time, it also cited to United States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864 (1st Cir.1986), and similar cases making such knowledge relevant.  Whether this new emphasis is a separate \"ground\" or merely a new twist, the government clearly did not offer it below and instead steered the magistrate judge and district court toward a strict linguistic analysis of the warrant.  If these judges erred, it was surely error \"invited\" by counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But whether we should ignore Bonner is a more difficult question.  The government sought timely review of the magistrate judge's ruling, and it filed a timely appeal to us from the district court's ruling.  True, local rules warn that failing to list grounds for reviewing the magistrate judge's report may be fatal;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  but we do not read this warning to counsel as preventing a reviewing court--where timely review is sought at each stage--from noticing on its own arguments not developed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ability of a reviewing court to decide the case properly is fundamental.  Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120-21, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2877-78, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976).  Indeed, the rules expressly preserve our ability to notice \"plain errors\" that affect \"substantial rights,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), especially where failure to do so would work a substantial injustice.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993);  see also Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).  The threat of substantial injustice is not limited to the interests of defendants.  United States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289, 292 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Bonner and similar decisions show that the issue of knowledge is not wholly distinct from the claim of clerical error;  whether an error is forgiven as clerical depends, at least in some situations, on whether in context it actually threatened privacy interests;  and this in turn may be affected by the executing officers' knowledge.  The Bonner argument is not intuitively evident;  but it is \"plain\" enough once the cases are consulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A final reason for refusing to cabin the analysis here is that the defendants are not prejudiced, because their ability to meet the government's Bonner argument is not affected by the delay.  The knowledge of the state judge and executing officer is readily inferred from documents and from testimony taken at the magistrate judge hearing, where defense counsel cross-examined the witnesses.  Defendants have not pointed to any evidence lost or foregone due to the government's tardiness in making its knowledge argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning then to the merits, we face at the outset a statutory ban on use in court of the contents of an intercepted wire or oral communication, or \"evidence derived therefrom,\" where disclosure would violate Title III. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2515.  There is no violation if the interception was \"authorized by\" Title III.  Id. &#167; 2517.  The authorizing provisions, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2516-18, elaborately set forth the crimes to be investigated, the application process for authorizing orders, and the standards to be met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pertinent here is 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(4), which governs each order authorizing an interception and requires that the order specify five different items.  Three items (subsections (a), (d) and (e)) are not in dispute:  the identity of the target, the identity of the agency and the authorizing official, and the time period.  The other two items which must be included are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>(b) the nature and location of the communications facilities as to which, or the place where, authority to intercept is granted;  [and]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>(c) a particular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense to which it relates[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants invoked both provisions;  the magistrate judge and the district judge focused upon (b), as the government seeks to do here.  In truth, we think that both provisions need to be read together.  Their thrust, disregarding the final clause of (c), is to identify the type of communication and to narrow the targeted communications by location of \"facilities\" (e.g., identifying a particular telephone) or \"place\" (e.g., where a \"bug\" is to be located to intercept oral communications).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a literal sense, the warrant does describe both type and place:  it refers expressly to oral communications and to Dillon's Tavern.  But this is an extreme example of missing the forest for the trees.  By referring randomly to oral communications and wire communications or wiretaps, the warrant is garbled on the very questions posed by subsections (b) and (c).  Taken as a whole--but taken alone and without extrinsic evidence--the warrant does not tell the objective but ignorant reader just what interceptions are to be targeted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the extent of confusion is a matter of degree.  Any reader can see that the warrant has been misdrafted;  whether a reasonable (but otherwise uninformed) police officer would solve the puzzle correctly is probably a matter of percentages.  In all events, the confusion is serious, and despite the government's linguistic acrobatics, this is not a warrant that we would deem adequate if it were signed by a judge and executed by a police officer having no other knowledge of the background and objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inadequacy is not because of any high likelihood that an otherwise uninformed officer would tap a telephone or would intercept Cunningham's oral communications at some other location than Dillon's.  No telephone number is given in the body of the warrant, and no other \"place\" of interception is mentioned.  Rather, standing alone, the bare inconsistent words of the warrant fail to create reasonable assurance that the signer or reader would know just what was intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this is not the end of the story.  The Supreme Court has made clear that suppression is not automatically required for every Title III violation;  rather, as a sister circuit summed up the Supreme Court's precedents in United States v. Johnson, 696 F.2d 115, 121 (D.C.Cir.1982), \"violations of even ... central requirements do not mandate suppression if the government demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the statutory purpose has been achieved despite the violation.\"   See also United States v. Donovan, 429 U.S. 413, 433-34, 97 S.Ct. 658, 671, 50 L.Ed.2d 652 (1977);  United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, 574-75, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 1855-56, 40 L.Ed.2d 380 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title III is designed to protect privacy interests similar to those reflected in the Fourth Amendment.  Whether or not Leon 's good faith exception should be interpolated into the statute--an issue we do not decide--Fourth Amendment precedent is highly relevant in deciding whether an authorizing order is valid and whether a defect in wording is of a kind that threatens the central interests sought to be protected.  Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has relied upon Fourth Amendment precedent in implementing Title III.  Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238, 254-59, 99 S.Ct. 1682, 1691-95, 60 L.Ed.2d 177 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A substantial body of Fourth Amendment precedent akin to Bonner, representing most circuits, permits a reviewing court to consider the knowledge of the officials who approved the warrant and executed it.  The reason is fairly straightforward:  such knowledge may, on particular facts, show that there was in fact no real threat to legitimate privacy interests.  Examples include the judge approving the warrant but forgetting to sign, or the warrant's omission of an address known both to the judge and executing officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In calling such mistakes \"clerical,\" courts do not mean that they are all unimportant typographical errors.  What is meant is that they are wording mistakes introduced by accident or lack of care rather than wilfully or with a sinister purpose.  Cases like Bonner often involve, and forgive, very serious clerical mistakes, depending upon the risk that they posed in fact.  E.g., Bentley, 825 F.2d at 1109 (personal knowledge of officers saved warrant that listed wrong office number).  In this sense, the term \"clerical\" is highly misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an approach is not cost free.  In an individual case, a defect may pose no threat (we will show that this is so here);  but exclusion of evidence in that case will still make the police more careful next time and so may prevent a different mistake that does pose such a threat.  But there are costs either way:  excluding reliable evidence and possibly freeing the guilty is also a cost.  And cases like Bonner represent a balance between competing objectives.  In any event, such is the law of this circuit and many others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sustaining the warrant in this case, we rely upon two major elements.  First, the flaw in this case, although serious, was a discrete set of clerical mistakes in a process that in all other important respects complied with the statute.  An application to a judge was made;  it demonstrated probable cause and other requisites for the interceptions proposed;  it identified place and type (although in a confusing language);  a warrant was signed;  and the authorizing judge and executing officer knew just what they were doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, because the judge and the executing officer knew what had been proposed and authorized, there was no substantial threat that this officer would intercept communications other than as authorized.  Thus, despite the seriously confusing language, the error here presented far less of a threat to civil liberties than, say, a facially coherent warrant that mistakenly inverted the numbers of a street address and was executed by an officer who did not know the actual address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the combination of these two elements that, as in Bonner, persuades us that the warrant should be treated as valid and, as in Johnson, that \"the statutory purpose [of Title III] has been achieved despite the violation.\" 696 F.2d at 121.   And, as always, substantial compliance and risk from error are matters of degree.  Knowledge would not save the interception if, for example, Alben had made out the affidavit but then neglected to present it to a judge to secure judicial approval.  Similarly, nothing in what we say offers any comfort to an officer who fails to comply with the true object of the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also worth stressing that the knowledge of Justice Sweeney and of Trooper Alben are established by a paper-trail record that was created before the search.  The affidavits submitted to secure the telephone taps and then to authorize oral interceptions show beyond serious dispute just what the judge and the executing officer understood.  The hearing record before the magistrate judge does help knit the events together, but there is no threat here of recollections being invented after the event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This hard evidence lessens, although it does not eliminate, the problems associated with any resort to personal knowledge.  But proof of the knowledge possessed by the police is the critical issue for most warrantless arrests and searches, e.g., Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 47-48, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1979-80, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970);  and, of course, knowledge is scrutinized in warrant cases as well where (for example) there is a charge of fabrication or of invented information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's cases do express a special concern where subjective motivation rather than knowledge is involved.  Thus, the Court has held as a matter of law that malignant motive is irrelevant where objectively reasonable conduct is proved to make out a defense of governmental qualified immunity, Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987), or where probable cause exists but a search is challenged as pretext.  Whren v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).  But the special concerns about overturning reasonable conduct because of bad motive have nothing to do with this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final word on this issue is in order.  Where, as here, the government seeks to rescue a defective warrant based partly on knowledge of the judge or officer, the burden is upon it to prove such knowledge--just as it would be the defendant's burden if the warrant were facially valid but sought to be impugned by proof of perjury.  It is fortunate for the government that in this case, the evidence is overwhelming and available from the existing record.  This piece of luck does not make the mishandling of the matter look any more attractive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants advance an alternative ground for upholding the suppression of the Dillon's Tavern tapes.  They claim that the government failed to comply with the sealing requirement of Title III, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(8)(a), with respect to the cellular phone tapes.  And, since the Dillon's Tavern surveillance derived from this allegedly tainted evidence, defendants say that it must be suppressed.  Id. &#167; 2515.  The district court ruled that the brief delay in sealing was not material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute authorizing an interlocutory appeal from an order of suppression, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731, gives only the government a right to appeal, and for good reason.  If evidence is suppressed, the government cannot appeal the suppression order after trial for double jeopardy reasons, whereas the defendant (if convicted) can always appeal from the district court's earlier refusal to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that appellate courts can uphold a judgment based on a ground rejected by the district court.  This general principle has been applied to section 3731 appeals.  United States v. Moody, 485 F.2d 531, 534 (3d Cir.1973).  But the government objects in this case that the defendants' alternative ground would not only support the order suppressing the Dillon's Tavern tapes but also undermine the different order declining to suppress the cellular phone tapes.  Thus, it argues that the alternative ground is really a Trojan horse effort to review an unappealable order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument is clever but unpersuasive.  The fact that the sealing issue may have implications for two different orders does not prevent us from considering that issue so far as it pertains to a reviewable order.  The cases cited by the government, e.g., United States v. Shameizadeh, 41 F.3d 266, 267 (6th Cir.1994), are not on point.  Indeed, if we thought that the suppression order were clearly valid, but on a ground different than that offered by the district court, it would be bizarre to overturn it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, however, the magistrate judge and the district court amply justified their action in treating the brief sealing delay as \"satisfactor[ily] explained.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(8)(a).  See United States v. Ojeda Rios, 495 U.S. 257, 265, 110 S.Ct. 1845, 1850, 109 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990).  There was no bad faith by the police, no claim of alteration to the tapes, and no other prejudice even suggested.  Given these circumstances and the brevity of the delay, we think no extended discussion is required in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Compare Rule 3(b), Rules for U.S. Magistrates in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts with Thomas v.

Gen. Laws ch. 272, &#167; 99(F), to authorize the interception of telephone calls to or from two specified cellular car telephone numbers.  The car telephones in question were located in cars controlled by defendant Rex W. Cunningham, Jr., and the offenses under investigation were suspected violations of state anti-gambling statutes.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A supporting 109-page affidavit by state trooper Timothy Alben described evidence that Cunningham had used threats in attempting to collect gambling debts for bets that he had taken.  The affidavit also set forth information from five confidential informants about a large-scale gambling organization allegedly controlled by Cunningham, including specifics as to how the organization worked, the names of employees, telephone numbers, and the location of records and cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 28, 1992, Justice Constance Sweeney, of the state Superior Court, issued the requested warrant, and signed ancillary orders directed to two carriers.  Several incriminating calls were intercepted between Cunningham and others and were described in another affidavit of Alben in support of a requested extension sought by Picknally on or about March 17, 1992.  Justice Sweeney granted the requested extension.  Surveillance of the two telephones ended on April 1, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 1992, Picknally applied to the Superior Court for a new warrant, this time (according to the application's caption) \"authorizing the interception of oral communications of ... Cunningham within an establishment known as Dillons (sic) Tavern.\"   The application identified Dillon's Tavern at a street address in Springfield, Massachusetts, and said that it was on property controlled by Cunningham and his relatives.  Incorporating a new Alben affidavit, the application referred to loansharking, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 271, &#167; 49, as well as gambling, as suspected offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the caption referred to interception of oral communications \"within ... Dillons (sic) Tavern,\" the first paragraph described the application as one for a warrant \"to intercept certain wire and oral communications,\" and there are later references to \"wiretaps\" and, separately, to \"oral communications ... within Dillons (sic) Tavern.\"   The affidavit also asked for authority for Alben to make secret entries into Dillon's Tavern \"for the purpose of installation and activation of oral interception devices.\"   This application, it appears, was a poorly edited markup of the original wiretap application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately below Picknally's signature was a paragraph signed by the district attorney for the county, saying that he had reviewed the application and affidavit and that the proposed use of electronic surveillance relative to two specified telephone numbers was consistent with county policy.  The two listed telephone numbers were the cellular telephone numbers specified in the original application.  Apparently the paragraph had been copied from the original warrant application without change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supporting Alben affidavit, this time 62 pages in length but attaching the original affidavit as well, described Cunningham's caution in using the telephone and provided reasons for believing that Cunningham and others were using Dillon's Tavern for meetings in aid of gambling and loansharking.  The affidavit described Cunningham's regular use of a particular table in Dillon's Tavern to conduct his business.  It also explained why oral interceptions were needed to supplement other evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alben's affidavit did not contain the confusing jumble of references to wiretaps and oral communications that marred the Picknally application.  It asked for approval to intercept oral communications within Dillon's Tavern, specifying that interception would</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>be limited to only such times that physical surveillances of this DILLONS TAVERN and Rex W. CUNNINGHAM Jr. can reasonable (sic) place CUNNINGHAM within this location and that interceptions will take place only at or near the particular table within the dining area which has been identified within this affidavit as being consistently used by CUNNINGHAM or his associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also asked approval to enter Dillon's Tavern to install technical equipment to achieve the interceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The warrant signed by Justice Sweeney had a caption similar to the application, specifically referring to interception of oral communications;  but--like the application-the warrant also referred confusingly to wire communications.  It approved the secret entry to install equipment, and imposed various safeguards.  The warrant was extended numerous times, and assault and battery was added as a suspected offense.  Surveillance ended on November 1, 1992.  By then 125 cassette tapes had been accumulated and were sealed by the Superior Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 1995, a federal grand jury in Springfield indicted Cunningham on RICO violations, loansharking, illegal gambling activities, and conspiracy to commit those offenses, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 892, 894, 1955, and 1962(c) and (d).  Codefendants Brian Hoyle and Thomas Ferris were charged with loansharking conspiracy.  Most of the evidence against Cunningham, and all of the evidence against the co-defendants, derived from the electronic surveillance and from searches conducted under state-court issued warrants at various sites shortly before the surveillance terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By joint motion filed on December 15, 1995, the defendants moved to suppress materials acquired by electronic surveillance under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-20.  That statute governs interception of both wire communication and oral communication, laying down detailed standards and procedures.  Id. &#167;&#167; 2516-18.  It also provides for exclusion from evidence of interceptions taken in violation of the statute.  Id. &#167; 2515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a two-day evidentiary hearing, including testimony from Picknally, Alben, and Hampden County District Attorney William Bennett, the magistrate judge issued a report on March 28, 1996.  In it, he recommended that the motion to suppress be allowed as to all electronic interceptions of conversations at Dillon's Tavern.  He said that the confusion in the warrant meant that it did not comply with statutory requirements as to specificity, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(4), nor--assuming a good faith exception existed--was reliance on the warrant objectively reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 17, 1996, the district court approved the magistrate judge's recommendation.  Its analysis tracked that of the magistrate judge and his rejection of a \"good faith\" defense was adopted by cross reference.  In memoranda dated June 13 and July 12, 1996, the district court addressed two successive government motions for reconsideration but stood by its earlier conclusion.  The government then brought the case to us by interlocutory appeal.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review of a suppression order, we defer to the factfinder's findings of raw fact unless clearly erroneous, and we consider issues of law de novo.

In the past, there has been deference accorded to the factfinder's judgment in applying general standards to particular known facts;  but the Supreme Court has recently stressed our responsibility, in a related Fourth Amendment context, to review \"mixed questions\" from an independent vantage.  Ornelas v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The first is its claim that the warrant adequately, although not perfectly, identified oral communications as its target--especially since Justice Sweeney and Trooper Alben as executing officer knew that this was its purpose.  The second argument is that the so-called good-faith exception of United States v. Leon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because we consider only the first ground on the merits, our discussion of this threshold objection is similarly limited.  To decipher that objection, it is necessary to understand how the government's defense of its warrant evolved on the path from the magistrate judge to the district court and finally to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the magistrate judge, the government defended its warrant on the ground that, analyzing the wording in detail, the errors were technical or clerical.  The government did not expressly assert that the personal knowledge of the authorizing judge and executing officer were pertinent;  but the magistrate judge touched obliquely on the issue, saying that the government's \"excuse\" would, if accepted, \"allow agents to conduct searches so long as they understood what was intended by the orders which their attorneys drafted for signatures by the court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its district court brief, the government again analyzed the warrant's language, arguing that it referred several times to interception of oral communications at Dillon's Tavern and that no reasonable officer would read it to approve wiretaps, especially because no telephone numbers were listed in the warrant.  The government did not mention the knowledge of the judge or executing officer;  indeed, in its first petition for reconsideration, the government complained that the district court had looked \"beyond the four corners of the warrant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's first attempt to emphasize what Justice Sweeney and Trooper Alben knew at the time came only in its appellate brief where, for the first time, it also cited to United States v. Bonner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481318\"><a href=\"/opinion/481318/united-states-v-russell-bonner-united-states-of-america-v-wayne-bonner/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1986), and similar cases making such knowledge relevant.  Whether this new emphasis is a separate \"ground\" or merely a new twist, the government clearly did not offer it below and instead steered the magistrate judge and district court toward a strict linguistic analysis of the warrant.  If these judges erred, it was surely error \"invited\" by counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But whether we should ignore Bonner is a more difficult question.  The government sought timely review of the magistrate judge's ruling, and it filed a timely appeal to us from the district court's ruling.  True, local rules warn that failing to list grounds for reviewing the magistrate judge's report may be fatal;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  but we do not read this warning to counsel as preventing a reviewing court--where timely review is sought at each stage--from noticing on its own arguments not developed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ability of a reviewing court to decide the case properly is fundamental.  Singleton v. Wulff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109530\"><a href=\"/opinion/109530/singleton-v-wulff/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 120-21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109530\"><a href=\"/opinion/109530/singleton-v-wulff/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Bonner argument is not intuitively evident;  but it is \"plain\" enough once the cases are consulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A final reason for refusing to cabin the analysis here is that the defendants are not prejudiced, because their ability to meet the government's Bonner argument is not affected by the delay.  The knowledge of the state judge and executing officer is readily inferred from documents and from testimony taken at the magistrate judge hearing, where defense counsel cross-examined the witnesses.  Defendants have not pointed to any evidence lost or foregone due to the government's tardiness in making its knowledge argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning then to the merits, we face at the outset a statutory ban on use in court of the contents of an intercepted wire or oral communication, or \"evidence derived therefrom,\" where disclosure would violate Title III. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2515.  There is no violation if the interception was \"authorized by\" Title III.  Id. &#167; 2517.  The authorizing provisions, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2516-18, elaborately set forth the crimes to be investigated, the application process for authorizing orders, and the standards to be met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pertinent here is 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(4), which governs each order authorizing an interception and requires that the order specify five different items.  Three items (subsections (a), (d) and (e)) are not in dispute:  the identity of the target, the identity of the agency and the authorizing official, and the time period.  The other two items which must be included are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>(b) the nature and location of the communications facilities as to which, or the place where, authority to intercept is granted;  [and]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>(c) a particular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense to which it relates[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants invoked both provisions;  the magistrate judge and the district judge focused upon (b), as the government seeks to do here.  In truth, we think that both provisions need to be read together.  Their thrust, disregarding the final clause of (c), is to identify the type of communication and to narrow the targeted communications by location of \"facilities\" (e.g., identifying a particular telephone) or \"place\" (e.g., where a \"bug\" is to be located to intercept oral communications).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a literal sense, the warrant does describe both type and place:  it refers expressly to oral communications and to Dillon's Tavern.  But this is an extreme example of missing the forest for the trees.  By referring randomly to oral communications and wire communications or wiretaps, the warrant is garbled on the very questions posed by subsections (b) and (c).  Taken as a whole--but taken alone and without extrinsic evidence--the warrant does not tell the objective but ignorant reader just what interceptions are to be targeted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the extent of confusion is a matter of degree.  Any reader can see that the warrant has been misdrafted;  whether a reasonable (but otherwise uninformed) police officer would solve the puzzle correctly is probably a matter of percentages.  In all events, the confusion is serious, and despite the government's linguistic acrobatics, this is not a warrant that we would deem adequate if it were signed by a judge and executed by a police officer having no other knowledge of the background and objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inadequacy is not because of any high likelihood that an otherwise uninformed officer would tap a telephone or would intercept Cunningham's oral communications at some other location than Dillon's.  No telephone number is given in the body of the warrant, and no other \"place\" of interception is mentioned.  Rather, standing alone, the bare inconsistent words of the warrant fail to create reasonable assurance that the signer or reader would know just what was intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this is not the end of the story.  The Supreme Court has made clear that suppression is not automatically required for every Title III violation;  rather, as a sister circuit summed up the Supreme Court's precedents in United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411998\"><a href=\"/opinion/411998/united-states-v-gerald-f-johnson-united-states-of-america-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 121 (D.C.Cir.1982), \"violations of even ... central requirements do not mandate suppression if the government demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the statutory purpose has been achieved despite the violation.\"   See also United States v.

Whether or not Leon 's good faith exception should be interpolated into the statute--an issue we do not decide--Fourth Amendment precedent is highly relevant in deciding whether an authorizing order is valid and whether a defect in wording is of a kind that threatens the central interests sought to be protected.  Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has relied upon Fourth Amendment precedent in implementing Title III.  Dalia v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110061\"><a href=\"/opinion/110061/dalia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 254-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110061\"><a href=\"/opinion/110061/dalia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A substantial body of Fourth Amendment precedent akin to Bonner, representing most circuits, permits a reviewing court to consider the knowledge of the officials who approved the warrant and executed it.  The reason is fairly straightforward:  such knowledge may, on particular facts, show that there was in fact no real threat to legitimate privacy interests.  Examples include the judge approving the warrant but forgetting to sign, or the warrant's omission of an address known both to the judge and executing officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In calling such mistakes \"clerical,\" courts do not mean that they are all unimportant typographical errors.  What is meant is that they are wording mistakes introduced by accident or lack of care rather than wilfully or with a sinister purpose.  Cases like Bonner often involve, and forgive, very serious clerical mistakes, depending upon the risk that they posed in fact.  E.g., Bentley, 825 F.2d at 1109 (personal knowledge of officers saved warrant that listed wrong office number).  In this sense, the term \"clerical\" is highly misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an approach is not cost free.  In an individual case, a defect may pose no threat (we will show that this is so here);  but exclusion of evidence in that case will still make the police more careful next time and so may prevent a different mistake that does pose such a threat.  But there are costs either way:  excluding reliable evidence and possibly freeing the guilty is also a cost.  And cases like Bonner represent a balance between competing objectives.  In any event, such is the law of this circuit and many others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sustaining the warrant in this case, we rely upon two major elements.  First, the flaw in this case, although serious, was a discrete set of clerical mistakes in a process that in all other important respects complied with the statute.  An application to a judge was made;  it demonstrated probable cause and other requisites for the interceptions proposed;  it identified place and type (although in a confusing language);  a warrant was signed;  and the authorizing judge and executing officer knew just what they were doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, because the judge and the executing officer knew what had been proposed and authorized, there was no substantial threat that this officer would intercept communications other than as authorized.  Thus, despite the seriously confusing language, the error here presented far less of a threat to civil liberties than, say, a facially coherent warrant that mistakenly inverted the numbers of a street address and was executed by an officer who did not know the actual address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the combination of these two elements that, as in Bonner, persuades us that the warrant should be treated as valid and, as in Johnson, that \"the statutory purpose [of Title III] has been achieved despite the violation.\" 696 F.2d at 121.   And, as always, substantial compliance and risk from error are matters of degree.  Knowledge would not save the interception if, for example, Alben had made out the affidavit but then neglected to present it to a judge to secure judicial approval.  Similarly, nothing in what we say offers any comfort to an officer who fails to comply with the true object of the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also worth stressing that the knowledge of Justice Sweeney and of Trooper Alben are established by a paper-trail record that was created before the search.  The affidavits submitted to secure the telephone taps and then to authorize oral interceptions show beyond serious dispute just what the judge and the executing officer understood.  The hearing record before the magistrate judge does help knit the events together, but there is no threat here of recollections being invented after the event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This hard evidence lessens, although it does not eliminate, the problems associated with any resort to personal knowledge.  But proof of the knowledge possessed by the police is the critical issue for most warrantless arrests and searches, e.g., Chambers v. Maroney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108184\"><a href=\"/opinion/108184/chambers-v-maroney/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 47-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108184\"><a href=\"/opinion/108184/chambers-v-maroney/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span> (1970);  and, of course, knowledge is scrutinized in warrant cases as well where (for example) there is a charge of fabrication or of invented information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's cases do express a special concern where subjective motivation rather than knowledge is involved.  Thus, the Court has held as a matter of law that malignant motive is irrelevant where objectively reasonable conduct is proved to make out a defense of governmental qualified immunity, Anderson v. Creighton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 641, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span> (1987), or where probable cause exists but a search is challenged as pretext.  Whren v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118036\"><a href=\"/opinion/118036/whren-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But the special concerns about overturning reasonable conduct because of bad motive have nothing to do with this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final word on this issue is in order.  Where, as here, the government seeks to rescue a defective warrant based partly on knowledge of the judge or officer, the burden is upon it to prove such knowledge--just as it would be the defendant's burden if the warrant were facially valid but sought to be impugned by proof of perjury.  It is fortunate for the government that in this case, the evidence is overwhelming and available from the existing record.  This piece of luck does not make the mishandling of the matter look any more attractive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants advance an alternative ground for upholding the suppression of the Dillon's Tavern tapes.  They claim that the government failed to comply with the sealing requirement of Title III, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(8)(a), with respect to the cellular phone tapes.  And, since the Dillon's Tavern surveillance derived from this allegedly tainted evidence, defendants say that it must be suppressed.  Id. &#167; 2515.  The district court ruled that the brief delay in sealing was not material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute authorizing an interlocutory appeal from an order of suppression, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731, gives only the government a right to appeal, and for good reason.  If evidence is suppressed, the government cannot appeal the suppression order after trial for double jeopardy reasons, whereas the defendant (if convicted) can always appeal from the district court's earlier refusal to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that appellate courts can uphold a judgment based on a ground rejected by the district court.  This general principle has been applied to section 3731 appeals.  United States v. Moody, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"313672\"><a href=\"/opinion/313672/united-states-v-jasper-junior-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 534 (3d Cir.1973).  But the government objects in this case that the defendants' alternative ground would not only support the order suppressing the Dillon's Tavern tapes but also undermine the different order declining to suppress the cellular phone tapes.  Thus, it argues that the alternative ground is really a Trojan horse effort to review an unappealable order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument is clever but unpersuasive.  The fact that the sealing issue may have implications for two different orders does not prevent us from considering that issue so far as it pertains to a reviewable order.  The cases cited by the government, e.g., United States v. Shameizadeh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683181\"><a href=\"/opinion/683181/united-states-of-america-cross-appellee-v-ali-shameizadeh-aka-ali/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 267 (6th Cir.1994), are not on point.  Indeed, if we thought that the suppression order were clearly valid, but on a ground different than that offered by the district court, it would be bizarre to overturn it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, however, the magistrate judge and the district court amply justified their action in treating the brief sealing delay as \"satisfactor[ily] explained.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(8)(a).  See United States v. Ojeda Rios, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112421\"><a href=\"/opinion/112421/united-states-v-ojeda-rios/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 265, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112421\"><a href=\"/opinion/112421/united-states-v-ojeda-rios/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
