CIGNA Fire\r\n\nInsurance   Company   (\"CIGNA\")    is   a   large   insurance\r\n\nconglomerate.    MacDonald &amp;  Johnson,  Inc.,  (\"M&amp;J\") is  an\r\n\nindependent  insurance  agent  that sold,  inter  alia, CIGNA\r                                                                  \r\n\ninsurance.   CIGNA sued M&amp;J  for breach of  contract alleging\r\n\nfailure  to  remit insurance  premiums due  it  by M&amp;J.   M&amp;J\r\n\nbrought  a  counterclaim against  CIGNA  alleging:  breach of\r\n\ncontract;    intentional   interference    with   contractual\r\n\nrelations; intentional interference  with economic gain;  and\r\n\nviolation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A,   11, and 93A generally.\r\n\n          After a four-day trial,  the jury returned  special\r\n\nverdicts:\r\n\n          Judgment for the defendant on plaintiffs'\r\n          claim of breach of contract.\r\n\n          Judgment  for  the defendant  against the\r\n          plaintiffs  on its  counterclaim alleging\r\n          breach of contract  with damages  awarded\r\n          in the amount of $780,000.00.\r\n\n          Judgment  for  the defendant  against the\r\n          plaintiffs  on its  counterclaim alleging\r\n          interference  with  contractual relations\r\n          with  damages awarded  in  the amount  of\r\n          $500,000.00.\r\n\nAdding   interest,   the  total   award   to   M&amp;J  came   to\r\n\n$1,544,106.73.       The  district court  found  for  CIGNA on\r\n\nM&amp;J's claimed violations of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A.\r\n\n          After a  hearing, the district court  set aside the\r\n\njury verdict and ordered a new trial.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          After another four-day trial the  second jury found\r\n\nin  favor of  M&amp;J and  awarded it  damages  in the  amount of\r\n\n$250,000.00. Judgment  for M&amp;J, including  interest, came  to\r\n\n$321,333.28.  Early in the second trial, the district  judge,\r\n\nbased on a  stipulation by  the parties, ruled  that M&amp;J  had\r\n\nbreached  its contract  with  CIGNA and  that the  amount due\r\n\nCIGNA was $169,798.14.  Adding interest to this resulted in a\r\n\njudgment  for CIGNA  in the  sum of  $219,888.60.   The judge\r\n\ndenied both parties' post-trial motions.\r\n\n          Before starting our exposition of the evidence  and\r\n\nanalysis  of the issues, we state the standard of review that\r\n\ncontrols our  assessment of the district  court's decision to\r\n\nset aside  the jury  verdicts and  order a new  trial in  the\r\n\nfirst case and decline to do so the second time around.  Fed.\r\n\nR. Civ. P. 59(a) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n             (a)    Grounds.

See,\r                                                              \r\n          e.g., Lama v.  Borras, 16  F.3d 473,  477\r                                           \r\n          (1st Cir. 1994).

L. ch. 175,   163.  \r\n\n                Submission of M&amp;J's Breach of\r                            Submission of M&amp;J's Breach of\r                                                         \r\n                  Contract Claim to the Jury\r                              Contract Claim to the Jury\r                                                        \r\n\n          The  question,  of  course, is  whether  there  was\r\n\nsufficient evidence for  M&amp;J's breach of contract claim to be\r\n\ndecided by  the  juries.   The  relevant evidence  which  was\r\n\nsubstantially  the  same for  both  trials  is summarized  as\r\n\nfollows.    Frank  Lombard,   president  and  owner  of  M&amp;J,\r\n\ntestified that  M&amp;J  encountered serious  financial  problems\r\n\nwhen  the Bank of New England collapsed causing M&amp;J's line of\r\n\ncredit  to terminate on May 30, 1991.  Lombard testified that\r\n\nit  was usual for M&amp;J,  and other insurance  agencies, to use\r\n\nbank  loans  to meet  its  premium  obligations to  insurance\r\n\ncompanies for premiums owed by the insureds.  In other words,\r\n\nthe  agency would carry its clients by borrowing money from a\r\n\nbank,  pay the premiums due the company and wait for payments\r\n\nfrom the clients.   The collapse of  the Bank of New  England\r\n\nstripped  M&amp;J of any  cash reserves.   Lombard testified that\r\n\nother insurance  companies with whom M&amp;J  did business agreed\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nto accept monthly  installment premium  payments or  extended\r\n\nthe due date for the payment of premiums.\r\n\n          Another  factor that  impacted  on M&amp;J's  financial\r\n\ncondition was the loss of its biggest insurance account, F.L.\r\n\nRoberts Co.  (\"Roberts\").  Premiums on  this account amounted\r\n\nto between $800,000.00 and $1,000,000.00 a year.  Roberts was\r\n\na  large wholesaler  and retailer  of petroleum  products and\r\n\noperator of service stations and  car washes in southern  New\r\n\nEngland.  \r\n\n          The  evidence discloses  the following  sequence of\r\n\nevents.  Lombard was an insurance consultant for Roberts, not\r\n\nan agent, from 1979 through 1986.  In late  1986, Roberts did\r\n\nnot  have a carrier for 1987.  Lombard suggested that Roberts\r\n\ntry to obtain insurance coverage for a three-year period with\r\n\nthe  premiums being determined on the  basis of the carrier's\r\n\nexpenses  and  Roberts' losses.    Under such  a  program the\r\n\ninsured, who paid a deposit premium initially,  might be owed\r\n\nrefunds by the carrier  at the end  of the insurance year  or\r\n\nvice versa.   The amount  due either the  carrier or  Roberts\r\n\nwould  be determined each  year.  In January  of 1987, such a\r\n\nprogram was entered into between  Roberts and CIGNA for three\r\n\nyears with M&amp;J  acting as agent.  The amount  of premiums due\r\n\nwould  be determined in September  1988, 1989, and  1990.  In\r\n\nJuly or  August of 1990  Lombard calculated  that CIGNA  owed\r\n\nRoberts $200,000.00 under the program.  He contacted CIGNA on\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nSeptember 30,  1990, and was told that it would look into it.\r\n\nLombard  called the CIGNA department in charge of the program\r\n\nand was reprimanded  for doing so.  A new  program was set to\r\n\ngo into effect in January of 1991.  The down payment required\r\n\nby  CIGNA from  Roberts  was $250,000.00.   Roberts  informed\r\n\nLombard that it would  not pay the $250,000.00 unless  it was\r\n\ncredited with  the $200,000.00  refund.  Laurie  Scanlan, who\r\n\nworked in  the special  risk division of  CIGNA, acknowledged\r\n\nthat CIGNA  owed Roberts money  under the program,  but would\r\n\nnot  pay it  because she  asserted that  Roberts also  owed a\r\n\nsurcharge of $56,000.00.   Lombard told Scanlan the surcharge\r\n\nwas  not part  of  the insurance  program.   She told  him to\r\n\ncollect it.  He refused.\r\n\n          An inter-office CIGNA memo states its position:\r\n\n          Per   our   discussion,   the   following\r\n          strategy will be utilized in  solving the\r\n          F.L. Roberts FVC surcharge dispute.\r\n\n             Number one, Insured Meeting.  Set up a\r\n          meeting  with F.L. Roberts and invite the\r\n          agent.\r\n\n             Number two, Program  Intent.   Discuss\r\n          the  need  for  the  surcharge  in  vague\r\n          terms.  Provide the  proposal for the '89\r\n          and  '90 years  to  document  the  stated\r\n          surcharge, in parentheses,  '87 and  '88:\r\n          FVC not mentioned.  Close parentheses.\r\n\n             Number 3, CIGNA's Needs.  If we cannot\r\n          collect the  surcharge,  we cannot  be  a\r\n          market for such coverages.\r\n\n             Number 4, Payment  Intentions.   After\r\n          discuss needs for surcharge, determine if\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          F.L. Roberts is  willing to  pay the  FVC\r\n          surcharge.\r\n\n             Number five, Refusal to Pay.  Legally,\r\n          we cannot enforce the payment of the  FVC\r\n          surcharge.  Therefore,  back-off if  they\r\n          refuse  to  pay.    But  we  should  then\r\n          seriously consider non-renewal.\r\n\n             Hopefully, we can satisfy  our insured\r\n          and  collect the  surcharge  at the  same\r\n          time.  Good luck.\r\n\n          M&amp;J  expected a  proposal from  CIGNA for  the 1992\r\n\nRoberts insurance  program.  Scanlan was supposed  to work up\r\n\nthe  figures.   Lombard  received a  letter  from Scanlan  on\r\n\nDecember 16, stating  that CIGNA would not  negotiate renewal\r\n\nterms  unless  CIGNA was  paid the  1991  premiums due.   The\r\n\nletter further  stated  that CIGNA  would issue  cancellation\r\n\nnotices  the next day, but  if Roberts paid  CIGNA within ten\r\n\ndays, the notices would be rescinded.  Roberts' insurance was\r\n\ncancelled  as per the  letter.  Lombard  immediately faxed to\r\n\nCIGNA  a statement by CIGNA  showing a credit  due Roberts of\r\n\n$28,903.58  as of  December 20, 1991.   After the  fax, CIGNA\r\n\nreinstated Roberts' insurance.\r\n\n          CIGNA sent  a renewal  proposal for 1992  that cost\r\n\nabout  $500,000.00 more than the  prior program.  Lombard was\r\n\ngiven until noon the next day to  make up his mind.  He found\r\n\nthe proposal totally unacceptable.  Lombard tried to work out\r\n\nan alternative program  with CIGNA.   With the permission  of\r\n\nJoann White  of CIGNA, he issued  temporary binders effective\r\n\nJanuary 1, 1992.  Scanlan notified Roberts that the temporary\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\npolicies  were  not valid.   Lombard  received a  letter from\r\n\nScanlan  that a new agent, Palmer Goodell Insurance, would be\r\n\nRoberts' new broker unless  Lombard was notified otherwise by\r\n\nthe  close of business on  January 17.   No such notification\r\n\nwas  received.   M&amp;J's  commissions  on  the Roberts  account\r\n\namounted to about $80,000.00 per year.\r\n\n          The  third  aspect  of the  evidence  involved  two\r\n\nunexecuted promissory  notes  from M&amp;J  to CIGNA.   As  M&amp;J's\r\n\nfinancial  problems increased, it  approached CIGNA and asked\r\n\nto   pay  the   premiums  due   in  twelve   regular  monthly\r\n\ninstallments.   CIGNA told M&amp;J  in September of  1991 that it\r\n\nwould  draw up a promissory note providing for payment of the\r\n\npast due premiums in regular monthly installments.  The  note\r\n\nwas brought to Lombard by Charles Glaser on February 6, 1992.\r\n\nLombard approved it orally,  but did not sign it  because the\r\n\nword \"draft\" was written across the top of it.  This note had\r\n\na principal sum of $115,507.05.   During his discussion  with\r\n\nGlaser, Lombard told him  about the Roberts account.   Glaser\r\n\nasked Lombard what he  was planning to do.   Lombard replied,\r\n\n\"I  don't know, I'm  seeking a legal remedy.\"   A second note\r\n\nwas  presented to Lombard on  March 23 by  Robert Purdy.  The\r\n\nprincipal was $105,324.14, but the payment terms and interest\r\n\nwere  the same  as  the first  note.1   This   note, however,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  There   is  no  explanation  in  the  record  as  to  the\r\ndifference between the principal in each note.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nincluded  a waiver and release  of all claims  that M&amp;J might\r\n\nhave against CIGNA.   Lombard, still smarting because  of the\r\n\nloss of the Roberts account, refused to sign the note.  Remmy\r\n\nMartens, a  marketing official for CIGNA, who  had dealt with\r\n\nLombard  for an appreciable length of time, told Purdy at the\r\n\ntime  the waiver  and release  were added  to the  note that,\r\n\nbased  on   his  knowledge  of  Lombard,   Purdy  would  have\r\n\ndifficulty getting Lombard to sign the note as redrafted.\r\n\n          CIGNA  cancelled  its   agency  contract  with  M&amp;J\r\n\nforthwith  after Lombard refused to  sign the note.   It shut\r\n\ndown all of M&amp;J's computers wired into the CIGNA net.  It put\r\n\nall  of the  policies  heretofore handled  by  M&amp;J on  direct\r\n\nbilling; i.e., premiums were paid directly to CIGNA.\r\n\n          M&amp;J notified CIGNA that the  forthwith cancellation\r\n\nwas prohibited  by Massachusetts law,  which it  was.   Mass.\r\n\nGen.  L.  ch. 175,    163  prohibits  the cancellation  of an\r\n\nagency  contract  without  180  days notice.2    After  CIGNA\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.           No company shall cancel  the authority\r\n          of  any  independent insurance  agent for\r\n          fire or casualty  insurance, or both,  if\r\n          said  agent is  not  an employee  of said\r\n          company and  no  company shall  modify  a\r\n          contract  with such  an agent  unless the\r\n          company  gives  written  notice   of  its\r\n          intent to cancel such agent or its intent\r\n          to  modify such  contract  at  least  one\r\n          hundred  and  eighty   days  before   the\r\n          proposed  effective  date  of   any  such\r\n          cancellation or modification.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nchecked   the  Massachusetts   statute,   it   deferred   the\r\n\ncancellation for 180 days.  \r\n\n          We  rule that  there  was sufficient  evidence from\r\n\nwhich  a jury  could  find  that  CIGNA breached  the  agency\r\n\ncontract with  M&amp;J.   The evidence  provided two  grounds for\r\n\nsuch  a finding.  One, that  the \"forthwith\" cancellation was\r\n\ncontrary  to  Massachusetts  law,  of  which  CIGNA  must  be\r\n\npresumed  to have  knowledge.   It also  could be  found that\r\n\nCIGNA cancelled its agency  contract with M&amp;J by refusing  to\r\n\nhonor  the  binders that  one  of its  officials  (White) had\r\n\nauthorized.  \r\n\n       The Application of Mass.

M&amp;J had no duty to invoke it.\r\n\n          CIGNA  has cited no cases holding even tangentially\r\n\nthat  the statute applies in  a situation similar  to the one\r\n\nthat confronts us.   The  two cases it  cites are  completely\r\n\ninapposite;  they involve  different  statutes and  different\r\n\nclaims.    We have  been  unable to  find any  cases  in this\r\n\nCircuit  or in  Massachusetts  requiring an  agent to  invoke\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. Ch. 175   163 prior to asserting claims against\r\n\nan  insurance  company, and  CIGNA has  cited none.

It ruled:   that\r\n\n\"there  was  no  evidence  of  a  contract  between  M&amp;J  and\r\n\nRoberts;\" that \"even if there was a contract . .  . there was\r\n\nno  evidence that  CIGNA knowingly  induced Roberts  to break\r\n\nthat  contract,\" and  that M&amp;J  failed to  show that  even if\r\n\nthere was a contract  and interference with it by  CIGNA, M&amp;J\r\n\n\"failed  to show  that CIGNA's  interference was  improper in\r\n\nmotive or means.\"\r\n\n          The court concluded:\r\n\n             In fine, after considering  the jury's\r\n          verdict in conjunction with its ruling on\r\n          CIGNA's breach of contract  claim, above,\r\n          the  Court  surmises   that  the   jury's\r\n          decision  on  the  MacDonald   &amp;  Johnson\r\n          breach of contract claim \"could only have\r\n          been a  sympathy\" verdict.

Acevedo-Diaz v.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nAponte, 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 1993).  We think so.   As the\r                  \r\n\ndistrict  court pointed  out in  its memorandum  opinion, the\r\n\nevidence was clear and not disputed by M&amp;J that it owed CIGNA\r\n\nabout $111,000.00  in premiums.  This evidence  came not only\r\n\nfrom  CIGNA  but from  the  testimony  of John  Januska,  the\r\n\ncomptroller  and assistant treasurer of M&amp;J.   He stated that\r\n\nthere  was no question that $111,000.00 was due CIGNA in July\r\n\nof 1991.  And although strictly speaking it was not evidence,\r\n\ncounsel for M&amp;J told  the jury in his opening  statement that\r\n\npremiums due CIGNA had not been paid.\r\n\n          In its  appellate argument, M&amp;J seeks  to shift the\r\n\nfocus from  the agency contract to  the unexecuted promissory\r\n\nnotes.  It contends that the notes constituted a modification\r\n\nof  the  agency contract  and  that  both parties  agreed  to\r\n\npayment  of the  overdue premiums  in   monthly installments.\r\n\nLombard  testified that he agreed  to the terms  of the first\r\n\nnote and that CIGNA did also.  CIGNA says that the first note\r\n\nwas only a tentative proposal for Lombard's consideration and\r\n\ntherefore  the note was not  signed by the  parties.  Lombard\r\n\nrefused  to  sign the  second note,  the  one with  the added\r\n\nwaiver and  release.  Lombard's  assumption that he  would be\r\n\ngiven  an opportunity  to  pay  the  premiums owed  CIGNA  in\r\n\nmonthly installments may have caused  him not to pursue other\r\n\noptions for  payment, but it is not a valid basis for finding\r\n\neither  a  modification of  the  agency  contract  or  a  new\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ncontract between the parties.   Such a finding  is foreclosed\r\n\nby the two  unexecuted promissory notes.  The  district court\r\n\ndid not err in ruling that the jury's verdict was contrary to\r\n\nthe evidence  and upholding it would result  in a miscarriage\r\n\nof justice.\r\n\n          Moreover, there is another reason for upholding the\r\n\ndistrict court on this issue.  Early in the second trial  the\r\n\nparties stipulated  that judgment would be  entered for CIGNA\r\n\nagainst M&amp;J on CIGNA's breach of contract claim in the amount\r\n\nof  $169,798.14 plus interest.   By so doing,  M&amp;J waived any\r\n\nobjections to CIGNA's contract claim in the first trial.\r\n\n            The Amount of Damages Awarded on M&amp;J's\r                        The Amount of Damages Awarded on M&amp;J's\r                                                              \r\n            Breach of Contract Claim Against CIGNA\r                        Breach of Contract Claim Against CIGNA\r                                                              \r\n\n          The jury  awarded M&amp;J $780,000.00 on  its breach of\r\n\ncontract  claim.   The  court  set this  aside  because M&amp;J's\r\n\nevidence failed  to establish  that it was  entitled to  over\r\n\n$700,000.00  in  damages  and  because it  was  a  \"sympathy\"\r\n\nverdict.   Lombard  estimated  that  he  lost a  little  over\r\n\n$200,000.00  as a  result of  the termination  of the  agency\r\n\ncontract  by CIGNA.    He managed  to  salvage $30,000.00  to\r\n\n$40,000.00,  making a net loss  of $160,000.00.  In addition,\r\n\nLombard testified that he  lost $161,158.00 on his commercial\r\n\naccounts,  $39,046.00   on  \"Market  Dyne\"  Business,  and  a\r\n\n$215,490.00  loss was  sustained on  personal accounts.   The\r\n\nloss  of   commissions  on   the  Roberts  account   came  to\r\n\n$80,000.00, and there was a loss of profit sharing with CIGNA\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\namounting to  $44,000.00.  Lombard testified  that his salary\r\n\ndropped about $60,000.00 a  year after the CIGNA termination.\r\n\nThese  figures, even  if  taken at  face  value and  with  no\r\n\nallowance  for  what appears  to  be  double counting,  total\r\n\n$699,694.00, not including the reduction in Lombard's salary.\r\n\nThe suit was brought  in the name of  M&amp;J so we do  not think\r\n\nthat Lombard's reduction  in salary  is a proper  item to  be\r\n\nconsidered.    Thus,  the  total amount  of  damages,  taking\r\n\nLombard's testimony at face  value, did not, as the  district\r\n\ncourt pointed out, exceed $700,000.00.\r\n\n          It  was not  error for  the  district court  to set\r\n\naside  as excessive  the breach  of contract  damages awarded\r\n\nM&amp;J.   We point out that the  court found that the verdict on\r\n\ndamages for M&amp;J was infected by the jury's complete disregard\r\n\nof  the evidence on CIGNA's  breach of contract  claim.  This\r\n\nappears  to  be a  sensible  assessment of  the  first jury's\r\n\nverdict.  The second jury was not so influenced.\r\n\n          The Jury Award of $500,000.00 for CIGNA's\r                      The Jury Award of $500,000.00 for CIGNA's\r                                                               \r\n                Intentional Interference with\r                            Intentional Interference with\r                                                         \r\n         M&amp;J's Contractual Relationship with Roberts\r                     M&amp;J's Contractual Relationship with Roberts\r                                                                \r\n\n          The district court correctly  applied Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw to a claim  for intentional interference with contractual\r\n\nrelations.   The  party  making  the  claim must  prove  four\r\n\nelements:  (1)  that there was a contract with a third party;\r\n\n(2) that defendant knowingly induced that party to  break the\r\n\ncontract; (3) that  defendant's interference was  intentional\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nand  improper in motive or  means; and (4)  that the claimant\r\n\nwas  harmed  by  defendant's  action.

A  long-standing business  relationship does  not\r\n\nbecome a contractual relationship automatically, as M&amp;J seems\r\n\nto  argue.  The last  insurance program issued  to Roberts by\r\n\nCIGNA through M&amp;J was for a term of three years.  None of the\r\n\nparties  had   a  contractual  obligation  to   continue  the\r\n\ninsurance  coverage after  its  term expired.   The  evidence\r\n\nsuggests strongly that  Roberts decided to use a broker other\r\n\nthan M&amp;J because it would be less  expensive.  There was also\r\n\nevidence  that one  of the  owners  of the  new agency  was a\r\n\nneighbor of the president  of Roberts.  We need go no further\r\n\nthan the lack of a contract between Roberts and M&amp;J to uphold\r\n\nthe  ruling of  the  district court  setting  aside the  jury\r\n\nverdict awarding M&amp;J $500,000.00 for intentional interference\r\n\nwith a contractual relationship by CIGNA.\r\n\n          At  the  trial the  court  reserved  to itself  the\r\n\ndecision  on the claim by M&amp;J against CIGNA for violations of\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nMass. Gen.  L. ch. 93A.   It  found in favor  of CIGNA.   M&amp;J\r\n\nmoved for a new trial.   Our review of the record  reveals no\r\n\nbasis for reversing the  judgment of the district court.   We\r\n\ndo not find it necessary to delve into the nuances of chapter\r\n\n93A law.  Suffice it to say that the sparsity of the evidence\r\n\nwas  a  firm basis  for the  court to  conclude that  M&amp;J had\r\n\nfailed to meet its burden of proof on its 93A claims.\r\n\n               Denial of M&amp;J's Motion to Amend\r                           Denial of M&amp;J's Motion to Amend\r                                                          \r\n                Count III of its Counterclaim\r                            Count III of its Counterclaim\r                                                         \r\n\n          This issue requires some  exposition.  Count III of\r\n\nM&amp;J's  counterclaim  was entitled,  \"Intentional Interference\r\n\nwith  Economic Gain.\"   In  a pretrial  memorandum  and order\r\n\ndated February 17, 1993, the district court said:\r\n\n             Defendant's third counterclaim against\r\n          CIGNA admittedly is mislabeled,  but this\r\n          problem is  not fatal.    The Court  will\r\n          interpret the cause of action  as one for\r\n          intentional       interference       with\r\n          advantageous business  relations, a claim\r\n          recognized by  the Massachusetts courts.2\r\n          Here,  too,  defendant  has  pleaded  the\r\n          requisite elements.  \r\n\n          The footnote stated:   \"Defendant  shall amend  its\r\n\ncounterclaim  within  ten   days,  substituting  the  correct\r\n\nnomenclature.\"     Inexplicably,  M&amp;J  did   not  amend   the\r\n\ncounterclaim as ordered.\r\n\n          At  a  pretrial conference  on  the  day the  trial\r\n\nstarted,  the  court pointed  out to  M&amp;J's counsel  that the\r\n\ncounterclaim had not  been amended as ordered.   The attorney\r\n\nsaid:   \"I  thought that  was  right in  there.\"   The  court\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nreplied, \"No.\"  The  judge's law clerk then  said, \"According\r\n\nto  the  documents, that  was  never  filed.\"   The  attorney\r\n\nresponded  by saying, \"Okay.\"  No objection was taken nor was\r\n\npermission requested to amend the counterclaim nunc pro tunc.\r                                                                         \r\n\n          After  the conclusion  of the  trial, M&amp;J  moved to\r\n\namend  its counterclaim.  The motion  was denied as untimely,\r\n\nbut the court said:\r\n\n             In  the  event that  this case  is re-\r\n          tried,   the    Court   will   reconsider\r\n          MacDonald  &amp;  Johnson's request  to amend\r\n          its  pleadings  to  include  a  claim for\r\n          intentional       interference       with\r\n          advantageous business relations.\r\n\n          Six days  prior to  the second  trial, M&amp;J filed  a\r\n\nmotion  to amend their  counterclaim to  include a  claim for\r\n\nintentional    interference   with    advantageous   business\r\n\nrelations.    The  court  denied  the  motion  on  timeliness\r\n\ngrounds,  also noting  that  the pleadings  failed to  allege\r\n\nfacts to support the claim,  that CIGNA presented no evidence\r\n\nat the first trial (nor offered any at the second) to support\r\n\nthe inference  that CIGNA knowingly induced  Roberts to break\r\n\nits contract with M&amp;J  or that any interference by  CIGNA was\r\n\nimproper.\r\n\n          We review a denial  of leave to amend for  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.   A  district court,  in denying such  leave, may\r\n\nproperly consider a party's undue delay, repeated failures to\r\n\ncure deficiencies in  the pleadings, and the futility  of the\r\n\nproposed  amendment.   Foman  v.  Davis,  371 U.S.  178,  192\r                                                   \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n(1962). Without deciding whether CIGNA had presented evidence\r\n\nat  the first  trial sufficient to  enable a jury  to find an\r\n\nintentional    interference   with    advantageous   business\r\n\nrelations, we  hold that the district court  acted within its\r\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion to amend.\r\n\n          The district court told  M&amp;J before the first trial\r\n\nthat  its  complaint should  be  amended  if  M&amp;J  wanted  it\r\n\nconsidered; M&amp;J failed to do so.  It was proper for the judge\r\n\nto  deny leave to amend  after the first  trial where counsel\r\n\nwas instructed to amend  the complaint, failed to do  so, and\r\n\nfailed to correct  this error when it was pointed  out by the\r\n\ncourt.   Having left an  opening for  M&amp;J to  try again,  the\r\n\ncourt  could well find that M&amp;J had failed to exercise proper\r\n\ndiligence because it waited virtually  until the eve of trial\r\n\nbefore  submitting   its  motion  to  amend.     Under  these\r\n\ncircumstances, we will not disturb the ruling of the district\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n                       The Second Trial\r                                   The Second Trial\r                                                   \r\n\n          As  already explained,  the second  jury  trial was\r\n\nlimited to M&amp;J's breach of contract claim against CIGNA.  M&amp;J\r\n\nmoved for a new trial, which was denied.  Both parties object\r\n\nto the damages award so we start with that.\r\n\n                           Damages\r                                       Damages\r                                              \r\n\n          CIGNA attacks the damages on two grounds:  that the\r\n\nevidence  should not have been  admitted because it was based\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\non hearsay and speculation  and that the award was  too high.\r\n\nM&amp;J  asserts that  the award  was too  low because  the court\r\n\nimproperly  limited  M&amp;J's damages  to  the  period from  the\r\n\ninitial  date  of cancellation  of  the  agency contract,  to\r\n\nOctober 15, 1992, the  extended date of cancellation required\r\n\nunder Massachusetts law.\r\n\n          Before  discussing the  claims of  the parties,  we\r\n\nrehearse  the evidence on  damages as reported  in the second\r\n\ntrial transcript.   The evidence  on damages came  in through\r\n\nthe testimony of Frank Lombard.   He testified essentially as\r\n\nfollows.  Up  to 1992, M&amp;J's average commissions  on premiums\r\n\nit received  was \"in the  $250,000 a year range.\"   After the\r\n\ncancellation, clients  of M&amp;J who were insured  by CIGNA were\r\n\nsent letters  notifying them  that M&amp;J's contract  with CIGNA\r\n\nhad  been  cancelled and  all premiums  due  were to  be paid\r\n\ndirectly to CIGNA.  Most of these clients did not renew their\r\n\npolicies  with  M&amp;J.   Lombard  kept  a  record  of all  such\r\n\nclients.  From the date of the initial cancellation, April 2,\r\n\n1992, to October 15, 1992, premiums from the affected clients\r\n\naggregated $1,720,495.00; M&amp;J's loss in  commissions totalled\r\n\n$201,294.00.   This  was broken  down into  three categories:\r\n\ncommercial   commissions   --   $175,138.00;    Market   Dyne\r\n\ncommissions  --  $13,281.00;  and  personal   commissions  --\r\n\n$12,875.00.  In addition, M&amp;J lost its annual  profit sharing\r\n\nincome from  CIGNA of $12,871.00.   Lombard further testified\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nthat the  commission loss to  the end of the  year would have\r\n\nbeen  $215,393.00.3      Lombard  testified   that  loss   of\r\n\ncommissions was the same as loss  of profits and that M&amp;J had\r\n\na renewal rate of 93% on insurance policies purchased through\r\n\nit.\r\n\n          He started to testify  about future loss of profits\r\n\nwhen  there was an objection  followed by a bench conference.\r\n\nThe  court  reminded  counsel  for M&amp;J  that  it  had limited\r\n\ndamages to October 15, 1992.  M&amp;J's counsel  made an offer of\r\n\nproof that damages would be $215,000.00 in lost commissions a\r\n\nyear plus loss of profit sharing of $56,000.00 for a total of\r\n\n$271,000.00 a year \"ad infinitum.\"\r\n\n          We  start our  analysis of  M&amp;J's objection  to the\r\n\ncourt's ruling  on damages  with the  observation that  it is\r\n\nobvious that an \"ad infinitum\" claim for damages has no basis\r\n\nin  law and confounds common  sense.  Confining our analysis,\r\n\nhowever, to the claim by M&amp;J that  the court's ruling that no\r\n\ndamages could be awarded  after October 15, 1992, was  error,\r\n\nwe point out  that the  transcript of  the jury  instructions\r\n\nshows that no such instruction was given.   The court left it\r\n\nentirely up to the  jury to determine the period  of time for\r\n\nwhich damages could be awarded:  \r\n\n          In  considering  any  claim  for  loss of\r\n          anticipated  profits   resulting  from  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  These amounts  are considerably  lower than the  items of\r\ndamages claimed in the first trial.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          breach of contract,  you should  consider\r\n          the  length of  time that  parties  had a\r\n          right  to expect to  receive the benefits\r\n          of the contract.\r\n\n             If you determine the contract was only\r\n          for a certain period of time, or could be\r\n          terminated by  notice to the  other party\r\n          after  a  certain  period,  you  may only\r\n          award damages for losses  incurred during\r\n          that limited period of time.\r\n\n          CIGNA did not object to the failure of the court to\r\n\nlimit the time period for awarding damages.\r\n\n          M&amp;J  argues that this  unexpected volte-face by the\r                                                                  \r\n\ncourt on damages prevented it from introducing more extensive\r\n\nevidence  on damages.   The  answer to  this is  that Lombard\r\n\ntestified:  \"Your  [sic] damages are, our  loss of commission\r\n\nboth  for 1992,  and these people,  based on  our experience,\r\n\nwould  have  renewed  their  insurance each  year  and  these\r\n\ncustomers  are  gone.\"   It is  hard  to see  what additional\r\n\nevidence could have been introduced.  This sum of $271,000.00\r\n\nfor  annual  lost profits  was in  evidence  for the  jury to\r\n\nconsider and  there was no restriction in the charge limiting\r\n\nthe  period of damages.  We have  read the final argument for\r\n\nM&amp;J carefully and there is  no discussion in it of any  time-\r\n\nperiod limitations on damages.  The attorney for M&amp;J, without\r\n\nobjection, stated, \"a  whole year's commission was  $215,000,\r\n\nnot 201.\"   Based on  the evidence  before the  jury and  the\r\n\ncourt's instructions, we find that M&amp;J was not  prejudiced by\r\n\nthe court's bench  ruling that damages  could not be  awarded\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nafter October 15, 1992, because this  ruling was not conveyed\r\n\nto the jury.  \r\n\n          We are not impressed by CIGNA's objections that the\r\n\nevidence on damages was based on speculation and hearsay  and\r\n\nshould  have  been  excluded.   As  the  court  pointed  out,\r\n\nLombard's  testimony  was  based   on  his  own  records  and\r\n\nexperience in the insurance business.  That the testimony was\r\n\nself-serving went to  its credibility not its  admissibility.\r\n\nLombard  was  subjected   to  rigorous  cross-examination  on\r\n\ndamages and  CIGNA introduced testimony  through experts that\r\n\ncontradicted  Lombard's  testimony.   The  jury's verdict  of\r\n\n$250,000.00 in  damages for  M&amp;J strikes  us as  a reasonable\r\n\nassessment  of the  evidence.   Moreover,  even if  Lombard's\r\n\ntestimony was hearsay in part, it did not affect the verdict.\r\n\nThe $250,000.00 award could only have been for the year 1992.\r\n\nAs to what  happened to  M&amp;J's clients in  1992, Lombard  had\r\n\nfirst-hand information.  He testified as follows:\r\n\n          A.   I kept track from the day this event\r\n          occurred in March of 1992.  I was the one\r\n          in charge.  I was the  one that talked to\r\n          the  people  that  got  the  letter  from\r\n          CIGNA. I was the one that handled all the\r\n          commercial  accounts, so  I knew  who was\r\n          affected by that action.\r\n\n          Any violation of the hearsay rule was de minimis.\r                                                                      \r\n\n          CIGNA's other objection that the award was too high\r\n\ndoes  not  fare  any  better.    CIGNA  argues  that  Lombard\r\n\ntestified only as to lost revenues but ignored the other side\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nof the ledger  -- savings  in ongoing expenses  -- thus,  the\r\n\ndamages were  higher than  what normally would  be the  case.\r\n\nLombard  did   testify  specifically,  however,   that  M&amp;J's\r\n\nexpenses  did  not contract  after  the loss  of  the Roberts\r\n\naccount but continued at  the same level.  He  testified that\r\n\nno one  was terminated, and  that expenses  continued at  the\r\n\nsame rate.   Lombard  was cross-examined intensively  on this\r\n\npoint  but  did not  give ground.    It was  well  within the\r\n\nprovince of the jury to believe Lombard's testimony.  \r\n\n          Our rulings and findings on damages negate  CIGNA's\r\n\nargument  that its motion  for a remittitur  should have been\r\n\nallowed.\r\n\n                   The Conduct of the Judge\r                               The Conduct of the Judge\r                                                       \r\n\n          M&amp;J's main  attack on  the jury  verdict is  a two-\r\n\npronged condemnation  of the  conduct of the  district judge.\r\n\nIt asserts that  the judge should  have recused himself  from\r\n\npresiding over the second trial because of bias and prejudice\r\n\nagainst  M&amp;J.     It  also  accuses  the  judge  of  secretly\r\n\ncommunicating with the jury  during its deliberations.  These\r\n\nare serious charges.\r\n\n                           Recusal\r                                       Recusal\r                                              \r\n\n          In its motion for recusal filed prior to the second\r\n\ntrial, M&amp;J states three specific reasons for recusal:\r\n\n          1.  The very nature of a retrial order is\r\n          such that it should  be considered by one\r\n          other than the original trial judge.\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n          2.  At  the pretrial  conference held  on\r\n          March 13, 1994,  Judge Freedman stated in\r\n          open  court  that  he  thought  that  the\r\n          Defendant,  Plaintiff  in   counterclaim,\r\n          Frank Lombard, was insincere.\r\n\n          3.   At  the pretrial conference  held on\r\n          March 13, 1994,  Judge Freedman stated in\r\n          open court that if a jury finds similarly\r\n          on  retrial, that he  would order a third\r\n          trial.\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\n          In its brief, M&amp;J has expanded its reasons:  \r\n\n             The  trial judge  not only  stated his\r\n          bias,   but  allowed  it  to  infect  his\r\n          rulings.  As indicated in prior arguments\r\n          in this  brief, he took away  verdicts in\r\n          favor of M &amp; J after the first trial even\r\n          though  there  was   ample  evidence   to\r\n          support them.  In ruling on these motions\r\n          he  denied the  existence of  evidence of\r\n          damages  which  was  clearly  before  the\r\n          jury.   He failed to apply  proper law in\r\n          finding  against  M  &amp; J  for  the  claim\r\n          arising out  of  the  loss  of  the  F.L.\r\n          Roberts account.  He failed  to adhere to\r\n          the  rules  of civil  procedure regarding\r\n          notice   pending    and   amendments   to\r\n          pleadings.  He found against M &amp; J on the\r\n          c.  93A count without making any findings\r\n          of fact to support his decision.\r\n\nM&amp;J's Brief at 42-43.\r\n\n          28 U.S.C.   455(a) provides:\r\n\n             (a) Any justice, judge,  or magistrate\r\n          of  the  United  States shall  disqualify\r\n          himself  in any  proceeding in  which his\r\n          impartiality    might    reasonably    be\r\n          questioned.\r\n\nWe turn  to the  case law  to determine  when the  statute is\r\n\nimplicated.  In this Circuit the question is:\r\n\n          whether   the   charge    of   lack    of\r\n          impartiality  is  grounded on  facts that\r\n          would    create   a    reasonable   doubt\r\n          concerning the  judge's impartiality, not\r\n          in the mind of  the judge himself or even\r\n          necessarily in  the mind of  the litigant\r\n          filing  the motion under 28 U.S.C.   455,\r\n          but rather in the mind  of the reasonable\r\n          man.\r\n\nUnited  States v.

M&amp;J  has cited no  case to  this effect  and we have\r\n\nfound  none.   Absent  a Local  Rule  that so  provides  (and\r\n\nMassachusetts  has  none),  this   is  a  matter  within  the\r\n\ndiscretion  of  the trial  judge.    Although  there  may  be\r\n\ncircumstances  in which a  new judge should  preside over the\r\n\nsecond trial,  such substitution  is not the  usual practice.\r\n\nWe find  nothing in the record  here suggesting circumstances\r\n\nthat would make  the trial judge think twice  about presiding\r\n\nover the new trial.\r\n\n          Because we  have affirmed the rulings  and findings\r\n\nof the district court setting aside the verdicts in the first\r\n\ntrial  and ordering  a new  trial, it  would be  pointless to\r\n\ndiscuss the asseverations made by M&amp;J  at pages 42 and 43  of\r\n\nits brief.  Our affirmance of the rulings and findings of the\r\n\ndistrict court scotches any  bias or prejudice claim on  this\r\n\nbasis. \r\n\n          This leaves for consideration  the comments made by\r\n\nthe  judge at  the pre-trial  hearing on May  13, 1994.   The\r\n\nrecord reads as follows.\r\n\n               THE  COURT:     Well,  Mr.   Joseph,\r\n          without even thinking  F.L. Roberts  what\r\n          is your client  earnestly, sincerely  and\r\n          so forth believe he's  entitled to on the\r\n          breach of contract on the counter-claim?\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\n               MR.  JOSEPH:   He is,  believes he's\r\n          entitled  to  the  jury  verdict  on  the\r\n          counter-claim.\r\n\n               THE COURT:  $500,000?\r\n\n               MR. JOSEPH:  Oh, indeed.\r\n\n               THE COURT:  There's  no way to  move\r\n          if that's his thinking.\r\n\n               MR.  JOSEPH:    Well,  that  is  his\r\n          thinking.\r\n\n               THE  COURT:    Well,  if  that's his\r\n          thinking then you have no authority to do\r\n          anything.\r\n\n               MR. JOSEPH:  Well, I have the authority.\r\n\n               THE COURT:  Then, we'll have to talk\r\n          trial date and go from here.\r\n\n               MR. JOSEPH:  All right, sir.\r\n\n               THE COURT:  And I have to advise you\r\n          in advance that if  a second jury went as\r\n          far  as the  first  jury went  as far  as\r\n          $500,000, the  money, I'd take  that away\r\n          as  well.   You have  to know  you're not\r\n          going  to get it.   I don't care what you\r\n          did.  At least not  from this Judge.  You\r\n          could always  take an appeal  and see  if\r\n          you could get  another trial. That  would\r\n          be up to the first circuit.\r\n\n               MR. JOSEPH:  Okay.\r\n\n               THE COURT:  I was hoping we might be\r\n          able to be sincere in our thinking and go\r\n          somewhere.  Your client is not sincere in\r\n          my eyes.\r\n\n               MR.  JOSEPH:   Judge, I  really must\r\n          disagree with you and I insist  my client\r\n          is very  sincere.   Perhaps if  you don't\r\n          think  he's  sincere  you  should  recuse\r\n          yourself.\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n               THE  COURT:   No,  I'm saying  if he\r\n          thinks a  jury verdict should be given to\r\n          him if he's not  willing to accept and go\r\n          with another trial, I frankly don't think\r\n          another jury would  go anywhere near that\r\n          figure.   If they  give anything  at all.\r\n          I'm  not  even convinced  he,  they would\r\n          ever do that.\r\n\n          This pre-trial  hearing was called by  the judge in\r\n\nan  attempt to  settle  the case.    We  see nothing  in  the\r\n\ncomments of  the judge that  would create a  reasonable doubt\r\n\nconcerning  the  judge's  impartiality   in  the  mind  of  a\r\n\nreasonable person.\r\n\n               The Alleged Secret Communication\r                           The Alleged Secret Communication\r                                                           \r\n                  by the Judge with the Jury\r                              by the Judge with the Jury\r                                                        \r\n\n          M&amp;J  has alleged  that  the  trial  judge,  without\r\n\nadvising counsel, responded in the negative to a question  by\r\n\nthe jury asking whether  it could award damages of  more than\r\n\n$240,000.00  to  M&amp;J.    This  alleged  secret  communication\r\n\nbetween  the judge and jury  first surfaced in a conversation\r\n\nbetween Gary  W.  Lavallee, foreman  of the  jury, and  Frank\r\n\nLombard,  president of  M&amp;J, at  a local restaurant  three or\r\n\nfour weeks after  verdict and judgment  in the second  trial.\r\n\nThe jury     foreman subsequently  executed a sworn affidavit\r\n\nwhich stated:\r\n\n                AFFIDAVIT OF GARY W.

One\r\n               question specifically asked  if\r\n               we could award damages over and\r\n               above  the   $240,000  you  had\r\n               illustrated on the  blackboard,\r\n               to  justify  for   a  loss   of\r\n               renewal income.  His  reply was\r\n               that we couldn't.\r\n\n             During  our  deliberation,  the  whole\r\n          jury   was   in  complete   agreement  to\r\n          awarding additional damages based on loss\r\n          of renewal income.\r\n\n       Signed under the pains and penalties of perjury this\r\n      1st   day of March 1995.\r                       \r\n\n                                     \\s\\ Gary W.

Lavallee\r\n\n          The  other  question asked  by  the  jury poses  no\r\n\nproblem.  It stated in writing:\r\n\n          (1)  Are  we  allowed  to  tack  on   (or\r\n          provide)  interest  to amount  of damages\r\n          that MacDonald is asking for?\r\n\n               If so, can we charge 8%?\r\n\n          After consulting with counsel  the judge replied in\r\n\nwriting:\r\n\n          Interest cannot be  added to any  verdict\r\n          by the jury.\r\n\n                              Judge Freedman.\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\n          The  allegation by  the  jury foreman  of a  secret\r\n\ncommunication  was  never  squarely  resolved  on the  merits\r\n\nbecause  the district court ruled  in a motion  to strike the\r\n\naffidavit  that it  had  been  obtained  in violation  of  an\r\n\nexplicit rule prohibiting interviews by counsel, litigants or\r\n\nagents except  under the  supervision of the  district court.\r\n\nSee United States v.  Kepreos, 759 F.2d 961, 967  (1st Cir.),\r                                         \r\n\ncert.  denied,  474 U.S.  901 (1985).    We concluded  that a\r                         \r\n\ncomplete  record was  necessary for  a fair  determination of\r\n\nthis  issue  and that  the  district  court should  determine\r\n\nwhether there was any private communication as alleged by the\r\n\njury   and,  if   so,  the   circumstances   surrounding  the\r\n\ncommunication.\r\n\n          We,   therefore,   issued   an    order   retaining\r\n\njurisdiction and \r\n\n          remanding to the  district court for  the\r\n          limited  purpose  of determining  whether\r\n          the    alleged   private    communication\r\n          occurred    and,    if   so,    in   what\r\n          circumstances.  A new district judge will\r\n          be  assigned  by the  chief judge  of the\r\n          district court for the limited purpose of\r\n          conducting this proceeding.\r\n\n          Judge Douglas Woodlock was assigned by Chief  Judge\r\n\nTauro of the U.S. District Court of  Massachusetts to conduct\r\n\nthe proceeding.  On May 2, Judge Woodlock took testimony from\r\n\nthe  jury  foreman,  Lavallee, two  district  court  security\r\n\nofficers,  a deputy  U.S. Marshal,  and the  courtroom deputy\r\n\nclerk to Judge Freedman during the trial.\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\n          On May 6 testimony was taken from six other jurors.\r\n\nOne of  the jurors had left the state and no attempt was made\r\n\nto obtain her  testimony.   Testimony was also  taken on  the\r\n\nsame  day from  Frank  Lombard,  president  of M&amp;J,  and  the\r\n\ncourtroom deputy clerk for the proceeding.  At the conclusion\r\n\nof  this evidentiary  hearing;  Judge  Woodlock informed  the\r\n\nparties  of   his  intention   to  give  Judge   Freedman  an\r\n\nopportunity to  state his recollection of  the allegations in\r\n\nthe  Lavallee  affidavit.   Counsel  was  advised that  after\r\n\nreviewing  Judge  Freedman's  statement  they  would  have an\r\n\nopportunity to interrogate him.\r\n\n          In the meantime, counsel had advised Judge Woodlock\r\n\nthat Judge Freedman's  law clerk  at the time  of the  trial,\r\n\nKenneth B. Walton, might have relevant evidence to offer.  On\r\n\nMay 21, Mr. Walton's  evidence was taken.  At  the conclusion\r\n\nof this hearing the parties informed Judge Woodlock that they\r\n\nsought  no  other testimony  and that  they  did not  wish to\r\n\ninterrogate Judge Freedman.\r\n\n          Judge Woodlock made the following ultimate finding:\r\n\n             Based upon my review of  the materials\r\n          of record  in this case  and the evidence\r\n          adduced   at  the   evidentiary  hearings\r\n          pursuant  to my  assignment, I find  as a\r\n          matter   of  fact  that  after  the  jury\r\n          retired  to  begin  its deliberations  in\r\n          this  case  on  November  17,  1994,  and\r\n          before  it  returned  with  its  verdict,\r\n          Judge    Freedman     had    no    secret\r\n          communication with the  jury outside  the\r\n          presence   of   counsel.       The   only\r\n          communication Judge Freedman had with the\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\n          deliberating jury involved the receipt of\r\n          a  jury   question  concerning  interest,\r\n          which   he   shared  with   counsel,  and\r\n          responded  to in writing, pursuant to his\r\n          standard    practice    regarding    such\r\n          inquiries.\r\n\n           We  have  reviewed  carefully  the record  of  the\r\n\nevidentiary hearings held by  Judge Woodlock and the detailed\r\n\nsubsidiary findings  he made.   We unhesitatingly  affirm his\r\n\nultimate finding and his underlying subsidiary findings.4 \r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          The judgments of the  district court in both trials\r\n\nare affirmed.\r                affirmed\r                        \r\n\n          No costs to either party.\r                      No costs to either party.\r                                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  In view of Judge Woodlock's findings, we need not address\r\nthe question of whether  the initial contacts between Lombard\r\nand Lavallee,  and the subsequent securing  of the affidavit,\r\nviolated   the  mandate   of  Kepreos,   759  F.2d   at  967.\r                                                 \r\nAccordingly, we express no opinion on that question.\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n",

CIGNA has raised two issues on appeal which are common to both trials:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Whether the district court erred in refusing to grant its motions for judgment as a matter of law on M &amp; J's breach of contract claim at the conclusion of both trials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Whether the district court erred in ruling that M &amp; J's claims \"were not barred or diminished\" for its failure to exhaust its administrative remedies provided under Mass.

The relevant evidence which was substantially the same for both trials is summarized as follows.  Frank Lombard, president and owner of M &amp; J, testified that M &amp; J encountered serious financial problems when the Bank of New England collapsed causing M &amp; J's line of credit to terminate on May 30, 1991.  Lombard testified that it was usual for M &amp; J, and other insurance agencies, to use bank loans to meet its premium obligations to insurance companies for premiums owed by the insureds.  In other words, the agency would carry its clients by borrowing money from a bank, pay the premiums due the company and wait for payments from the clients.  The collapse of the Bank of New England stripped M &amp; J of any cash reserves.  Lombard testified that other insurance companies with whom M &amp; J did business agreed to accept monthly installment premium payments or extended the due date for the payment of premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another factor that impacted on M &amp; J's financial condition was the loss of its biggest insurance account, F.L. Roberts Co.  (\"Roberts\").  Premiums on this account amounted to between $800,000.00 and $1,000,000.00 a year.  Roberts was a large wholesaler and retailer of petroleum products and operator of service stations and car washes in southern New England.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence discloses the following sequence of events.  Lombard was an insurance consultant for Roberts, not an agent, from 1979 through 1986.  In late 1986, Roberts did not have a carrier for 1987.  Lombard suggested that Roberts try to obtain insurance coverage for a three-year period with the premiums being determined on the basis of the carrier's expenses and Roberts' losses.  Under such a program the insured, who paid a deposit premium initially, might be owed refunds by the carrier at the end of the insurance year or vice versa.  The amount due either the carrier or Roberts would be determined each year.  In January of 1987, such a program was entered into between Roberts and CIGNA for three years with M &amp; J acting as agent.  The amount of premiums due would be determined in September 1988, 1989, and 1990.  In July or August of 1990 Lombard calculated that CIGNA owed Roberts $200,000.00 under the program.  He contacted CIGNA on September 30, 1990, and was told that it would look into it.  Lombard called the CIGNA department in charge of the program and was reprimanded for doing so.  A new program was set to go into effect in January of 1991.  The down payment required by CIGNA from Roberts was $250,000.00.  Roberts informed Lombard that it would not pay the $250,000.00 unless it was credited with the $200,000.00 refund.  Laurie Scanlan, who worked in the special risk division of CIGNA, acknowledged that CIGNA owed Roberts money under the program, but would not pay it because she asserted that Roberts also owed a surcharge of $56,000.00.  Lombard told Scanlan the surcharge was not part of the insurance program.  She told him to collect it.  He refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inter-office CIGNA memo states its position:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Per our discussion, the following strategy will be utilized in solving the F.L. Roberts FVC surcharge dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Number one, Insured Meeting.

Roberts is willing to pay the FVC surcharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Number five, Refusal to Pay.  Legally, we cannot enforce the payment of the FVC surcharge.  Therefore, back-off if they refuse to pay.  But we should then seriously consider non-renewal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hopefully, we can satisfy our insured and collect the surcharge at the same time.  Good luck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J expected a proposal from CIGNA for the 1992 Roberts insurance program.  Scanlan was supposed to work up the figures.  Lombard received a letter from Scanlan on December 16, stating that CIGNA would not negotiate renewal terms unless CIGNA was paid the 1991 premiums due.  The letter further stated that CIGNA would issue cancellation notices the next day, but if Roberts paid CIGNA within ten days, the notices would be rescinded.  Roberts' insurance was cancelled as per the letter.  Lombard immediately faxed to CIGNA a statement by CIGNA showing a credit due Roberts of $28,903.58 as of December 20, 1991.  After the fax, CIGNA reinstated Roberts' insurance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA sent a renewal proposal for 1992 that cost about $500,000.00 more than the prior program.  Lombard was given until noon the next day to make up his mind.  He found the proposal totally unacceptable.  Lombard tried to work out an alternative program with CIGNA.  With the permission of Joann White of CIGNA, he issued temporary binders effective January 1, 1992.  Scanlan notified Roberts that the temporary policies were not valid.  Lombard received a letter from Scanlan that a new agent, Palmer Goodell Insurance, would be Roberts' new broker unless Lombard was notified otherwise by the close of business on January 17.  No such notification was received.  M &amp; J's commissions on the Roberts account amounted to about $80,000.00 per year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third aspect of the evidence involved two unexecuted promissory notes from M &amp; J to CIGNA.  As M &amp; J's financial problems increased, it approached CIGNA and asked to pay the premiums due in twelve regular monthly installments.  CIGNA told M &amp; J in September of 1991 that it would draw up a promissory note providing for payment of the past due premiums in regular monthly installments.  The note was brought to Lombard by Charles Glaser on February 6, 1992.  Lombard approved it orally, but did not sign it because the word \"draft\" was written across the top of it.  This note had a principal sum of $115,507.05.  During his discussion with Glaser, Lombard told him about the Roberts account.  Glaser asked Lombard what he was planning to do.  Lombard replied, \"I don't know, I'm seeking a legal remedy.\"   A second note was presented to Lombard on March 23 by Robert Purdy.  The principal was $105,324.14, but the payment terms and interest were the same as the first note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This note, however, included a waiver and release of all claims that M &amp; J might have against CIGNA.  Lombard, still smarting because of the loss of the Roberts account, refused to sign the note.  Remmy Martens, a marketing official for CIGNA, who had dealt with Lombard for an appreciable length of time, told Purdy at the time the waiver and release were added to the note that, based on his knowledge of Lombard, Purdy would have difficulty getting Lombard to sign the note as redrafted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA cancelled its agency contract with M &amp; J forthwith after Lombard refused to sign the note.  It shut down all of M &amp; J's computers wired into the CIGNA net.  It put all of the policies heretofore handled by M &amp; J on direct billing;  i.e., premiums were paid directly to CIGNA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J notified CIGNA that the forthwith cancellation was prohibited by Massachusetts law, which it was.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 163 prohibits the cancellation of an agency contract without 180 days notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After CIGNA checked the Massachusetts statute, it deferred the cancellation for 180 days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that CIGNA breached the agency contract with M &amp; J. The evidence provided two grounds for such a finding.  One, that the \"forthwith\" cancellation was contrary to Massachusetts law, of which CIGNA must be presumed to have knowledge.  It also could be found that CIGNA cancelled its agency contract with M &amp; J by refusing to honor the binders that one of its officials (White) had authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>The Application of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 163</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue does not merit extended discussion.  CIGNA claims \"that the unexhausted administrative remedy available under M.G.L. ch. 175, Sec. 163 eclipsed or diminished M &amp; J's claim for damages.\"   CIGNA brief at 37.  First, we do not understand what the terms \"eclipsed or diminished\" mean in the context of this case.  The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>Except as otherwise provided herein, any agent receiving notice of such cancellation, modification or expiration MAY, within fifteen days after receipt thereof, make a written demand for reference to three referees of the question as to whether or not such cancellation, modification or expiration will so affect the renewal, continuation or replacement of any policies placed with the company through the efforts of the agent, or the services needed by any policyholder doing business with the company as a result of the efforts of the agent, as to justify renewal or continuation of any policies then in effect having been placed with such company by such agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It cannot be reasonably doubted that the statute is permissive.  M &amp; J had no duty to invoke it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA has cited no cases holding even tangentially that the statute applies in a situation similar to the one that confronts us.  The two cases it cites are completely inapposite;  they involve different statutes and different claims.  We have been unable to find any cases in this Circuit or in Massachusetts requiring an agent to invoke Mass.  Gen. L. Ch. 175 &#167; 163 prior to asserting claims against an insurance company, and CIGNA has cited none.  CIGNA's argument is without merit.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE FIRST TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered a new trial for three reasons.  It ruled that the jury finding that M &amp; J had not breached its contract with CIGNA to pay premiums as due \"is against the clear weight of the evidence and enforcing it would result in a miscarriage of justice.\"   The court found that the jury \"rendered an improper 'sympathy' verdict.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that the amount awarded M &amp; J on its breach of contract claim was \"outrageous.\"   It held that M &amp; J \"failed to introduce evidence at trial that established its entitlement to over $700,000 in damages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court set aside the jury verdict awarding $500,000.00 to M &amp; J for intentional interference by CIGNA with M &amp; J's contractual relations with Roberts.  It ruled:  that \"there was no evidence of a contract between M &amp; J and Roberts;\" that \"even if there was a contract ... there was no evidence that CIGNA knowingly induced Roberts to break that contract,\" and that M &amp; J failed to show that even if there was a contract and interference with it by CIGNA, M &amp; J \"failed to show that CIGNA's interference was improper in motive or means.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fine, after considering the jury's verdict in conjunction with its ruling on CIGNA's breach of contract claim, above, the Court surmises that the jury's decision on the MacDonald &amp; Johnson breach of contract claim \"could only have been a sympathy\" verdict.  See Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., 915 F.2d at 767.   In addition, because the issues of liability and damages are so interwoven both issues must be re-tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J, as would be expected, objects strenuously to the district court's rulings and findings.  We discuss them seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>The Jury Verdict that M &amp; J did not Breach its Contract with CIGNA</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is, could the evidence lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion.  Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.1993).  We think so.  As the district court pointed out in its memorandum opinion, the evidence was clear and not disputed by M &amp; J that it owed CIGNA about $111,000.00 in premiums.  This evidence came not only from CIGNA but from the testimony of John Januska, the comptroller and assistant treasurer of M &amp; J. He stated that there was no question that $111,000.00 was due CIGNA in July of 1991.  And although strictly speaking it was not evidence, counsel for M &amp; J told the jury in his opening statement that premiums due CIGNA had not been paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its appellate argument, M &amp; J seeks to shift the focus from the agency contract to the unexecuted promissory notes.  It contends that the notes constituted a modification of the agency contract and that both parties agreed to payment of the overdue premiums in monthly installments.  Lombard testified that he agreed to the terms of the first note and that CIGNA did also.  CIGNA says that the first note was only a tentative proposal for Lombard's consideration and therefore the note was not signed by the parties.  Lombard refused to sign the second note, the one with the added waiver and release.  Lombard's assumption that he would be given an opportunity to pay the premiums owed CIGNA in monthly installments may have caused him not to pursue other options for payment, but it is not a valid basis for finding either a modification of the agency contract or a new contract between the parties.  Such a finding is foreclosed by the two unexecuted promissory notes.  The district court did not err in ruling that the jury's verdict was contrary to the evidence and upholding it would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is another reason for upholding the district court on this issue.  Early in the second trial the parties stipulated that judgment would be entered for CIGNA against M &amp; J on CIGNA's breach of contract claim in the amount of $169,798.14 plus interest.  By so doing, M &amp; J waived any objections to CIGNA's contract claim in the first trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>The Amount of Damages Awarded on M &amp; J's Breach of Contract</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Claim Against CIGNA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded M &amp; J $780,000.00 on its breach of contract claim.  The court set this aside because M &amp; J's evidence failed to establish that it was entitled to over $700,000.00 in damages and because it was a \"sympathy\" verdict.  Lombard estimated that he lost a little over $200,000.00 as a result of the termination of the agency contract by CIGNA.  He managed to salvage $30,000.00 to $40,000.00, making a net loss of $160,000.00.  In addition, Lombard testified that he lost $161,158.00 on his commercial accounts, $39,046.00 on \"Market Dyne\" Business, and a $215,490.00 loss was sustained on personal accounts.  The loss of commissions on the Roberts account came to $80,000.00, and there was a loss of profit sharing with CIGNA amounting to $44,000.00.  Lombard testified that his salary dropped about $60,000.00 a year after the CIGNA termination.  These figures, even if taken at face value and with no allowance for what appears to be double counting, total $699,694.00, not including the reduction in Lombard's salary.  The suit was brought in the name of M &amp; J so we do not think that Lombard's reduction in salary is a proper item to be considered.  Thus, the total amount of damages, taking Lombard's testimony at face value, did not, as the district court pointed out, exceed $700,000.00.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not error for the district court to set aside as excessive the breach of contract damages awarded M &amp; J. We point out that the court found that the verdict on damages for M &amp; J was infected by the jury's complete disregard of the evidence on CIGNA's breach of contract claim.  This appears to be a sensible assessment of the first jury's verdict.  The second jury was not so influenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>The Jury Award of $500,000.00 for CIGNA's Intentional</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>Interference with M &amp; J's Contractual Relationship</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>with Roberts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly applied Massachusetts law to a claim for intentional interference with contractual relations.  The party making the claim must prove four elements:  (1) that there was a contract with a third party;  (2) that defendant knowingly induced that party to break the contract;  (3) that defendant's interference was intentional and improper in motive or means;  and (4) that the claimant was harmed by defendant's action.  Wright v. Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children, 412 Mass. 469, 476, 589 N.E.2d 1241, 1245 (1992);  see also G.S. Enterprises, Inc. v. Falmouth Marine, Inc., 410 Mass. 262, 272, 571 N.E.2d 1363, 1369 (1991);  United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, 406 Mass. 811, 812, 551 N.E.2d 20, 21 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading of the record confirms the ruling of the district court that there was no contract between Roberts and M &amp; J. A long-standing business relationship does not become a contractual relationship automatically, as M &amp; J seems to argue.  The last insurance program issued to Roberts by CIGNA through M &amp; J was for a term of three years.  None of the parties had a contractual obligation to continue the insurance coverage after its term expired.  The evidence suggests strongly that Roberts decided to use a broker other than M &amp; J because it would be less expensive.  There was also evidence that one of the owners of the new agency was a neighbor of the president of Roberts.  We need go no further than the lack of a contract between Roberts and M &amp; J to uphold the ruling of the district court setting aside the jury verdict awarding M &amp; J $500,000.00 for intentional interference with a contractual relationship by CIGNA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial the court reserved to itself the decision on the claim by M &amp; J against CIGNA for violations of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93A. It found in favor of CIGNA.  M &amp; J moved for a new trial.  Our review of the record reveals no basis for reversing the judgment of the district court.  We do not find it necessary to delve into the nuances of chapter 93A law.  Suffice it to say that the sparsity of the evidence was a firm basis for the court to conclude that M &amp; J had failed to meet its burden of proof on its 93A claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>Denial of M &amp; J's Motion to Amend Count III of its Counterclaim</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue requires some exposition.  Count III of M &amp; J's counterclaim was entitled, \"Intentional Interference with Economic Gain.\"  In a pretrial memorandum and order dated February 17, 1993, the district court said:Defendant's third counterclaim against CIGNA admittedly is mislabeled, but this problem is not fatal.  The Court will interpret the cause of action as one for intentional interference with advantageous business relations, a claim recognized by the Massachusetts courts.2 Here, too, defendant has pleaded the requisite elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The footnote stated:  \"Defendant shall amend its counterclaim within ten days, substituting the correct nomenclature.\"   Inexplicably, M &amp; J did not amend the counterclaim as ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a pretrial conference on the day the trial started, the court pointed out to M &amp; J's counsel that the counterclaim had not been amended as ordered.  The attorney said:  \"I thought that was right in there.\"   The court replied, \"No.\" The judge's law clerk then said, \"According to the documents, that was never filed.\"   The attorney responded by saying, \"Okay.\"  No objection was taken nor was permission requested to amend the counterclaim nunc pro tunc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the conclusion of the trial, M &amp; J moved to amend its counterclaim.  The motion was denied as untimely, but the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event that this case is re-tried, the Court will reconsider MacDonald &amp; Johnson's request to amend its pleadings to include a claim for intentional interference with advantageous business relations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six days prior to the second trial, M &amp; J filed a motion to amend their counterclaim to include a claim for intentional interference with advantageous business relations.  The court denied the motion on timeliness grounds, also noting that the pleadings failed to allege facts to support the claim, that CIGNA presented no evidence at the first trial (nor offered any at the second) to support the inference that CIGNA knowingly induced Roberts to break its contract with M &amp; J or that any interference by CIGNA was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.  A district court, in denying such leave, may properly consider a party's undue delay, repeated failures to cure deficiencies in the pleadings, and the futility of the proposed amendment.  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).  Without deciding whether CIGNA had presented evidence at the first trial sufficient to enable a jury to find an intentional interference with advantageous business relations, we hold that the district court acted within its discretion in denying the motion to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court told M &amp; J before the first trial that its complaint should be amended if M &amp; J wanted it considered;  M &amp; J failed to do so.  It was proper for the judge to deny leave to amend after the first trial where counsel was instructed to amend the complaint, failed to do so, and failed to correct this error when it was pointed out by the court.  Having left an opening for M &amp; J to try again, the court could well find that M &amp; J had failed to exercise proper diligence because it waited virtually until the eve of trial before submitting its motion to amend.  Under these circumstances, we will not disturb the ruling of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Second Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already explained, the second jury trial was limited to M &amp; J's breach of contract claim against CIGNA.  M &amp; J moved for a new trial, which was denied.  Both parties object to the damages award so we start with that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA attacks the damages on two grounds:  that the evidence should not have been admitted because it was based on hearsay and speculation and that the award was too high.  M &amp; J asserts that the award was too low because the court improperly limited M &amp; J's damages to the period from the initial date of cancellation of the agency contract, to October 15, 1992, the extended date of cancellation required under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before discussing the claims of the parties, we rehearse the evidence on damages as reported in the second trial transcript.  The evidence on damages came in through the testimony of Frank Lombard.  He testified essentially as follows.  Up to 1992, M &amp; J's average commissions on premiums it received was \"in the $250,000 a year range.\"   After the cancellation, clients of M &amp; J who were insured by CIGNA were sent letters notifying them that M &amp; J's contract with CIGNA had been cancelled and all premiums due were to be paid directly to CIGNA.  Most of these clients did not renew their policies with M &amp; J. Lombard kept a record of all such clients.  From the date of the initial cancellation, April 2, 1992, to October 15, 1992, premiums from the affected clients aggregated $1,720,495.00;  M &amp; J's loss in commissions totalled $201,294.00.  This was broken down into three categories:  commercial commissions--$175,138.00;  Market Dyne commissions--$13,281.00;  and personal commissions--$12,875.00.  In addition, M &amp; J lost its annual profit sharing income from CIGNA of $12,871.00.  Lombard further testified that the commission loss to the end of the year would have been $215,393.00.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Lombard testified that loss of commissions was the same as loss of profits and that M &amp; J had a renewal rate of 93% on insurance policies purchased through it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He started to testify about future loss of profits when there was an objection followed by a bench conference.  The court reminded counsel for M &amp; J that it had limited damages to October 15, 1992.  M &amp; J's counsel made an offer of proof that damages would be $215,000.00 in lost commissions a year plus loss of profit sharing of $56,000.00 for a total of $271,000.00 a year \"ad infinitum.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis of M &amp; J's objection to the court's ruling on damages with the observation that it is obvious that an \"ad infinitum\" claim for damages has no basis in law and confounds common sense.  Confining our analysis, however, to the claim by M &amp; J that the court's ruling that no damages could be awarded after October 15, 1992, was error, we point out that the transcript of the jury instructions shows that no such instruction was given.  The court left it entirely up to the jury to determine the period of time for which damages could be awarded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>In considering any claim for loss of anticipated profits resulting from a breach of contract, you should consider the length of time that parties had a right to expect to receive the benefits of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you determine the contract was only for a certain period of time, or could be terminated by notice to the other party after a certain period, you may only award damages for losses incurred during that limited period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA did not object to the failure of the court to limit the time period for awarding damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J argues that this unexpected volte-face by the court on damages prevented it from introducing more extensive evidence on damages.  The answer to this is that Lombard testified:  \"Your [sic] damages are, our loss of commission both for 1992, and these people, based on our experience, would have renewed their insurance each year and these customers are gone.\"   It is hard to see what additional evidence could have been introduced.  This sum of $271,000.00 for annual lost profits was in evidence for the jury to consider and there was no restriction in the charge limiting the period of damages.  We have read the final argument for M &amp; J carefully and there is no discussion in it of any time-period limitations on damages.  The attorney for M &amp; J, without objection, stated, \"a whole year's commission was $215,000, not 201.\"   Based on the evidence before the jury and the court's instructions, we find that M &amp; J was not prejudiced by the court's bench ruling that damages could not be awarded after October 15, 1992, because this ruling was not conveyed to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not impressed by CIGNA's objections that the evidence on damages was based on speculation and hearsay and should have been excluded.  As the court pointed out, Lombard's testimony was based on his own records and experience in the insurance business.  That the testimony was self-serving went to its credibility not its admissibility.  Lombard was subjected to rigorous cross-examination on damages and CIGNA introduced testimony through experts that contradicted Lombard's testimony.  The jury's verdict of $250,000.00 in damages for M &amp; J strikes us as a reasonable assessment of the evidence.  Moreover, even if Lombard's testimony was hearsay in part, it did not affect the verdict.  The $250,000.00 award could only have been for the year 1992.  As to what happened to M &amp; J's clients in 1992, Lombard had first-hand information.  He testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>A.  I kept track from the day this event occurred in March of 1992.  I was the one in charge.  I was the one that talked to the people that got the letter from CIGNA.  I was the one that handled all the commercial accounts, so I knew who was affected by that action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any violation of the hearsay rule was de minimis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA's other objection that the award was too high does not fare any better.  CIGNA argues that Lombard testified only as to lost revenues but ignored the other side of the ledger--savings in ongoing expenses--thus, the damages were higher than what normally would be the case.  Lombard did testify specifically, however, that M &amp; J's expenses did not contract after the loss of the Roberts account but continued at the same level.  He testified that no one was terminated, and that expenses continued at the same rate.  Lombard was cross-examined intensively on this point but did not give ground.  It was well within the province of the jury to believe Lombard's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our rulings and findings on damages negate CIGNA's argument that its motion for a remittitur should have been allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Conduct of the Judge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J's main attack on the jury verdict is a two-pronged condemnation of the conduct of the district judge.  It asserts that the judge should have recused himself from presiding over the second trial because of bias and prejudice against M &amp; J. It also accuses the judge of secretly communicating with the jury during its deliberations.  These are serious charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Recusal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its motion for recusal filed prior to the second trial, M &amp; J states three specific reasons for recusal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>1.  The very nature of a retrial order is such that it should be considered by one other than the original trial judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>2. At the pretrial conference held on March 13, 1994, Judge Freedman stated in open court that he thought that the Defendant, Plaintiff in counterclaim, Frank Lombard, was insincere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>3. At the pretrial conference held on March 13, 1994, Judge Freedman stated in open court that if a jury finds similarly on retrial, that he would order a third trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, M &amp; J has expanded its reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge not only stated his bias, but allowed it to infect his rulings.  As indicated in prior arguments in this brief, he took away verdicts in favor of M &amp; J after the first trial even though there was ample evidence to support them.  In ruling on these motions he denied the existence of evidence of damages which was clearly before the jury.  He failed to apply proper law in finding against M &amp; J for the claim arising out of the loss of the F.L. Roberts account.

M &amp; J has cited no case to this effect and we have found none.  Absent a Local Rule that so provides (and Massachusetts has none), this is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge.  Although there may be circumstances in which a new judge should preside over the second trial, such substitution is not the usual practice.

This alleged secret communication between the judge and jury first surfaced in a conversation between Gary W. Lavallee, foreman of the jury, and Frank Lombard, president of M &amp; J, at a local restaurant three or four weeks after verdict and judgment in the second trial.  The jury foreman subsequently executed a sworn affidavit which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>AFFIDAVIT OF GARY W.

See United States v. Kepreos, 759 F.2d 961, 967 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 901, 106 S.Ct. 227, 88 L.Ed.2d 227 (1985).  We concluded that a complete record was necessary for a fair determination of this issue and that the district court should determine whether there was any private communication as alleged by the jury and, if so, the circumstances surrounding the communication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, therefore, issued an order retaining jurisdiction and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p>remanding to the district court for the limited purpose of determining whether the alleged private communication occurred and, if so, in what circumstances.

On May 2, Judge Woodlock took testimony from the jury foreman, Lavallee, two district court security officers, a deputy U.S. Marshal, and the courtroom deputy clerk to Judge Freedman during the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 6 testimony was taken from six other jurors.  One of the jurors had left the state and no attempt was made to obtain her testimony.  Testimony was also taken on the same day from Frank Lombard, president of M &amp; J, and the courtroom deputy clerk for the proceeding.  At the conclusion of this evidentiary hearing;  Judge Woodlock informed the parties of his intention to give Judge Freedman an opportunity to state his recollection of the allegations in the Lavallee affidavit.  Counsel was advised that after reviewing Judge Freedman's statement they would have an opportunity to interrogate him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, counsel had advised Judge Woodlock that Judge Freedman's law clerk at the time of the trial, Kenneth B.

At the conclusion of this hearing the parties informed Judge Woodlock that they sought no other testimony and that they did not wish to interrogate Judge Freedman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Woodlock made the following ultimate finding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon my review of the materials of record in this case and the evidence adduced at the evidentiary hearings pursuant to my assignment, I find as a matter of fact that after the jury retired to begin its deliberations in this case on November 17, 1994, and before it returned with its verdict, Judge Freedman had no secret communication with the jury outside the presence of counsel.  The only communication Judge Freedman had with the deliberating jury involved the receipt of a jury question concerning interest, which he shared with counsel, and responded to in writing, pursuant to his standard practice regarding such inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have reviewed carefully the record of the evidentiary hearings held by Judge Woodlock and the detailed subsidiary findings he made.

The relevant evidence which was substantially the same for both trials is summarized as follows.  Frank Lombard, president and owner of M &amp; J, testified that M &amp; J encountered serious financial problems when the Bank of New England collapsed causing M &amp; J's line of credit to terminate on May 30, 1991.  Lombard testified that it was usual for M &amp; J, and other insurance agencies, to use bank loans to meet its premium obligations to insurance companies for premiums owed by the insureds.  In other words, the agency would carry its clients by borrowing money from a bank, pay the premiums due the company and wait for payments from the clients.  The collapse of the Bank of New England stripped M &amp; J of any cash reserves.  Lombard testified that other insurance companies with whom M &amp; J did business agreed to accept monthly installment premium payments or extended the due date for the payment of premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another factor that impacted on M &amp; J's financial condition was the loss of its biggest insurance account, F.L. Roberts Co.  (\"Roberts\").  Premiums on this account amounted to between $800,000.00 and $1,000,000.00 a year.  Roberts was a large wholesaler and retailer of petroleum products and operator of service stations and car washes in southern New England.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence discloses the following sequence of events.  Lombard was an insurance consultant for Roberts, not an agent, from 1979 through 1986.  In late 1986, Roberts did not have a carrier for 1987.  Lombard suggested that Roberts try to obtain insurance coverage for a three-year period with the premiums being determined on the basis of the carrier's expenses and Roberts' losses.  Under such a program the insured, who paid a deposit premium initially, might be owed refunds by the carrier at the end of the insurance year or vice versa.  The amount due either the carrier or Roberts would be determined each year.  In January of 1987, such a program was entered into between Roberts and CIGNA for three years with M &amp; J acting as agent.  The amount of premiums due would be determined in September 1988, 1989, and 1990.  In July or August of 1990 Lombard calculated that CIGNA owed Roberts $200,000.00 under the program.  He contacted CIGNA on September 30, 1990, and was told that it would look into it.  Lombard called the CIGNA department in charge of the program and was reprimanded for doing so.  A new program was set to go into effect in January of 1991.  The down payment required by CIGNA from Roberts was $250,000.00.  Roberts informed Lombard that it would not pay the $250,000.00 unless it was credited with the $200,000.00 refund.  Laurie Scanlan, who worked in the special risk division of CIGNA, acknowledged that CIGNA owed Roberts money under the program, but would not pay it because she asserted that Roberts also owed a surcharge of $56,000.00.  Lombard told Scanlan the surcharge was not part of the insurance program.  She told him to collect it.  He refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inter-office CIGNA memo states its position:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Per our discussion, the following strategy will be utilized in solving the F.L.

Legally, we cannot enforce the payment of the FVC surcharge.  Therefore, back-off if they refuse to pay.  But we should then seriously consider non-renewal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hopefully, we can satisfy our insured and collect the surcharge at the same time.  Good luck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J expected a proposal from CIGNA for the 1992 Roberts insurance program.  Scanlan was supposed to work up the figures.  Lombard received a letter from Scanlan on December 16, stating that CIGNA would not negotiate renewal terms unless CIGNA was paid the 1991 premiums due.  The letter further stated that CIGNA would issue cancellation notices the next day, but if Roberts paid CIGNA within ten days, the notices would be rescinded.  Roberts' insurance was cancelled as per the letter.  Lombard immediately faxed to CIGNA a statement by CIGNA showing a credit due Roberts of $28,903.58 as of December 20, 1991.  After the fax, CIGNA reinstated Roberts' insurance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA sent a renewal proposal for 1992 that cost about $500,000.00 more than the prior program.  Lombard was given until noon the next day to make up his mind.  He found the proposal totally unacceptable.  Lombard tried to work out an alternative program with CIGNA.  With the permission of Joann White of CIGNA, he issued temporary binders effective January 1, 1992.  Scanlan notified Roberts that the temporary policies were not valid.  Lombard received a letter from Scanlan that a new agent, Palmer Goodell Insurance, would be Roberts' new broker unless Lombard was notified otherwise by the close of business on January 17.  No such notification was received.  M &amp; J's commissions on the Roberts account amounted to about $80,000.00 per year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third aspect of the evidence involved two unexecuted promissory notes from M &amp; J to CIGNA.  As M &amp; J's financial problems increased, it approached CIGNA and asked to pay the premiums due in twelve regular monthly installments.  CIGNA told M &amp; J in September of 1991 that it would draw up a promissory note providing for payment of the past due premiums in regular monthly installments.  The note was brought to Lombard by Charles Glaser on February 6, 1992.  Lombard approved it orally, but did not sign it because the word \"draft\" was written across the top of it.  This note had a principal sum of $115,507.05.  During his discussion with Glaser, Lombard told him about the Roberts account.  Glaser asked Lombard what he was planning to do.  Lombard replied, \"I don't know, I'm seeking a legal remedy.\"   A second note was presented to Lombard on March 23 by Robert Purdy.  The principal was $105,324.14, but the payment terms and interest were the same as the first note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This note, however, included a waiver and release of all claims that M &amp; J might have against CIGNA.  Lombard, still smarting because of the loss of the Roberts account, refused to sign the note.  Remmy Martens, a marketing official for CIGNA, who had dealt with Lombard for an appreciable length of time, told Purdy at the time the waiver and release were added to the note that, based on his knowledge of Lombard, Purdy would have difficulty getting Lombard to sign the note as redrafted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA cancelled its agency contract with M &amp; J forthwith after Lombard refused to sign the note.  It shut down all of M &amp; J's computers wired into the CIGNA net.  It put all of the policies heretofore handled by M &amp; J on direct billing;  i.e., premiums were paid directly to CIGNA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J notified CIGNA that the forthwith cancellation was prohibited by Massachusetts law, which it was.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 163 prohibits the cancellation of an agency contract without 180 days notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After CIGNA checked the Massachusetts statute, it deferred the cancellation for 180 days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that CIGNA breached the agency contract with M &amp; J. The evidence provided two grounds for such a finding.  One, that the \"forthwith\" cancellation was contrary to Massachusetts law, of which CIGNA must be presumed to have knowledge.  It also could be found that CIGNA cancelled its agency contract with M &amp; J by refusing to honor the binders that one of its officials (White) had authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>The Application of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 163</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue does not merit extended discussion.  CIGNA claims \"that the unexhausted administrative remedy available under M.G.L. ch. 175, Sec. 163 eclipsed or diminished M &amp; J's claim for damages.\"   CIGNA brief at 37.  First, we do not understand what the terms \"eclipsed or diminished\" mean in the context of this case.  The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>Except as otherwise provided herein, any agent receiving notice of such cancellation, modification or expiration MAY, within fifteen days after receipt thereof, make a written demand for reference to three referees of the question as to whether or not such cancellation, modification or expiration will so affect the renewal, continuation or replacement of any policies placed with the company through the efforts of the agent, or the services needed by any policyholder doing business with the company as a result of the efforts of the agent, as to justify renewal or continuation of any policies then in effect having been placed with such company by such agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It cannot be reasonably doubted that the statute is permissive.  M &amp; J had no duty to invoke it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA has cited no cases holding even tangentially that the statute applies in a situation similar to the one that confronts us.  The two cases it cites are completely inapposite;  they involve different statutes and different claims.  We have been unable to find any cases in this Circuit or in Massachusetts requiring an agent to invoke Mass.  Gen. L. Ch. 175 &#167; 163 prior to asserting claims against an insurance company, and CIGNA has cited none.  CIGNA's argument is without merit.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE FIRST TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered a new trial for three reasons.  It ruled that the jury finding that M &amp; J had not breached its contract with CIGNA to pay premiums as due \"is against the clear weight of the evidence and enforcing it would result in a miscarriage of justice.\"   The court found that the jury \"rendered an improper 'sympathy' verdict.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that the amount awarded M &amp; J on its breach of contract claim was \"outrageous.\"   It held that M &amp; J \"failed to introduce evidence at trial that established its entitlement to over $700,000 in damages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court set aside the jury verdict awarding $500,000.00 to M &amp; J for intentional interference by CIGNA with M &amp; J's contractual relations with Roberts.  It ruled:  that \"there was no evidence of a contract between M &amp; J and Roberts;\" that \"even if there was a contract ... there was no evidence that CIGNA knowingly induced Roberts to break that contract,\" and that M &amp; J failed to show that even if there was a contract and interference with it by CIGNA, M &amp; J \"failed to show that CIGNA's interference was improper in motive or means.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fine, after considering the jury's verdict in conjunction with its ruling on CIGNA's breach of contract claim, above, the Court surmises that the jury's decision on the MacDonald &amp; Johnson breach of contract claim \"could only have been a sympathy\" verdict.  See Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., 915 F.2d at 767.   In addition, because the issues of liability and damages are so interwoven both issues must be re-tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J, as would be expected, objects strenuously to the district court's rulings and findings.  We discuss them seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>The Jury Verdict that M &amp; J did not Breach its Contract with CIGNA</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is, could the evidence lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion.  Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627336\"><a href=\"/opinion/627336/franco-acevedo-diaz-v-jose-e-aponte-ada-n-perez-franco-acevedo-diaz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.1993).  We think so.  As the district court pointed out in its memorandum opinion, the evidence was clear and not disputed by M &amp; J that it owed CIGNA about $111,000.00 in premiums.  This evidence came not only from CIGNA but from the testimony of John Januska, the comptroller and assistant treasurer of M &amp; J. He stated that there was no question that $111,000.00 was due CIGNA in July of 1991.  And although strictly speaking it was not evidence, counsel for M &amp; J told the jury in his opening statement that premiums due CIGNA had not been paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its appellate argument, M &amp; J seeks to shift the focus from the agency contract to the unexecuted promissory notes.  It contends that the notes constituted a modification of the agency contract and that both parties agreed to payment of the overdue premiums in monthly installments.  Lombard testified that he agreed to the terms of the first note and that CIGNA did also.  CIGNA says that the first note was only a tentative proposal for Lombard's consideration and therefore the note was not signed by the parties.  Lombard refused to sign the second note, the one with the added waiver and release.  Lombard's assumption that he would be given an opportunity to pay the premiums owed CIGNA in monthly installments may have caused him not to pursue other options for payment, but it is not a valid basis for finding either a modification of the agency contract or a new contract between the parties.  Such a finding is foreclosed by the two unexecuted promissory notes.  The district court did not err in ruling that the jury's verdict was contrary to the evidence and upholding it would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is another reason for upholding the district court on this issue.  Early in the second trial the parties stipulated that judgment would be entered for CIGNA against M &amp; J on CIGNA's breach of contract claim in the amount of $169,798.14 plus interest.  By so doing, M &amp; J waived any objections to CIGNA's contract claim in the first trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>The Amount of Damages Awarded on M &amp; J's Breach of Contract</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Claim Against CIGNA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded M &amp; J $780,000.00 on its breach of contract claim.  The court set this aside because M &amp; J's evidence failed to establish that it was entitled to over $700,000.00 in damages and because it was a \"sympathy\" verdict.  Lombard estimated that he lost a little over $200,000.00 as a result of the termination of the agency contract by CIGNA.  He managed to salvage $30,000.00 to $40,000.00, making a net loss of $160,000.00.  In addition, Lombard testified that he lost $161,158.00 on his commercial accounts, $39,046.00 on \"Market Dyne\" Business, and a $215,490.00 loss was sustained on personal accounts.  The loss of commissions on the Roberts account came to $80,000.00, and there was a loss of profit sharing with CIGNA amounting to $44,000.00.  Lombard testified that his salary dropped about $60,000.00 a year after the CIGNA termination.  These figures, even if taken at face value and with no allowance for what appears to be double counting, total $699,694.00, not including the reduction in Lombard's salary.  The suit was brought in the name of M &amp; J so we do not think that Lombard's reduction in salary is a proper item to be considered.  Thus, the total amount of damages, taking Lombard's testimony at face value, did not, as the district court pointed out, exceed $700,000.00.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not error for the district court to set aside as excessive the breach of contract damages awarded M &amp; J. We point out that the court found that the verdict on damages for M &amp; J was infected by the jury's complete disregard of the evidence on CIGNA's breach of contract claim.  This appears to be a sensible assessment of the first jury's verdict.

A long-standing business relationship does not become a contractual relationship automatically, as M &amp; J seems to argue.  The last insurance program issued to Roberts by CIGNA through M &amp; J was for a term of three years.  None of the parties had a contractual obligation to continue the insurance coverage after its term expired.  The evidence suggests strongly that Roberts decided to use a broker other than M &amp; J because it would be less expensive.  There was also evidence that one of the owners of the new agency was a neighbor of the president of Roberts.  We need go no further than the lack of a contract between Roberts and M &amp; J to uphold the ruling of the district court setting aside the jury verdict awarding M &amp; J $500,000.00 for intentional interference with a contractual relationship by CIGNA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial the court reserved to itself the decision on the claim by M &amp; J against CIGNA for violations of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  93A. It found in favor of CIGNA.  M &amp; J moved for a new trial.  Our review of the record reveals no basis for reversing the judgment of the district court.  We do not find it necessary to delve into the nuances of chapter 93A law.  Suffice it to say that the sparsity of the evidence was a firm basis for the court to conclude that M &amp; J had failed to meet its burden of proof on its 93A claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>Denial of M &amp; J's Motion to Amend Count III of its Counterclaim</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue requires some exposition.  Count III of M &amp; J's counterclaim was entitled, \"Intentional Interference with Economic Gain.\"  In a pretrial memorandum and order dated February 17, 1993, the district court said:Defendant's third counterclaim against CIGNA admittedly is mislabeled, but this problem is not fatal.  The Court will interpret the cause of action as one for intentional interference with advantageous business relations, a claim recognized by the Massachusetts courts.2 Here, too, defendant has pleaded the requisite elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The footnote stated:  \"Defendant shall amend its counterclaim within ten days, substituting the correct nomenclature.\"   Inexplicably, M &amp; J did not amend the counterclaim as ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a pretrial conference on the day the trial started, the court pointed out to M &amp; J's counsel that the counterclaim had not been amended as ordered.  The attorney said:  \"I thought that was right in there.\"   The court replied, \"No.\" The judge's law clerk then said, \"According to the documents, that was never filed.\"   The attorney responded by saying, \"Okay.\"  No objection was taken nor was permission requested to amend the counterclaim nunc pro tunc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the conclusion of the trial, M &amp; J moved to amend its counterclaim.  The motion was denied as untimely, but the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event that this case is re-tried, the Court will reconsider MacDonald &amp; Johnson's request to amend its pleadings to include a claim for intentional interference with advantageous business relations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six days prior to the second trial, M &amp; J filed a motion to amend their counterclaim to include a claim for intentional interference with advantageous business relations.  The court denied the motion on timeliness grounds, also noting that the pleadings failed to allege facts to support the claim, that CIGNA presented no evidence at the first trial (nor offered any at the second) to support the inference that CIGNA knowingly induced Roberts to break its contract with M &amp; J or that any interference by CIGNA was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.  A district court, in denying such leave, may properly consider a party's undue delay, repeated failures to cure deficiencies in the pleadings, and the futility of the proposed amendment.  Foman v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1962).  Without deciding whether CIGNA had presented evidence at the first trial sufficient to enable a jury to find an intentional interference with advantageous business relations, we hold that the district court acted within its discretion in denying the motion to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court told M &amp; J before the first trial that its complaint should be amended if M &amp; J wanted it considered;  M &amp; J failed to do so.  It was proper for the judge to deny leave to amend after the first trial where counsel was instructed to amend the complaint, failed to do so, and failed to correct this error when it was pointed out by the court.  Having left an opening for M &amp; J to try again, the court could well find that M &amp; J had failed to exercise proper diligence because it waited virtually until the eve of trial before submitting its motion to amend.  Under these circumstances, we will not disturb the ruling of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Second Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already explained, the second jury trial was limited to M &amp; J's breach of contract claim against CIGNA.  M &amp; J moved for a new trial, which was denied.  Both parties object to the damages award so we start with that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA attacks the damages on two grounds:  that the evidence should not have been admitted because it was based on hearsay and speculation and that the award was too high.  M &amp; J asserts that the award was too low because the court improperly limited M &amp; J's damages to the period from the initial date of cancellation of the agency contract, to October 15, 1992, the extended date of cancellation required under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before discussing the claims of the parties, we rehearse the evidence on damages as reported in the second trial transcript.  The evidence on damages came in through the testimony of Frank Lombard.  He testified essentially as follows.  Up to 1992, M &amp; J's average commissions on premiums it received was \"in the $250,000 a year range.\"   After the cancellation, clients of M &amp; J who were insured by CIGNA were sent letters notifying them that M &amp; J's contract with CIGNA had been cancelled and all premiums due were to be paid directly to CIGNA.  Most of these clients did not renew their policies with M &amp; J. Lombard kept a record of all such clients.  From the date of the initial cancellation, April 2, 1992, to October 15, 1992, premiums from the affected clients aggregated $1,720,495.00;  M &amp; J's loss in commissions totalled $201,294.00.  This was broken down into three categories:  commercial commissions--$175,138.00;  Market Dyne commissions--$13,281.00;  and personal commissions--$12,875.00.  In addition, M &amp; J lost its annual profit sharing income from CIGNA of $12,871.00.  Lombard further testified that the commission loss to the end of the year would have been $215,393.00.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Lombard testified that loss of commissions was the same as loss of profits and that M &amp; J had a renewal rate of 93% on insurance policies purchased through it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He started to testify about future loss of profits when there was an objection followed by a bench conference.  The court reminded counsel for M &amp; J that it had limited damages to October 15, 1992.  M &amp; J's counsel made an offer of proof that damages would be $215,000.00 in lost commissions a year plus loss of profit sharing of $56,000.00 for a total of $271,000.00 a year \"ad infinitum.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis of M &amp; J's objection to the court's ruling on damages with the observation that it is obvious that an \"ad infinitum\" claim for damages has no basis in law and confounds common sense.  Confining our analysis, however, to the claim by M &amp; J that the court's ruling that no damages could be awarded after October 15, 1992, was error, we point out that the transcript of the jury instructions shows that no such instruction was given.  The court left it entirely up to the jury to determine the period of time for which damages could be awarded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>In considering any claim for loss of anticipated profits resulting from a breach of contract, you should consider the length of time that parties had a right to expect to receive the benefits of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you determine the contract was only for a certain period of time, or could be terminated by notice to the other party after a certain period, you may only award damages for losses incurred during that limited period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA did not object to the failure of the court to limit the time period for awarding damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J argues that this unexpected volte-face by the court on damages prevented it from introducing more extensive evidence on damages.  The answer to this is that Lombard testified:  \"Your [sic] damages are, our loss of commission both for 1992, and these people, based on our experience, would have renewed their insurance each year and these customers are gone.\"   It is hard to see what additional evidence could have been introduced.  This sum of $271,000.00 for annual lost profits was in evidence for the jury to consider and there was no restriction in the charge limiting the period of damages.  We have read the final argument for M &amp; J carefully and there is no discussion in it of any time-period limitations on damages.  The attorney for M &amp; J, without objection, stated, \"a whole year's commission was $215,000, not 201.\"   Based on the evidence before the jury and the court's instructions, we find that M &amp; J was not prejudiced by the court's bench ruling that damages could not be awarded after October 15, 1992, because this ruling was not conveyed to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not impressed by CIGNA's objections that the evidence on damages was based on speculation and hearsay and should have been excluded.  As the court pointed out, Lombard's testimony was based on his own records and experience in the insurance business.  That the testimony was self-serving went to its credibility not its admissibility.  Lombard was subjected to rigorous cross-examination on damages and CIGNA introduced testimony through experts that contradicted Lombard's testimony.  The jury's verdict of $250,000.00 in damages for M &amp; J strikes us as a reasonable assessment of the evidence.  Moreover, even if Lombard's testimony was hearsay in part, it did not affect the verdict.  The $250,000.00 award could only have been for the year 1992.  As to what happened to M &amp; J's clients in 1992, Lombard had first-hand information.  He testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>A.  I kept track from the day this event occurred in March of 1992.  I was the one in charge.  I was the one that talked to the people that got the letter from CIGNA.  I was the one that handled all the commercial accounts, so I knew who was affected by that action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any violation of the hearsay rule was de minimis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIGNA's other objection that the award was too high does not fare any better.  CIGNA argues that Lombard testified only as to lost revenues but ignored the other side of the ledger--savings in ongoing expenses--thus, the damages were higher than what normally would be the case.  Lombard did testify specifically, however, that M &amp; J's expenses did not contract after the loss of the Roberts account but continued at the same level.  He testified that no one was terminated, and that expenses continued at the same rate.  Lombard was cross-examined intensively on this point but did not give ground.  It was well within the province of the jury to believe Lombard's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our rulings and findings on damages negate CIGNA's argument that its motion for a remittitur should have been allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Conduct of the Judge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J's main attack on the jury verdict is a two-pronged condemnation of the conduct of the district judge.  It asserts that the judge should have recused himself from presiding over the second trial because of bias and prejudice against M &amp; J. It also accuses the judge of secretly communicating with the jury during its deliberations.  These are serious charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Recusal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its motion for recusal filed prior to the second trial, M &amp; J states three specific reasons for recusal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>1.  The very nature of a retrial order is such that it should be considered by one other than the original trial judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>2. At the pretrial conference held on March 13, 1994, Judge Freedman stated in open court that he thought that the Defendant, Plaintiff in counterclaim, Frank Lombard, was insincere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>3. At the pretrial conference held on March 13, 1994, Judge Freedman stated in open court that if a jury finds similarly on retrial, that he would order a third trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, M &amp; J has expanded its reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge not only stated his bias, but allowed it to infect his rulings.  As indicated in prior arguments in this brief, he took away verdicts in favor of M &amp; J after the first trial even though there was ample evidence to support them.  In ruling on these motions he denied the existence of evidence of damages which was clearly before the jury.  He failed to apply proper law in finding against M &amp; J for the claim arising out of the loss of the F.L. Roberts account.  He failed to adhere to the rules of civil procedure regarding notice pending and amendments to pleadings.  He found against M &amp; J on the c. 93A count without making any findings of fact to support his decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J's Brief at 42-43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a) provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the case law to determine when the statute is implicated.

The M/Y Johanny, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195615\"><a href=\"/opinion/195615/el-fenix-v-the-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 140 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No permissible reading of subsection 455(a) would suggest that Congress intended to allow a litigant to compel disqualification simply on unfounded innuendo concerning the possible partiality of the presiding judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis by noting that there is no rule of federal procedure that requires a different judge to preside over a new jury trial ordered by the original trial judge.  M &amp; J has cited no case to this effect and we have found none.  Absent a Local Rule that so provides (and Massachusetts has none), this is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge.  Although there may be circumstances in which a new judge should preside over the second trial, such substitution is not the usual practice.  We find nothing in the record here suggesting circumstances that would make the trial judge think twice about presiding over the new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have affirmed the rulings and findings of the district court setting aside the verdicts in the first trial and ordering a new trial, it would be pointless to discuss the asseverations made by M &amp; J at pages 42 and 43 of its brief.  Our affirmance of the rulings and findings of the district court scotches any bias or prejudice claim on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves for consideration the comments made by the judge at the pre-trial hearing on May 13, 1994.  The record reads as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Well, Mr. Joseph, without even thinking F.L. Roberts what is your client earnestly, sincerely and so forth believe he's entitled to on the breach of contract on the counter-claim?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

JOSEPH:  Well, I have the authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Then, we'll have to talk trial date and go from here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. JOSEPH:  All right, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  And I have to advise you in advance that if a second jury went as far as the first jury went as far as $500,000, the money, I'd take that away as well.  You have to know you're not going to get it.  I don't care what you did.  At least not from this Judge.  You could always take an appeal and see if you could get another trial.  That would be up to the first circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. JOSEPH:  Okay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  I was hoping we might be able to be sincere in our thinking and go somewhere.  Your client is not sincere in my eyes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. JOSEPH:  Judge, I really must disagree with you and I insist my client is very sincere.  Perhaps if you don't think he's sincere you should recuse yourself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  No, I'm saying if he thinks a jury verdict should be given to him if he's not willing to accept and go with another trial, I frankly don't think another jury would go anywhere near that figure.  If they give anything at all.  I'm not even convinced he, they would ever do that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This pre-trial hearing was called by the judge in an attempt to settle the case.  We see nothing in the comments of the judge that would create a reasonable doubt concerning the judge's impartiality in the mind of a reasonable person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p>The Alleged Secret Communication by the Judge with the Jury</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M &amp; J has alleged that the trial judge, without advising counsel, responded in the negative to a question by the jury asking whether it could award damages of more than $240,000.00 to M &amp; J. This alleged secret communication between the judge and jury first surfaced in a conversation between Gary W. Lavallee, foreman of the jury, and Frank Lombard, president of M &amp; J, at a local restaurant three or four weeks after verdict and judgment in the second trial.  The jury foreman subsequently executed a sworn affidavit which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>AFFIDAVIT OF GARY W. LAVALLEE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am Gary W. Lavallee.  My business address is 82 Main Street, West Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I was the foreman of the jury in the case of CIGNA vs.  MacDonald and Johnson Insurance Agency, Inc. in November 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p>Based on our recent conversation regarding your jury award, we the jury sent two questions out to Judge Freedman requesting guidance.  One question specifically asked if we could award damages over and above the $240,000 you had illustrated on the blackboard, to justify for a loss of renewal income.  His reply was that we couldn't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During our deliberation, the whole jury was in complete agreement to awarding additional damages based on loss of renewal income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Signed under the pains and penalties of perjury this 1st  day of March 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p>/s/  Gary W.

Lavallee</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other question asked by the jury poses no problem.  It stated in writing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p>(1) Are we allowed to tack on (or provide) interest to amount of damages that MacDonald is asking for?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p>If so, can we charge 8%?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After consulting with counsel the judge replied in writing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p>Interest cannot be added to any verdict by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p>Judge Freedman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegation by the jury foreman of a secret communication was never squarely resolved on the merits because the district court ruled in a motion to strike the affidavit that it had been obtained in violation of an explicit rule prohibiting interviews by counsel, litigants or agents except under the supervision of the district court.  See United States v. Kepreos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450719\"><a href=\"/opinion/450719/united-states-v-constantine-t-kepreos/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span>, 967 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span> (1985).  We concluded that a complete record was necessary for a fair determination of this issue and that the district court should determine whether there was any private communication as alleged by the jury and, if so, the circumstances surrounding the communication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, therefore, issued an order retaining jurisdiction and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p>remanding to the district court for the limited purpose of determining whether the alleged private communication occurred and, if so, in what circumstances. A new district judge will be assigned by the chief judge of the district court for the limited purpose of conducting this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Douglas Woodlock was assigned by Chief Judge Tauro of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts to conduct the proceeding.  On May 2, Judge Woodlock took testimony from the jury foreman, Lavallee, two district court security officers, a deputy U.S. Marshal, and the courtroom deputy clerk to Judge Freedman during the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 6 testimony was taken from six other jurors.  One of the jurors had left the state and no attempt was made to obtain her testimony.  Testimony was also taken on the same day from Frank Lombard, president of M &amp; J, and the courtroom deputy clerk for the proceeding.  At the conclusion of this evidentiary hearing;  Judge Woodlock informed the parties of his intention to give Judge Freedman an opportunity to state his recollection of the allegations in the Lavallee affidavit.  Counsel was advised that after reviewing Judge Freedman's statement they would have an opportunity to interrogate him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, counsel had advised Judge Woodlock that Judge Freedman's law clerk at the time of the trial, Kenneth B. Walton, might have relevant evidence to offer.  On May 21, Mr. Walton's evidence was taken.  At the conclusion of this hearing the parties informed Judge Woodlock that they sought no other testimony and that they did not wish to interrogate Judge Freedman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Woodlock made the following ultimate finding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon my review of the materials of record in this case and the evidence adduced at the evidentiary hearings pursuant to my assignment, I find as a matter of fact that after the jury retired to begin its deliberations in this case on November 17, 1994, and before it returned with its verdict, Judge Freedman had no secret communication with the jury outside the presence of counsel.  The only communication Judge Freedman had with the deliberating jury involved the receipt of a jury question concerning interest, which he shared with counsel, and responded to in writing, pursuant to his standard practice regarding such inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have reviewed carefully the record of the evidentiary hearings held by Judge Woodlock and the detailed subsidiary findings he made.  We unhesitatingly affirm his ultimate finding and his underlying subsidiary findings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgments of the district court in both trials are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No costs to either party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is no explanation in the record as to the difference between the principal in each note</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> No company shall cancel the authority of any independent insurance agent for fire or casualty insurance, or both, if said agent is not an employee of said company and no company shall modify a contract with such an agent unless the company gives written notice of its intent to cancel such agent or its intent to modify such contract at least one hundred and eighty days before the proposed effective date of any such cancellation or modification</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> These amounts are considerably lower than the items of damages claimed in the first trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In view of Judge Woodlock's findings, we need not address the question of whether the initial contacts between Lombard and Lavallee, and the subsequent securing of the affidavit, violated the mandate of Kepreos, 759 F.2d at 967.
