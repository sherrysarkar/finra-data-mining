Castro-Gómez\n\nappeals the denial by the district court of his motion to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea. Castro-Gómez allegedly was unaware that the only possible\n\nsentence for a person with his criminal history under the \"three\n\nstrikes\" statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3559(c)(1)(A), was life imprisonment.\n\nBecause the district court did not inform appellant, as required by\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1), that he faced a minimum\n\nmandatory life sentence, we reverse.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          On November 12, 1997, a grand jury returned an indictment\n\nagainst César R. Castro-Gómez charging him with: (1) conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 846 and 18 U.S.C. § 2; (2) attempt to import and possess with intent\n\nto distribute cocaine on board a vessel, in violation of 46A U.S.C.\n\n§ 1903(a) and (b)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2; and (3) aiding and abetting\n\nunlawful importation of cocaine into the United States, in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. § 963 and 18 U.S.C. § 2. In the months leading up to trial,\n\nappellant's counsel engaged in plea negotiations with the government\n\nresulting in a motion for a change of plea from not guilty to guilty.\n\nShortly thereafter, the United States Attorney's office determined that\n\nit would not offer appellant a deal and filed an Information stating\n\nthat based on appellant's prior criminal history, it would seek life\n\nimprisonment.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          On March 25, 1998, appellant's change of plea hearing was\n\nheld before the district court. Appellant entered a straight plea of\n\nguilty for the three counts with which he was charged. The district\n\ncourt explained to appellant that each count had a minimum sentence of\n\nten years imprisonment and a maximum of life imprisonment. Appellant\n\nwas told that the sentences could be imposed to run concurrently or\n\nconsecutively and was given examples of possible scenarios. Appellant\n\nstated that no promises or predictions had been made to him regarding\n\nwhat sentence he was likely to receive. No mention of the government's\n\nInformation was made at appellant's change of plea hearing.\n\n          Appellant's sentencing hearing was held on August 17, 1998.\n\nThe government moved for the district court to take into account the\n\nInformation regarding appellant's prior convictions, which would\n\nmandate a sentence of life imprisonment. Appellant's counsel responded\n\nby objecting and stating that she did not know of the filing of the\n\nInformation until she received the pre-sentence report. In addition,\n\nshe stated that had she known that the government was going to file an\n\nInformation, appellant would not have pled guilty. Appellant's counsel\n\nreasoned that if faced with mandatory life imprisonment, appellant had\n\nnothing to lose by going to trial. The government countered that\n\nappellant's counsel had been alerted to the filing of the Information,\n\nas evidenced by the certificate of service. The sentencing hearing was\n\ncontinued with instructions to the parties to clarify their positions.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          The government filed two unsworn statements indicating that\n\nappellant's counsel had been notified of the impending filing of the\n\nInformation. On November 3, 1998, appellant filed a motion to withdraw\n\nhis guilty plea on the grounds that he did not make an intelligent or\n\nknowing plea. This was denied by the district court in its Opinion and\n\nOrder of February 4, 1999 for the reasons that: (1) appellant's counsel\n\nprobably had received notice of the Information, or, at minimum,\n\ncertainly knew about appellant's prior criminal convictions and should\n\nhave expected that the government would file such Information; and (2)\n\nappellant was informed of the possibility of a life sentence and had no\n\nexpectation of any particular sentence.       Appellant's Motion for\n\nReconsideration was similarly denied on February 24, 1999, and\n\nappellant was sentenced to life imprisonment, as required by statute,\n\non March 12, 1999.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          The standard of review for denial of a motion to withdraw a\n\nguilty plea is abuse of discretion. United States v. Ribas-Dominicci,\n\n50 F.3d 76, 78 (1st Cir. 1995). Appellant was not per se entitled to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing.        United States v.\n\nMarrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 347 (1st Cir. 1997). Instead, motions to\n\nwithdraw a guilty plea prior to sentencing may be allowed upon a\n\nshowing of \"any fair and just reason,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e), with the\n\nburden of persuasion falling upon the defendant, Marrero-Rivera, 124\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fF.3d at 347. In making this determination, the district court was\n\nrequired to evaluate whether the guilty plea was voluntary,\n\nintelligent, and knowing within the framework of Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 11.     Id.\n\n          Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs\n\na court's conduct when a defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere.\n\nSpecifically, the court must communicate to the defendant personally:\n\n\"the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory\n\nminimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible\n\npenalty provided by law.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1). This Court has\n\nidentified three \"core\" concerns of Rule 11(c). They are: (1) that the\n\nplea is voluntary; (2) that the defendant understands the charge to\n\nwhich he has pled guilty; and (3) that the defendant knows the\n\nconsequences of his guilty plea. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 348 n.7.\n\nThe complete failure of the district court to address one or more of\n\nthese three concerns would warrant reversal. Id. at 348. Absent total\n\nfailure, any variance from the procedures required by Rule 11 that does\n\nnot \"affect substantial rights\" is harmless error. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(h); Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 348.       We look at all of the\n\ncircumstances of the Rule 11 hearing to determine what appellant\n\nreasonably should have understood.      Id.\n\n          In this appeal, only the third concern, appellant's knowledge\n\nof the consequences of his guilty plea, is relevant. At his change of\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fplea hearing, Castro-Gómez was informed by the district court that,\n\nbased on the offenses to which he intended to plead guilty, he faced a\n\nminimum of ten years imprisonment and a maximum of life imprisonment.\n\nAccording to the Information filed by the government, however,\n\nappellant's prior criminal history mandated a life sentence. The ten-\n\nyear minimums set out in the statutes that appellant was charged with\n\nviolating were not applicable. It follows that he was not accurately\n\napprised of the minimum mandatory sentence that would be imposed, as\n\nrequired by Rule 11(c)(1).\n\n          A failure to inform a defendant of a mandatory minimum\n\nsentence at his plea hearing \"implicates a core concern of Rule 11.\"\n\nUnited States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1997). Before\n\nforfeiting the right to trial by a plea of guilty, appellant was\n\nentitled to have the consequences of that forfeiture accurately\n\nexplained. Informing appellant of the mandatory minimums for the\n\noffenses to which he pled guilty, rather than the mandatory life\n\nimprisonment imposed by the \"three strikes\" provision, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3559(c)(1)(A), was not sufficient: \"advice as to a mandatory minimum\n\nthat is no longer relevant can hardly achieve Rule 11's purpose, which\n\nis to advise a defendant of the actual consequences of his plea so that\n\nhe can realistically decide whether to plead guilty.\" United States v.\n\nSanto, 225 F.3d 92, 98 (1st Cir. 2000). The district court's failure\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fto communicate the minimum mandatory life sentence to appellant\n\nrendered the Rule 11 colloquy imperfect.\n\n          Our inquiry does not end here, because the district court did\n\nnot completely fail to inform appellant of the consequences of his\n\nplea.   The error, then, must now be analyzed for its effect on\n\nappellant's substantial rights. If the error is harmless, Rule 11(h)\n\ninstructs us to uphold appellant's guilty plea. The district court\n\ndenied Castro-Gómez's motion to withdraw his plea in part because\n\nappellant was fully aware that he could receive a life sentence.\n\nAppellant was told at his change of plea hearing that he could receive\n\nten years to life for each of the offenses to which he intended to\n\nplead guilty. He admits that no assurances were given to him that he\n\nwould receive a sentence closer to the alleged ten-year minimum rather\n\nthan the life maximum. The imposition of the life sentence, then, did\n\nnot come without warning.\n\n          Even a mere possibility that Castro-Gómez could receive less\n\nthan a life sentence, however, likely played an important role in his\n\ndecision to plead guilty.     See Santo, 225 F.3d at 100 (\"[I]t is\n\nsufficiently likely that [appellant] misjudged the consequences of his\n\nplea in light of the court's misinformation so that he must be allowed\n\nto withdraw his plea.\").    There are few instances that one could\n\nimagine in which an accused individual would concede the right to trial\n\nand the chance of acquittal, however slim, and submit to a guaranteed\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\flife sentence.    We cannot say that appellant would have made a\n\ndifferent choice had he known at the outset that he faced mandatory\n\nlife, but certainty is unnecessary in this regard. It is enough that\n\nwe find that this information could reasonably have affected his\n\ndecision to plead guilty.     Santo, 225 F.3d at 101.\n\n          Appellant's situation is distinguishable from those found in\n\ncases in which we have found harmless error.        In McDonald, the\n\ndefendant was sentenced to more time than the mandatory minimum\n\nprescribed. 121 F.3d at 11 (sentenced to fifteen months more than the\n\nten-year minimum). We held that defendant's substantial rights were\n\nnot affected because the mandatory minimum had no actual impact on the\n\nsentence that he received. Id. Appellant's sentence, in contrast, was\n\nwholly dictated by the mandatory minimum, as no other sentence was\n\npossible under the \"three strikes\" statute.\n\n          Finally, whether or not appellant's counsel knew of the\n\ngovernment's filing of the Information or should have known, based on\n\nappellant's prior record, that the government was likely to file such\n\nInformation is irrelevant.     Rule 11 requires that a defendant be\n\n\"personally\" informed by the district court of the mandatory minimum\n\npenalties that he faces. See McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459,\n\n465-66 (1969); United States v. Medina-Silverio, 30 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1994). A possible awareness by appellant's counsel of minimum and\n\nmaximum penalties did not absolve the district court of its\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fresponsibility to conduct a direct and complete Rule 11 interrogation\n\nof the appellant. Cf. United States v. Gray, 63 F.3d 57, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (rejecting government argument that defendant knew of the\n\napplicable minimum penalty because the information had been contained\n\nin the plea agreement that defendant signed; this did not absolve\n\ndistrict court of the duty to address the defendant personally in the\n\nRule 11 colloquy).\n\n          Accordingly, the district court's denial of appellant's\n\nmotion to withdraw his plea is reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

Informing appellant of the mandatory minimums for the\n\noffenses to which he pled guilty, rather than the mandatory life\n\nimprisonment imposed by the \"three strikes\" provision, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3559(c)(1)(A), was not sufficient: \"advice as to a mandatory minimum\n\nthat is no longer relevant can hardly achieve Rule 11's purpose, which\n\nis to advise a defendant of the actual consequences of his plea so that\n\nhe can realistically decide whether to plead guilty.\" United States v.\n\nSanto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199080\"><a href=\"/opinion/199080/united-states-v-santo/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (1st Cir. 2000). The district court's failure\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fto communicate the minimum mandatory life sentence to appellant\n\nrendered the Rule 11 colloquy imperfect.\n\n          Our inquiry does not end here, because the district court did\n\nnot completely fail to inform appellant of the consequences of his\n\nplea.   The error, then, must now be analyzed for its effect on\n\nappellant's substantial rights. If the error is harmless, Rule 11(h)\n\ninstructs us to uphold appellant's guilty plea. The district court\n\ndenied Castro-Gómez's motion to withdraw his plea in part because\n\nappellant was fully aware that he could receive a life sentence.\n\nAppellant was told at his change of plea hearing that he could receive\n\nten years to life for each of the offenses to which he intended to\n\nplead guilty. He admits that no assurances were given to him that he\n\nwould receive a sentence closer to the alleged ten-year minimum rather\n\nthan the life maximum. The imposition of the life sentence, then, did\n\nnot come without warning.\n\n          Even a mere possibility that Castro-Gómez could receive less\n\nthan a life sentence, however, likely played an important role in his\n\ndecision to plead guilty.     See Santo, 225 F.3d at 100 (\"[I]t is\n\nsufficiently likely that [appellant] misjudged the consequences of his\n\nplea in light of the court's misinformation so that he must be allowed\n\nto withdraw his plea.\").    There are few instances that one could\n\nimagine in which an accused individual would concede the right to trial\n\nand the chance of acquittal, however slim, and submit to a guaranteed\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\flife sentence.    We cannot say that appellant would have made a\n\ndifferent choice had he known at the outset that he faced mandatory\n\nlife, but certainty is unnecessary in this regard. It is enough that\n\nwe find that this information could reasonably have affected his\n\ndecision to plead guilty.     Santo, 225 F.3d at 101.\n\n          Appellant's situation is distinguishable from those found in\n\ncases in which we have found harmless error.        In McDonald, the\n\ndefendant was sentenced to more time than the mandatory minimum\n\nprescribed. 121 F.3d at 11 (sentenced to fifteen months more than the\n\nten-year minimum). We held that defendant's substantial rights were\n\nnot affected because the mandatory minimum had no actual impact on the\n\nsentence that he received. Id. Appellant's sentence, in contrast, was\n\nwholly dictated by the mandatory minimum, as no other sentence was\n\npossible under the \"three strikes\" statute.\n\n          Finally, whether or not appellant's counsel knew of the\n\ngovernment's filing of the Information or should have known, based on\n\nappellant's prior record, that the government was likely to file such\n\nInformation is irrelevant.     Rule 11 requires that a defendant be\n\n\"personally\" informed by the district court of the mandatory minimum\n\npenalties that he faces. See McCarthy v.
