Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Brian C. Shaughnessy, with whom Normand &amp; Shaughnessy, P.A.\r\nwas on brief for appellant.\r\n\n   Richard P. Campbell, with whom Lisa DeBrosse Johnson and\r\nCampbell Campbell &amp; Edwards PC were on brief for appellee.  \r\n\nOctober 15, 1999\r\n\nPER CURIAM.  This diversity jurisdiction case is on\r\nappeal from a grant of summary judgment for the defendants in a\r\nproducts liability case based on an alleged design defect.  The\r\ndistrict court ruled that under New Hampshire law the plaintiff in\r\na strict liability defective design case must show that the\r\ndefective product reached the plaintiff without substantial change\r\nin its condition.  That ruling is the sole issue before us.\r\n                              I.\r\nWe recite the undisputed facts as stated by the district\r\ncourt:\r\n       On August 25, 1993, the plaintiff was\r\nworking as a used car salesman for his\r\nemployer, Auto City of Manchester, when he\r\ndrove a 1985 King Cab Nissan pickup truck\r\nacross a car lot for a customer.  He proceeded\r\nat a low speed, approximately ten miles an\r\nhour.  As he stepped on the brake, the seat\r\nslid forward freely, pushing the plaintiff\r\nforward as well.  As a result, his foot\r\npressed hard on the brake, stopping the truck\r\nabruptly.  This caused him to be thrown\r\nforward and backward.  He hit his head on a\r\nsun visor and suffered lacerations, bruising,\r\nand severe injuries to his back, head, neck,\r\nand arms, as well as other injuries.  After\r\nthe incident the plaintiff examined the seat. \r\nHe found that the seat adjuster lever, which\r\nlocked and released the seat on its track, was\r\ncaught on a tool pack stored beneath the seat. \r\nThe plaintiff asserts that the tool pack\r\nprevented the seat from locking into place and\r\nallowed the seat to slide forward and backward\r\nfreely.\r\n\n       The plaintiff does not know the present\r\nlocation or the present owner of the vehicle,\r\nand has not seen the vehicle since the date of\r\nthe incident.  The plaintiff's witnesses,\r\nincluding his expert witness, have not\r\nexamined the vehicle or any of its component\r\nparts.  At the time of the incident the\r\nvehicle was eight years old with 144,973 miles\r\non its odometer, its exterior was heavily\r\nrusted, its interior was filthy, and the seats\r\nwere in poor condition.  The plaintiff does\r\nnot know whether, as of the time of the\r\nincident, the strap that held the tool pack in\r\nplace, the tool pack itself, the seat adjuster\r\nlever, or the seat track, were original parts\r\nor in the same or similar condition as when\r\nthe truck was manufactured and originally\r\nsold, or, with the exception of the tool pack,\r\neven if they were manufactured or sold by the\r\nvehicle manufacturer or its distributor. \r\nMoreover, in February 1990, the truck had had\r\nan accident on Interstate 93, suffered\r\nextensive damage, and was declared \"totaled\"\r\nfor insurance purposes.  The plaintiff does\r\nnot know whether the seat track, the seat\r\nadjuster lever, or any of the component parts\r\nfor moving the seat were damaged in the\r\naccident or otherwise.\r\n\nWe describe the alleged design defect as the plaintiff\r\ndid in his brief at 6-7.\r\n  The 1985 Nissan King Cab pickup truck was\r\ndesigned to hold a tool pack which contained\r\nthe vehicle's tire iron and other accessories\r\nunder the driver's seat of the vehicle.  The\r\ntool pack was designed to be held in place by\r\na rubber fastening strap which would hold the\r\ntool pack to the mounting frame of the front\r\nseat.  The mounting frame and tool pack are\r\nstationary as are the seat rails which allow\r\nfor the adjustment of the seat both forward\r\nand backward.  The front seat, along with the\r\nadjustment lever which is attached to the\r\nfront seat, move forward and backward on the\r\nseat rails and allow for adjustment to the\r\ndesired position by the driver.  When the seat\r\nis adjusted to its rear-most position, the\r\nseat adjustment lever is located directly\r\nabove the storage area for the tool pack.  \r\n\nPlaintiff offered to show, based on his examination of\r\nthe seating mechanism of the truck, that on the date of the\r\naccident a tool pack was located directly under the driver's seat\r\nas intended by the manufacturer of the truck.  Plaintiff contends\r\nthat this was a design defect because it allowed the seat adjuster\r\nlever on the driver's seat to become stuck on the tool pack and\r\nthus prevented the seat from locking into place.  The result was\r\nthat when the plaintiff applied the brakes as the truck was moving\r\nforward, the seat suddenly slid forward injuring plaintiff's head\r\nand cervical spine.\r\n                             II.\r\nBoth parties and the district court relied primarily on\r\nthe New Hampshire case of Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 118\r\nN.H. 802, 395 A.2d 843 (1978).  In Thibault, the New Hampshire\r\nSupreme Court carefully explained the design defect theory of\r\nstrict products liability.  It held specifically:\r\n  Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\r\nshould not read RSA 507:7-a (Supp. 1977) in a\r\njury charge on the strict liability count,\r\n. . . .  The trial court should read or\r\nparaphrase Restatement (Second) of Torts\r\n 402A(1) and (2) to the jury; the jury should\r\nthen usually be asked by special verdict if\r\nplaintiff's proof has met the requirements of\r\nthe Restatement.  If plaintiff's proof is\r\nsufficient, the jury must [then consider\r\ndefenses].  (Emphasis added.) \r\n\nId. 118 N.H. at 813, 395 A.2d at 850.\r\n\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts  402A provides in pertinent part:\r\n  Special Liability of Seller of Product for\r\nPhysical Harm to User or Consumer\r\n  (1)  One who sells any product in a defective\r\ncondition unreasonably dangerous to the user\r\nor consumer or to his property is subject to\r\nliability for physical harm thereby caused to\r\nthe ultimate user or consumer, or to his\r\nproperty, if\r\n  (a)  the seller is engaged in the business of\r\nselling such a product, and\r\n  (b)  it is expected to and does reach the user\r\nor consumer without substantial change in the\r\ncondition in which it is sold.\r\n\n(Emphasis added.)  We agree with the district court that subsection\r\n(1)(b) is a requirement of New Hampshire law.  The plaintiff spins\r\na complex and lengthy argument that Thibault did not adopt\r\nsubsection (1)(b) and, if it did, subsequent cases make the holding\r\ndubious.  We disagree.  First of all, Thibault is clearly on point\r\nand we have been unable to find any New Hampshire case even\r\narguably to the contrary.  Secondly, our own circuit precedent\r\nsquarely holds that Section 402A in its entirety has been adopted\r\nby the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.  Raymond v. The Raymond\r\nCorp., 938 F.2d 1518, 1520-21 (1st Cir. 1991); Fortier v. Olin\r\nCorp., 840 F.2d 98, 99 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\nFinally, we consider plaintiff's alternative argument. \r\nPlaintiff says that even if subsection (1)(b) applies, a reasonable\r\njury could find it to be satisfied in this case.  He argues (based\r\non his expert's proferred judgment) that the dangerous condition\r\ncreated by the manufacturer was to locate the kit under the seat;\r\nand he says that his own testimony, albeit based on only a brief\r\nlook under the seat before the vehicle disappeared for good, would\r\npermit a jury to find that this condition pertained \"without\r\nsubstantial change\" at the time of the accident.    \r\nEven if \"change in condition\" were read so narrowly, we\r\ndo not see how a jury could find causation without more information\r\nas to the condition of the truck.  There is nothing to show that\r\nthe pack, strap, seat, track or adjuster lever were original\r\nequipment or properly operating or otherwise in good repair.  Thus,\r\ngiven the age and prior damage to the truck, it would be sheer\r\nspeculation for a jury to conclude that it was the alleged defect\r\nrather than some intervening change or damage to other parts that\r\nled to the accident in this case.  \r\nAffirmed.  Costs awarded to appellee.\n",
