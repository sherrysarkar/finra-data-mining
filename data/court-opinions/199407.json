In   this    case,   we\n\nconsider   whether     a   Maine   statute        providing   for    affordable\n\nprescription drugs can survive facial constitutional challenges.\n\nOn October 26, 2000, the district court issued a preliminary\n\ninjunction preventing the implementation of the statute on the\n\nground that it is preempted by the Supremacy Clause and violates\n\nthe dormant Commerce Clause.            We reverse.\n\n                             I.     BACKGROUND\n\n           On May 11, 2000, the Governor of Maine signed into law\n\nan Act to Establish Fairer Pricing for Prescription Drugs, 2000\n\nMe. Legis. Ch. 786 (S.P. 1026) (L.D. 2599) (the “Act”), which\n\nestablishes      the   “Maine      Rx     Program\"     (the   \"Program\").1\n\n           The    statute    was        enacted    because    of     the   Maine\n\nLegislature's concern that many Maine citizens who were not\n\nMedicaid recipients could not afford necessary prescription\n\n\n    1The full text of the relevant provisions of the Act is set\nforth in the Appendix, infra.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdrugs. It is predicated on the economic reality that volume\n\nbuying     of    prescription          drugs        by    Medicaid       administrators,\n\ninsurance        companies       and     health          maintenance       organizations\n\n(“HMOs”)    resulted       in     substantially           lower    prices     for   these\n\nentities than for individual purchasers.                             A minority staff\n\nreport for the United States House Committee on Government\n\nReform and Oversight found that the average retail price for\n\nindividual elderly purchasers was 86 percent higher than the\n\nprice    charged     to    the    federal       government         and    other   favored\n\ncustomers, such as HMOs.\n\n            The Program is open to all State residents, and allows\n\nenrollees to purchase prescription drugs from participating\n\nMaine pharmacies at a discounted price.                     The discount offered by\n\nthe pharmacies is reimbursed by the State out of a dedicated\n\nfund    created     with    the       money    raised      from    “rebate     payments”\n\ncollected from participating drug manufacturers.                          Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 22, § 2681.             The obligation to pay the “rebate” is\n\ntriggered by the retail sale of the manufacturer's drugs to a\n\nProgram enrollee through a participating pharmacy.\n\n            The Act directs the Commissioner of Maine's Department\n\nof     Health     Services       to     negotiate         rebate     agreements       with\n\nmanufacturers.        Id. § 2681(3).                These rebate agreements are\n\nsimilar     in     form    to     the     rebate          agreements       required     of\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\fmanufacturers participating in the Maine Medicaid outpatient\n\ndrug program.      Id. § 2681(4).          In negotiating the rebate, the\n\nCommissioner      is   directed     to    “consider”        the    rebate   amount\n\ncalculated under the Federal Medicaid Rebate Program, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396r-8, and to use his or her “best efforts” to obtain an\n\ninitial rebate in the same amount.             Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,\n\n§ 2681(4)(A)-(C).         Rebate payments are made quarterly on the\n\nbasis of retail sales records for that quarter.                    Id. § 2681(3).\n\n           In order to create an incentive for manufacturers to\n\nenter rebate agreements with the Commissioner, the Act provides\n\nthat names of manufacturers who do not enter into agreements be\n\nreleased   to    health    care    providers     and   the    public.       Id.   §\n\n2681(7).   More    importantly,          the   drugs   of    all    noncompliant\n\nmanufacturers are required to be subject, “as permitted by law,”\n\nto the “prior authorization requirements” in the State Medicaid\n\nprogram.   Id. § 2681(7).         When subjected to prior authorization,\n\na drug may not be dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary without\n\nthe approval of the State Medicaid administrator.\n\n           The    plaintiff-appellee,          Pharmaceutical        Research     &\n\nManufacturers of America (“PhRMA”), brought an action in the\n\nUnited States District Court in the District of Maine against\n\ndefendant-appellants Commissioner of the Maine Department of\n\nHuman Services and the Maine Attorney General, challenging the\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fconstitutionality      of   the    Act.     PhRMA    claimed   that    the   Act\n\nviolated the dormant Commerce Clause and was preempted by the\n\nfederal Medicaid statute under the Supremacy Clause, and moved\n\nfor a preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of\n\nthe Act.\n\n               The district court issued the preliminary injunction\n\nand found the Act unconstitutional on the two asserted grounds.\n\nFirst, the district court held that the Act had an impermissible\n\nextraterritorial reach by regulating the revenues out-of-state\n\npharmaceutical manufacturers receive when selling to out-of-\n\nstate pharmaceutical distributors, thereby violating the dormant\n\nCommerce Clause.       As to those distributors located in the State\n\nof Maine, the district court held that the Act was preempted\n\nunder    the    Supremacy   Clause   because    it    conflicted      with   the\n\nfederal Medicaid program.2\n\n                             II.     DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n\n\n\n     2\n     The Act also contained a provision that made it “illegal\nprofiteering” for a manufacturer to “exact[] or demand[] an\nunconscionable price” or to “exact[] or demand[] prices or terms\nthat lead to any unjust or unreasonable profit.”      An Act to\nEstablish Fairer Pricing for Prescription Drugs, § 2697(2), 2000\nMe. Legis. Ch. 786 (S.P. 1026) (L.D. 2599) (to be codified at\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 2697(2)).     The district court\nfound this provision unconstitutional. The State of Maine has\nnot appealed this ruling.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f              \"The criteria for the grant of a preliminary injunction\n\nare     the    familiar       four:   likelihood      of     success,      risk       of\n\nirreparable       harm,    the   balance       of   equities       and   the    public\n\ninterest.\"        Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 47\n\n(1st    Cir.    2000)     (citing       Ross-Simons     of     Warwick,        Inc.    v.\n\nBaccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996)).                               When a\n\ndistrict court's grant of a preliminary injunction is appealed,\n\nour standard of review depends on the issue under consideration:\n\nwe review pure issues of law de novo, findings of fact for clear\n\nerror, and \"judgment calls\" with considerable deference.                              Id.\n\n(noting that our standard of review is sometimes summarized as\n\nbeing for \"abuse of discretion\").\n\n              The district court concluded that PhRMA's likelihood\n\nof    success     on    the    merits    of    most   of     its    constitutional\n\nchallenges      was    \"overwhelming.\"          Accordingly,        it   dealt    only\n\ncursorily with the remaining preliminary injunction factors.\n\nOur review also focuses on PhRMA's likelihood of success on the\n\nmerits of its challenges under the Supremacy Clause and the\n\nCommerce Clause.          See Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (stating that the “sine qua non” of preliminary\n\ninjunction analysis is whether plaintiff is likely to succeed on\n\nmerits of claim).\n\nB.     Standing\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f         The initial question we face is whether PhRMA has\n\nprudential    standing   to    challenge   the   prior   authorization\n\nprovision of the Act.         PhRMA contends that Maine's standing\n\nargument was not briefed to the district court, and therefore\n\nwas waived.   We assume, without deciding, that Maine may assert\n\nthis standing challenge on appeal, and hold that PhRMA falls\n\nwithin the relevant \"zone of interest.\"3\n\n         The Supreme Court recently reiterated the standard for\n\ndetermining prudential standing:\n\n         [I]n applying the \"zone of interests\" test,\n         we do not ask whether, in enacting the\n         statutory provision at issue, Congress\n         specifically   intended   to   benefit   the\n         plaintiff.   Instead, we first discern the\n         interests \"arguably . . . to be protected\"\n         by the statutory provision at issue; we then\n         inquire whether the plaintiff's interests\n         affected by the agency action in question\n         are among them.\n\n\n\n\n    3 There is some dispute among the circuits as to whether\nprudential standing (as opposed to Article III standing) can be\nraised for the first time on appeal. Compare Animal Legal Def.\nFund v. Espy, 23 F.3d 496, 499 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (prudential\nstanding is non-waivable); Thompson v. County of Franklin, 15\nF.3d 245, 248 (2d Cir. 1994) (same); Cmty. First Bank v. Nat'l\nCredit Union Admin., 41 F.3d 1050, 1053 (6th Cir. 1994) (same)\nwith Pershing Park Villas Homeowners Ass'n v. United Pac. Ins.\nCo., 219 F.3d 895, 899 (9th Cir. 2000) (prudential standing is\nwaivable); Lindley v. Sullivan, 889 F.2d 124, 129 (7th Cir.\n1989) (same). Because we hold that Maine's challenge to PhRMA's\nstanding would be unsuccessful in any event, as explained infra,\nit is not necessary for us to decide the waiver issue now.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fNat'l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 522\n\nU.S. 479, 492 (1998).\n\n              Maine   contends      that    PhRMA's   interest     is   purely\n\nfinancial and is limited to ensuring that its members' drugs are\n\nprescribed      instead     of   competitors'    drugs.      Nothing    in   the\n\nMedicaid statute, Maine argues, suggests that Congress intended\n\nto protect sales of any particular drugs.                 See Tap Pharms. v.\n\nU.S. Dep't of HHS, 163 F.3d 199, 208 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding\n\nthat pharmaceutical manufacturer lacked standing to challenge\n\nMedicare rules reducing reimbursement amounts paid for their\n\nproducts because manufacturer's financial interests were not\n\nwithin zone of interests protected by Medicare).\n\n              PhRMA has not asserted an action to enforce rights\n\nunder the Medicaid statute, however, but rather a preemption-\n\nbased challenge under the Supremacy Clause.                 In this type of\n\naction, it is the interests protected by the Supremacy Clause,\n\nnot by the preempting statute, that are at issue.                  St. Thomas-\n\nSt. John Hotel & Tourism Ass'n v. Virgin Islands, 218 F.3d 232,\n\n241 (3d Cir. 2000).         As the Third Circuit recently pointed out,\n\nan   entity    does   not    need   prudential   standing     to   invoke    the\n\nprotection of the Supremacy Clause:\n\n              We know of no governing authority to the\n              effect that the federal statutory provision\n              which allegedly preempts enforcement of\n              local legislation by conflict must confer a\n\n                                      -9-\n\f            right on the party that argues in favor of\n            preemption. On the contrary, a state or\n            territorial law can be unenforceable as\n            preempted by federal law even when the\n            federal    law   secures   no   individual\n            substantive rights for the party arguing\n            preemption.\n\nId.   Thus, regardless of whether the Medicaid statute's relevant\n\nprovisions were designed to benefit PhRMA, PhRMA can invoke the\n\nstatute's preemptive force.       Cf. Burgio & Campofelice, Inc. v.\n\nN.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 107 F.3d 1000, 1006 (2d Cir. 1997)\n\n(concluding that the Supremacy Clause creates an implied right\n\nof action for injunctive relief against state officers who are\n\nthreatening to violate federal law).\n\n            Given that PhRMA has prudential standing grounded in\n\nthe Supremacy Clause, we think it may fairly assert the rights\n\nof Medicaid recipients for purposes of this action.                  Where a\n\nparty has established a concrete injury in fact, and otherwise\n\nhas standing to challenge the lawfulness of the statute, it is\n\n\"entitled to assert those concomitant rights of third parties\n\nthat would be 'diluted or adversely affected' should [its]\n\nconstitutional    challenge    fail    and    the   statute[]      remain   in\n\nforce.”     Craig v.    Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 195 (1976) (quoting\n\nGriswold     v.   Connecticut,     381       U.S.    479,    481    (1965)).\n\nAccordingly, “vendors and those in like positions have been\n\nuniformly   permitted    to   resist   efforts      at   restricting   their\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\foperations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties\n\nwho seek access to their market or function.”                    Id.; see also 1\n\nL. Tribe, American Constitutional Law, § 3-19, p. 438 (3d ed.\n\n2000).\n\nC.     Preemption\n\n              Having decided that PhRMA has standing to challenge the\n\nMaine Act on preemption grounds, we now turn to the merits of\n\nthat argument.            The district court addressed preemption only\n\nwith       regard    to   the    Act's   regulation      of   sales     to   in-state\n\ndistributors, after concluding that such regulation would not be\n\nbarred       by   the     Commerce    Clause.       It   held    that    the   prior\n\nauthorization review requirement of the Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 2681(7), conflicted with the purposes of the Medicaid\n\nprogram       such      that    the   requirement     was     invalid    under    the\n\nSupremacy Clause.4             If we affirm the district court's preemption\n\nholding, it would invalidate the Act as to all distributors, not\n\njust those who operate in Maine, and would obviate the need to\n\n\n\n\n       4\n     Only the prior authorization review requirement of the Act\nis  at   issue  for   preemption  purposes,   not  the   public\nidentification requirement. Therefore, for simplicity's sake,\nour use of the terms \"the Act\" or \"Maine Rx Program\" refer\nsolely to the prior authorization review requirement.\n\n                                         -11-\n\faddress the Commerce Clause.         Therefore, we analyze the issue of\n\npreemption first.5\n\n          Under the Supremacy Clause, a federal law may expressly\n\nor impliedly preempt state law.                U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2\n\n(stating that federal law “shall be the supreme law of the Land\n\n. . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the\n\nContrary notwithstanding”).         As the parties agree, only \"implied\n\nconflict preemption\" is at issue here.6            Our task, therefore, is\n\nto   consider    if    “compliance       with    both    state    and   federal\n\nregulations     is    impossible\"   or    if    \"state   law     interposes   an\n\n\n\n     5An amicus curiae brief offers another basis for federal\npreemption: Edwin D. Schindler, Major Stockholder and Patent\nAttorney, argues that the Maine Act is preempted by federal\npatent law. Because these issues were raised for the first time\non appeal by an amicus, not by a party, we do not consider them.\nAm. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 3936 v. Fed. Labor Relations\nAuth., 239 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Sturm,\nRuger & Co., 84 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"an amicus cannot\nintroduce a new argument into a case\").\n     6\n     Express preemption of a state law occurs where “a federal\nstatute explicitly confirms Congress’s intention to preempt\nstate law and defines the extent of that preclusion.” Grant's\nDairy-Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric., Food & Rural\nRes., 232 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 2000).     There is no explicit\nlanguage in the Medicaid statute that forbids the Maine Rx\nProgram. Nor is the doctrine of \"field\" preemption relevant, as\nMedicaid is a cooperative federal and state program. This form\nof implied preemption applies only when a federal regulatory\nscheme is so pervasive as to create the inference that Congress\ndid not intend for the states to pass supplemental law in that\narea. Gade v. Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88, 98\n(1992). Therefore, we consider only implied conflict preemption\nas a basis for PhRMA's argument.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fobstacle    to    the    achievement       of   Congress’s     discernable\n\nobjectives.”     Grant's Dairy-Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of\n\nAgric., Food & Rural Res., 232 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(citing Gade v. Nat'l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass'n, 505 U.S. 88, 98\n\n(1992)).\n\n           In doing so, we assume \"that the historic police powers\n\nof the States [are] not to be superceded by . . . Federal Act\n\nunless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.”\n\nId. at 14-15 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S.\n\n218, 230 (1947)).       We also recognize that federal preemption of\n\na state law is “strong medicine,” and is “not casually to be\n\ndispensed.”      Id. at 18.        This is especially true when the\n\nfederal    statute   creates   a   program,     such   as   Medicaid,   that\n\nutilizes \"cooperative federalism”: \"Where coordinated state and\n\nfederal efforts exist within a complementary administrative\n\nframework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for\n\nfederal preemption becomes a less persuasive one.\"            Wash., Dep’t\n\nof Soc. & Health Servs. v. Bowen, 815 F.2d 549, 557 (9th Cir.\n\n1987) (quoting N.Y. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S.\n\n405, 421 (1973)).\n\n           To determine whether the state regulation is consistent\n\nwith the federal statute, we examine the \"structure and purpose\n\nof the [federal] statute as a whole.\"             Gade, 505 U.S. at 98.\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fThe primary purpose of Medicaid is to enable states to provide\n\nmedical   services   to   those   whose   “income   and   resources   are\n\ninsufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services .\n\n. . .”    42 U.S.C. § 1396 (2000).        Congress expressly intended\n\nthat the provision of medical services be administered by the\n\nstate “in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration\n\nand the best interests of the recipients.”          Id. § 1396a(a)(19).\n\n           We perceive no conflict between the Maine Act and\n\nMedicaid's structure and purpose.         Neither the letter nor the\n\nintent of the Medicaid statute prevents states from imposing\n\nprior authorization requirements; indeed, they are explicitly\n\npermitted.   42 U.S.C. § 1396r-8(d)(1)(A) (states may \"subject to\n\nprior authorization any covered outpatient drug\").          The statute\n\nsets forth only two limitations on a state’s use of prior\n\nauthorization: the state must provide “response by telephone or\n\nother telecommunication device within 24 hours of a request for\n\nprior authorization;\" and, with respect to most drugs, provide\n\nfor \"the dispensing of at least 72-hour [sic] supply of a\n\ncovered outpatient prescription drug in an emergency situation\n\n(as defined by the Secretary).”      Id. § 1396r-8(d)(5)(A) and (B).\n\n           The plain text of the Maine Act appears to incorporate\n\nthese Medicaid requirements.         It provides:      “The department\n\nshall impose prior authorization requirements in the Medicaid\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fprogram      under   this    Title,       as     permitted      by   law,    for   the\n\ndispensing of prescription drugs . . . .”                     Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 2681(7) (emphasis added).                   We read the language \"as\n\npermitted by law\" to limit the Act's application to only those\n\nsituations      in   which       prior    authorization         is   permitted      by\n\nMedicaid.7      As the Department is charged with administering the\n\nMaine Rx Program, we owe deference to its interpretation of the\n\nAct.       Fireside Nissan, Inc. v. Fanning, 30 F.3d 206, 212 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n              Moreover,     as   set     forth    in   the    affidavit     of   Kevin\n\nConcannon,      Commissioner       of     the     Maine      Department     of   Human\n\nServices, Maine has proposed administrative rules governing\n\nprior authorization aimed at ensuring that Medicaid recipients\n\nwill have access to needed medications.                         Specifically, the\n\ndecision to place a drug on the prior authorization list may be\n\nmade only by the State's Medicaid Drug Utilization Review [DUR]\n\nCommittee,       which      exclusively           comprises      physicians        and\n\npharmacists licensed to prescribe or dispense medications in\n\nMaine.      Concannon states:\n\n              In making its determination of whether or\n              not a prior authorization requirement is\n\n\n       7\n      Kevin Concannon, Commissioner of the Maine Department of\nHuman Services, affirms in an affidavit that the Department will\nnot impose prior authorization that would conflict with the\nMedicaid requirements.\n\n                                         -15-\n\f             clinically appropriate, the DUR Committee\n             shall be guided by the law of Medicaid, and\n             particularly the principle that Medicaid\n             recipients shall be assured access to all\n             medically necessary prescription drugs.\n\n             PhRMA   contends        that     prior    authorization,        however\n\nimplemented,     necessarily          interferes       with    the    delivery     of\n\nMedicaid     services      by   placing       an     administrative     burden      on\n\nphysicians and patients.             This interference is acceptable, it\n\nsays,    when   performed       in    the    usual    course    of    the    Medicaid\n\nregulations concerning prior authorization, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-\n\n8(d)(5), because there is a countervailing \"legitimate\" purpose\n\nof preventing abuse or overprescription of certain expensive\n\nmedications.      In the case of a prior authorization under the\n\nMaine Rx Program, however, PhRMA argues (and the district court\n\nagreed) that there is no \"Medicaid purpose\" or \"benefit\" to\n\nMedicaid that offsets the interference.                     Hence, it contends,\n\nonly when a prior authorization is motivated by the refusal to\n\nenter into a Maine Rx Program rebate agreement is it preempted.\n\n             This argument is unpersuasive.                   First, we are not\n\nconvinced     that   the    Medicaid        statute    is   concerned       with   the\n\nmotivation behind imposing prior authorization, as long as the\n\n24-hour response and the 72-hour drug-supply requirements, 42\n\nU.S.C.   §   1396r-8(d)(5),          are    satisfied.        Thus,   even    if   the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that “Maine can point to no Medicaid\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\fpurpose in this new prior authorization requirement” is true, it\n\ndoes not necessarily mean that the prior authorization scheme\n\nconflicts with the objectives of the Medicaid program.                 We see\n\nno basis for inflicting the \"strong medicine\" of preemption on\n\na state statute that, in the absence of an actual conflict,\n\nmerely fails to directly advance the purpose of the federal\n\nprogram.\n\n             Moreover, even assuming that this inquiry into the\n\nunderlying objectives of the Act is appropriate, we disagree\n\nthat   the   Act   serves    no   purpose   related   to   Medicaid.      The\n\npurposes of the Medicaid statute, read broadly, are consonant\n\nwith the purposes of the Maine Rx Program.            First, the Maine Rx\n\nProgram furthers Medicaid's aim of providing medical services to\n\nthose whose “income and resources are insufficient to meet the\n\ncosts of necessary medical services,” 42 U.S.C. § 1396, even if\n\nthe individuals covered by the Maine Rx Program are not poor\n\nenough to qualify for Medicaid.         Second, there is some evidence\n\nin the record that by making prescription drugs more accessible\n\nto the uninsured, Maine may reduce Medicaid expenditures.                When\n\npeople   whose     incomes   fall   outside   Medicaid     eligibility    are\n\nunable to purchase necessary medication, their conditions may\n\nworsen, driving them further into poverty and into the Medicaid\n\nprogram, requiring more expensive treatment that could have been\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\favoided had earlier intervention been possible.              See Stephen B.\n\nSoumerai,     Sc.D.,   Dennis     Ross-Degnan,         Sc.D.,   Inadequate\n\nPrescription-Drug Coverage for Medicare Enrollees – A Call to\n\nAction, New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 9, March\n\n4, 1999 (contained in district court record); Minority Staff\n\nReport,   Prescription   Drug    Pricing    in   the   1st   Congressional\n\nDistrict of Maine:       Drug Companies Profit at the Expense of\n\nOlder Americans, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight,\n\nU.S. House of Representatives, prepared for Rep. Thomas H.\n\nAllen, October 9, 1998 (same).8\n\n            Thus, we disagree with the district court's statement\n\nthat \"If Maine can use its authority over Medicaid authorization\n\nto   leverage   drug   manufacturer      rebates   for    the   benefit   of\n\nuninsured citizens, then it can just as easily put the rebates\n\ninto a state program for highway and bridge construction or\n\nschool    funding.\"    Neither    highway    construction       nor   school\n\nfunding relate in any way to the purposes of providing medical\n\nservices to the needy, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396, or of cost-\n\neffective administration of the Medicaid program,                see id. §\n\n\n\n      8\n     Moreover, the Amicus Curiae Brief of Viola Quirion,\nMichelle Campbell, Maine Council of Senior Citizens and Richard\nDonahue, M.D. attaches an affidavit from Maine resident Viola\nQuirion indicating that because many older persons cannot afford\nthe high costs of prescription drugs, there may be increased\nenrollment in nursing homes and an increased burden on Medicaid.\n\n                                  -18-\n\f1396a(a)30(A)   (state   plans   must   assure   that   payments   are\n\nconsistent with, inter alia, efficiency and economy).\n\n         PhRMA further contends that the Maine Rx Program will\n\nnecessarily harm Medicaid recipients by impeding access to their\n\ndoctors' first-choice medications.       The district court agreed\n\nwith this argument, concluding that the Maine Act conflicted\n\nwith the Medicaid provision setting forth a general requirement\n\nthat a state Medicaid plan contain safeguards to assure that\n\ncare and services will be provided \"in a manner consistent with\n\n. . . the best interests of the recipients.\"             42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a(a)(19).   PhRMA vigorously presses the argument that the\n\nprior authorization provision is more than a de minimus obstacle\n\nto achieving these best interests of the Medicaid recipient\n\nbecause it will effectively require a doctor to shift to her\n\nsecond choice drug where the first choice drug is manufactured\n\nby a company that does not participate in the rebate program.\n\nThe state concedes that it will not authorize payment for the\n\nfirst-choice drug manufactured by a non-participant where there\n\nis another drug for the ailment manufactured by a participant,\n\nbut insists that the Medicaid recipient will always receive\n\nmedically necessary drugs.   At this point in the proceedings, we\n\nfind insufficient basis for concluding that the Maine Act, on\n\nits face, controverts the Medicaid goal of \"best interests.\"\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f            Because this is a facial challenge to a statute, PhRMA\n\nhas a difficult burden of showing that Medicaid recipients will\n\nbe harmed by the Maine Rx Program.                 \"A facial challenge to a\n\nlegislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to\n\nmount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no\n\nset of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\"\n\nUnited States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).                            “The\n\nexistence     of    a    hypothetical        or     potential       conflict     is\n\ninsufficient to warrant the preemption of the state statute.”\n\nRice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 659 (1982).\n\n            Here,   the    parties     submitted          competing    affidavits\n\ndiscussing whether the Maine Rx Program will necessarily inflict\n\nharm on Medicaid patients.          Dr. Scott Howell, Vice President of\n\nNational Accounts, Managed Care, SmithKline Beecham Corporation,\n\nstates   that    \"when    used    wrongly,\"       prior    authorizations      hurt\n\nmedical professionals and patients by adding administrative\n\nburdens, delays, anxiety and confusion.                    He opines that the\n\nMaine Rx Program \"will create a high likelihood\" of harm by\n\nleading to inappropriate prescribing of medications, needlessly\n\nburdening doctors, and causing unnecessary inconvenience for\n\nMedicaid recipients.           \"[P]rior authorization of drugs, without\n\nregard   to     safety    or    efficacy,     will    lead     to     drugs   being\n\nprescribed that are less safe and efficacious.\"\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f            Dr. Timothy S. Clifford, the Medical Director for the\n\nMaine Bureau of Medical Services, which administers the Medicaid\n\nprogram,    disagrees       with      Dr.    Howell's       affidavit    on       several\n\npoints.    He contends that the Department will address safety and\n\nefficacy concerns in administering the Maine Rx Program's prior\n\nauthorization       requirement;            that      it     will     consider        the\n\navailability of alternative drugs in deciding whether to subject\n\na   particular     drug     to     the      requirement;       and    that       Medicaid\n\nrecipients will continue to have access to medically necessary\n\ndrugs.     Dr. Clifford states: \"The Department certainly will not\n\nsubject     any    single-source            drug   that       fulfills       a     unique\n\ntherapeutic       function       to   the     prior        authorization         process,\n\nregardless of whether the manufacturer participates in the Maine\n\nRx Program . . . .\"\n\n            Dr. H. Burtt Richardson, Jr., a Maine pediatrician and\n\nMaine Medicaid provider, states that he supports the Maine Rx\n\nProgram \"so long as the decision to put a prior authorization on\n\nparticular    drugs    is    clinically         appropriate,         feasible      for   a\n\nmedical office, and accompanied by the assurance that all Maine\n\nMedicaid recipients have access to medically necessary drugs.\"\n\n\n\n            These affidavits, along with other materials in the\n\nrecord, fall short of establishing that the Act will inflict\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\finevitable or even probable harm on Medicaid patients or their\n\nproviders.       In reviewing a preemption-based facial challenge,\n\n\"we   do   not   rest      our   decision      on    consequences     that,     while\n\npossible, are by no means predictable.\"                  Dep't of Taxation and\n\nFin. of N.Y. v. Milhelm Attea & Bros., Inc., 512 U.S. 61, 69\n\n(1994).     There is no evidence that the prior authorization\n\nprocedure is likely to foreclose a patient from receiving a\n\nnecessary     drug.         Although        prior    authorization         review     is\n\ntriggered by a manufacturer's refusal to participate in the\n\nMaine Rx Program, the record indicates that the final decision\n\nto require prior authorization for a particular drug is based\n\nprimarily     on        clinical     criteria       applied     by    health        care\n\nprofessionals.\n\n            Since both sides agree that the prior authorization\n\nrequirement        is     the      \"hammer\"     or     \"force\"       that     coerces\n\nmanufacturers to enter into the Program, the possibility that\n\nfirst-choice drugs will not be readily approved where second-\n\nchoice inferior alternatives exist concerns us.                  The possibility\n\nthat the administrative implications of the prior authorization\n\nrequirement will affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid\n\nrecipients in more subtle ways, i.e. through inconveniencing\n\nprescribing      physicians,         also     concerns    us.        Dr.     Howell's\n\naffidavit, however, is controverted by the affidavits of other\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fqualified individuals.        We simply cannot say on this record that\n\nthe   Act   conflicts    with      Medicaid's      requirement      that   state\n\nMedicaid plans assure that care will be provided in a manner\n\nconsistent with the recipients' best interests.                  42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a(a)(19).\n\n            This decision is without prejudice to PhRMA's right to\n\nrenew its preemption challenge after implementation of the Act,\n\nshould there be evidence that Medicaid recipients are harmed by\n\nthe prior authorization requirement \"as applied.\"                   See United\n\nStates v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61, 71 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 528\n\nU.S. 844 (1999) (\"It makes little sense to strike down an entire\n\nstatute     in   response     to   a    facial     attack    when    potential\n\ndifficulties      can    be   remedied        in   future    cases     through\n\nfact-specific as-applied challenges.\"); see also Corgain v.\n\nMiller, 708 F.2d 1241, 1251 (7th Cir. 1983) (upholding facial\n\nadequacy of plan for prisoner's access to law library, but not\n\nforeclosing future challenge to plan as implemented).\n\nD.    Dormant Commerce Clause\n\n            Holding that the Maine Act is not preempted by the\n\nMedicaid statute, we next consider whether it violates the\n\ndormant     Commerce    Clause.        The    Constitution    provides      that\n\nCongress shall have the power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with\n\nforeign Nations, and among the several States, and with the\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fIndian    Tribes[.]\"         U.S.      Const.       art.

The prohibitions imposed\n\nupon state regulation by the dormant Commerce Clause have fallen\n\ninto several identifiable categories.

When     a   state   statute\n\nregulates commerce wholly outside the state’s borders or when\n\nthe    statute   has   a    practical    effect    of    controlling     conduct\n\noutside of the state, the statute will be invalid under the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause.          Cotto Waxo Co. v. Williams, 46 F.3d\n\n790, 793 (8th Cir. 1995) (citing Healy).                A statute will have an\n\nextraterritorial reach if it “necessarily requires out-of-state\n\ncommerce to be conducted according to in-state terms.”                   Id. at\n\n794.\n\n           Second,     if    a   state   statute    discriminates        against\n\ninterstate commerce, we apply strict scrutiny.                     It will be\n\nscrutinized under a “virtually per se invalid rule,” which means\n\nthat the statute will be invalid unless the state can “show that\n\nit advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fserved by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.” Or.

Quality of Or., 511 U.S. 93, 100-\n\n01 (1994) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThis level of scrutiny will be applied if the state statute\n\ndiscriminates against interstate commerce on its face or in\n\npractical effect.      Taylor, 477 U.S. at 138; see also Bacchus\n\nImports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 270 (1984) (indicating that\n\na finding of discriminatory purpose or discriminatory effect can\n\nconstitute economic protectionism subjecting the state statute\n\nto a “stricter level of invalidity”).            When a state statute\n\n“discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect\n\nis   to   favor   in-state   economic     interests    over   out-of-state\n\ninterests, we have generally struck down the statute without\n\nfurther inquiry.”     Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. N.Y. State\n\nLiquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573, 579 (1986).\n\n            Third, a lower standard of scrutiny is applied when the\n\nstate statute regulates evenhandedly and has only incidental\n\neffects on interstate commerce.         In this situation, a balancing\n\ntest is applied.     Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142\n\n(1970).    \"Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate\n\na    legitimate   local   public   interest,     and    its    effects   on\n\ninterstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\funless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive\n\nin relation to the putative local benefits.\"     Id.\n\n          PhRMA contends that the Maine Act is an impermissible\n\nexercise in extraterritorial regulation and, therefore, is per\n\nse violative of the dormant Commerce Clause.    It argues that the\n\nAct necessarily regulates the transaction that occurs between\n\nthe manufacturer and the distributor outside the borders of\n\nMaine.\n\n          Maine first argues that we need not reach the issue of\n\nwhether the Act violates the dormant Commerce Clause because it\n\nis acting as a \"market participant\" and is therefore exempt from\n\nCommerce Clause restrictions.9   See South-Central Timber Dev.,\n\nInc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82, 93 (1984) (\"if a State is acting\n\nas a market participant, rather than as a market regulator, the\n\ndormant   Commerce   Clause   places     no   limitation   on   its\n\nactivities\").   We hold that Maine does not fall under the market\n\nparticipant exception to the dormant Commerce Clause.      Maine is\n\nnot a market buyer of prescription drugs, except as required by\n\nthe Medicaid statute.    Its citizens will continue to directly\n\npurchase prescription drugs as needed.    Nothing in the Act makes\n\nMaine a market participant.\n\n\n    9See Judge Lynch's opinion in Nat'l Foreign Trade Council,\n181 F.3d at 62-65, for a thorough scholarly discussion of a\nstate as a market participant.\n\n                              -27-\n\f          Maine alternatively argues that the Act evenhandedly\n\nregulates in-state conduct that only has an incidental effect on\n\ninterstate commerce.   Maine contends that we should apply the\n\nlower level of scrutiny, use the Pike balancing test, and find\n\nthat the local benefits of the Maine Rx Program outweigh the\n\nincidental burden on interstate commerce.\n\n          The Maine Act represents a novel legislative approach\n\nto one of the serious problems of our time, one that resists\n\neasy analysis.   We address each of the potentially applicable\n\ndormant   Commerce   Clause   prohibitions      to    determine    the\n\nappropriate analysis and level of scrutiny.\n\n          1.   Per Se Invalidity:      Extraterritorial Reach\n\n          A state may not pass laws that have the \"'practical\n\neffect' of regulating commerce occurring wholly outside that\n\nState's borders . . . .\"        Healy, 491     U.S.   at   332.   When\n\nevaluating the practical effect of the statute, the court should\n\nconsider the statute itself, and “how the challenged statute may\n\ninteract with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other States\n\nand what effect would arise if not one, but many or every, State\n\nadopted similar legislation.”    Id. at 336.\n\n          PhRMA relies on three cases to support its argument\n\nthat the Maine Act is per se invalid because it regulates\n\nconduct beyond the borders of Maine.       The cases cited, however,\n\n\n                                -28-\n\fare inapposite to the facial construction of the Maine Act.\n\nPhRMA construes these cases as standing for the proposition\n\nthat, \"a state may not dictate the terms on which buyers and\n\nsellers do business outside of the state.\"     See, e.g., Healy,\n\n491 U.S. at 338; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 583-84.         This is\n\npartially correct but does not reflect the entire picture.     The\n\ncases on which PhRMA relies, however, involve price control,\n\nprice affirmation or price tying schemes.    See Healy, 491 U.S.\n\nat 326; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 575-76;     Baldwin v. G.A.F.\n\nSeelig, 294 U.S. 511, 519 (1935) (\"Seelig\").    The statutes in\n\nthese cases involved regulating the prices charged in the home\n\nstate and those charged in other states in order to benefit the\n\nbuyers and sellers in the home state, resulting in a direct\n\nburden on the buyers and sellers in the other states.\n\n          In Healy, the Court struck down a Connecticut Liquor\n\nControl Act that required out-of-state shippers of beer to\n\naffirm that the prices at which the products were sold to\n\nConnecticut wholesalers were no higher than prices at which\n\nthose same products were sold in bordering states.   491 U.S. at\n\n326.   The Court held the statute to be unconstitutional because\n\nit controlled prices in neighboring states and interfered with\n\nthe regulatory schemes in those states.   Id. at 338-39.\n\n\n\n\n                              -29-\n\f               In Brown-Forman, the Court struck down a provision of\n\nthe New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law that required liquor\n\ndistillers to affirm that their prices were no higher than the\n\nlowest price at which the same product would be sold in any\n\nother state during the month.              476 U.S. at 575-76.        The Court\n\ndetermined that this was an extraterritorial reach violative of\n\nthe Constitution.          It held that \"[o]nce a distiller has posted\n\nprices    in    New   York,    it   is   not    free   to   change   its   prices\n\nelsewhere       in   the   United   States      during    the   relevant   month.\n\nForcing a merchant to seek regulatory approval in one State\n\nbefore undertaking a transaction in another directly regulates\n\ninterstate commerce.\"           Id. at 582 (footnote omitted).\n\n               In Seelig, the Court struck down the New York Milk\n\nControl Act, which set minimum prices for milk purchased from\n\nin-state and out-of-state producers and banned the resale of\n\nmilk in New York when that milk had been purchased out-of-state\n\nfor a lower price.            294 U.S. at 519.           By requiring New York\n\nwholesalers to buy out-of-state milk at certain prices, the\n\neffect of the statute was to essentially set out-of-state milk\n\nprices.     The Court recognized that the Commerce Clause does not\n\npermit a state to create a \"scale of prices for use in other\n\nstates, and to bar the sale of products . . . unless the scale\n\nhas been observed.\"           Id. at 528.\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\f              The Maine Act is different from these statutes. Unlike\n\nthese price affirmation and price control statutes, the Maine\n\nAct does not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction,\n\neither by its express terms or by its inevitable effect.             Maine\n\ndoes    not   insist   that   manufacturers   sell   their   drugs   to   a\n\nwholesaler for a certain price.10         Similarly, Maine is not tying\n\nthe price of its in-state products to out-of-state prices.\n\nThere is nothing within the Act that requires the rebate to be\n\na certain amount dependent on the price of prescription drugs in\n\nother states.      The Act merely says that the Commissioner of the\n\nMaine Department of Human Services shall use “best efforts to\n\nobtain an initial rebate amount equal to or greater than the\n\nrebate calculated under the Medicaid program . . . .”           Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 22, § 2681(4)(B).           Furthermore, unlike Brown-\n\nForman and Seelig, the Maine Act does not impose direct controls\n\non a transaction that occurs wholly out-of-state.\n\n              PhRMA argues strenuously that the effect of the Act\n\nwill be to regulate the transaction that occurs between the\n\nmanufacturer and the wholesaler -- a transaction that occurs\n\nentirely out of state.        It argues that as a result of the rebate\n\nprovision, manufacturers will lose a portion of their profits\n\n\n       10\n      As noted above, supra fn.2, the anti-profiteering\nprovision of the Act was held unconstitutional and is not part\nof this appeal.\n\n                                   -31-\n\fotherwise    obtained       from   distributors.           Admittedly,   it   is\n\npossible that the rebate provisions of the statute may decrease\n\nthe profits of manufacturers.           Simply because the manufacturers’\n\nprofits might be negatively affected by the Maine Act, however,\n\ndoes not necessarily mean that the Maine Act is regulating those\n\nprofits.\n\n            The Act does not regulate the transaction between\n\nmanufacturers and wholesalers.                 It provides for a negotiated\n\nrebate agreement between \"[a] drug manufacturer or labeler that\n\nsells prescription drugs in [Maine] through the elderly low-cost\n\ndrug   program   .      .    .     or   any      other     publicly   supported\n\npharmaceutical assistance program . . . .\"                 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 2681(3).         The rebate program is voluntary and either\n\nthe manufacturer or the State may withdraw at any time with\n\nsixty days' notice.         The Act directs the commissioner to \"use\n\nthe commissioner's best efforts\" to negotiate the amount of the\n\nrebate required from the manufacturer.                   Id. § 2681(4)(B).    We\n\nnote that the commissioner's \"best efforts\" may become coercive\n\nor otherwise inappropriate, but we cannot say so on this facial\n\nchallenge.   This may be an issue that needs to be revisited once\n\nthe Act takes effect.         On a facial challenge, however, the use\n\nof the commissioner's \"best efforts\" indicates that the Act is\n\nnot \"regulating\" prices, but merely \"negotiating\" rebates.\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\f           The Act clearly does not interfere with regulatory\n\nschemes in other states.            Ultimately, the Maine Act simply\n\nregulates activity that occurs in state:             (1) the purchase of\n\nthe   prescription     drugs    that   triggers     the   rebate;   (2)    the\n\nnegotiation of a rebate amount; and (3) the State's action\n\nsubjecting a manufacturer's drug to prior authorization and\n\nreleasing the manufacturer's name to health care providers and\n\nthe public occurs in state.         Because the regulation only applies\n\nto in-state activities, there is no extraterritorial reach and\n\nthe Act is not per se invalid under the Commerce Clause.\n\n           One final consideration is the consequence of other\n\nstates passing similar statutes.            See Healy, 491 U.S. at 336\n\n(considering \"what effect would arise if not one, but many or\n\nevery, State adopted similar legislation\").               The most apparent\n\neffect of similar statutes being passed in other states would be\n\na loss in profits for manufacturers.           It does not appear, and\n\nPhRMA does not argue, that statutes similar to the Maine Act, if\n\nenacted,    would    result    in   manufacturers    having    inconsistent\n\nobligations to states, or in creating a “price gridlock” linking\n\nprices in some states to the prices in other states.             See Healy,\n\n491 U.S. at 340.      Therefore, at this time, when we are dealing\n\nwith a facial challenge to the Act, there is no evidence that\n\nadverse    effects   on   interstate    commerce     will   occur   if    such\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\flegislation were passed in other states.      The Act is not per se\n\nviolative of the Commerce Clause.\n\n            2.   Strict Level of Scrutiny:   Discriminatory Statute\n\n            A statute enacted for a discriminatory purpose is\n\nsubject to strict scrutiny.    See Bacchus Imports, Ltd., 468 U.S.\n\nat 270.    Under this strict scrutiny analysis, a statute violates\n\nthe Commerce Clause unless the state can show that the statute\n\nserves a legitimate local purpose that is unrelated to economic\n\nprotectionism and that the same purpose could not be achieved by\n\nnondiscriminatory means.     Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 336\n\n(1979).     PhRMA does not contend, nor did the district court\n\nfind, that the Maine Act discriminates on its face or in its\n\neffects.    Therefore, we need not discuss it further.\n\n            3.   Low Level of Scrutiny:   Pike Balancing Test\n\n            When a state statute regulates evenhandedly and has\n\nonly incidental effects on interstate commerce, that statute\n\nwill be upheld unless the burden on interstate commerce is\n\n“clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.”\n\nPike, 397 U.S. at 142.\n\n            Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to\n            effectuate   a   legitimate   local   public\n            interest, and its effects on interstate\n            commerce are only incidental, it will be\n            upheld unless the burden imposed on such\n            commerce is clearly excessive in relation to\n            the   putative  local   benefits.     If   a\n            legitimate local purpose is found, then the\n\n                                -34-\n\f          question becomes one of degree.      And the\n          extent of the burden that will be tolerated\n          will of course depend on the nature of the\n          local interest involved, and on whether it\n          could be promoted as well with a lesser\n          impact    on     interstate     activities.\n          Occasionally   the   Court    has   candidly\n          undertaken a balancing approach in resolving\n          these issues, but more frequently it has\n          spoken in terms of \"direct\" and \"indirect\"\n          effects and burdens.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted).       The Maine Act is neither an\n\nimpermissible extraterritorial reach nor is it discriminatory;\n\nrather,   it   regulates   evenhandedly     and   only   has   incidental\n\neffects on interstate commerce.       Therefore, we apply this lower\n\nlevel of scrutiny, known as the Pike balancing test.\n\n          The district court found the Maine Act to be per se\n\ninvalid, and therefore never determined whether it survives the\n\nPike   balancing   test.     Though   the   district     court   did   not\n\nundertake such an analysis, we may conduct the Pike balancing\n\ntest for the first time on appeal.     See Instructional Sys., Inc.\n\nv. Computer Curriculum Corp., 35 F.3d 813, 826 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\nIn Instructional Systems, the Third Circuit considered a facial\n\nchallenge to the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act after the\n\ndistrict court had declared the statute per se invalid under the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause.     Id. at 826.     The court found that the\n\nstatute, from a facial standpoint, survived the Pike test, and\n\nreversed the district court judgment which had declared the\n\n\n                                -35-\n\fstatute     unconstitutional.            Id.    at     827.    The   Third    Circuit\n\nrecognized, however, that the issue of whether the statute, when\n\napplied, burdens interstate commerce could not be resolved as a\n\nmatter of law.          Id.\n\n            Applying the Pike balancing test to the Maine Act, we\n\nconsider:         (1)    the    nature   of     the    putative      local   benefits\n\nadvanced by the statute; (2) the burden the statute places on\n\ninterstate commerce; and (3) whether the burden is “clearly\n\nexcessive” as compared to the putative local benefits.                            See\n\nPike, 397 U.S. at 142.\n\n            Arguably,          the   only     burden    imposed      on   interstate\n\ncommerce by the Maine Act is its possible effects on the profits\n\nof the individual manufacturers.                As the Third Circuit stated,\n\nhowever, “the fact that a law may have 'devastating economic\n\nconsequences' on a particular interstate firm is not sufficient\n\nto rise to a Commerce Clause burden.”                    Instructional Sys., 35\n\nF.3d at 827 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Ins. Comm’r, 874 F.2d\n\n926, 943 (3d Cir. 1989)); see also Exxon Corp. v. Governor of\n\nMd., 437 U.S. 117, 127-28 (1978) (stating that “the [Commerce]\n\nClause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate\n\nfirms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.”).\n\n            We next consider the local benefits of the Act, which\n\nwe   find    to    be    substantial.           The    Maine    Rx    Program    will\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\fpotentially provide prescription drugs to Maine citizens who\n\ncould not otherwise afford them.          The Maine Legislature has\n\ndecided that without the Maine Rx Program, needy Maine citizens\n\nwill continue to be deprived of necessary medical care because\n\nof   rising    prescription     drug     costs.          When   measuring\n\nmanufacturers' possible loss of profits against the increased\n\naccess to prescription drugs for Maine citizens, the local\n\nbenefits appear to outweigh the burden on interstate commerce.\n\nAt the very least, the burden on interstate commerce is not\n\n“clearly excessive” as compared to the local benefits.\n\n          It   is   necessary   to     recognize   the    difficulty   in\n\nforeseeing what events actually will occur from the enforcement\n\nof this Act, which admittedly makes the Pike balancing test more\n\nchallenging to apply.     We are forced to balance the possible\n\neffects, instead of the actual effects of the statute in action.\n\nFor now, it is enough to say that the Act survives the facial\n\nchallenge under the dormant Commerce Clause.11\n\n\n     11\n      On appeal, Maine argues in the alternative that the Act\ndoes not violate the dormant Commerce Clause because if the\nrebate provision of the Act is construed as a tax, it satisfies\nthe requirements set forth in the Complete Auto line of cases\ndealing with taxation on interstate commerce. See Complete Auto\nTransit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977) (holding that\na state's tax on interstate commerce will be upheld only if it\n\"is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the\ntaxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate\nagainst interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the\nservices provided by the State.\"). PhRMA replies, arguing that\n\n                                -37-\n\fE.   Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors\n\n          Having concluded that PhRMA is not likely to succeed\n\non the merits of its constitutional challenges, we need not\n\ndelve into the three remaining preliminary injunction factors\n\n(risk of irreparable harm, the balance of equities and the\n\npublic interest).    This court has recognized that the “sine qua\n\nnon” of the preliminary injunction analysis is whether the\n\nplaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of the claim.\n\nWeaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12, 14 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(concluding that, after determining that there was no likelihood\n\nof success on the merits, it was not necessary to examine the\n\nother factors).     We must conclude that PhRMA has not satisfied\n\nits burden to obtain a preliminary injunction preventing the\n\nimplementation of the Act.\n\n                          III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          In this facial challenge, we perceive no conflict\n\nbetween the Maine Act and the Medicaid statute that would result\n\n\n\n\nthe Complete Auto test is not satisfied. We need not address\nthis argument on the merits, however, because this legal theory\nwas not raised before the district court. \"'If any principle is\nsettled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely\nin the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on\nappeal.'\" Boateng v. Interamerican Univ., Inc., 210 F.3d 56, 62\n(1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Teamsters Union, Local No. 59 v.\nSuperline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992)). This\nis not one of those extraordinary circumstances.\n\n                                 -38-\n\fin federal preemption.      The Act sets forth prior authorization\n\nprocedures that are consistent with those explicitly permitted\n\nby Medicaid.   PhRMA has not established at this point that the\n\nadministrative burden imposed by prior authorization will likely\n\nharm Medicaid recipients.         In the absence of such evidence, we\n\ncannot conclude that the Act violates the Supremacy Clause.\n\n          Nor does the Act offend the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\nIt is not an extraterritorial regulation on interstate commerce\n\nbecause it does not regulate conduct occurring outside the\n\nstate, but only regulates in-state activities.              Moreover, from\n\na facial standpoint, the local benefits of the Act appear to\n\noutweigh any incidental burden on interstate commerce.               For the\n\nreasons   stated,   the   Maine    Act     survives   the   facial   dormant\n\nCommerce Clause challenge.\n\n          This is a close case but we do not think that, under\n\nthe applicable law, the State of Maine should be prohibited from\n\nputting the Act into play.        We heed the dissent of Justice Louis\n\nBrandeis in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 310\n\n(1932):\n\n          To stay experimentation in things social and\n          economic is a grave responsibility. Denial\n          of the right to experiment may be fraught\n          with serious consequences to the nation. It\n          is one of the happy incidents of the federal\n          system that a single courageous state may,\n          if   its  citizens   choose,   serve   as   a\n          laboratory;   and  try   novel   social   and\n\n                                    -39-\n\f         economic experiments without risk to the\n         rest of the country.     This Court has the\n         power to prevent an experiment.       We may\n         strike down the statute which embodies it on\n         the ground that, in our opinion, the measure\n         is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\n         We have power to do this, because the due\n         process clause has been held by the Court\n         applicable to matters of substantive law as\n         well as to matters of procedure.     But, in\n         the exercise of this high power, we must be\n         ever on our guard, lest we erect our\n         prejudices into legal principles.      If we\n         would guide by the light of reason, we must\n         let our minds be bold.\n\n(footnote omitted).\n\n         The decision of the district court is REVERSED and the\n\ntemporary injunction is VACATED.\n\n                - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                             -40-\n\f                           APPENDIX\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:\n\n         The Maine Rx Program, referred to in this\n         subchapter as the “program,” is established\n         to reduce prescription drug prices for\n         residents of the State.      The program is\n         designed   for   the    State   to   utilize\n         manufacturer rebates and pharmacy discounts\n         to reduce prescription drug prices.       In\n         implementing the program, the State shall\n         serve as a pharmacy benefit manager in\n         establishing rebates and discounts on behalf\n         of qualified residents.\n\n         1. Program goals.    The Legislature finds\n         that affordability is critical in providing\n         access to prescription drugs for Maine\n         residents.   This subchapter is enacted by\n         the Legislature to enable the State to act\n         as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to\n         make prescription drugs more affordable for\n         qualified    Maine    residents,     thereby\n         increasing the overall health of Maine\n         residents, promoting healthy communities and\n         protecting the public health and welfare.\n         It is not the intention of the State to\n         discourage employers from offering or paying\n         for prescription drug benefits for their\n         employees or to replace employer-sponsored\n         prescription drug benefit plans that provide\n         benefits comparable to those made available\n         to qualified Maine residents under this\n         subchapter.\n\n                           * * * *\n\n         3. Rebate agreement. A drug manufacturer\n         or labeler that sells prescription drugs in\n         this State through the elderly low-cost drug\n         program under section 254 or any other\n         publicly supported pharmaceutical assistance\n         program shall enter into a rebate agreement\n         with the department for this program. The\n         rebate    agreement    must   require    the\n\n                             -41-\n\fmanufacturer or labeler to make rebate\npayments to the State each calendar quarter\nor according to a schedule established by\nthe department.\n\n4. Rebate amount. The commissioner shall\nnegotiate the amount of the rebate required\nfrom a manufacturer or labeler in accordance\nwith this subsection.\n\nA.   The   commissioner    shall   take  into\nconsideration the rebate calculated under\nthe Medicaid Rebate Program pursuant to 42\nUnited States Code, Section 1396r-8, the\naverage wholesale price of prescription\ndrugs    and  any    other   information   on\nprescription    drug    prices    and   price\ndiscounts.\n\nB.   The   commissioner   shall  use  the\ncommissioner’s best efforts to obtain an\ninitial rebate amount equal to or greater\nthan  the   rebate  calculated  under the\nMedicaid program pursuant to 42 United\nStates Code, Section 1396r-8.\n\n\n\n\n                    -42-\n\f            KEETON, District Judge (concurring).\n\n                            I.   Introduction\n\n            I concur in the judgment reversing the decision of the\n\ndistrict court and vacating the preliminary injunction.         Because\n\nthe appropriate grounds of the decision involve issues that are\n\nfundamental to harmonizing interests in liberty and order under\n\nthe Constitution of the United States, I conclude that it is\n\nappropriate, if not obligatory, that I state in a concurring\n\nopinion the grounds as I see them for reaching this judgment.\n\n            For reasons associated with undisputed facts about\n\nPharmaceutical Benefit Managers (PBMs) and relationships between\n\ninterests they represent and interests of citizens of Maine\n\nrepresented    by   the   Commissioner,   Maine   Department   of   Human\n\nServices, Maine’s Legislature, and Maine’s Attorney General, I\n\nturn first to a more extended recitation of background facts\n\nregarding standing and jurisdiction than appears in the opinion\n\nof the Court of Appeals, delivered by Judge Bownes.\n\n      II.     Background Facts on Standing and Jurisdiction\n              to Consider Group or Association Contentions\n\n            Did the district court have authority, and does the\n\nCourt of Appeals have authority, to consider positions stated in\n\nbriefs on behalf of groups or associations seeking to represent\n\nthe interests of their members that they claim are materially\n\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\faffected by orders made, or that might be made, in the district\n\ncourt and on appeal?\n\n            The case before us is styled Pharmaceutical Research\n\nand Manufacturers of America, Plaintiff, Appellee, v. Kevin\n\nConcannon, Commissioner, Maine Department of Human Services, and\n\nMaine Attorney General, Defendants, Appellants.\n\n            Plaintiff/Appellee’s            CORPORATE    DISCLOSURE          STATEMENT\n\nsays   that     “plaintiff/appellee,          Pharmaceutical           Research     and\n\nManufacturers         of    America,   by    and    through      its    undersigned\n\ncounsel, and, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26.1, states that it has\n\nno parent company and that no publicly held company owns any of\n\nits stock.”\n\n            In its brief, which uses the short title PhRMA to\n\ndesignate       itself,      Plaintiff/Appellee         refers    to        additional\n\ncharacteristics and rights of PhRMA.\n\n            + It has the ability to challenge adverse treatment\n\n                       under the Maine Act, including a challenge on\n\n                       preemption grounds. Plaintiff/Appellee’s Brief\n\n                       at 34.\n\n            +    It   has    members   who    are   “regulated         by    and   make\n\n                       payments consistent with the provisions of the\n\n                       Medicaid prescription drug program.”                  Id. at 36\n\n                       n.21.\n\n\n                                       -44-\n\f            Also, on the basis of the limited information available\n\nin the record, I infer that some of PhRMA’s members are Pharmacy\n\nBenefit Managers (PBMs).       No party or amicus, or attorney for a\n\nparty or amicus, has called attention to any case explicitly\n\ndeclaring that PBMs have standing and a United States district\n\ncourt has jurisdiction to consider either a facial challenge or\n\nan as-applied challenge by a PBM to a state statute like Maine’s\n\nAct to Establish Fairer Pricing for Prescription Drugs, and I am\n\naware of none.    Treating the issue as one of first impression,\n\nI would recognize both standing and jurisdiction, in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Maine, and on appeal.\n\nIn the world outside the court system, as a pragmatic matter no\n\nother person or entity is as active and effective in protecting\n\nbenefits and beneficiaries of availability of pharmacy products\n\nat reasonable cost as PBMs.      It is entirely appropriate in these\n\ncircumstances that the standing of PBMs be recognized in United\n\nStates   district     courts   and    on    appeal   from   adjudications\n\ninterpreting    and   applying   state      legislation     affecting   the\n\nbenefits and interests of beneficiaries of marketing of pharmacy\n\nproducts.    As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has\n\npreviously stated, “Article III standing is largely . . . albeit\n\nnot entirely . . . a practical jurisprudence.”              New Hampshire\n\nHemp Council v. Marshall, 203 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing\n\n\n                                     -45-\n\f13 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 3531.1, at 352, 362-63 (2d\n\ned.1984)).\n\n          The basis for the foregoing conclusions is a principled\n\nproposition that applies broadly.    I state explicitly, for the\n\nsake of clarity, that in my view it applies to each of the\n\nfollowing contentions, in addition to the standing of PhRMA and\n\nthe standing of PBMs to make the contention stated above:\n\n          (A) claims of violation of the Supremacy Clause;\n\n          (B) claims of violation of Dormant Commerce Clause\n\njurisprudence (as to which, with respect to PhRMA’s standing,\n\nsee also Part II.D of opinion of the Court of Appeals, delivered\n\nby Judge Bownes).\n\n          For the reasons explained in the remainder of this\n\nopinion concurring in the judgment, I would allow standing and\n\njurisdiction but reject on the merits other specific challenges\n\nto the Maine Rx Program.\n\nIII.   Madisonian Influences on Allocation of Legislative Power\n                  in the American Legal System\n\n          The roles of state legislatures and the Congress of the\n\nUnited States in the American legal system owe much to James\n\nMadison’s seminal thinking expressed publicly and privately\n\nduring debates over the structure of the new form of federalism\n\nto be established under a constitution drafted in May, 1787 to\n\n                              -46-\n\fcure deficiencies in the Articles of Confederation of 1777.                      See\n\ngenerally    John    P.   Kaminski,      Ph.D.,      Director,       and    Richard\n\nLeffler,    Ph.D.,   Co-Director,        The     Center     for     Study   of   the\n\nAmerican    Constitution,       The    University      of    Wisconsin-Madison\n\n(Wisconsin    Study),     The    Origins        of   the    Three    Branches     of\n\nGovernment,    Federal     Judicial       Center     Traveling       Seminar     3-9\n\n(2001).\n\n            Madison, a Virginian, writing to Edmund Randolph of New\n\nYork on 8 April 1787, mused:\n\n               I hold it for a fundamental point that an\n            individual independence of the States, is\n            utterly irreconcileable with the idea of an\n            aggregate sovereignty. I think at the same\n            time that a consolidation of the States into\n            one simple republic is not less unattainable\n            than it would be inexpedient.     Let it be\n            tried then whether any middle ground can be\n            taken which will at once support a due\n            supremacy of the national authority, and\n            leave in force the local authorities so far\n            as they can be subordinately useful.\n\n                                      . . . .\n\n               Let the national Government be armed with\n            a positive & compleat authority in all cases\n            where uniform measures are necessary. As in\n            trade &c. &c. Let it also retain the powers\n            which it now possesses.\n\n                 Let it have a negative in all cases\n            whatsoever on the Legislative Acts of the\n            States as the K. of G.B. heretofore had.\n            This I conceive to be essential and the\n            least possible abridgement of the State\n            Soveriegnties.   Without such a defensive\n\n\n                                       -47-\n\f         power, every positive power that can be\n         given on paper will be unavailing. . . .\n\n            Let this national supremacy be extended\n         also to the Judiciary departmt.      If the\n         judges in the last resort depend on the\n         States & are bound by their oaths to them\n         and not to the Union, the intention of the\n         law and the interests of the nation may be\n         defeated by the obsequiousness of the\n         Tribunals to the policy or prejudices of the\n         States. It seems at least essential that an\n         appeal should lie to some national tribunals\n         on all cases which concern foreigners, or\n         inhabitants of other States. . . .\n\n               The supremacy of the whole in the\n         Executive department seems liable to some\n         difficulty. Perhaps an extension of it to\n         the case of the Militia may be necessary and\n         sufficient.\n\n             A Government formed of such extensive\n         powers ought to be well organized. . . .\n\n                           . . . .\n\n            To give the new system its proper energy\n         it will be desirable to have it ratified by\n         the authority of the people, and not merely\n         by that of the Legislatures.\n\nThe Origins of the Three Branches of Government, id., at 4-5.\n\nMadison concluded these thoughts with a statement that, fearing\n\n“you will think this project, if not extravagant, absolutely\n\nunattainable and unworthy of being attempted,” he conceived it\n\n“to go no further than is essential.”   Id. at 6.\n\n         In his Notes of Convention Debates, Madison records\n\nResolutions proposed by Mr. Randolph in Convention on May 29,\n\n\n                             -48-\n\f1787, including a set of proposals for a form of federalism\n\nremarkably similar to Madison’s suggestions six weeks earlier.\n\n          Those    Madisonian    suggestions   are   reminders   of    two\n\nsalient points relevant to our consideration of the issues\n\npresented in the present appeal.\n\n          First.    The genius of the Constitution of the United\n\nStates of America is that it establishes a unique form of\n\nfederalism, unlike any ever fashioned before, that harmonizes\n\nand accommodates in new and distinctive ways national and state\n\ncenters of governmental power.\n\n          Second.    The authority for this new form of federalism\n\nis declared by “the people, and not merely by the Legislatures.”\n\nSee id. at 5.\n\n          The eighteenth-century debates in which Madison and\n\nRandolph were among the key participants occurred more than two\n\ncenturies ago.      Twenty-first century readers are even more\n\nremoved than the lapse of time suggests from being in tune with\n\nthe spirit and culture surrounding the debates over what became\n\nthe Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights\n\nembodied in the Amendments adopted forthwith.             Those debates\n\nwere strikingly lively and thorough examinations of the history\n\nof peoples’ ideas and efforts to form governments powerful\n\nenough   to   preserve   the    order    essential   to   protection    of\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\findividual liberty and at the same time subject to inherent\n\ncontrols against abuse of power likely to lead to despotism.\n\n            Ideas about liberty and order are no less relevant now\n\nthan they were when the Founders developed the Constitution of\n\nthe United States of America.           “The aim of the American legal\n\nsystem is liberty and justice for all.              How close we come to\n\nthat aim depends on good judging.”           Robert E. Keeton, Judging in\n\nthe American Legal System 1 (Lexis Law Publishing 1999).\n\n            The quality of judging in a legal system\n            depends on commitment.   It depends, first,\n            on commitment to the aim of justice.\n            Second,   it  depends   on  commitment   to\n            professionalism.   The declared beliefs of\n            all professionals in the system – including\n            advocates, counselors, and academic critics\n            as well as judges – affect the quality of\n            judging in the system. Third, the quality\n            of judging depends on commitment to method.\n            Judicial choice, at its best, is reasoned\n            choice, candidly explained.\n\nId. at 5.     Reasoned judicial choice in the matter currently\n\npending   before   us    requires,      in   my   view,   that   we   reject\n\nplaintiff’s facial challenge to the constitutionality of the\n\nMaine   statute,   but    does    not   require   that    we   consider   the\n\nconstitutionality        of     every   possible     interpretation       or\n\napplication of the Maine statute.            This view is reenforced by\n\ntaking into account James Madison’s contributions to federalist\n\nthought and actions.          This historical background is especially\n\nrelevant, in my view, to disputes over supremacy of national\n\n                                    -50-\n\flegislation and associated issues of interpretation of the Maine\n\nstatute that was before the district court and is before us in\n\nthis appeal.\n\n                IV.   In the American Legal System,\n                       a State is a Sovereign\n\n          Under     fundamental     premises     of   the   American   legal\n\nsystem, the State of Maine, like all other States of the United\n\nStates of America, is a sovereign.         Each State has authority to\n\ngovern persons and institutions and their transactions within\n\nits territorial boundaries.\n\n          I do not understand that any of the briefs before us\n\nchallenges the sovereignty of states within the Union, and I do\n\nnot   understand    the   opinion     of   the    Court     of   Appeals     as\n\nchallenging this proposition.        Thus, I say no more here on the\n\nexistence of sovereignty of states within the Union.                       Some\n\nimportant implications of this sovereignty, however, are noted\n\nin other sections of this opinion, infra.\n\n               V.   A State May Act in Multiple Roles\n\n          A sovereign State of the United States, in addition to\n\ngoverning, may be an active participant in a market for any kind\n\nof goods or services that it seeks to buy for its own use,\n\nincluding a purchase for (1) a use such as obtaining furniture\n\nfor a State office and (2) a use such as obtaining pharmacy\n\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\fproducts    for   State-sponsored         programs      such   as    Medicaid       and\n\nMedicare.\n\n            Thus, the     State of Maine may act\n\n            (1)    as a sovereign,\n\n            (2)      as a market participant itself because it buys\n\n                     pharmacy products for Medicaid patients, and\n\n            (3)      in “the role of each State as a guardian and\n\n                     trustee       for   its    people”    who      need    pharmacy\n\n                     products       at    affordable      prices.          White     v.\n\n                     Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, 460\n\n                     U.S. 204, 207 n.3 (1983).\n\n            The third of these roles has special relevance to\n\nissues in this case because Maine has undertaken to represent\n\n“its people”      who need pharmacy products at affordable prices.\n\n            It    would   be   a   curious      irony   indeed      if     dozens   of\n\nprivately organized groups of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)\n\ncould participate freely in the market for purchasing products\n\nfrom pharmacy product manufacturers but States as guardians and\n\ntrustees for their people could not because the States are also\n\nsovereign.       In my view, we should make the commonsense ruling\n\nthat the State of Maine as well as PBMs may participate in the\n\nmarket for purchasing pharmacy products.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\f         Any    conflict      of   interest     problems    that   might\n\ntheoretically   be   raised    are   answered    in   the   distinctive\n\ncircumstances of this case by the fact that the State of Maine\n\nfaces no conflicting interests because it believes that in all\n\nits roles it is trying to serve the best interests of its people\n\nand each of the groups of its people who have an interest in and\n\nneed for pharmacy products.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -53-\n\f            VI.     Interpreting “Best Efforts” Provisions\n                           of the Maine Statute\n\nA.     The Statutory Maine Rx Program\n\n            By a legislative enactment in the first quarter of the\n\nyear 2000, the State of Maine established The Maine Rx Program\n\n(“the program”).         Maine’s Act to Establish Fairer Pricing for\n\nPrescription Drugs, 2000 Me. Legis. Ch. 786 (S.P. 1026) (L.D.\n\n2599) (“The Act”).        The Act established the program “to reduce\n\nprescription drug prices for residents of the State.”                 Id., Me.\n\nRev.    Stat.     Ann.   tit.   22,   §   2681   (unnumbered   introductory\n\nparagraph).\n\n            The program is designed for the State to\n            utilize manufacturer rebates and pharmacy\n            discounts   to  reduce   prescription  drug\n            prices.   In implementing the program, the\n            State shall serve as a pharmacy benefit\n            manager   in   establishing   rebates   and\n            discounts on behalf of qualified residents.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n            The    legislation    was     explicit   in   declaring   program\n\ngoals.\n\n            1.   Program goals.   The Legislature finds\n            that affordability is critical in providing\n            access to prescription drugs for Maine\n            residents.   This subchapter is enacted by\n            the Legislature to enable the State to act\n            as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to\n            make prescription drugs more affordable for\n            qualified    Maine     residents,    thereby\n            increasing the overall health of Maine\n            residents, promoting healthy communities and\n            protecting the public health and welfare.\n\n                                      -54-\n\f         It is not the intention of the State to\n         discourage employers from offering or paying\n         for prescription drug benefits for their\n         employees or to replace employer-sponsored\n         prescription drug benefit plans that provide\n         benefits comparable to those made available\n         to qualified Maine residents under this\n         subchapter.\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 2681 (emphasis added).\n\n         Some of the statutory definitions of terms are relevant\n\nto interpretive issues before us in this appeal.\n\n         2.     Definitions.   As  used      in  this\n         subchapter, unless the context     otherwise\n         indicates, the following terms     have the\n         following meanings.\n\n                           . . . .\n\n                B. “Initial discounted price” means\n                a price that is less than or equal to\n                the average wholesale price, minus\n                6%, plus the dispensing fee provided\n                under the Medicaid program under this\n                Title.\n\n                           . . . .\n\n                E. “Pharmacy benefit manager” means\n                an entity that procures prescription\n                drugs at a negotiated rate under a\n                contract.\n\n                           . . . .\n\n                G.    “Secondary discounted price”\n                means a price that is equal to or\n                less than the initial discounted\n                price minus the amount of any rebate\n                paid    by   the    State   to   the\n                participating retail pharmacy.\n\nId.\n\n                             -55-\n\f            Also   relevant    to    the    matters    before   us     are   the\n\nstatutory provisions on rebate amount.\n\n            4. Rebate amount. The commissioner shall\n            negotiate the amount of the rebate required\n            from a manufacturer or labeler in accordance\n            with this subsection.\n\n                                    . . . .\n\n                   B.   The commissioner shall use the\n                   commissioner’s best efforts to obtain\n                   an initial rebate amount equal to or\n                   greater than the rebate calculated\n                   under the Medicaid program pursuant\n                   to 42 United States Code, Section\n                   1396r-8.\n\n                   C. With respect to the rebate taking\n                   effect no later than October 1, 2001,\n                   the   commissioner   shall  use   the\n                   commissioner’s best efforts to obtain\n                   an amount equal to or greater than\n                   the amount of any discount, rebate or\n                   price   reduction  for   prescription\n                   drugs   provided   to   the   Federal\n                   Government.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n            Finally, statutory provisions on discounted prices for\n\nqualified    residents,   in   subsection      5,     are   relevant    to   the\n\nmatters before us.\n\n                   B.   Beginning January 1, 2001, a\n                   participating retail pharmacy shall\n                   offer the initial discounted price.\n\n\n                   C. No later than October 1, 2001, a\n                   participating retail pharmacy shall\n                   offer the secondary discounted price.\n\n\n                                     -56-\n\fId.\n\n\nB.    Statutory Interpretation\n\n           We should be guided primarily by the plain language of\n\nall the provisions of the statute that are relevant to the\n\nissues before us, and the plain and ordinary meaning of the\n\nwords   used   in   all   the   relevant   provisions.          The    relevant\n\nprovisions     include    the     definitions    in     the    statute,     the\n\ndeclaration of program goals, and the operational directives to\n\nDefendant/Appellant       Kevin     Concannon,        Commissioner,       Maine\n\nDepartment of Human Services.         With these guideposts in mind, I\n\nconclude that a     reasonable interpretation of the Maine statute\n\nincludes the following elements:\n\n           + The Maine statute authorizes “best efforts” of Maine\n\n                    administrators         rather       than          requiring\n\n                    prohibitive      administrative           decisions     and\n\n                    actions.\n\n           +   The courts should respect the legislative drafters’\n\n                    thoughtful use of the idea of “best efforts.”\n\n           +   It would be a mistake to accept the suggestions of\n\n                    challenges to the Maine statute that propose to\n\n                    interpret it in a way that, in effect, reads\n\n                    “best efforts” out of the statute.\n\n\n\n                                    -57-\n\f            The provision that opponents describe as requiring\n\nauthorization for participating pharmacies to offer discounted\n\nprices to some defined group of Maine residents and obtain\n\nrebates from a state fund, created by an assessment against\n\nmanufacturers, is not a statutory mandate.                 Instead, the statute\n\nrequires only “best efforts” of Administrators to achieve the\n\nlegislative aim of protecting interests of the people of Maine\n\nby ongoing creative mediation and negotiation that appeals to\n\nthe executives of pharmacy products manufacturers to cooperate\n\nwith   Maine’s         administration       of    legislatively        authorized\n\nprograms.    The statutory provisions providing for “best efforts”\n\nand for “negotiation” make clear that the drafters intended the\n\nrebate process to entail negotiation and compromise between the\n\nstate and the manufacturers to reach a mutually beneficial\n\noutcome.    Although conceivably these “best efforts” could fail,\n\nand manufacturers could be subject to the prior authorization\n\nprovisions of the statute, this outcome is not mandated by the\n\nlanguage of the statute, and it is not necessary, in a facial\n\nchallenge    to       the   statute,   to   reach     questions      that    may   be\n\npresented in the future if “best efforts” fail.\n\n            As    a    practical   matter,       it   is   obvious    that    many,\n\nprobably most, citizens of Maine who have a need for pharmacy\n\nproducts but have less than the economic resources of, say, the\n\n\n                                       -58-\n\ftop ten percent of citizens of the state, do not have adequate\n\nresources and practical means to get the pharmacy products they\n\nneed unless\n\n                   (i)   by travel to Canada, or\n\n                   (ii) by mail, or\n\n                   (iii) in some other way that\n\n                         involves           aid      or\n\n                         assistance comparable to\n\n                         that PBMs provide.\n\nIf these citizens have a need for prescription medication, and\n\nchoose to forgo that medication rather than resort to these\n\nresources, it may well be in the interests of PhRMA members to\n\nnegotiate with the State of Maine.          In light of allegations made\n\nin their submissions, I infer that PhRMA members believe that a\n\nrebate in the amount of the Medicaid rebate would not be in\n\ntheir best interest, but the plain language of the statute\n\nallows   for   negotiation   in   a   way   that   will   serve   the   best\n\ninterests of both PhRMA members and previously unrepresented\n\ncitizens of the State of Maine.\n\n    VII.   The Timing of Adjudications on Constitutionality\n\n           The Maine statute, interpreted in the way explained in\n\nPart VI, is consistent with all State and Federal constitutional\n\ndoctrines and is permissible legislation.           The district court’s\n\n\n                                  -59-\n\fruling   to    the    contrary    must    be    vacated.            No        federal    law\n\n(constitutional, statutory, or decisional) preempts and thus\n\nforbids reasonable implementation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n22, § 2681.\n\n           Properly       interpreted,      that    law       is    compatible          with\n\nrather than conflicting with federal Medicaid legislation and\n\nadministrative supervision of Medicaid.\n\n           It        is   error     to     say      --        as         is     said      in\n\nDefendants/Appellants’ Brief at page 18 -- that the extent to\n\nwhich the Act advances the purposes of Medicaid is irrelevant\n\nAlso, it is error to say that the “proper question” in this\n\nappeal   “is    whether    the    Act    conflicts       with      the        purposes    of\n\nMedicaid,” as        Defendants/Appellants’ Brief asserts at page 18.\n\nThe core question is multifarious, not singular.                          An evaluative\n\nlegal test applies, not a bright-line elements legal test.\n\n           Plaintiff/Appellee            proposes        in        its        waiver     and\n\npreclusion arguments that we should hold that the fact that\n\nDefendants/Appellants        make       these    fallacious          arguments          bars\n\nrelief to Defendants/Appellants in this appeal.                          I would reject\n\nthis argument.        It does not state a valid reason for depriving\n\nthe citizens of Maine of a fair adjudication of their interests\n\nat stake in this appeal, based on a proper interpretation of the\n\nMaine statute.       Our federal system permits a State’s advocacy in\n\n\n                                        -60-\n\fcourt in support of its interests and those of its people.\n\nPenalizing a state and its people whenever the state makes an\n\nargument rejected by the court is not appropriate.\n\n              Other arguments presented by Defendants/Appellants both\n\nhere    and    in    the    district   court      are    consistent       with    the\n\ninterpretation of the Maine statute explained in Part VI of this\n\nopinion and support reversal of the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\n              An         unstated      but        implicit           premise        of\n\nPlaintiff/Appellee’s           position      in   this    case       is   that     all\n\nPlaintiff/Appellee need do to succeed in a facial challenge to\n\nthe Maine Act is to show that the administration of the Act is\n\nputting pressure on Plaintiff/ Appellee, thus making its choice\n\nabout how it responds to the circumstances developing under\n\nongoing administration of the Act not entirely voluntary.\n\n              The fallacy of that position stems from the fact that\n\nfew    choices      of   individuals   and    entities     in    a    geographical\n\nterritory that has a government are entirely voluntary.                          True,\n\nsome transactions are beyond governmental authority to intrude.\n\nThey are “transactions beyond law” in the sense that individuals\n\nand private (non-governmental) entities they create and maintain\n\nhave a large range of freedom under law to do as they please\n\nwithout governmental intrusion on that freedom.                  But a demand by\n\n\n                                       -61-\n\fany individual or entity for entire freedom is fundamentally in\n\nconflict with having a government that maintains the order\n\nessential to protection of individual freedom.\n\n          It is possible, as explained in Part VIII, infra, to\n\nfashion   remedies    for   any    threats    that   may    arise    from\n\noverstepping the bounds of statutorily authorized “best efforts”\n\nof Maine’s Commissioner of Human Services during the ongoing\n\nadministration of the Maine Rx Program.          It is appropriate to\n\nwait and see what happens, and fashion appropriate remedies for\n\nany   overstepping,     rather     than      declaring     Maine’s    Act\n\nunconstitutional because of an outside chance that something\n\nbeyond constitutional bounds will be attempted unless an advance\n\ndeclaration of facial invalidity of the statute by the district\n\ncourt is allowed to stand.\n\n                  VIII. Remedies for Threats\n             to Overstep Statutory Authorization\n\n          A United States district court, confronted with a\n\nfacial challenge to validity of a state statute on grounds like\n\nthose asserted in this case, should dismiss the facial challenge\n\nfor failure to meet the requirements of applicable precedents.\n\n          The court might also find it appropriate to declare\n\nexplicitly that the dismissal on this ground would not be a bar\n\nto an otherwise properly supported claim for relief against a\n\nthreatened administrative overstepping of the bounds of the\n\n                                  -62-\n\fstatutory authorization for administrative “best efforts” to\n\nnegotiate and implement a suitable accommodation of legitimate\n\ninterests by methods acceptable to Maine’s Commissioner of Human\n\nServices, acting both for the State and as a PBM for its people,\n\nand to manufacturers of pharmacy products who wish to market\n\ntheir products in Maine consistently with the Maine Rx Program.\n\n            The decision would be one to wait and see, and act then\n\nif    needed,    instead       of     prohibiting      legislatively      sponsored\n\nadministrative       aid       to    the   people   of     Maine    because     of    a\n\npossibility that at some time in the future some administrator\n\nwill overstep the bounds of the legislative authorization.\n\n            For example, acting under this wait-and-see principle,\n\nthe    Court    of   Appeals         would    vacate     the   District       Court’s\n\npreliminary injunction, but at the same time declare that its\n\nruling would not stand as a bar to renewed proceedings in the\n\nDistrict    Court    if    at       some   future   time    the     Legislative      or\n\nExecutive      Branch     of    the    sovereign    State      of    Maine,    or    an\n\nAdministrative Agency authorized to act to serve the declared\n\nlegislative aim of the statute in issue, takes action that is an\n\nimminent threat to legally protected interests of a person or\n\nentity (including any out-of-state as well as any in-state\n\nperson or entity) claiming a right to market pharmacy products\n\nin Maine.       An as-applied challenge to state legislation is a\n\n\n                                           -63-\n\fmore   flexible   instrument   of   adjudication,   more   capable   of\n\nreaching an outcome tailored to the circumstances and needs of\n\na case at hand than the all-or-nothing nature of a facial\n\nchallenge to validity.\n\n          A federal district or appellate court’s acting in\n\nadvance of overstepping, because of the possibility overstepping\n\nmight occur in the future, is fundamentally inconsistent with\n\nthe body of precedents establishing the elements of a successful\n\nfacial challenge in a federal court to the consistency of a\n\nstate statute with potentially preemptive federal law.           See,\n\ne.g., California Coastal Comm’n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S.\n\n572, 579-80 (1987) (holding that state permit requirements were\n\nnot preempted by federal law, and stating that the party arguing\n\nin favor of preemption would have to demonstrate “that there is\n\nno possible set of conditions that the [state] could place on\n\nits permit that would not conflict with federal law – that any\n\nstate permit requirement is per se preempted”) (underscoring\n\nadded).   These precedents would require PhRMA to demonstrate\n\n“that there is no possible” application of the statute that\n\nwould not conflict with the structure and purpose of Medicaid.\n\nPhRMA cannot meet this burden.       It could not do so even if we\n\nsoftened the legal standard a bit by substituting “reasonably\n\n\n\n\n                                -64-\n\flikely”   for      “possible.”         PhRMA’s    facial    challenge       must   be\n\ndenied.\n\n              A federal court’s acting in advance of overstepping by\n\nstate officials, and responding to a facial challenge, is also\n\ninconsistent with relevant precedents for a facial challenge on\n\nconstitutional grounds.           In United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S.\n\n739 (1987), the Supreme Court stated that “a facial challenge to\n\na legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to\n\nmount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no\n\nset of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”\n\nId. at 745.\n\n              It   is   true     that    the     Salerno    decision    has     been\n\ncriticized in later opinions of some Justices of the Supreme\n\nCourt.    See, e.g., Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 740\n\n(1997) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgments) (declaring\n\nthat    the   Court     has    never    in   fact    applied   “such    a     strict\n\nstandard.”); Janklow v. Planned Parenthood, 517 U.S. 1174, 1175-\n\n76 (1996) (Stevens, J., respecting the denial of the petition\n\nfor certiorari) (calling the Salerno decision “draconian” and\n\ndeclaring that it “does not accurately characterize the standard\n\nfor deciding facial challenges.”).\n\n              Salerno, nevertheless, continues to be cited by both\n\nthe    Supreme     Court   and   the    Courts      of   Appeals.      See,    e.g.,\n\n\n                                        -65-\n\fAnderson v.       Edwards, 514 U.S. 143, 155 n.6 (1995); Reno v.\n\nFlores, 507 U.S. 292, 301 (1993); Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S.\n\n173,   183    (1991).        We    need   not    reach   the   issue   of     the\n\napplicability of the Salerno test, however, because the statute\n\nin this case, as explained in Part VI of this opinion, is\n\ncapable      of   an   interpretation      and    an   application     that    is\n\nrespectful of limits imposed by the Constitution.\n\n             The application of facial-challenge jurisprudence in\n\nthe circumstance of this case before the District Court and in\n\nthis appeal is, in practical effect, a considerable stretch\n\nbeyond any thus-far-successful facial challenge.                  If such an\n\nextension of the jurisprudence of facial challenges expressed in\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court of the United States is to occur,\n\nit is more appropriate that it occur in an opinion of that Court\n\nthan in an opinion of a Court of Appeals.\n\n             My own reading of the array of Supreme Court opinions\n\non this subject, even in light of the ongoing differences both\n\nwithin the Court and among scholars on the applicability of the\n\nSalerno test, is that precedent points away from rather than\n\ntoward    softening     in   any   way    the    rigorous   requirements      for\n\npresenting a successful facial challenge to validity of a state\n\nstatute.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -66-\n\f             This conclusion is supported not only by the opinions\n\nexplicitly       reasoned     as   part     of   the    facial-challenge\n\njurisprudence but also by other ongoing developments of federal\n\nlaw.\n\n             One ongoing development supportive of the conclusion\n\nI propose is the resurgence in recent years of emphasis on the\n\nrespect that inferior federal courts are directed to show for\n\nthe freedom of the people of a locality and local governmental\n\ninstitutions to make their own decisions.               For illustrative\n\ncitations, see Part IX of this opinion, infra.               See also the\n\nMadisonian principles identified in Part III, supra.                    This\n\nemphasis is in part a feature of the distinctive version of\n\nfederalism underlying what is commonly called the American legal\n\nsystem.      It is associated with the Supreme Court’s invoking the\n\nCommerce Clause not for the ordinary purpose of sustaining\n\nfederal legislation but to strike down state legislation.               This\n\nemphasis on federalism weighs in favor of sustaining rather than\n\nstriking down the Maine Rx Program, as explained in Part IX,\n\ninfra.\n\n       IX.

[t]o regulate\n         Commerce . . . among the several States. . .\n         .”    Art. I, §8, cl. 3.        It is long\n         established that, while a literal reading\n         evinces a grant of power to Congress, the\n         Commerce Clause also directly limits the\n         powers of the States. . . . [Wyoming v.\n         Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 454 (1992) (citing\n         authorities).]\n\nBrief Amicus Curiae of the Chamber of Commerce of the United\n\nStates in Support of Appellee Recommending Affirmance at 7.   The\n\ncitations relied upon include the following:\n\n         Healy v. The Beer Institute, 491 U.S. 324,\n         336  (1989)   (“a  statute  that  directly\n         controls commerce occurring wholly outside\n         the boundaries of a State exceeds the\n\n                              -68-\n\f            inherent limits of the enacting State’s\n            authority and is invalid regardless of\n            whether the statute’s extraterritorial reach\n            was intended by the legislature.         The\n            critical inquiry is whether the practical\n            effect of the regulation is to control\n            conduct   beyond  the   boundaries  of   the\n            State.”); see generally Laurence H. Tribe,\n            American Constitutional Law, §6-12 at 1098\n            (3d ed. 2000) (referencing “the per se\n            principle against extraterritorial state\n            regulation”).\n\nId. at 9.\n\n            These   arguments    are    classic       illustrations     of    the\n\ncontroversial efforts that have occurred from time to time to\n\ntreat the Commerce Clause not only as authorizing legislation by\n\nthe Congress of the United States but also as constraining state\n\nlegislation.\n\n            Consider, for example, a case emphasized in the Brief\n\nof the Chamber of Commerce, Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437\n\n(1992).     Unlike the case before us, this was a direct clash\n\nbetween   two   States   of   the     Union.     Wyoming,     a     major   coal-\n\nproducing    State,   though    not     a    seller    of   coal,    imposed    a\n\nseverance tax on those who extracted coal.              The direct impact of\n\nthat severance tax on the price of Wyoming coal purchased by\n\nfour Oklahoma electric utilities was obvious.                     The Oklahoma\n\nlegislature     passed   an     act    requiring       coal-fired      electric\n\nutilities in Oklahoma to burn a mixture containing at least 10%\n\nOklahoma-mined coal.      The utilities reduced their purchases of\n\n                                      -69-\n\fWyoming   coal.         Wyoming’s       severance     tax          revenues    declined.\n\nWyoming sought relief under the original jurisdiction of the\n\nSupreme   Court      of    the    United    States.             The    Court    accepted\n\nWyoming’s complaint and held the Oklahoma act invalid under the\n\n“negative” aspect of the Commerce Clause on the reasoning that\n\nit   “prohibits     economic       protectionism          –    that    is,    regulatory\n\nmeasures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by\n\nburdening out-of-state competitors.”                 Id. at 454.          Even so, the\n\nCourt added that a clearly discriminatory statute will be struck\n\ndown “unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a\n\nvalid factor unrelated to economic protectionism,” citing Maine\n\nv. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131 (1986).\n\n           I need not and do not consider whether the case before\n\nus would qualify for the exception.                  Instead, I conclude that\n\nthe case before us is not one subject to the “negative” rule\n\nitself, quite apart from the exception.\n\n           Wyoming v. Oklahoma and other opinions of the Supreme\n\nCourt that have gone farthest in the direction of a “negative”\n\napplication    of       the      Commerce    Clause           do    not   support      the\n\nproposition    that       a   federal       court    acts          properly     when    it\n\ndisregards     all      the      indicia     of     the        State’s       purpose    in\n\nestablishing      the     Maine    Rx   Program     to        regulate    transactions\n\nwithin the territorial boundaries of Maine and to protect the\n\n\n                                         -70-\n\fhealth of the people of Maine.    In these circumstances a federal\n\ncourt does not act properly when it makes a judicial “finding”\n\nthat the State’s declaration of purpose is a facade and the real\n\npurpose was “to regulate the price paid in earlier transactions\n\nin other states.”\n\n          First.    The legislative aim of the Act was fully stated\n\nin the Act itself, as explained in Part VI.A of this opinion,\n\nsupra.   This is not a case of hidden or obscure aims.\n\n          Second.     Any suggestion to the contrary in briefs\n\nbefore this court is in disregard of our obligation, and that of\n\nthe District Court, in reading the statute, to be guided, as\n\nstated in Part VI.B of this opinion, by the plain language of\n\nthe statute, the definitions in the statute, and the plain and\n\nordinary meaning of the words used in the declaration of program\n\ngoals, in the statutory definitions, and in the operational\n\ndirectives to Maine’s Commissioner of Human Services.          See\n\nWhiting v. Town of Westerly, 942 F.2d 18, 21 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(“In evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal\n\ncourt must consider any limiting construction that a state court\n\nor enforcement agency has proffered.”).\n\n          Third.    As stated in Part VI.B, the provision of the\n\nMaine Act that opponents describe as requiring authorization for\n\nparticipating pharmacies to offer discounted prices to some\n\n\n                                -71-\n\fdefined group of Maine residents and obtain rebates from a state\n\nfund, created by an assessment against manufacturers, is not a\n\nstatutory mandate.            Instead, it is a statement of aim.              The\n\nstatute   requires          only   “best   efforts”    of    Administrators    to\n\nachieve the legislative aim of protecting interests of the\n\npeople of Maine by ongoing creative mediation and negotiation.\n\n              Fourth.       As stated in Part VI.B, many and probably most\n\ncitizens of Maine who have a need for pharmacy products would\n\nnot have adequate resources and practical means to get the\n\npharmacy products they need absent the Maine Rx Program.                   In the\n\ncourse of the creative mediation and negotiation required by the\n\nstatute, the pharmaceutical companies themselves may find it is\n\nin their best interests to enter into agreements to allow them\n\nto reach this previously untapped market for their products.\n\n              Fifth.       In view of the foregoing four points, it cannot\n\nbe   proper    for     a    federal   court    to   make    judicial   “findings”\n\ncontrary to Maine’s legislative declarations and on that basis\n\ndeclare that Maine’s Act is invalid because “it attempted to\n\nregulate transactions taking place solely outside the State” and\n\nattempted “to regulate the price paid in earlier transactions in\n\nother states.”         In so doing, the District Court acted beyond its\n\nauthority.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -72-\n\f           The ideals of federalism explained above weigh in favor\n\nof respect for a state’s experimentation and respect for a\n\nstate’s sovereignty.      The precedents that govern our examination\n\nand that of the District Court of a facial challenge to state\n\nlegislation are consistent with these ideals of federalism, and\n\nindeed   are   consistent    with    the   delicate   balance   of   power\n\nexplained by Madison in his early writings.\n\n           The District Court’s preliminary injunction must be\n\nvacated.\n\n                     X.     Conclusion and Order\n\n           The decision I would make, for the reasons explained\n\nin this concurring opinion, would not bar further proceedings,\n\neither in the civil action in which the preliminary injunction\n\nwas issued or in a civil action newly filed at some future time,\n\nif at that time a showing could be made by the complaining party\n\nthat the Legislative or Executive Branch of the sovereign State\n\nof Maine, or an Administrative Agency authorized to act to serve\n\nthe declared legislative aim of the statute in issue, had taken\n\naction that is a threat to legally protected interests of a\n\nperson or entity (including any out-of-state as well as any in-\n\nstate person or entity) making the complaint.           That    person or\n\nentity might appropriately seek a form of limited injunctive\n\nrelief needed to protect identified interests without deeper\n\n\n                                    -73-\n\fintrusions on the State of Maine’s legitimate interests than\n\nwould be necessary and appropriate for that purpose.\n\n         For the reasons stated in this opinion, the District\n\nCourt’s preliminary injunction should be vacated, and I concur\n\nin the judgment of the Court of Appeals, delivered by Judge\n\nBownes, so ordering.\n\n\n\n\n                             -74-\n\f",

We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 2000, the Governor of Maine signed into law an Act to Establish Fairer Pricing for Prescription Drugs, 2000 Me. Legis. Ch. 786 (S.P. 1026) (L.D. 2599) (the \"Act\"), which establishes the \"Maine Rx Program\" (the \"Program\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute was enacted because of the Maine Legislature's concern that many Maine citizens who were not Medicaid recipients could not afford necessary prescription drugs. It is predicated on the economic reality that volume buying of prescription drugs by Medicaid administrators, insurance companies and health maintenance organizations (\"HMOs\") resulted in substantially lower prices for these entities than for individual purchasers. A minority staff report for the United States House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight found that the average retail price for individual elderly purchasers was 86 percent higher than the price charged to the federal government and other favored customers, such as HMOs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Program is open to all State residents, and allows enrollees to purchase prescription drugs from participating Maine pharmacies at a discounted price. The discount offered by the pharmacies is reimbursed by the State out of a dedicated fund created with the money raised from \"rebate payments\" collected from participating drug manufacturers. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681. The obligation to pay the \"rebate\" is triggered by the retail sale of the manufacturer's drugs to a Program enrollee through a participating pharmacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act directs the Commissioner of Maine's Department of Health Services to negotiate rebate agreements with manufacturers. Id. &#167; 2681(3). These rebate agreements are similar in form to the rebate agreements required of manufacturers participating in the Maine Medicaid outpatient drug program. Id. &#167; 2681(4). In negotiating the rebate, the Commissioner is directed to \"consider\" the rebate amount calculated under the Federal Medicaid Rebate Program, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8, and to use his or her \"best efforts\" to obtain an initial rebate in the same amount. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(4)(A)-(C). Rebate payments are made quarterly on the basis of retail sales records for that quarter. Id. &#167; 2681(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to create an incentive for manufacturers to enter rebate agreements with the Commissioner, the Act provides that names of manufacturers who do not enter into agreements be released to health care providers and the public. Id. &#167; 2681(7). More importantly, the drugs of all noncompliant manufacturers are required to be subject, \"as permitted by law,\" to the \"prior authorization requirements\" in the State Medicaid program. Id. &#167; 2681(7). When subjected to prior authorization, a drug may not be dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary without the approval of the State Medicaid administrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff-appellee, Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Manufacturers of America (\"PhRMA\"), brought an action in the United States District Court in the District of Maine against defendant-appellants Commissioner of the Maine Department of Human Services and the Maine Attorney General, challenging the constitutionality of the Act. PhRMA claimed that the Act violated the dormant Commerce Clause and was preempted by the federal Medicaid statute under the Supremacy Clause, and moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued the preliminary injunction and found the Act unconstitutional on the two asserted grounds. First, the district court held that the Act had an impermissible extraterritorial reach by regulating the revenues out-of-state pharmaceutical manufacturers receive when selling to out-of-state pharmaceutical distributors, thereby violating the dormant Commerce Clause. As to those distributors located in the State of Maine, the district court held that the Act was preempted under the Supremacy Clause because it conflicted with the federal Medicaid program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The criteria for the grant of a preliminary injunction are the familiar four: likelihood of success, risk of irreparable harm, the balance of equities and the public interest.\" Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996)). When a district court's grant of a preliminary injunction is appealed, our standard of review depends on the issue under consideration: we review pure issues of law de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and \"judgment calls\" with considerable deference. Id. (noting that our standard of review is sometimes summarized as being for \"abuse of discretion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that PhRMA's likelihood of success on the merits of most of its constitutional challenges was \"overwhelming.\" Accordingly, it dealt only cursorily with the remaining preliminary injunction factors. Our review also focuses on PhRMA's likelihood of success on the merits of its challenges under the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause. See Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1993) (stating that the \"sine qua non\" of preliminary injunction analysis is whether plaintiff is likely to succeed on merits of claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial question we face is whether PhRMA has prudential standing to challenge the prior authorization provision of the Act. PhRMA contends that Maine's standing argument was not briefed to the district court, and therefore was waived. We assume, without deciding, that Maine may assert this standing challenge on appeal, and hold that PhRMA falls within the relevant \"zone of interest.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court recently reiterated the standard for determining prudential standing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n applying the \"zone of interests\" test, we do not ask whether, in enacting the statutory provision at issue, Congress specifically intended to benefit the plaintiff. Instead, we first discern the interests \"arguably . . . to be protected\" by the statutory provision at issue; we then inquire whether the plaintiff's interests affected by the agency action in question are among them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nat'l Credit Union Admin. v.

Nothing in the Medicaid statute, Maine argues, suggests that Congress intended to protect sales of any particular drugs. See Tap Pharms. v. U.S. Dep't of HHS, 163 F.3d 199, 208 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding that pharmaceutical manufacturer lacked standing to challenge Medicare rules reducing reimbursement amounts paid for their products because manufacturer's financial interests were not within zone of interests protected by Medicare).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA has not asserted an action to enforce rights under the Medicaid statute, however, but rather a preemption-based challenge under the Supremacy Clause. In this type of action, it is the interests protected by the Supremacy Clause, not by the preempting statute, that are at issue. St. Thomas-St. John Hotel &amp; Tourism Ass'n v. Virgin Islands, 218 F.3d 232, 241 (3d Cir. 2000). As the Third Circuit recently pointed out, an entity does not need prudential standing to invoke the protection of the Supremacy Clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We know of no governing authority to the effect that the federal statutory provision which allegedly preempts enforcement of local legislation by conflict must confer a right on the party that argues in favor of preemption. On the contrary, a state or territorial law can be unenforceable as preempted by federal law even when the federal law secures no individual substantive rights for the party arguing preemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. Thus, regardless of whether the Medicaid statute's relevant provisions were designed to benefit PhRMA, PhRMA can invoke the statute's preemptive force. Cf. Burgio &amp; Campofelice, Inc. v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 107 F.3d 1000, 1006 (2d Cir. 1997) (concluding that the Supremacy Clause creates an implied right of action for injunctive relief against state officers who are threatening to violate federal law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that PhRMA has prudential standing grounded in the Supremacy Clause, we think it may fairly assert the rights of Medicaid recipients for purposes of this action. Where a party has established a concrete injury in fact, and otherwise has standing to challenge the lawfulness of the statute, it is \"entitled to assert those concomitant rights of third parties that would be 'diluted or adversely affected' should [its] constitutional challenge fail and the statute[] remain in force.\" Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 195 (1976) (quoting Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 481 (1965)). Accordingly, \"vendors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function.\" Id.; see also 1 L.

Preemption</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having decided that PhRMA has standing to challenge the Maine Act on preemption grounds, we now turn to the merits of that argument. The district court addressed preemption only with regard to the Act's regulation of sales to in-state distributors, after concluding that such regulation would not be barred by the Commerce Clause. It held that the prior authorization review requirement of the Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(7), conflicted with the purposes of the Medicaid program such that the requirement was invalid under the Supremacy Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> If we affirm the district court's preemption holding, it would invalidate the Act as to all distributors, not just those who operate in Maine, and would obviate the need to address the Commerce Clause.

As the parties agree, only \"implied conflict preemption\" is at issue here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Our task, therefore, is to consider if \"compliance with both state and federal regulations is impossible\" or if \"state law interposes an obstacle to the achievement of Congress's discernable objectives.\" Grant's Dairy-Me., LLC v.

We also recognize that federal preemption of a state law is \"strong medicine,\" and is \"not casually to be dispensed.\" Id. at 18. This is especially true when the federal statute creates a program, such as Medicaid, that utilizes \"cooperative federalism\": \"Where coordinated state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for federal preemption becomes a less persuasive one.\" Wash., Dep't of Soc. &amp; Health Servs. v.

The primary purpose of Medicaid is to enable states to provide medical services to those whose \"income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396 (2000). Congress expressly intended that the provision of medical services be administered by the state \"in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of the recipients.\" Id. &#167; 1396a(a)(19).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We perceive no conflict between the Maine Act and Medicaid's structure and purpose. Neither the letter nor the intent of the Medicaid statute prevents states from imposing prior authorization requirements; indeed, they are explicitly permitted. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8(d)(1)(A) (states may \"subject to prior authorization any covered outpatient drug\"). The statute sets forth only two limitations on a state's use of prior authorization: the state must provide \"response by telephone or other telecommunication device within 24 hours of a request for prior authorization;\" and, with respect to most drugs, provide for \"the dispensing of at least 72-hour [sic] supply of a covered outpatient prescription drug in an emergency situation (as defined by the Secretary).\" Id. &#167; 1396r-8(d)(5)(A) and (B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain text of the Maine Act appears to incorporate these Medicaid requirements. It provides: \"The department shall impose prior authorization requirements in the Medicaid program under this Title, as permitted by law, for the dispensing of prescription drugs . . . .\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(7) (emphasis added). We read the language \"as permitted by law\" to limit the Act's application to only those situations in which prior authorization is permitted by Medicaid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As the Department is charged with administering the Maine Rx Program, we owe deference to its interpretation of the Act. Fireside Nissan, Inc. v. Fanning, 30 F.3d 206, 212 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as set forth in the affidavit of Kevin Concannon, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Human Services, Maine has proposed administrative rules governing prior authorization aimed at ensuring that Medicaid recipients will have access to needed medications. Specifically, the decision to place a drug on the prior authorization list may be made only by the State's Medicaid Drug Utilization Review [DUR] Committee, which exclusively comprises physicians and pharmacists licensed to prescribe or dispense medications in Maine. Concannon states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making its determination of whether or not a prior authorization requirement is clinically appropriate, the DUR Committee shall be guided by the law of Medicaid, and particularly the principle that Medicaid recipients shall be assured access to all medically necessary prescription drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA contends that prior authorization, however implemented, necessarily interferes with the delivery of Medicaid services by placing an administrative burden on physicians and patients. This interference is acceptable, it says, when performed in the usual course of the Medicaid regulations concerning prior authorization, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8(d)(5), because there is a countervailing \"legitimate\" purpose of preventing abuse or over prescription of certain expensive medications. In the case of a prior authorization under the Maine Rx Program, however, PhRMA argues (and the district court agreed) that there is no \"Medicaid purpose\" or \"benefit\" to Medicaid that offsets the interference. Hence, it contends, only when a prior authorization is motivated by the refusal to enter into a Maine Rx Program rebate agreement is it preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unpersuasive. First, we are not convinced that the Medicaid statute is concerned with the motivation behind imposing prior authorization, as long as the 24-hour response and the 72-hour drug-supply requirements, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8(d)(5), are satisfied. Thus, even if the district court's conclusion that \"Maine can point to no Medicaid purpose in this new prior authorization requirement\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that the prior authorization scheme conflicts with the objectives of the Medicaid program. We see no basis for inflicting the \"strong medicine\" of preemption on a state statute that, in the absence of an actual conflict, merely fails to directly advance the purpose of the federal program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming that this inquiry into the underlying objectives of the Act is appropriate, we disagree that the Act serves no purpose related to Medicaid. The purposes of the Medicaid statute, read broadly, are consonant with the purposes of the Maine Rx Program. First, the Maine Rx Program furthers Medicaid's aim of providing medical services to those whose \"income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396, even if the individuals covered by the Maine Rx Program are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. Second, there is some evidence in the record that by making prescription drugs more accessible to the uninsured, Maine may reduce Medicaid expenditures. When people whose incomes fall outside Medicaid eligibility are unable to purchase necessary medication, their conditions may worsen, driving them further into poverty and into the Medicaid program, requiring more expensive treatment that could have been avoided had earlier intervention been possible. See Stephen B. Soumerai, Sc.D., Dennis Ross-Degnan, Sc.D., Inadequate Prescription-Drug Coverage for Medicare Enrollees - A Call to Action, New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 9, March 4, 1999 (contained in district court record); Minority Staff Report, Prescription Drug Pricing in the 1st Congressional District of Maine: Drug Companies Profit at the Expense of Older Americans, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, U.S. House of Representatives, prepared for Rep.

Allen, October 9, 1998 (same).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we disagree with the district court's statement that \"If Maine can use its authority over Medicaid authorization to leverage drug manufacturer rebates for the benefit of uninsured citizens, then it can just as easily put the rebates into a state program for highway and bridge construction or school funding.\" Neither highway construction nor school funding relate in any way to the purposes of providing medical services to the needy, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396, or of cost-effective administration of the Medicaid program, see id. &#167; 1396a(a)30(A) (state plans must assure that payments are consistent with, inter alia, efficiency and economy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA further contends that the Maine Rx Program will necessarily harm Medicaid recipients by impeding access to their doctors' first-choice medications. The district court agreed with this argument, concluding that the Maine Act conflicted with the Medicaid provision setting forth a general requirement that a state Medicaid plan contain safeguards to assure that care and services will be provided \"in a manner consistent with . . . the best interests of the recipients.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(19). PhRMA vigorously presses the argument that the prior authorization provision is more than a de minimus obstacle to achieving these best interests of the Medicaid recipient because it will effectively require a doctor to shift to her second choice drug where the first choice drug is manufactured by a company that does not participate in the rebate program. The state concedes that it will not authorize payment for the first-choice drug manufactured by a non-participant where there is another drug for the ailment manufactured by a participant, but insists that the Medicaid recipient will always receive medically necessary drugs. At this point in the proceedings, we find insufficient basis for concluding that the Maine Act, on its face, controverts the Medicaid goal of \"best interests.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is a facial challenge to a statute, PhRMA has a difficult burden of showing that Medicaid recipients will be harmed by the Maine Rx Program. \"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \"The existence of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to warrant the preemption of the state statute.\" Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 659 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the parties submitted competing affidavits discussing whether the Maine Rx Program will necessarily inflict harm on Medicaid patients. Dr. Scott Howell, Vice President of National Accounts, Managed Care, SmithKline Beecham Corporation, states that \"when used wrongly,\" prior authorizations hurt medical professionals and patients by adding administrative burdens, delays, anxiety and confusion. He opines that the Maine Rx Program \"will create a high likelihood\" of harm by leading to inappropriate prescribing of medications, needlessly burdening doctors, and causing unnecessary inconvenience for Medicaid recipients. \"[P]rior authorization of drugs, without regard to safety or efficacy, will lead to drugs being prescribed that are less safe and efficacious.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Timothy S. Clifford, the Medical Director for the Maine Bureau of Medical Services, which administers the Medicaid program, disagrees with Dr. Howell's affidavit on several points. He contends that the Department will address safety and efficacy concerns in administering the Maine Rx Program's prior authorization requirement; that it will consider the availability of alternative drugs in deciding whether to subject a particular drug to the requirement; and that Medicaid recipients will continue to have access to medically necessary drugs. Dr. Clifford states: \"The Department certainly will not subject any single-source drug that fulfills a unique therapeutic function to the prior authorization process, regardless of whether the manufacturer participates in the Maine Rx Program . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. H. Burtt Richardson, Jr., a Maine pediatrician and Maine Medicaid provider, states that he supports the Maine Rx Program \"so long as the decision to put a prior authorization on particular drugs is clinically appropriate, feasible for a medical office, and accompanied by the assurance that all Maine Medicaid recipients have access to medically necessary drugs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These affidavits, along with other materials in the record, fall short of establishing that the Act will inflict inevitable or even probable harm on Medicaid patients or their providers. In reviewing a preemption-based facial challenge, \"we do not rest our decision on consequences that, while possible, are by no means predictable.\" Dep't of Taxation and Fin. of N.Y. v. Milhelm Attea &amp; Bros., Inc., 512 U.S. 61, 69 (1994). There is no evidence that the prior authorization procedure is likely to foreclose a patient from receiving a necessary drug. Although prior authorization review is triggered by a manufacturer's refusal to participate in the Maine Rx Program, the record indicates that the final decision to require prior authorization for a particular drug is based primarily on clinical criteria applied by health care professionals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since both sides agree that the prior authorization requirement is the \"hammer\" or \"force\" that coerces manufacturers to enter into the Program, the possibility that first-choice drugs will not be readily approved where second-choice inferior alternatives exist concerns us. The possibility that the administrative implications of the prior authorization requirement will affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid recipients in more subtle ways, i.e. through inconveniencing prescribing physicians, also concerns us. Dr. Howell's affidavit, however, is controverted by the affidavits of other qualified individuals. We simply cannot say on this record that the Act conflicts with Medicaid's requirement that state Medicaid plans assure that care will be provided in a manner consistent with the recipients' best interests. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(19).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This decision is without prejudice to PhRMA's right to renew its preemption challenge after implementation of the Act, should there be evidence that Medicaid recipients are harmed by the prior authorization requirement \"as applied.\" See United States v.

The Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes[.]\" U.S. Const. art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 3. The constitutional provision affirmatively granting Congress the authority to legislate in the area of interstate commerce \"has long been understood, as well, to provide 'protection from state legislation inimical to the national commerce [even] where Congress has not acted. . . .'\" Nat'l Foreign Trade Council v.

Nat'l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363 (2000). This negative command, known as the dormant Commerce Clause, prohibits states from acting in a manner that burdens the flow of interstate commerce. Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 179-80 (1995); Healy v.

Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 138 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). The prohibitions imposed upon state regulation by the dormant Commerce Clause have fallen into several identifiable categories. To determine whether a statute violates the dormant Commerce Clause, we apply one of several levels of analysis, depending on the effect and reach of the legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, a state statute is a per se violation of the Commerce Clause when it has an \"extraterritorial reach.\" Healy, 491 U.S. at 336. \"[A] statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting State's authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute's extraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature.\" Id. When a state statute regulates commerce wholly outside the state's borders or when the statute has a practical effect of controlling conduct outside of the state, the statute will be invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause. Cotto Waxo Co. v. Williams, 46 F.3d 790, 793 (8th Cir. 1995) (citing Healy). A statute will have an extraterritorial reach if it \"necessarily requires out-of-state commerce to be conducted according to in-state terms.\" Id. at 794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if a state statute discriminates against interstate commerce, we apply strict scrutiny. It will be scrutinized under a \"virtually per se invalid rule,\" which means that the statute will be invalid unless the state can \"show that it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.\" Or. Waste Sys., Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality of Or., 511 U.S. 93, 100-01 (1994) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). This level of scrutiny will be applied if the state statute discriminates against interstate commerce on its face or in practical effect. Taylor, 477 U.S. at 138; see also Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 270 (1984) (indicating that a finding of discriminatory purpose or discriminatory effect can constitute economic protectionism subjecting the state statute to a \"stricter level of invalidity\"). When a state statute \"discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.\" Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v.

In this situation, a balancing test is applied. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). \"Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA contends that the Maine Act is an impermissible exercise in extraterritorial regulation and, therefore, is per se violative of the dormant Commerce Clause.

Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82, 93 (1984) (\"if a State is acting as a market participant, rather than as a market regulator, the dormant Commerce Clause places no limitation on its activities\"). We hold that Maine does not fall under the market participant exception to the dormant Commerce Clause. Maine is not a market buyer of prescription drugs, except as required by the Medicaid statute. Its citizens will continue to directly purchase prescription drugs as needed.

PhRMA construes these cases as standing for the proposition that, \"a state may not dictate the terms on which buyers and sellers do business outside of the state.\" See, e.g., Healy, 491 U.S. at 338; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 583-84. This is partially correct but does not reflect the entire picture. The cases on which PhRMA relies, however, involve price control, price affirmation or price tying schemes. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 575-76; Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, 294 U.S. 511, 519 (1935) (\"Seelig\"). The statutes in these cases involved regulating the prices charged in the home state and those charged in other states in order to benefit the buyers and sellers in the home state, resulting in a direct burden on the buyers and sellers in the other states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Healy, the Court struck down a Connecticut Liquor Control Act that required out-of-state shippers of beer to affirm that the prices at which the products were sold to Connecticut wholesalers were no higher than prices at which those same products were sold in bordering states. 491 U.S. at 326. The Court held the statute to be unconstitutional because it controlled prices in neighboring states and interfered with the regulatory schemes in those states. Id. at 338-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Brown-Forman, the Court struck down a provision of the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law that required liquor distillers to affirm that their prices were no higher than the lowest price at which the same product would be sold in any other state during the month. 476 U.S. at 575-76. The Court determined that this was an extraterritorial reach violative of the Constitution. It held that \"[o]nce a distiller has posted prices in New York, it is not free to change its prices elsewhere in the United States during the relevant month. Forcing a merchant to seek regulatory approval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another directly regulates interstate commerce.\" Id. at 582 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Seelig, the Court struck down the New York Milk Control Act, which set minimum prices for milk purchased from in-state and out-of-state producers and banned the resale of milk in New York when that milk had been purchased out-of-state for a lower price. 294 U.S. at 519. By requiring New York wholesalers to buy out-of-state milk at certain prices, the effect of the statute was to essentially set out-of-state milk prices. The Court recognized that the Commerce Clause does not permit a state to create a \"scale of prices for use in other states, and to bar the sale of products . . . unless the scale has been observed.\" Id. at 528.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine Act is different from these statutes. Unlike these price affirmation and price control statutes, the Maine Act does not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect. Maine does not insist that manufacturers sell their drugs to a wholesaler for a certain price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Similarly, Maine is not tying the price of its in-state products to out-of-state prices. There is nothing within the Act that requires the rebate to be a certain amount dependent on the price of prescription drugs in other states. The Act merely says that the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Human Services shall use \"best efforts to obtain an initial rebate amount equal to or greater than the rebate calculated under the Medicaid program . . . .\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(4)(B). Furthermore, unlike Brown-Forman and Seelig, the Maine Act does not impose direct controls on a transaction that occurs wholly out-of-state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA argues strenuously that the effect of the Act will be to regulate the transaction that occurs between the manufacturer and the wholesaler -- a transaction that occurs entirely out of state. It argues that as a result of the rebate provision, manufacturers will lose a portion of their profits otherwise obtained from distributors. Admittedly, it is possible that the rebate provisions of the statute may decrease the profits of manufacturers. Simply because the manufacturers' profits might be negatively affected by the Maine Act, however, does not necessarily mean that the Maine Act is regulating those profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act does not regulate the transaction between manufacturers and wholesalers. It provides for a negotiated rebate agreement between \"[a] drug manufacturer or labeler that sells prescription drugs in [Maine] through the elderly low-cost drug program . . . or any other publicly supported pharmaceutical assistance program . . . .\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(3). The rebate program is voluntary and either the manufacturer or the State may withdraw at any time with sixty days' notice. The Act directs the commissioner to \"use the commissioner's best efforts\" to negotiate the amount of the rebate required from the manufacturer. Id. &#167; 2681(4)(B). We note that the commissioner's \"best efforts\" may become coercive or otherwise inappropriate, but we cannot say so on this facial challenge. This may be an issue that needs to be revisited once the Act takes effect. On a facial challenge, however, the use of the commissioner's \"best efforts\" indicates that the Act is not \"regulating\" prices, but merely \"negotiating\" rebates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act clearly does not interfere with regulatory schemes in other states. Ultimately, the Maine Act simply regulates activity that occurs in state: (1) the purchase of the prescription drugs that triggers the rebate; (2) the negotiation of a rebate amount; and (3) the State's action subjecting a manufacturer's drug to prior authorization and releasing the manufacturer's name to health care providers and the public occurs in state. Because the regulation only applies to in-state activities, there is no extraterritorial reach and the Act is not per se invalid under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final consideration is the consequence of other states passing similar statutes. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 336 (considering \"what effect would arise if not one, but many or every, State adopted similar legislation\"). The most apparent effect of similar statutes being passed in other states would be a loss in profits for manufacturers. It does not appear, and PhRMA does not argue, that statutes similar to the Maine Act, if enacted, would result in manufacturers having inconsistent obligations to states, or in creating a \"price gridlock\" linking prices in some states to the prices in other states. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 340. Therefore, at this time, when we are dealing with a facial challenge to the Act, there is no evidence that adverse effects on interstate commerce will occur if such legislation were passed in other states. The Act is not per se violative of the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Strict Level of Scrutiny: Discriminatory Statute</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statute enacted for a discriminatory purpose is subject to strict scrutiny. See Bacchus Imports, Ltd., 468 U.S. at 270. Under this strict scrutiny analysis, a statute violates the Commerce Clause unless the state can show that the statute serves a legitimate local purpose that is unrelated to economic protectionism and that the same purpose could not be achieved by nondiscriminatory means. Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 336 (1979). PhRMA does not contend, nor did the district court find, that the Maine Act discriminates on its face or in its effects. Therefore, we need not discuss it further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Low Level of Scrutiny: Pike Balancing Test</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a state statute regulates evenhandedly and has only incidental effects on interstate commerce, that statute will be upheld unless the burden on interstate commerce is \"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\" Pike, 397 U.S. at 142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities. Occasionally the Court has candidly undertaken a balancing approach in resolving these issues, but more frequently it has spoken in terms of \"direct\" and \"indirect\" effects and burdens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (internal citations omitted). The Maine Act is neither an impermissible extraterritorial reach nor is it discriminatory; rather, it regulates evenhandedly and only has incidental effects on interstate commerce. Therefore, we apply this lower level of scrutiny, known as the Pike balancing test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the Maine Act to be per se invalid, and therefore never determined whether it survives the Pike balancing test. Though the district court did not undertake such an analysis, we may conduct the Pike balancing test for the first time on appeal. See Instructional Sys., Inc. v. Computer Curriculum Corp., 35 F.3d 813, 826 (3d Cir. 1994). In Instructional Systems, the Third Circuit considered a facial challenge to the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act after the district court had declared the statute per se invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause. Id. at 826. The court found that the statute, from a facial standpoint, survived the Pike test, and reversed the district court judgment which had declared the statute unconstitutional. Id. at 827. The Third Circuit recognized, however, that the issue of whether the statute, when applied, burdens interstate commerce could not be resolved as a matter of law. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the Pike balancing test to the Maine Act, we consider: (1) the nature of the putative local benefits advanced by the statute; (2) the burden the statute places on interstate commerce; and (3) whether the burden is \"clearly excessive\" as compared to the putative local benefits. See Pike, 397 U.S. at 142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, the only burden imposed on interstate commerce by the Maine Act is its possible effects on the profits of the individual manufacturers. As the Third Circuit stated, however, \"the fact that a law may have 'devastating economic consequences' on a particular interstate firm is not sufficient to rise to a Commerce Clause burden.\" Instructional Sys., 35 F.3d at 827 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Ins. Comm'r, 874 F.2d 926, 943 (3d Cir. 1989)); see also Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Md., 437 U.S. 117, 127-28 (1978) (stating that \"the [Commerce] Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider the local benefits of the Act, which we find to be substantial. The Maine Rx Program will potentially provide prescription drugs to Maine citizens who could not otherwise afford them. The Maine Legislature has decided that without the Maine Rx Program, needy Maine citizens will continue to be deprived of necessary medical care because of rising prescription drug costs. When measuring manufacturers' possible loss of profits against the increased access to prescription drugs for Maine citizens, the local benefits appear to outweigh the burden on interstate commerce. At the very least, the burden on interstate commerce is not \"clearly excessive\" as compared to the local benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is necessary to recognize the difficulty in foreseeing what events actually will occur from the enforcement of this Act, which admittedly makes the Pike balancing test more challenging to apply. We are forced to balance the possible effects, instead of the actual effects of the statute in action. For now, it is enough to say that the Act survives the facial challenge under the dormant Commerce Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that PhRMA is not likely to succeed on the merits of its constitutional challenges, we need not delve into the three remaining preliminary injunction factors (risk of irreparable harm, the balance of equities and the public interest). This court has recognized that the \"sine qua non\" of the preliminary injunction analysis is whether the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of the claim. Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12, 14 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993) (concluding that, after determining that there was no likelihood of success on the merits, it was not necessary to examine the other factors). We must conclude that PhRMA has not satisfied its burden to obtain a preliminary injunction preventing the implementation of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this facial challenge, we perceive no conflict between the Maine Act and the Medicaid statute that would result in federal preemption. The Act sets forth prior authorization procedures that are consistent with those explicitly permitted by Medicaid. PhRMA has not established at this point that the administrative burden imposed by prior authorization will likely harm Medicaid recipients. In the absence of such evidence, we cannot conclude that the Act violates the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Act offend the dormant Commerce Clause. It is not an extraterritorial regulation on interstate commerce because it does not regulate conduct occurring outside the state, but only regulates in-state activities. Moreover, from a facial standpoint, the local benefits of the Act appear to outweigh any incidental burden on interstate commerce. For the reasons stated, the Maine Act survives the facial dormant Commerce Clause challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a close case but we do not think that, under the applicable law, the State of Maine should be prohibited from putting the Act into play. We heed the dissent of Justice Louis Brandeis in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 310 (1932):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the nation. It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. This Court has the power to prevent an experiment. We may strike down the statute which embodies it on the ground that, in our opinion, the measure is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. We have power to do this, because the due process clause has been held by the Court applicable to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. But, in the exercise of this high power, we must be ever on our guard, lest we erect our prejudices into legal principles. If we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is REVERSED and the temporary injunction is VACATED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine Rx Program, referred to in this subchapter as the \"program,\" is established to reduce prescription drug prices for residents of the State.

This subchapter is enacted by the Legislature to enable the State to act as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified Maine residents, thereby increasing the overall health of Maine residents, promoting healthy communities and protecting the public health and welfare. It is not the intention of the State to discourage employers from offering or paying for prescription drug benefits for their employees or to replace employer-sponsored prescription drug benefit plans that provide benefits comparable to those made available to qualified Maine residents under this subchapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Treating the issue as one of first impression, I would recognize both standing and jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the District of Maine, and on appeal. In the world outside the court system, as a pragmatic matter no other person or entity is as active and effective in protecting benefits and beneficiaries of availability of pharmacy products at reasonable cost as PBMs. It is entirely appropriate in these circumstances that the standing of PBMs be recognized in United States district courts and on appeal from adjudications interpreting and applying state legislation affecting the benefits and interests of beneficiaries of marketing of pharmacy products. As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has previously stated, \"Article III standing is largely . . . albeit not entirely . . . a practical jurisprudence.\" New Hampshire Hemp Council v.

Kaminski, Ph.D., Director, and Richard Leffler, Ph.D., Co-Director, The Center for Study of the American Constitution, The University of Wisconsin-Madison (Wisconsin Study), The Origins of the Three Branches of Government, Federal Judicial Center Traveling Seminar 3-9 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Madison, a Virginian, writing to Edmund Randolph of New York on 8 April 1787, mused:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I hold it for a fundamental point that an individual independence of the States, is utterly irreconcilable with the idea of an aggregate sovereignty. I think at the same time that a consolidation of the States into one simple republic is not less unattainable than it would be inexpedient. Let it be tried then whether any middle ground can be taken which will at once support a due supremacy of the national authority, and leave in force the local authorities so far as they can be subordinately useful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let the national Government be armed with a positive &amp; complete authority in all cases where uniform measures are necessary. As in trade &amp;c. &amp;c. Let it also retain the powers which it now possesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let it have a negative in all cases whatsoever on the Legislative Acts of the States as the K. of G.B. heretofore had. This I conceive to be essential and the least possible abridgement of the State Sovereignties. Without such a defensive power, every positive power that can be given on paper will be unavailing. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let this national supremacy be extended also to the Judiciary department. If the judges in the last resort depend on the States &amp; are bound by their oaths to them and not to the Union, the intention of the law and the interests of the nation may be defeated by the obsequiousness of the Tribunals to the policy or prejudices of the States. It seems at least essential that an appeal should lie to some national tribunals on all cases which concern foreigners, or inhabitants of other States. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supremacy of the whole in the Executive department seems liable to some difficulty.

The genius of the Constitution of the United States of America is that it establishes a unique form of federalism, unlike any ever fashioned before, that harmonizes and accommodates in new and distinctive ways national and state centers of governmental power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second. The authority for this new form of federalism is declared by \"the people, and not merely by the Legislatures.\" See id. at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The eighteenth-century debates in which Madison and Randolph were among the key participants occurred more than two centuries ago. Twenty-first century readers are even more removed than the lapse of time suggests from being in tune with the spirit and culture surrounding the debates over what became the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights embodied in the Amendments adopted forthwith. Those debates were strikingly lively and thorough examinations of the history of peoples' ideas and efforts to form governments powerful enough to preserve the order essential to protection of individual liberty and at the same time subject to inherent controls against abuse of power likely to lead to despotism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ideas about liberty and order are no less relevant now than they were when the Founders developed the Constitution of the United States of America. \"The aim of the American legal system is liberty and justice for all. How close we come to that aim depends on good judging.\" Robert E. Keeton, Judging in the American Legal System 1 (Lexis Law Publishing 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The quality of judging in a legal system depends on commitment. It depends, first, on commitment to the aim of justice. Second, it depends on commitment to professionalism. The declared beliefs of all professionals in the system - including advocates, counselors, and academic critics as well as judges - affect the quality of judging in the system. Third, the quality of judging depends on commitment to method. Judicial choice, at its best, is reasoned choice, candidly explained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 5. Reasoned judicial choice in the matter currently pending before us requires, in my view, that we reject plaintiff's facial challenge to the constitutionality of the Maine statute, but does not require that we consider the constitutionality of every possible interpretation or application of the Maine statute. This view is reenforced by taking into account James Madison's contributions to federalist thought and actions. This historical background is especially relevant, in my view, to disputes over supremacy of national legislation and associated issues of interpretation of the Maine statute that was before the district court and is before us in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. In the American Legal System, a State is a Sovereign</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under fundamental premises of the American legal system, the State of Maine, like all other States of the United States of America, is a sovereign. Each State has authority to govern persons and institutions and their transactions within its territorial boundaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not understand that any of the briefs before us challenges the sovereignty of states within the Union, and I do not understand the opinion of the Court of Appeals as challenging this proposition. Thus, I say no more here on the existence of sovereignty of states within the Union. Some important implications of this sovereignty, however, are noted in other sections of this opinion, infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. A State May Act in Multiple Roles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A sovereign State of the United States, in addition to governing, may be an active participant in a market for any kind of goods or services that it seeks to buy for its own use, including a purchase for (1) a use such as obtaining furniture for a State office and (2) a use such as obtaining pharmacy products for State-sponsored programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the State of Maine may act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) as a sovereign,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) as a market participant itself because it buys pharmacy products for Medicaid patients, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) in \"the role of each State as a guardian and trustee for its people\" who need pharmacy products at affordable prices. White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, 460 U.S. 204, 207 n.3 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third of these roles has special relevance to issues in this case because Maine has undertaken to represent \"its people\" who need pharmacy products at affordable prices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be a curious irony indeed if dozens of privately organized groups of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) could participate freely in the market for purchasing products from pharmacy product manufacturers but States as guardians and trustees for their people could not because the States are also sovereign. In my view, we should make the commonsense ruling that the State of Maine as well as PBMs may participate in the market for purchasing pharmacy products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any conflict of interest problems that might theoretically be raised are answered in the distinctive circumstances of this case by the fact that the State of Maine faces no conflicting interests because it believes that in all its roles it is trying to serve the best interests of its people and each of the groups of its people who have an interest in and need for pharmacy products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI.

Statutory Interpretation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should be guided primarily by the plain language of all the provisions of the statute that are relevant to the issues before us, and the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in all the relevant provisions. The relevant provisions include the definitions in the statute, the declaration of program goals, and the operational directives to Defendant/Appellant Kevin Concannon, Commissioner, Maine Department of Human Services. With these guideposts in mind, I conclude that a reasonable interpretation of the Maine statute includes the following elements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">+ The Maine statute authorizes \"best efforts\" of Maine administrators rather than requiring prohibitive administrative decisions and actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">+ The courts should respect the legislative drafters' thoughtful use of the idea of \"best efforts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">+ It would be a mistake to accept the suggestions of challenges to the Maine statute that propose to interpret it in a way that, in effect, reads \"best efforts\" out of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision that opponents describe as requiring authorization for participating pharmacies to offer discounted prices to some defined group of Maine residents and obtain rebates from a state fund, created by an assessment against manufacturers, is not a statutory mandate. Instead, the statute requires only \"best efforts\" of Administrators to achieve the legislative aim of protecting interests of the people of Maine by ongoing creative mediation and negotiation that appeals to the executives of pharmacy products manufacturers to cooperate with Maine's administration of legislatively authorized programs. The statutory provisions providing for \"best efforts\" and for \"negotiation\" make clear that the drafters intended the rebate process to entail negotiation and compromise between the state and the manufacturers to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. Although conceivably these \"best efforts\" could fail, and manufacturers could be subject to the prior authorization provisions of the statute, this outcome is not mandated by the language of the statute, and it is not necessary, in a facial challenge to the statute, to reach questions that may be presented in the future if \"best efforts\" fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, it is obvious that many, probably most, citizens of Maine who have a need for pharmacy products but have less than the economic resources of, say, the top ten percent of citizens of the state, do not have adequate resources and practical means to get the pharmacy products they need unless</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) by travel to Canada, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) by mail, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) in some other way that involves aid or assistance comparable to that PBMs provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If these citizens have a need for prescription medication, and choose to forgo that medication rather than resort to these resources, it may well be in the interests of PhRMA members to negotiate with the State of Maine. In light of allegations made in their submissions, I infer that PhRMA members believe that a rebate in the amount of the Medicaid rebate would not be in their best interest, but the plain language of the statute allows for negotiation in a way that will serve the best interests of both PhRMA members and previously unrepresented citizens of the State of Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VII. The Timing of Adjudications on Constitutionality</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine statute, interpreted in the way explained in Part VI, is consistent with all State and Federal constitutional doctrines and is permissible legislation. The district court's ruling to the contrary must be vacated. No federal law (constitutional, statutory, or decisional) preempts and thus forbids reasonable implementation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Properly interpreted, that law is compatible with rather than conflicting with federal Medicaid legislation and administrative supervision of Medicaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is error to say -- as is said in Defendants/Appellants' Brief at page 18 -- that the extent to which the Act advances the purposes of Medicaid is irrelevant Also, it is error to say that the \"proper question\" in this appeal \"is whether the Act conflicts with the purposes of Medicaid,\" as Defendants/Appellants' Brief asserts at page 18. The core question is multifarious, not singular. An evaluative legal test applies, not a bright-line elements legal test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff/Appellee proposes in its waiver and preclusion arguments that we should hold that the fact that Defendants/Appellants make these fallacious arguments bars relief to Defendants/Appellants in this appeal. I would reject this argument. It does not state a valid reason for depriving the citizens of Maine of a fair adjudication of their interests at stake in this appeal, based on a proper interpretation of the Maine statute. Our federal system permits a State's advocacy in court in support of its interests and those of its people. Penalizing a state and its people whenever the state makes an argument rejected by the court is not appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other arguments presented by Defendants/Appellants both here and in the district court are consistent with the interpretation of the Maine statute explained in Part VI of this opinion and support reversal of the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An unstated but implicit premise of Plaintiff/Appellee's position in this case is that all Plaintiff/Appellee need do to succeed in a facial challenge to the Maine Act is to show that the administration of the Act is putting pressure on Plaintiff/ Appellee, thus making its choice about how it responds to the circumstances developing under ongoing administration of the Act not entirely voluntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fallacy of that position stems from the fact that few choices of individuals and entities in a geographical territory that has a government are entirely voluntary. True, some transactions are beyond governmental authority to intrude. They are \"transactions beyond law\" in the sense that individuals and private (non-governmental) entities they create and maintain have a large range of freedom under law to do as they please without governmental intrusion on that freedom. But a demand by any individual or entity for entire freedom is fundamentally in conflict with having a government that maintains the order essential to protection of individual freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible, as explained in Part VIII, infra, to fashion remedies for any threats that may arise from overstepping the bounds of statutorily authorized \"best efforts\" of Maine's Commissioner of Human Services during the ongoing administration of the Maine Rx Program. It is appropriate to wait and see what happens, and fashion appropriate remedies for any overstepping, rather than declaring Maine's Act unconstitutional because of an outside chance that something beyond constitutional bounds will be attempted unless an advance declaration of facial invalidity of the statute by the district court is allowed to stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VIII.

An as-applied challenge to state legislation is a more flexible instrument of adjudication, more capable of reaching an outcome tailored to the circumstances and needs of a case at hand than the all-or-nothing nature of a facial challenge to validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal district or appellate court's acting in advance of overstepping, because of the possibility overstepping might occur in the future, is fundamentally inconsistent with the body of precedents establishing the elements of a successful facial challenge in a federal court to the consistency of a state statute with potentially preemptive federal law. See, e.g., California Coastal Comm'n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S. 572, 579-80 (1987) (holding that state permit requirements were not preempted by federal law, and stating that the party arguing in favor of preemption would have to demonstrate \"that there is no possible set of conditions that the [state] could place on its permit that would not conflict with federal law - that any state permit requirement is per se preempted\") (underscoring added). These precedents would require PhRMA to demonstrate \"that there is no possible\" application of the statute that would not conflict with the structure and purpose of Medicaid. PhRMA cannot meet this burden. It could not do so even if we softened the legal standard a bit by substituting \"reasonably likely\" for \"possible.\" PhRMA's facial challenge must be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal court's acting in advance of overstepping by state officials, and responding to a facial challenge, is also inconsistent with relevant precedents for a facial challenge on constitutional grounds. In United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), the Supreme Court stated that \"a facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" Id. at 745.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Salerno decision has been criticized in later opinions of some Justices of the Supreme Court. See, e.g., Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 740 (1997) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgments) (declaring that the Court has never in fact applied \"such a strict standard.\"); Janklow v. Planned Parenthood, 517 U.S. 1174, 1175-76 (1996) (Stevens, J., respecting the denial of the petition for certiorari) (calling the Salerno decision \"draconian\" and declaring that it \"does not accurately characterize the standard for deciding facial challenges.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salerno, nevertheless, continues to be cited by both the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals. See, e.g., Anderson v. Edwards, 514 U.S. 143, 155 n.6 (1995); Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301 (1993); Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 183 (1991). We need not reach the issue of the applicability of the Salerno test, however, because the statute in this case, as explained in Part VI of this opinion, is capable of an interpretation and an application that is respectful of limits imposed by the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application of facial-challenge jurisprudence in the circumstance of this case before the District Court and in this appeal is, in practical effect, a considerable stretch beyond any thus-far-successful facial challenge. If such an extension of the jurisprudence of facial challenges expressed in decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States is to occur, it is more appropriate that it occur in an opinion of that Court than in an opinion of a Court of Appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My own reading of the array of Supreme Court opinions on this subject, even in light of the ongoing differences both within the Court and among scholars on the applicability of the Salerno test, is that precedent points away from rather than toward softening in any way the rigorous requirements for presenting a successful facial challenge to validity of a state statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is supported not only by the opinions explicitly reasoned as part of the facial-challenge jurisprudence but also by other ongoing developments of federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One ongoing development supportive of the conclusion I propose is the resurgence in recent years of emphasis on the respect that inferior federal courts are directed to show for the freedom of the people of a locality and local governmental institutions to make their own decisions. For illustrative citations, see Part IX of this opinion, infra. See also the Madisonian principles identified in Part III, supra. This emphasis is in part a feature of the distinctive version of federalism underlying what is commonly called the American legal system. It is associated with the Supreme Court's invoking the Commerce Clause not for the ordinary purpose of sustaining federal legislation but to strike down state legislation. This emphasis on federalism weighs in favor of sustaining rather than striking down the Maine Rx Program, as explained in Part IX, infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IX.

Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437 (1992). Unlike the case before us, this was a direct clash between two States of the Union. Wyoming, a major coal-producing State, though not a seller of coal, imposed a severance tax on those who extracted coal. The direct impact of that severance tax on the price of Wyoming coal purchased by four Oklahoma electric utilities was obvious. The Oklahoma legislature passed an act requiring coal-fired electric utilities in Oklahoma to burn a mixture containing at least 10% Oklahoma-mined coal. The utilities reduced their purchases of Wyoming coal. Wyoming's severance tax revenues declined. Wyoming sought relief under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court accepted Wyoming's complaint and held the Oklahoma act invalid under the \"negative\" aspect of the Commerce Clause on the reasoning that it \"prohibits economic protectionism - that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\" Id. at 454. Even so, the Court added that a clearly discriminatory statute will be struck down \"unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism,\" citing Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I need not and do not consider whether the case before us would qualify for the exception. Instead, I conclude that the case before us is not one subject to the \"negative\" rule itself, quite apart from the exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyoming v. Oklahoma and other opinions of the Supreme Court that have gone farthest in the direction of a \"negative\" application of the Commerce Clause do not support the proposition that a federal court acts properly when it disregards all the indicia of the State's purpose in establishing the Maine Rx Program to regulate transactions within the territorial boundaries of Maine and to protect the health of the people of Maine. In these circumstances a federal court does not act properly when it makes a judicial \"finding\" that the State's declaration of purpose is a facade and the real purpose was \"to regulate the price paid in earlier transactions in other states.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First. The legislative aim of the Act was fully stated in the Act itself, as explained in Part VI.A of this opinion, supra. This is not a case of hidden or obscure aims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second. Any suggestion to the contrary in briefs before this court is in disregard of our obligation, and that of the District Court, in reading the statute, to be guided, as stated in Part VI.B of this opinion, by the plain language of the statute, the definitions in the statute, and the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in the declaration of program goals, in the statutory definitions, and in the operational directives to Maine's Commissioner of Human Services. See Whiting v. Town of Westerly, 942 F.2d 18, 21 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"In evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third. As stated in Part VI.B, the provision of the Maine Act that opponents describe as requiring authorization for participating pharmacies to offer discounted prices to some defined group of Maine residents and obtain rebates from a state fund, created by an assessment against manufacturers, is not a statutory mandate. Instead, it is a statement of aim. The statute requires only \"best efforts\" of Administrators to achieve the legislative aim of protecting interests of the people of Maine by ongoing creative mediation and negotiation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth. As stated in Part VI.B, many and probably most citizens of Maine who have a need for pharmacy products would not have adequate resources and practical means to get the pharmacy products they need absent the Maine Rx Program. In the course of the creative mediation and negotiation required by the statute, the pharmaceutical companies themselves may find it is in their best interests to enter into agreements to allow them to reach this previously untapped market for their products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth. In view of the foregoing four points, it cannot be proper for a federal court to make judicial \"findings\" contrary to Maine's legislative declarations and on that basis declare that Maine's Act is invalid because \"it attempted to regulate transactions taking place solely outside the State\" and attempted \"to regulate the price paid in earlier transactions in other states.\" In so doing, the District Court acted beyond its authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ideals of federalism explained above weigh in favor of respect for a state's experimentation and respect for a state's sovereignty. The precedents that govern our examination and that of the District Court of a facial challenge to state legislation are consistent with these ideals of federalism, and indeed are consistent with the delicate balance of power explained by Madison in his early writings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court's preliminary injunction must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">X.

We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 2000, the Governor of Maine signed into law an Act to Establish Fairer Pricing for Prescription Drugs, 2000 Me. Legis. Ch. 786 (S.P. 1026) (L.D. 2599) (the \"Act\"), which establishes the \"Maine Rx Program\" (the \"Program\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute was enacted because of the Maine Legislature's concern that many Maine citizens who were not Medicaid recipients could not afford necessary prescription drugs. It is predicated on the economic reality that volume buying of prescription drugs by Medicaid administrators, insurance companies and health maintenance organizations (\"HMOs\") resulted in substantially lower prices for these entities than for individual purchasers. A minority staff report for the United States House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight found that the average retail price for individual elderly purchasers was 86 percent higher than the price charged to the federal government and other favored customers, such as HMOs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Program is open to all State residents, and allows enrollees to purchase prescription drugs from participating Maine pharmacies at a discounted price. The discount offered by the pharmacies is reimbursed by the State out of a dedicated fund created with the money raised from \"rebate payments\" collected from participating drug manufacturers. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681. The obligation to pay the \"rebate\" is triggered by the retail sale of the manufacturer's drugs to a Program enrollee through a participating pharmacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act directs the Commissioner of Maine's Department of Health Services to negotiate rebate agreements with manufacturers. Id. &#167; 2681(3). These rebate agreements are similar in form to the rebate agreements required of manufacturers participating in the Maine Medicaid outpatient drug program. Id. &#167; 2681(4). In negotiating the rebate, the Commissioner is directed to \"consider\" the rebate amount calculated under the Federal Medicaid Rebate Program, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8, and to use his or her \"best efforts\" to obtain an initial rebate in the same amount. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(4)(A)-(C). Rebate payments are made quarterly on the basis of retail sales records for that quarter. Id. &#167; 2681(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to create an incentive for manufacturers to enter rebate agreements with the Commissioner, the Act provides that names of manufacturers who do not enter into agreements be released to health care providers and the public. Id. &#167; 2681(7). More importantly, the drugs of all noncompliant manufacturers are required to be subject, \"as permitted by law,\" to the \"prior authorization requirements\" in the State Medicaid program. Id. &#167; 2681(7). When subjected to prior authorization, a drug may not be dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary without the approval of the State Medicaid administrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff-appellee, Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Manufacturers of America (\"PhRMA\"), brought an action in the United States District Court in the District of Maine against defendant-appellants Commissioner of the Maine Department of Human Services and the Maine Attorney General, challenging the constitutionality of the Act. PhRMA claimed that the Act violated the dormant Commerce Clause and was preempted by the federal Medicaid statute under the Supremacy Clause, and moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued the preliminary injunction and found the Act unconstitutional on the two asserted grounds. First, the district court held that the Act had an impermissible extraterritorial reach by regulating the revenues out-of-state pharmaceutical manufacturers receive when selling to out-of-state pharmaceutical distributors, thereby violating the dormant Commerce Clause. As to those distributors located in the State of Maine, the district court held that the Act was preempted under the Supremacy Clause because it conflicted with the federal Medicaid program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The criteria for the grant of a preliminary injunction are the familiar four: likelihood of success, risk of irreparable harm, the balance of equities and the public interest.\" Langlois v.

When a district court's grant of a preliminary injunction is appealed, our standard of review depends on the issue under consideration: we review pure issues of law de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and \"judgment calls\" with considerable deference. Id.

Our review also focuses on PhRMA's likelihood of success on the merits of its challenges under the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause. See Weaver v. Henderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599015\"><a href=\"/opinion/599015/ralph-s-weaver-etc-v-charles-henderson-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 1993) (stating that the \"sine qua non\" of preliminary injunction analysis is whether plaintiff is likely to succeed on merits of claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial question we face is whether PhRMA has prudential standing to challenge the prior authorization provision of the Act. PhRMA contends that Maine's standing argument was not briefed to the district court, and therefore was waived. We assume, without deciding, that Maine may assert this standing challenge on appeal, and hold that PhRMA falls within the relevant \"zone of interest.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court recently reiterated the standard for determining prudential standing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n applying the \"zone of interests\" test, we do not ask whether, in enacting the statutory provision at issue, Congress specifically intended to benefit the plaintiff. Instead, we first discern the interests \"arguably . . . to be protected\" by the statutory provision at issue; we then inquire whether the plaintiff's interests affected by the agency action in question are among them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nat'l Credit Union Admin. v.

Nothing in the Medicaid statute, Maine argues, suggests that Congress intended to protect sales of any particular drugs. See Tap Pharms. v. U.S. Dep't of HHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760127\"><a href=\"/opinion/760127/tap-pharmaceuticals-v-us-department-of-health-human-services-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 208 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding that pharmaceutical manufacturer lacked standing to challenge Medicare rules reducing reimbursement amounts paid for their products because manufacturer's financial interests were not within zone of interests protected by Medicare).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA has not asserted an action to enforce rights under the Medicaid statute, however, but rather a preemption-based challenge under the Supremacy Clause. In this type of action, it is the interests protected by the Supremacy Clause, not by the preempting statute, that are at issue. St. Thomas-St. John Hotel &amp; Tourism Ass'n v. Virgin Islands, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769382\"><a href=\"/opinion/769382/the-st-thomas-st-john-hotel-tourism-association-inc-the-st-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 241 (3d Cir. 2000). As the Third Circuit recently pointed out, an entity does not need prudential standing to invoke the protection of the Supremacy Clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We know of no governing authority to the effect that the federal statutory provision which allegedly preempts enforcement of local legislation by conflict must confer a right on the party that argues in favor of preemption. On the contrary, a state or territorial law can be unenforceable as preempted by federal law even when the federal law secures no individual substantive rights for the party arguing preemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. Thus, regardless of whether the Medicaid statute's relevant provisions were designed to benefit PhRMA, PhRMA can invoke the statute's preemptive force. Cf. Burgio &amp; Campofelice, Inc. v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736908\"><a href=\"/opinion/736908/burgio-and-campofelice-inc-v-nys-dept-of-labor-thomas-p-hartnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1006 (2d Cir. 1997) (concluding that the Supremacy Clause creates an implied right of action for injunctive relief against state officers who are threatening to violate federal law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that PhRMA has prudential standing grounded in the Supremacy Clause, we think it may fairly assert the rights of Medicaid recipients for purposes of this action. Where a party has established a concrete injury in fact, and otherwise has standing to challenge the lawfulness of the statute, it is \"entitled to assert those concomitant rights of third parties that would be 'diluted or adversely affected' should [its] constitutional challenge fail and the statute[] remain in force.\" Craig v.

Preemption</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having decided that PhRMA has standing to challenge the Maine Act on preemption grounds, we now turn to the merits of that argument. The district court addressed preemption only with regard to the Act's regulation of sales to in-state distributors, after concluding that such regulation would not be barred by the Commerce Clause. It held that the prior authorization review requirement of the Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(7), conflicted with the purposes of the Medicaid program such that the requirement was invalid under the Supremacy Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> If we affirm the district court's preemption holding, it would invalidate the Act as to all distributors, not just those who operate in Maine, and would obviate the need to address the Commerce Clause. Therefore, we analyze the issue of preemption first.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Supremacy Clause, a federal law may expressly or impliedly preempt state law.

The primary purpose of Medicaid is to enable states to provide medical services to those whose \"income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396 (2000). Congress expressly intended that the provision of medical services be administered by the state \"in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of the recipients.\" Id. &#167; 1396a(a)(19).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We perceive no conflict between the Maine Act and Medicaid's structure and purpose. Neither the letter nor the intent of the Medicaid statute prevents states from imposing prior authorization requirements; indeed, they are explicitly permitted. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8(d)(1)(A) (states may \"subject to prior authorization any covered outpatient drug\"). The statute sets forth only two limitations on a state's use of prior authorization: the state must provide \"response by telephone or other telecommunication device within 24 hours of a request for prior authorization;\" and, with respect to most drugs, provide for \"the dispensing of at least 72-hour [sic] supply of a covered outpatient prescription drug in an emergency situation (as defined by the Secretary).\" Id. &#167; 1396r-8(d)(5)(A) and (B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain text of the Maine Act appears to incorporate these Medicaid requirements.

Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(7) (emphasis added). We read the language \"as permitted by law\" to limit the Act's application to only those situations in which prior authorization is permitted by Medicaid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As the Department is charged with administering the Maine Rx Program, we owe deference to its interpretation of the Act. Fireside Nissan, Inc. v. Fanning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675088\"><a href=\"/opinion/675088/fireside-nissan-inc-v-daniel-p-fanning-director-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as set forth in the affidavit of Kevin Concannon, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Human Services, Maine has proposed administrative rules governing prior authorization aimed at ensuring that Medicaid recipients will have access to needed medications. Specifically, the decision to place a drug on the prior authorization list may be made only by the State's Medicaid Drug Utilization Review [DUR] Committee, which exclusively comprises physicians and pharmacists licensed to prescribe or dispense medications in Maine. Concannon states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making its determination of whether or not a prior authorization requirement is clinically appropriate, the DUR Committee shall be guided by the law of Medicaid, and particularly the principle that Medicaid recipients shall be assured access to all medically necessary prescription drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA contends that prior authorization, however implemented, necessarily interferes with the delivery of Medicaid services by placing an administrative burden on physicians and patients. This interference is acceptable, it says, when performed in the usual course of the Medicaid regulations concerning prior authorization, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8(d)(5), because there is a countervailing \"legitimate\" purpose of preventing abuse or over prescription of certain expensive medications. In the case of a prior authorization under the Maine Rx Program, however, PhRMA argues (and the district court agreed) that there is no \"Medicaid purpose\" or \"benefit\" to Medicaid that offsets the interference. Hence, it contends, only when a prior authorization is motivated by the refusal to enter into a Maine Rx Program rebate agreement is it preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unpersuasive. First, we are not convinced that the Medicaid statute is concerned with the motivation behind imposing prior authorization, as long as the 24-hour response and the 72-hour drug-supply requirements, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-8(d)(5), are satisfied. Thus, even if the district court's conclusion that \"Maine can point to no Medicaid purpose in this new prior authorization requirement\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that the prior authorization scheme conflicts with the objectives of the Medicaid program. We see no basis for inflicting the \"strong medicine\" of preemption on a state statute that, in the absence of an actual conflict, merely fails to directly advance the purpose of the federal program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming that this inquiry into the underlying objectives of the Act is appropriate, we disagree that the Act serves no purpose related to Medicaid. The purposes of the Medicaid statute, read broadly, are consonant with the purposes of the Maine Rx Program. First, the Maine Rx Program furthers Medicaid's aim of providing medical services to those whose \"income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396, even if the individuals covered by the Maine Rx Program are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. Second, there is some evidence in the record that by making prescription drugs more accessible to the uninsured, Maine may reduce Medicaid expenditures. When people whose incomes fall outside Medicaid eligibility are unable to purchase necessary medication, their conditions may worsen, driving them further into poverty and into the Medicaid program, requiring more expensive treatment that could have been avoided had earlier intervention been possible.

Soumerai, Sc.D., Dennis Ross-Degnan, Sc.D., Inadequate Prescription-Drug Coverage for Medicare Enrollees - A Call to Action, New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 9, March 4, 1999 (contained in district court record); Minority Staff Report, Prescription Drug Pricing in the 1st Congressional District of Maine: Drug Companies Profit at the Expense of Older Americans, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, U.S. House of Representatives, prepared for Rep.

The district court agreed with this argument, concluding that the Maine Act conflicted with the Medicaid provision setting forth a general requirement that a state Medicaid plan contain safeguards to assure that care and services will be provided \"in a manner consistent with . . . the best interests of the recipients.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(19). PhRMA vigorously presses the argument that the prior authorization provision is more than a de minimus obstacle to achieving these best interests of the Medicaid recipient because it will effectively require a doctor to shift to her second choice drug where the first choice drug is manufactured by a company that does not participate in the rebate program. The state concedes that it will not authorize payment for the first-choice drug manufactured by a non-participant where there is another drug for the ailment manufactured by a participant, but insists that the Medicaid recipient will always receive medically necessary drugs. At this point in the proceedings, we find insufficient basis for concluding that the Maine Act, on its face, controverts the Medicaid goal of \"best interests.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is a facial challenge to a statute, PhRMA has a difficult burden of showing that Medicaid recipients will be harmed by the Maine Rx Program. \"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" United States v.

Dr. Scott Howell, Vice President of National Accounts, Managed Care, SmithKline Beecham Corporation, states that \"when used wrongly,\" prior authorizations hurt medical professionals and patients by adding administrative burdens, delays, anxiety and confusion. He opines that the Maine Rx Program \"will create a high likelihood\" of harm by leading to inappropriate prescribing of medications, needlessly burdening doctors, and causing unnecessary inconvenience for Medicaid recipients. \"[P]rior authorization of drugs, without regard to safety or efficacy, will lead to drugs being prescribed that are less safe and efficacious.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Timothy S. Clifford, the Medical Director for the Maine Bureau of Medical Services, which administers the Medicaid program, disagrees with Dr. Howell's affidavit on several points. He contends that the Department will address safety and efficacy concerns in administering the Maine Rx Program's prior authorization requirement; that it will consider the availability of alternative drugs in deciding whether to subject a particular drug to the requirement; and that Medicaid recipients will continue to have access to medically necessary drugs. Dr. Clifford states: \"The Department certainly will not subject any single-source drug that fulfills a unique therapeutic function to the prior authorization process, regardless of whether the manufacturer participates in the Maine Rx Program . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. H. Burtt Richardson, Jr., a Maine pediatrician and Maine Medicaid provider, states that he supports the Maine Rx Program \"so long as the decision to put a prior authorization on particular drugs is clinically appropriate, feasible for a medical office, and accompanied by the assurance that all Maine Medicaid recipients have access to medically necessary drugs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These affidavits, along with other materials in the record, fall short of establishing that the Act will inflict inevitable or even probable harm on Medicaid patients or their providers. In reviewing a preemption-based facial challenge, \"we do not rest our decision on consequences that, while possible, are by no means predictable.\" Dep't of Taxation and Fin. of N.Y. v.

There is no evidence that the prior authorization procedure is likely to foreclose a patient from receiving a necessary drug. Although prior authorization review is triggered by a manufacturer's refusal to participate in the Maine Rx Program, the record indicates that the final decision to require prior authorization for a particular drug is based primarily on clinical criteria applied by health care professionals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since both sides agree that the prior authorization requirement is the \"hammer\" or \"force\" that coerces manufacturers to enter into the Program, the possibility that first-choice drugs will not be readily approved where second-choice inferior alternatives exist concerns us. The possibility that the administrative implications of the prior authorization requirement will affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid recipients in more subtle ways, i.e. through inconveniencing prescribing physicians, also concerns us. Dr. Howell's affidavit, however, is controverted by the affidavits of other qualified individuals. We simply cannot say on this record that the Act conflicts with Medicaid's requirement that state Medicaid plans assure that care will be provided in a manner consistent with the recipients' best interests. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(19).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This decision is without prejudice to PhRMA's right to renew its preemption challenge after implementation of the Act, should there be evidence that Medicaid recipients are harmed by the prior authorization requirement \"as applied.\" See United States v.

The prohibitions imposed upon state regulation by the dormant Commerce Clause have fallen into several identifiable categories. To determine whether a statute violates the dormant Commerce Clause, we apply one of several levels of analysis, depending on the effect and reach of the legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, a state statute is a per se violation of the Commerce Clause when it has an \"extraterritorial reach.\" Healy, 491 U.S. at 336. \"[A] statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting State's authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute's extraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature.\" Id. When a state statute regulates commerce wholly outside the state's borders or when the statute has a practical effect of controlling conduct outside of the state, the statute will be invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause.

This level of scrutiny will be applied if the state statute discriminates against interstate commerce on its face or in practical effect. Taylor, 477 U.S. at 138; see also Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v.

In this situation, a balancing test is applied. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 142 (1970). \"Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA contends that the Maine Act is an impermissible exercise in extraterritorial regulation and, therefore, is per se violative of the dormant Commerce Clause. It argues that the Act necessarily regulates the transaction that occurs between the manufacturer and the distributor outside the borders of Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine first argues that we need not reach the issue of whether the Act violates the dormant Commerce Clause because it is acting as a \"market participant\" and is therefore exempt from Commerce Clause restrictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> See South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v.

We hold that Maine does not fall under the market participant exception to the dormant Commerce Clause. Maine is not a market buyer of prescription drugs, except as required by the Medicaid statute. Its citizens will continue to directly purchase prescription drugs as needed.

When evaluating the practical effect of the statute, the court should consider the statute itself, and \"how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other States and what effect would arise if not one, but many or every, State adopted similar legislation.\" Id. at 336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA relies on three cases to support its argument that the Maine Act is per se invalid because it regulates conduct beyond the borders of Maine. The cases cited, however, are inapposite to the facial construction of the Maine Act. PhRMA construes these cases as standing for the proposition that, \"a state may not dictate the terms on which buyers and sellers do business outside of the state.\" See, e.g., Healy, 491 U.S. at 338; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 583-84. This is partially correct but does not reflect the entire picture. The cases on which PhRMA relies, however, involve price control, price affirmation or price tying schemes. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 575-76; Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102402\"><a href=\"/opinion/102402/baldwin-v-gaf-seelig-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 519 (1935) (\"Seelig\"). The statutes in these cases involved regulating the prices charged in the home state and those charged in other states in order to benefit the buyers and sellers in the home state, resulting in a direct burden on the buyers and sellers in the other states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Healy, the Court struck down a Connecticut Liquor Control Act that required out-of-state shippers of beer to affirm that the prices at which the products were sold to Connecticut wholesalers were no higher than prices at which those same products were sold in bordering states. 491 U.S. at 326. The Court held the statute to be unconstitutional because it controlled prices in neighboring states and interfered with the regulatory schemes in those states. Id. at 338-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Brown-Forman, the Court struck down a provision of the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law that required liquor distillers to affirm that their prices were no higher than the lowest price at which the same product would be sold in any other state during the month. 476 U.S. at 575-76. The Court determined that this was an extraterritorial reach violative of the Constitution. It held that \"[o]nce a distiller has posted prices in New York, it is not free to change its prices elsewhere in the United States during the relevant month. Forcing a merchant to seek regulatory approval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another directly regulates interstate commerce.\" Id. at 582 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Seelig, the Court struck down the New York Milk Control Act, which set minimum prices for milk purchased from in-state and out-of-state producers and banned the resale of milk in New York when that milk had been purchased out-of-state for a lower price. 294 U.S. at 519. By requiring New York wholesalers to buy out-of-state milk at certain prices, the effect of the statute was to essentially set out-of-state milk prices. The Court recognized that the Commerce Clause does not permit a state to create a \"scale of prices for use in other states, and to bar the sale of products . . . unless the scale has been observed.\" Id. at 528.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine Act is different from these statutes. Unlike these price affirmation and price control statutes, the Maine Act does not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect. Maine does not insist that manufacturers sell their drugs to a wholesaler for a certain price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Similarly, Maine is not tying the price of its in-state products to out-of-state prices. There is nothing within the Act that requires the rebate to be a certain amount dependent on the price of prescription drugs in other states. The Act merely says that the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Human Services shall use \"best efforts to obtain an initial rebate amount equal to or greater than the rebate calculated under the Medicaid program . . . .\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(4)(B). Furthermore, unlike Brown-Forman and Seelig, the Maine Act does not impose direct controls on a transaction that occurs wholly out-of-state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PhRMA argues strenuously that the effect of the Act will be to regulate the transaction that occurs between the manufacturer and the wholesaler -- a transaction that occurs entirely out of state. It argues that as a result of the rebate provision, manufacturers will lose a portion of their profits otherwise obtained from distributors. Admittedly, it is possible that the rebate provisions of the statute may decrease the profits of manufacturers. Simply because the manufacturers' profits might be negatively affected by the Maine Act, however, does not necessarily mean that the Maine Act is regulating those profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act does not regulate the transaction between manufacturers and wholesalers. It provides for a negotiated rebate agreement between \"[a] drug manufacturer or labeler that sells prescription drugs in [Maine] through the elderly low-cost drug program . . . or any other publicly supported pharmaceutical assistance program . . . .\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2681(3). The rebate program is voluntary and either the manufacturer or the State may withdraw at any time with sixty days' notice. The Act directs the commissioner to \"use the commissioner's best efforts\" to negotiate the amount of the rebate required from the manufacturer. Id. &#167; 2681(4)(B). We note that the commissioner's \"best efforts\" may become coercive or otherwise inappropriate, but we cannot say so on this facial challenge. This may be an issue that needs to be revisited once the Act takes effect. On a facial challenge, however, the use of the commissioner's \"best efforts\" indicates that the Act is not \"regulating\" prices, but merely \"negotiating\" rebates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act clearly does not interfere with regulatory schemes in other states. Ultimately, the Maine Act simply regulates activity that occurs in state: (1) the purchase of the prescription drugs that triggers the rebate; (2) the negotiation of a rebate amount; and (3) the State's action subjecting a manufacturer's drug to prior authorization and releasing the manufacturer's name to health care providers and the public occurs in state. Because the regulation only applies to in-state activities, there is no extraterritorial reach and the Act is not per se invalid under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final consideration is the consequence of other states passing similar statutes. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 336 (considering \"what effect would arise if not one, but many or every, State adopted similar legislation\"). The most apparent effect of similar statutes being passed in other states would be a loss in profits for manufacturers. It does not appear, and PhRMA does not argue, that statutes similar to the Maine Act, if enacted, would result in manufacturers having inconsistent obligations to states, or in creating a \"price gridlock\" linking prices in some states to the prices in other states. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 340. Therefore, at this time, when we are dealing with a facial challenge to the Act, there is no evidence that adverse effects on interstate commerce will occur if such legislation were passed in other states. The Act is not per se violative of the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Strict Level of Scrutiny: Discriminatory Statute</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statute enacted for a discriminatory purpose is subject to strict scrutiny. See Bacchus Imports, Ltd., 468 U.S. at 270. Under this strict scrutiny analysis, a statute violates the Commerce Clause unless the state can show that the statute serves a legitimate local purpose that is unrelated to economic protectionism and that the same purpose could not be achieved by nondiscriminatory means.

Low Level of Scrutiny: Pike Balancing Test</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a state statute regulates evenhandedly and has only incidental effects on interstate commerce, that statute will be upheld unless the burden on interstate commerce is \"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\" Pike, 397 U.S. at 142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities. Occasionally the Court has candidly undertaken a balancing approach in resolving these issues, but more frequently it has spoken in terms of \"direct\" and \"indirect\" effects and burdens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (internal citations omitted). The Maine Act is neither an impermissible extraterritorial reach nor is it discriminatory; rather, it regulates evenhandedly and only has incidental effects on interstate commerce. Therefore, we apply this lower level of scrutiny, known as the Pike balancing test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the Maine Act to be per se invalid, and therefore never determined whether it survives the Pike balancing test. Though the district court did not undertake such an analysis, we may conduct the Pike balancing test for the first time on appeal. See Instructional Sys., Inc. v. Computer Curriculum Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678506\"><a href=\"/opinion/678506/instructional-systems-inc-a-corporation-of-the-state-of-new-jersey-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 826 (3d Cir. 1994). In Instructional Systems, the Third Circuit considered a facial challenge to the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act after the district court had declared the statute per se invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause. Id. at 826. The court found that the statute, from a facial standpoint, survived the Pike test, and reversed the district court judgment which had declared the statute unconstitutional. Id. at 827. The Third Circuit recognized, however, that the issue of whether the statute, when applied, burdens interstate commerce could not be resolved as a matter of law. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the Pike balancing test to the Maine Act, we consider: (1) the nature of the putative local benefits advanced by the statute; (2) the burden the statute places on interstate commerce; and (3) whether the burden is \"clearly excessive\" as compared to the putative local benefits. See Pike, 397 U.S. at 142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, the only burden imposed on interstate commerce by the Maine Act is its possible effects on the profits of the individual manufacturers. As the Third Circuit stated, however, \"the fact that a law may have 'devastating economic consequences' on a particular interstate firm is not sufficient to rise to a Commerce Clause burden.\" Instructional Sys., 35 F.3d at 827 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Ins. Comm'r, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523152\"><a href=\"/opinion/523152/ford-motor-company-and-ford-motor-credit-company-and-the-american-road/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span>, 943 (3d Cir. 1989)); see also Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Md., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109896\"><a href=\"/opinion/109896/exxon-corp-v-governor-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 127-28 (1978) (stating that \"the [Commerce] Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider the local benefits of the Act, which we find to be substantial. The Maine Rx Program will potentially provide prescription drugs to Maine citizens who could not otherwise afford them. The Maine Legislature has decided that without the Maine Rx Program, needy Maine citizens will continue to be deprived of necessary medical care because of rising prescription drug costs. When measuring manufacturers' possible loss of profits against the increased access to prescription drugs for Maine citizens, the local benefits appear to outweigh the burden on interstate commerce. At the very least, the burden on interstate commerce is not \"clearly excessive\" as compared to the local benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is necessary to recognize the difficulty in foreseeing what events actually will occur from the enforcement of this Act, which admittedly makes the Pike balancing test more challenging to apply. We are forced to balance the possible effects, instead of the actual effects of the statute in action. For now, it is enough to say that the Act survives the facial challenge under the dormant Commerce Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that PhRMA is not likely to succeed on the merits of its constitutional challenges, we need not delve into the three remaining preliminary injunction factors (risk of irreparable harm, the balance of equities and the public interest). This court has recognized that the \"sine qua non\" of the preliminary injunction analysis is whether the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of the claim. Weaver v. Henderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599015\"><a href=\"/opinion/599015/ralph-s-weaver-etc-v-charles-henderson-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 12, 14 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993) (concluding that, after determining that there was no likelihood of success on the merits, it was not necessary to examine the other factors). We must conclude that PhRMA has not satisfied its burden to obtain a preliminary injunction preventing the implementation of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this facial challenge, we perceive no conflict between the Maine Act and the Medicaid statute that would result in federal preemption. The Act sets forth prior authorization procedures that are consistent with those explicitly permitted by Medicaid. PhRMA has not established at this point that the administrative burden imposed by prior authorization will likely harm Medicaid recipients. In the absence of such evidence, we cannot conclude that the Act violates the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Act offend the dormant Commerce Clause. It is not an extraterritorial regulation on interstate commerce because it does not regulate conduct occurring outside the state, but only regulates in-state activities. Moreover, from a facial standpoint, the local benefits of the Act appear to outweigh any incidental burden on interstate commerce. For the reasons stated, the Maine Act survives the facial dormant Commerce Clause challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a close case but we do not think that, under the applicable law, the State of Maine should be prohibited from putting the Act into play. We heed the dissent of Justice Louis Brandeis in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101887\"><a href=\"/opinion/101887/new-state-ice-co-v-liebmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 310 (1932):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the nation. It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. This Court has the power to prevent an experiment. We may strike down the statute which embodies it on the ground that, in our opinion, the measure is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. We have power to do this, because the due process clause has been held by the Court applicable to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. But, in the exercise of this high power, we must be ever on our guard, lest we erect our prejudices into legal principles. If we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is REVERSED and the temporary injunction is VACATED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine Rx Program, referred to in this subchapter as the \"program,\" is established to reduce prescription drug prices for residents of the State.

This subchapter is enacted by the Legislature to enable the State to act as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified Maine residents, thereby increasing the overall health of Maine residents, promoting healthy communities and protecting the public health and welfare. It is not the intention of the State to discourage employers from offering or paying for prescription drug benefits for their employees or to replace employer-sponsored prescription drug benefit plans that provide benefits comparable to those made available to qualified Maine residents under this subchapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

No party or amicus, or attorney for a party or amicus, has called attention to any case explicitly declaring that PBMs have standing and a United States district court has jurisdiction to consider either a facial challenge or an as-applied challenge by a PBM to a state statute like Maine's Act to Establish Fairer Pricing for Prescription Drugs, and I am aware of none. Treating the issue as one of first impression, I would recognize both standing and jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the District of Maine, and on appeal. In the world outside the court system, as a pragmatic matter no other person or entity is as active and effective in protecting benefits and beneficiaries of availability of pharmacy products at reasonable cost as PBMs. It is entirely appropriate in these circumstances that the standing of PBMs be recognized in United States district courts and on appeal from adjudications interpreting and applying state legislation affecting the benefits and interests of beneficiaries of marketing of pharmacy products.

This view is reenforced by taking into account James Madison's contributions to federalist thought and actions. This historical background is especially relevant, in my view, to disputes over supremacy of national legislation and associated issues of interpretation of the Maine statute that was before the district court and is before us in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Statutory Interpretation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should be guided primarily by the plain language of all the provisions of the statute that are relevant to the issues before us, and the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in all the relevant provisions. The relevant provisions include the definitions in the statute, the declaration of program goals, and the operational directives to Defendant/Appellant Kevin Concannon, Commissioner, Maine Department of Human Services. With these guideposts in mind, I conclude that a reasonable interpretation of the Maine statute includes the following elements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">+ The Maine statute authorizes \"best efforts\" of Maine administrators rather than requiring prohibitive administrative decisions and actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">+ The courts should respect the legislative drafters' thoughtful use of the idea of \"best efforts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">+ It would be a mistake to accept the suggestions of challenges to the Maine statute that propose to interpret it in a way that, in effect, reads \"best efforts\" out of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision that opponents describe as requiring authorization for participating pharmacies to offer discounted prices to some defined group of Maine residents and obtain rebates from a state fund, created by an assessment against manufacturers, is not a statutory mandate. Instead, the statute requires only \"best efforts\" of Administrators to achieve the legislative aim of protecting interests of the people of Maine by ongoing creative mediation and negotiation that appeals to the executives of pharmacy products manufacturers to cooperate with Maine's administration of legislatively authorized programs. The statutory provisions providing for \"best efforts\" and for \"negotiation\" make clear that the drafters intended the rebate process to entail negotiation and compromise between the state and the manufacturers to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. Although conceivably these \"best efforts\" could fail, and manufacturers could be subject to the prior authorization provisions of the statute, this outcome is not mandated by the language of the statute, and it is not necessary, in a facial challenge to the statute, to reach questions that may be presented in the future if \"best efforts\" fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, it is obvious that many, probably most, citizens of Maine who have a need for pharmacy products but have less than the economic resources of, say, the top ten percent of citizens of the state, do not have adequate resources and practical means to get the pharmacy products they need unless</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) by travel to Canada, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) by mail, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) in some other way that involves aid or assistance comparable to that PBMs provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If these citizens have a need for prescription medication, and choose to forgo that medication rather than resort to these resources, it may well be in the interests of PhRMA members to negotiate with the State of Maine. In light of allegations made in their submissions, I infer that PhRMA members believe that a rebate in the amount of the Medicaid rebate would not be in their best interest, but the plain language of the statute allows for negotiation in a way that will serve the best interests of both PhRMA members and previously unrepresented citizens of the State of Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VII.

The district court's ruling to the contrary must be vacated. No federal law (constitutional, statutory, or decisional) preempts and thus forbids reasonable implementation of Me. Rev. Stat.

The core question is multifarious, not singular. An evaluative legal test applies, not a bright-line elements legal test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff/Appellee proposes in its waiver and preclusion arguments that we should hold that the fact that Defendants/Appellants make these fallacious arguments bars relief to Defendants/Appellants in this appeal. I would reject this argument. It does not state a valid reason for depriving the citizens of Maine of a fair adjudication of their interests at stake in this appeal, based on a proper interpretation of the Maine statute. Our federal system permits a State's advocacy in court in support of its interests and those of its people. Penalizing a state and its people whenever the state makes an argument rejected by the court is not appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other arguments presented by Defendants/Appellants both here and in the district court are consistent with the interpretation of the Maine statute explained in Part VI of this opinion and support reversal of the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An unstated but implicit premise of Plaintiff/Appellee's position in this case is that all Plaintiff/Appellee need do to succeed in a facial challenge to the Maine Act is to show that the administration of the Act is putting pressure on Plaintiff/ Appellee, thus making its choice about how it responds to the circumstances developing under ongoing administration of the Act not entirely voluntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fallacy of that position stems from the fact that few choices of individuals and entities in a geographical territory that has a government are entirely voluntary. True, some transactions are beyond governmental authority to intrude. They are \"transactions beyond law\" in the sense that individuals and private (non-governmental) entities they create and maintain have a large range of freedom under law to do as they please without governmental intrusion on that freedom. But a demand by any individual or entity for entire freedom is fundamentally in conflict with having a government that maintains the order essential to protection of individual freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible, as explained in Part VIII, infra, to fashion remedies for any threats that may arise from overstepping the bounds of statutorily authorized \"best efforts\" of Maine's Commissioner of Human Services during the ongoing administration of the Maine Rx Program. It is appropriate to wait and see what happens, and fashion appropriate remedies for any overstepping, rather than declaring Maine's Act unconstitutional because of an outside chance that something beyond constitutional bounds will be attempted unless an advance declaration of facial invalidity of the statute by the district court is allowed to stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VIII.

An as-applied challenge to state legislation is a more flexible instrument of adjudication, more capable of reaching an outcome tailored to the circumstances and needs of a case at hand than the all-or-nothing nature of a facial challenge to validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal district or appellate court's acting in advance of overstepping, because of the possibility overstepping might occur in the future, is fundamentally inconsistent with the body of precedents establishing the elements of a successful facial challenge in a federal court to the consistency of a state statute with potentially preemptive federal law.

These precedents would require PhRMA to demonstrate \"that there is no possible\" application of the statute that would not conflict with the structure and purpose of Medicaid. PhRMA cannot meet this burden. It could not do so even if we softened the legal standard a bit by substituting \"reasonably likely\" for \"possible.\" PhRMA's facial challenge must be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal court's acting in advance of overstepping by state officials, and responding to a facial challenge, is also inconsistent with relevant precedents for a facial challenge on constitutional grounds.

We need not reach the issue of the applicability of the Salerno test, however, because the statute in this case, as explained in Part VI of this opinion, is capable of an interpretation and an application that is respectful of limits imposed by the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application of facial-challenge jurisprudence in the circumstance of this case before the District Court and in this appeal is, in practical effect, a considerable stretch beyond any thus-far-successful facial challenge. If such an extension of the jurisprudence of facial challenges expressed in decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States is to occur, it is more appropriate that it occur in an opinion of that Court than in an opinion of a Court of Appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My own reading of the array of Supreme Court opinions on this subject, even in light of the ongoing differences both within the Court and among scholars on the applicability of the Salerno test, is that precedent points away from rather than toward softening in any way the rigorous requirements for presenting a successful facial challenge to validity of a state statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is supported not only by the opinions explicitly reasoned as part of the facial-challenge jurisprudence but also by other ongoing developments of federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One ongoing development supportive of the conclusion I propose is the resurgence in recent years of emphasis on the respect that inferior federal courts are directed to show for the freedom of the people of a locality and local governmental institutions to make their own decisions. For illustrative citations, see Part IX of this opinion, infra. See also the Madisonian principles identified in Part III, supra. This emphasis is in part a feature of the distinctive version of federalism underlying what is commonly called the American legal system. It is associated with the Supreme Court's invoking the Commerce Clause not for the ordinary purpose of sustaining federal legislation but to strike down state legislation. This emphasis on federalism weighs in favor of sustaining rather than striking down the Maine Rx Program, as explained in Part IX, infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IX.

Unlike the case before us, this was a direct clash between two States of the Union. Wyoming, a major coal-producing State, though not a seller of coal, imposed a severance tax on those who extracted coal. The direct impact of that severance tax on the price of Wyoming coal purchased by four Oklahoma electric utilities was obvious. The Oklahoma legislature passed an act requiring coal-fired electric utilities in Oklahoma to burn a mixture containing at least 10% Oklahoma-mined coal. The utilities reduced their purchases of Wyoming coal. Wyoming's severance tax revenues declined. Wyoming sought relief under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court accepted Wyoming's complaint and held the Oklahoma act invalid under the \"negative\" aspect of the Commerce Clause on the reasoning that it \"prohibits economic protectionism - that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\" Id. at 454. Even so, the Court added that a clearly discriminatory statute will be struck down \"unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism,\" citing Maine v.

Instead, I conclude that the case before us is not one subject to the \"negative\" rule itself, quite apart from the exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyoming v. Oklahoma and other opinions of the Supreme Court that have gone farthest in the direction of a \"negative\" application of the Commerce Clause do not support the proposition that a federal court acts properly when it disregards all the indicia of the State's purpose in establishing the Maine Rx Program to regulate transactions within the territorial boundaries of Maine and to protect the health of the people of Maine. In these circumstances a federal court does not act properly when it makes a judicial \"finding\" that the State's declaration of purpose is a facade and the real purpose was \"to regulate the price paid in earlier transactions in other states.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First. The legislative aim of the Act was fully stated in the Act itself, as explained in Part VI.A of this opinion, supra. This is not a case of hidden or obscure aims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second. Any suggestion to the contrary in briefs before this court is in disregard of our obligation, and that of the District Court, in reading the statute, to be guided, as stated in Part VI.B of this opinion, by the plain language of the statute, the definitions in the statute, and the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in the declaration of program goals, in the statutory definitions, and in the operational directives to Maine's Commissioner of Human Services. See Whiting v. Town of Westerly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566795\"><a href=\"/opinion/566795/charles-whiting-iii-and-eric-anderson-v-town-of-westerly-and-mark/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 21 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"In evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third. As stated in Part VI.B, the provision of the Maine Act that opponents describe as requiring authorization for participating pharmacies to offer discounted prices to some defined group of Maine residents and obtain rebates from a state fund, created by an assessment against manufacturers, is not a statutory mandate. Instead, it is a statement of aim. The statute requires only \"best efforts\" of Administrators to achieve the legislative aim of protecting interests of the people of Maine by ongoing creative mediation and negotiation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth. As stated in Part VI.B, many and probably most citizens of Maine who have a need for pharmacy products would not have adequate resources and practical means to get the pharmacy products they need absent the Maine Rx Program. In the course of the creative mediation and negotiation required by the statute, the pharmaceutical companies themselves may find it is in their best interests to enter into agreements to allow them to reach this previously untapped market for their products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth. In view of the foregoing four points, it cannot be proper for a federal court to make judicial \"findings\" contrary to Maine's legislative declarations and on that basis declare that Maine's Act is invalid because \"it attempted to regulate transactions taking place solely outside the State\" and attempted \"to regulate the price paid in earlier transactions in other states.\" In so doing, the District Court acted beyond its authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ideals of federalism explained above weigh in favor of respect for a state's experimentation and respect for a state's sovereignty. The precedents that govern our examination and that of the District Court of a facial challenge to state legislation are consistent with these ideals of federalism, and indeed are consistent with the delicate balance of power explained by Madison in his early writings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court's preliminary injunction must be vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">X.
