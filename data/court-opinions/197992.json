Peter Parker, Federal Defender Office, for appellant.\r\nPaula J. DeGiacomo, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Despena F.\r\nBillings, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n                May 27, 1998\r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Defendant Paul E. Lowe appeals\r\nhis three-count conviction for carjacking in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n2119, kidnapping in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1201, and interstate\r\ntransportation for illegal sexual activity in violation of the Mann\r\nAct, 18 U.S.C.  2421.  He was sentenced to a total term of 432\r\nmonths of imprisonment.  Lowe argues that he was deprived of his\r\nfull complement of peremptory challenges during voir dire, alleges\r\nthat the jury was exposed to prejudicial facts not in evidence, and\r\nchallenges the sufficiency and admissibility of certain evidence. \r\nHe also contends that the district court erred in sentencing him\r\nfor the carjacking count.  We affirm.\r\n               I.  BACKGROUND\r\nOn an appeal from a jury conviction, we view the facts,\r\nconsistent with record support, in the light most favorable to the\r\njury's verdict.  United States v. Rosen, 130 F.3d 5, 6 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  We find that a jury could have found the following facts.\r\nAt approximately 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, December 10, 1995,\r\nLowe helped a young woman (\"K.\") by pushing her car as she drove it\r\nout of a snowbank at the end of her driveway in Lowell,\r\nMassachusetts.  Upon freeing K.'s car, he forced her to let him in,\r\nand drove her to New Hampshire, where, in the front passenger seat,\r\nhe forced her to perform oral sex on him while holding a\r\nscrewdriver to her neck, and then raped her vaginally.  He then\r\ndrove K. back to Massachusetts, and after stealing her jewelry and\r\nmoney, left K. in her car in Lowell near the Belvedere police\r\nprecinct.\r\nShe immediately drove to the house of her boyfriend,\r\nSteve Makris, and told him about the kidnapping, but did not\r\nrecount the rape.  Makris called the police, and when the\r\nresponding officer arrived, K. again failed to mention the rape. \r\nHowever, en route to the police station, K. stated to Makris that\r\nshe had been raped.  Upon arriving at the police station, she was\r\nimmediately taken to Saints Memorial Hospital, where emergency room\r\nnurse Kathleen Sweetser spoke to K. for approximately 25 minutes. \r\nShe was eventually examined by an emergency room physician, and\r\nreleased.  After giving her statement to the police, she retraced\r\nLowe's route to New Hampshire and back for police detectives.  On\r\nDecember 13, 1995, FBI agents and police officers arrested Lowe at\r\nhis girlfriend's apartment in Waltham, Massachusetts.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial also showed that in the\r\nhours prior to kidnapping K., Lowe had been involved in an incident\r\nin which he purposely and repeatedly rammed his pickup truck into\r\nthe car in which his friends Nancy Goudreau and Rachel Briggar and\r\ntheir boyfriends were driving.  When they confronted Lowe, he\r\nthreatened to continue hitting the car until Goudreau got into the\r\ntruck with him.  Eventually, Goudreau and her friends parked at the\r\nLowell police station, and there, Lowe rammed the truck right into\r\nthe car.  Lowe fled and drove to Goudreau's apartment in Lowell\r\nwhere he found her sister, Priscilla Champagne.  The police arrived\r\nat Goudreau's apartment, searched for Lowe, who was hiding in a\r\ncloset, but failed to find him.  However, they towed Lowe's truck. \r\nLowe left the apartment on foot with two screwdrivers Champagne had\r\nprovided.  A short time later, Lowe encountered K. with her car\r\nstuck in a snowbank.\r\nDuring trial, the government presented DNA evidence,\r\nwhich Lowe's counsel moved to exclude.  After evidentiary hearings,\r\nthe district court issued a detailed memorandum and order denying\r\nthe motion and admitting the DNA evidence.  A jury convicted Lowe\r\nof carjacking, kidnapping, and interstate transportation for\r\nillegal sexual activity.  He was acquitted on an additional count\r\nfor using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence.  The\r\ndistrict court sentenced Lowe to 300 months imprisonment for\r\ncarjacking, 432 months for kidnapping, and 60 months for the\r\ninterstate transportation charge, all terms to be served\r\nconcurrently with each other.  Lowe appeals.\r\n              II.  DISCUSSION\r\nA.   Peremptory Challenges\r\n\nLowe argues that the district court's refusal to strike\r\nfor cause two prospective jurors, one of whom had been sexually\r\nmolested and the other who had been the victim of an attempted\r\nrape, unfairly forced him to expend two peremptory challenges. \r\nCiting United States v. Cambara, 902 F.2d 144, 147 (1st Cir. 1990),\r\nLowe claims that the district court committed reversible error by\r\ndenying him the full number of peremptory challenges required by\r\nlaw.  Before addressing Lowe's grounds for reversal, we must first\r\ndetermine whether the district court erred in failing to excuse\r\nthese two jurors for cause.  We review a district court's ruling on\r\nfor-cause challenges to prospective jurors for clear abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See United States v. Gonzlez-Soberal, 109 F.3d 64,\r\n69-70 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nThe two jurors at issue, juror number 18 and juror number\r\n19, were among a group of ten prospective jurors who responded\r\nduring voir dire to questions concerning sexual abuse committed on\r\nthemselves, a family member or a friend.  The district court\r\nexcluded five of these jurors for cause because they stated they\r\ncould not be impartial.  The district court also excused three\r\nadditional jurors for cause even though they either claimed that\r\nthey could be impartial or professed uncertainty regarding their\r\nimpartiality.  The record reflects that the judge did not believe\r\nthese three jurors after assessing their demeanor.\r\nIn contrast, juror number 19 stated that although she had\r\nbeen sexually molested in the past, she did not think it would\r\ninterfere with her ability to be fair and impartial.  The juror\r\nstated that the incident had occurred a long time ago, and she had\r\nnot filed a complaint or gone through a trial.  When asked, \"Will\r\nit in any way bias you against the defendant in this case?\" she\r\nresponded, \"no.\"  Lowe's counsel challenged juror number 19 for\r\ncause, but the district court refused to strike the juror because\r\n\"[u]nlike the . . . two other women who were just in front of me\r\nwho appeared so visibly upset, she didn't.  She seemed to be able\r\nto put it aside, she said she'd be fair and impartial.\"\r\nJuror number 18 stated that she had a friend who had been\r\nbeaten and raped about 35 years ago and that the juror had been the\r\nvictim of an attempted rape about 40 years ago.  The juror said she\r\ndid not report her own case or go through a trial.  The judge asked\r\nwhether her experiences would in any way interfere with her ability\r\nto serve on the jury, she replied \"I don't think so.\"  The juror\r\nalso responded \"no\" to a question whether she would hold any bias\r\nagainst the defendant.  When Lowe's counsel moved to excuse this\r\njuror, the judge responded, \"I'm not going to excuse her based on\r\nmy evaluation of her demeanor that she could be fair and impartial. \r\nAnd I view her as credible.  It was a long time ago, 35, 40 years\r\nago.\"  Since the district court denied his motions to strike jurors\r\nnumber 18 and 19 for cause, defense counsel used two peremptory\r\nchallenges to exclude these jurors.\r\nWe find that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in denying Lowe's motions.  \"There are few aspects of a\r\njury trial where we would be less inclined to disturb a trial\r\njudge's exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling\r\non challenges for cause in the empaneling of a jury.\"  Gonzlez-\r\nSoberal, 109 F.3d at 69-70 (quoting United States v. McCarthy, 961\r\nF.2d 972, 976 (1st Cir. 1992)).  In the instant case, the judge\r\nasked each juror several questions regarding their experiences with\r\nsexual abuse to ascertain any potential bias.  We decline to\r\nsecond-guess the district court's determination that jurors number\r\n18 and 19 could be impartial at trial because \"[i]t is the\r\nfundamental task of the district court judge to make this sort of\r\ndistinction.\"  Cambara, 902 F.2d at 148.  The trial judge is in the\r\nbest position to assess a potential juror's credibility by\r\nobserving her demeanor, reaction to questioning, and overall\r\nbehavior on the stand.  Moreover, nothing in the record suggests\r\nthat the district court judge lacked judgment or was prejudiced\r\ntoward Lowe.  Cf. Gonzlez-Soberal, 109 F.3d at 70.\r\nBecause the district court did not abuse its discretion\r\nin denying the defendant's motions to exclude jurors number 18 and\r\n19 for cause, we need not reach the question whether Lowe's use of\r\ntwo of his peremptory challenges for these jurors mandates\r\nreversal.\r\nB.   Jury Exposure to Prejudicial Facts\r\nLowe contends that he was denied a fair trial because the\r\njury was presented with prejudicial facts not in evidence during\r\nvoir dire and the government's closing argument.  He argues that,\r\nduring voir dire, the jury was made aware of his pretrial escape\r\nfrom the Wyatt Detention Facility when the district court asked the\r\nentire panel of potential jurors, \"[H]as anyone read or heard\r\nanything about an escape involved in this case from a Rhode Island\r\njail?\"\r\nIt was well within the district court's discretion to\r\nprobe prospective jurors about the escape or any other pretrial\r\npublicity to uncover any bias.  Lowe himself moved for individual\r\nvoir dire on the issue of pretrial publicity.  \"When pretrial\r\npublicity threatens to impede selection of an unbiased jury, the\r\ntrial judge must take extra care to ensure that the particular\r\njurors selected do not come to the trial with preconceived notions\r\nabout the defendant's guilt.\"  See United States v. Samalot Prez,\r\n767 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1985).  The district court, in fact,\r\nexcused two prospective jurors for cause because they said they\r\ncould not be fair and impartial due to publicity concerning the\r\nescape.  Another juror was excused because of publicity about the\r\ncase generally.\r\nOn the record, we see no specific proof that pretrial\r\npublicity either tainted the trial process or prejudiced jurors. \r\nOnly one of the deliberating jurors, juror number 28, had heard\r\nabout the case, and had done so over a year prior to the voir dire. \r\nThe district court asked this juror, among other questions, whether\r\nhe could put aside what he had heard on the news and decide the\r\ncase on the evidence.  The juror responded, \"Yes, I think so.\"  The\r\njuror also said that he was sure he could be fair and impartial. \r\nIndeed, Lowe's counsel did not move to excuse juror number 28 for\r\ncause.\r\nLowe also contends that the government's statement in\r\nclosing argument that \"K talked to Sweetser and she told her\r\neverything\" denied him the right to a fair trial.  The defendant's\r\ncounsel objected to this statement during side bar conference since\r\nK did not testify that she had told the nurse everything.  He then\r\nrequested an instruction that the jurors' deliberations should be\r\ncontrolled by their own memories of what happened.  While the\r\ndistrict court did not issue an immediate curative instruction,\r\nwhich is a practice we regularly encourage to dispel potential\r\nprejudice, see United States v. Rivera-Gmez, 67 F.3d 993, 999 (1st\r\nCir. 1995), the judge stated during her charge to the jury:\r\n     There are certain things I want to\r\n  emphasize that are not evidence in this\r\n  case.  The first is, the opening\r\n  statements and the closing arguments made\r\n  by the lawyers are not evidence in this\r\n  case . . . .  In the final analysis, it's\r\n  your own recollection and your own\r\n  interpretation of the evidence that\r\n  controls in this case. . . .\r\n     Don't speculate about what was\r\n  redacted.  You will see the word \"redacted\"\r\n  when it was redacted, and you won't see\r\n  the word when the portions of the form are\r\n  simply blank.\r\n\nTranscript at 9:104-105.\r\nIn oral argument as well as in its brief, the government\r\nadmitted to inaccurately restating trial testimony when it made the\r\nchallenged comment.  In assessing whether improper statements\r\nduring closing argument require a new trial, we examine (1) whether\r\nthe prosecutor's conduct was isolated and/or deliberate; (2)\r\nwhether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary\r\ninstruction; and (3) whether it is likely that any prejudice\r\nsurviving the judge's instruction could have affected the outcome\r\nof the case.  See United States v. Hodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d 607, 610\r\n(1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Boldt, 929 F.2d 35 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).  We see no deliberate attempt on the government's part to\r\nmislead the jury with its stray comment.  During side bar, the\r\nprosecutor acknowledged that her memory of K.'s testimony may have\r\nbeen incorrect.  In addition, as previously mentioned, the\r\ngovernment was forthright in oral argument and in its brief in\r\nrecognizing its error.  It appears that the government made an\r\nhonest mistake rather than a deliberate one.\r\nWe also find that the district court's curative\r\ninstruction adequately addressed Lowe's concerns regarding the\r\ngovernment's misstatement.  The district court emphasized to the\r\njurors that any statement during the closing was not evidence and\r\nthat their interpretation of the evidence presented during trial\r\nshould control their decision.  While Lowe claims that the mistaken\r\nreference could have related to redacted parts of the hospital\r\nrecords, the district court specifically admonished the jury not to\r\nconsider any redacted portions of the record.  The court properly\r\naccounted for any possible prejudice from the government's remark. \r\nUnder these circumstances, we find no reversible error.\r\nC.   Evidentiary Rulings\r\nLowe opposes the admission of DNA evidence as well as\r\nevidence of his involvement in a car crash prior to the alleged\r\nrape.  In addition, he contests the sufficiency of evidence  used\r\nto convict him of kidnapping.  We review a district court's\r\ndecision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.  See United\r\nStates v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1008 (1st Cir. 1995).  We engage in\r\nde novo review of claims of insufficient evidence.  See United\r\nStates v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1494 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nWith respect to the admissibility of the DNA evidence, we\r\naffirm on the grounds stated in the district court's well-written\r\nmemorandum and order on this issue.  See United States v. Lowe, 954\r\nF. Supp. 401 (D. Mass. 1996).  We write only to note the following. \r\nSince Lowe admitted to having sex with K., he contends that the\r\nprejudicial impact of the DNA evidence far outweighs its probative\r\nvalue on the issue of identity.  However, as the district court\r\nobserved, the evidence \"was probative not only on the issue of\r\nidentity but also on the location of the alleged rape.\"  Id. at\r\n408, n.8.  Thus, the district court found that, under Fed. R. Evid.\r\n403, \"[i]ts probative value was not substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\r\nthe jury.\"  Id.  On appeal, we afford a trial court's construction\r\nof a Rule 403 balancing substantial discretion.  See Veranda Beach\r\nClub Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1372 (1st\r\nCir. 1991).  Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's determination.\r\nThe defendant also challenges the admission of evidence\r\nof his involvement in a car ramming incident hours prior to his\r\nencountering K. in her driveway.  Lowe asserts that the evidence\r\nshould have been excluded as prior bad acts evidence under Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 404(b) and 403.  Rule 404(b) provides:\r\n  Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\r\n  is not admissible to prove the character\r\n  of a person in order to show action in\r\n  conformity therewith.  It may, however, be\r\n  admissible for other purposes such as\r\n  proof of motive, opportunity, intent\r\n  preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\r\n  absence of mistake or accident . . . .\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 404(b).  In the instant case, the district court\r\nadmitted the car ramming evidence as probative of his desire for\r\nsex and of his motive for committing carjacking.\r\nLowe argues that the evidence did not have any relevance\r\nto his desire for sex because he conceded having sex with K.  To\r\nprevent the admission of bad acts evidence, a defendant's offer to\r\nconcede knowledge and/or intent issues must: (1) express a clear\r\nand unequivocal intention to remove the issue such that, in effect\r\nif not in form, it constitutes an offer to stipulate, and (2) the\r\nconcession must cover the necessary substantive ground to remove\r\nthe issue from the case.  See United States v. Garca, 983 F.2d\r\n1160, 1174 (1st Cir. 1993).  Lowe's concession fails to satisfy the\r\nsecond prong of this test.  Evidence that is probative of Lowe's\r\ndesire for sex is also relevant to show motive and intent to commit\r\nkidnapping and interstate transportation for illegal sexual\r\nactivity. However, the defendant conceded to nothing more than\r\nhaving consensual sex with K.  He did not concede the element of\r\nintent required to prove kidnapping and the Mann Act offense. \r\nThus, the fact that Lowe admitted to having sex with K. did not\r\nremove the issue of intent from the case.\r\nThe district court also properly admitted the car-ramming\r\nevidence as probative of Lowe's motive and intent to carjack.  The\r\nevidence showed that Lowe damaged his truck in the ramming, and the\r\npolice then towed the truck.  The jury could have inferred from the\r\nevidence that the defendant needed to procure another vehicle to\r\nevade the Lowell police who were searching for him.\r\nLastly, despite Lowe's arguments to the contrary, the\r\nprobative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by\r\nthe risk of unfair prejudice under Rule 403.  In its jury\r\ninstructions on the challenged evidence, the district court warned:\r\n  The only use you may make of Mr. Lowe's\r\n  involvement in the car crash is to\r\n  determine whether he had the intent to\r\n  commit the offenses charged in the\r\n  indictment.\r\n\n  You are free to determine that Mr. Lowe's\r\n  alleged involvement in the car crash is\r\n  not probative of his intent to commit the\r\n  offense with which he is charged.  You may\r\n  not consider evidence of the car crash as\r\n  a substitute for proof that the defendant\r\n  committed the offenses charged, nor may\r\n  you consider evidence of the car crash as\r\n  proof that the defendant has a propensity\r\n  to engage in criminal acts or has a bad\r\n  character.\r\n\nTranscript at 9:112-113.  Here, the district court minimized the\r\npotential for prejudice by telling the jury explicitly not to draw\r\nthe forbidden inference.  Cf. United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d\r\n771, 775 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding potential for prejudice minimized\r\nby contemporaneous jury instruction which was reiterated in final\r\ncharge).  Thus, we find no error.\r\nLowe's final evidentiary challenge relates to the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence to convict him of kidnapping K.  Lowe\r\nargues that since kidnapping is coextensive with the Mann Act,\r\nwhich also requires transportation or confinement, the district\r\ncourt may not convict him of kidnapping if the degree of\r\ntransportation or confinement imposed to commit the kidnapping is\r\nno greater than that required for the Mann Act, citing Government\r\nof Virgin Islands v. Berry, 604 F.2d 221, 227 (3d Cir. 1979);\r\nUnited States v. Howard, 918 F.2d 1529, 1535-36  (11th Cir. 1990). \r\nIn other words, Lowe contends that since the alleged transportation\r\nand confinement of K. was merely incidental to the Mann Act\r\nviolation, these acts were insufficient to support a conviction for\r\nkidnapping.\r\nThe Mann Act and federal kidnapping charges are separate\r\nand distinct offenses with different underlying congressional\r\npurposes.  See United States v. Jones, 808 F.2d 561, 566 (7th Cir.\r\n1986); United States v. Phillips, 640 F.2d 87, 95 (7th Cir. 1981). \r\n\"[The] congressional intent of . . . the Mann Act was to protect\r\nthe morals of the community, while the purposes of the kidnapping\r\nstatute was to protect the liberty and life of the victim.\"  SeePhillips, 640 F.2d at 95, citing Sealund v. United States, 97 F.2d\r\n742, 747 (7th Cir. 1938).  It is irrelevant that the kidnapping may\r\nhave been incidental to the Mann Act offense as long as the\r\ngovernment proved the elements of the kidnapping charge.\r\nFor the kidnapping charge, the government needed to show\r\nthat Lowe knowingly and willfully seized, abducted, or confined K.,\r\ntransported her in interstate commerce, and held her for \"ransom,\r\nreward or otherwise.\"  See 18 U.S.C.  1201.  The term \"otherwise\"\r\ncan include sexual gratification.  See United States v. Sriyuth, 98\r\nF.3d 739, 746-47 (3d Cir. 1996).  The Mann Act required the\r\ngovernment to prove that the defendant knowingly and willfully\r\ntransported K. in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution\r\nor any other illegal sexual activity.  See 18 U.S.C.  2421. \r\nConsent is a defense to kidnapping but not to a Mann Act charge. \r\nSee Jones, 808 F.2d at 565.\r\nOn the record, we find sufficient evidence of the\r\nelements of kidnapping.  In evaluating the sufficiency of evidence\r\nunderlying a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the prosecution.  See Ruiz, 105 F.3d at 1494.  The\r\nevidence shows that Lowe took and carried away K. against her will\r\nand held her for over six hours.  During the course of the\r\nabduction, Lowe forced K. to travel with him from Massachusetts to\r\nNew Hampshire and back.  In addition, he forced her to perform oral\r\nsex on him as well as raping her vaginally.  The government firmly\r\nestablished the elements of the kidnapping charge, and therefore,\r\nwe affirm the conviction.\r\nD.   Appeal of Carjacking Sentence\r\nLowe appeals his 25-year sentence under 18 U.S.C.\r\n2119(2), which enhances the 15-year sentence under  2119(1) \"if\r\nserious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 of this title)\r\nresults\" from the commission of a carjacking.  Lowe asserts that\r\nthe shorter sentence applies, arguing that K. did not suffer\r\nserious bodily injury as defined in the statute, and that even if\r\nthe rape constitutes serious bodily injury, the rape is outside the\r\ncoverage of the statute because it did not result from the force,\r\nviolence and intimidation used to take the car.\r\nSection 1365(g)(3) provides that \"serious bodily injury\"\r\nmeans bodily injury which involves:\r\n(A) a substantial risk of death;\r\n(B) extreme physical pain; \r\n(C) protracted and obvious disfigurement; or \r\n(D) protracted loss or impairment of the function of a\r\nbodily member, organ, or mental faculty . . . \r\n\n18 U.S.C.  1365(g)(3).  After reviewing the record, the district\r\ncourt determined that K. suffered \"protracted . . . impairment of\r\n. . . mental facult[ies].\"  During trial, nearly 10 months after\r\nthe crime, the court noted that K. was \"extremely tearful through\r\nparts of her testimony, particularly when she [was] looking in the\r\ndefendant's direction,\" and that she was in a \"fragile\" state.  The\r\nrecord reflects, inter alia, that K. underwent at least 10 months\r\nof counseling at a rape crisis center.  The district court properly\r\nenhanced Lowe's carjacking sentence.  The record amply demonstrates\r\nthat, as a direct consequence of the rape, K. suffered serious and\r\ncontinuing mental trauma, constituting a \"protracted . . .\r\nimpairment of . . . mental facult[ies]\" under  1365(g)(3).  Cf.\r\nUnited States v. Vzquez-Rivera, 135 F.3d 172, 177-78 (1st Cir.\r\n1998) (holding that persistent psychological trauma resulting from\r\nrape qualified as protracted impairment of mental faculties, and\r\ntherefore, as \"serious bodily injury\").\r\nWith respect to Lowe's claim that the rape was not the\r\nresult of the carjacking, we find our recent decision in Vzquez-\r\nRivera, 135 F.3d at 178, dispositive.  The defendant in that case,\r\nwho also raped his carjacking victim, raised a similar argument. \r\nHowever, we determined that \"the choice of the word 'results' in\r\nthe statutory phrase 'if serious bodily injury . . . results'\r\nsuggests that Congress intended to cover a fairly broad range of\r\nconsequences flowing from a carjacking.\"  Id.  In addition, we\r\nnoted that \"the legislative history characterized the provision as\r\nimposing the enhancement when the carjacking 'involves bodily\r\ninjury,' . . . which supports the view that the injuries covered\r\nare not limited to those resulting from the 'taking' of a vehicle,\r\nbut also include those caused by the carjacker at any point during\r\nhis or her retention of the vehicle.\"  Id. (internal citations\r\nomitted).  Accordingly, we conclude that the carjacking resulted in\r\nserious bodily injury.\r\n              III.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant's conviction is\r\naffirmed.\n",

He was sentenced to a total term of 432\r\nmonths of imprisonment.

We affirm.\r\n               I.  BACKGROUND\r\nOn an appeal from a jury conviction, we view the facts,\r\nconsistent with record support, in the light most favorable to the\r\njury's verdict.  United States v. Rosen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197629\"><a href=\"/opinion/197629/united-states-v-rosen/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  We find that a jury could have found the following facts.\r\nAt approximately 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, December 10, 1995,\r\nLowe helped a young woman (\"K.\") by pushing her car as she drove it\r\nout of a snowbank at the end of her driveway in Lowell,\r\nMassachusetts.  Upon freeing K.'s car, he forced her to let him in,\r\nand drove her to New Hampshire, where, in the front passenger seat,\r\nhe forced her to perform oral sex on him while holding a\r\nscrewdriver to her neck, and then raped her vaginally.  He then\r\ndrove K. back to Massachusetts, and after stealing her jewelry and\r\nmoney, left K. in her car in Lowell near the Belvedere police\r\nprecinct.\r\nShe immediately drove to the house of her boyfriend,\r\nSteve Makris, and told him about the kidnapping, but did not\r\nrecount the rape.  Makris called the police, and when the\r\nresponding officer arrived, K. again failed to mention the rape. \r\nHowever, en route to the police station, K. stated to Makris that\r\nshe had been raped.  Upon arriving at the police station, she was\r\nimmediately taken to Saints Memorial Hospital, where emergency room\r\nnurse Kathleen Sweetser spoke to K. for approximately 25 minutes. \r\nShe was eventually examined by an emergency room physician, and\r\nreleased.  After giving her statement to the police, she retraced\r\nLowe's route to New Hampshire and back for police detectives.  On\r\nDecember 13, 1995, FBI agents and police officers arrested Lowe at\r\nhis girlfriend's apartment in Waltham, Massachusetts.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial also showed that in the\r\nhours prior to kidnapping K., Lowe had been involved in an incident\r\nin which he purposely and repeatedly rammed his pickup truck into\r\nthe car in which his friends Nancy Goudreau and Rachel Briggar and\r\ntheir boyfriends were driving.  When they confronted Lowe, he\r\nthreatened to continue hitting the car until Goudreau got into the\r\ntruck with him.  Eventually, Goudreau and her friends parked at the\r\nLowell police station, and there, Lowe rammed the truck right into\r\nthe car.  Lowe fled and drove to Goudreau's apartment in Lowell\r\nwhere he found her sister, Priscilla Champagne.  The police arrived\r\nat Goudreau's apartment, searched for Lowe, who was hiding in a\r\ncloset, but failed to find him.  However, they towed Lowe's truck. \r\nLowe left the apartment on foot with two screwdrivers Champagne had\r\nprovided.  A short time later, Lowe encountered K. with her car\r\nstuck in a snowbank.\r\nDuring trial, the government presented DNA evidence,\r\nwhich Lowe's counsel moved to exclude.  After evidentiary hearings,\r\nthe district court issued a detailed memorandum and order denying\r\nthe motion and admitting the DNA evidence.  A jury convicted Lowe\r\nof carjacking, kidnapping, and interstate transportation for\r\nillegal sexual activity.  He was acquitted on an additional count\r\nfor using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence.  The\r\ndistrict court sentenced Lowe to 300 months imprisonment for\r\ncarjacking, 432 months for kidnapping, and 60 months for the\r\ninterstate transportation charge, all terms to be served\r\nconcurrently with each other.  Lowe appeals.\r\n              II.  DISCUSSION\r\nA.   Peremptory Challenges\r\n\nLowe argues that the district court's refusal to strike\r\nfor cause two prospective jurors, one of whom had been sexually\r\nmolested and the other who had been the victim of an attempted\r\nrape, unfairly forced him to expend two peremptory challenges. \r\nCiting United States v. Cambara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540782\"><a href=\"/opinion/540782/united-states-v-joaquin-cambara-united-states-of-america-v-jose-cambara/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 147 (1st Cir. 1990),\r\nLowe claims that the district court committed reversible error by\r\ndenying him the full number of peremptory challenges required by\r\nlaw.  Before addressing Lowe's grounds for reversal, we must first\r\ndetermine whether the district court erred in failing to excuse\r\nthese two jurors for cause.  We review a district court's ruling on\r\nfor-cause challenges to prospective jurors for clear abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See United States v. Gonzlez-Soberal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197260\"><a href=\"/opinion/197260/united-states-v-gonzalez-soberal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n69-70 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nThe two jurors at issue, juror number 18 and juror number\r\n19, were among a group of ten prospective jurors who responded\r\nduring voir dire to questions concerning sexual abuse committed on\r\nthemselves, a family member or a friend.  The district court\r\nexcluded five of these jurors for cause because they stated they\r\ncould not be impartial.  The district court also excused three\r\nadditional jurors for cause even though they either claimed that\r\nthey could be impartial or professed uncertainty regarding their\r\nimpartiality.  The record reflects that the judge did not believe\r\nthese three jurors after assessing their demeanor.\r\nIn contrast, juror number 19 stated that although she had\r\nbeen sexually molested in the past, she did not think it would\r\ninterfere with her ability to be fair and impartial.  The juror\r\nstated that the incident had occurred a long time ago, and she had\r\nnot filed a complaint or gone through a trial.  When asked, \"Will\r\nit in any way bias you against the defendant in this case?\" she\r\nresponded, \"no.\"  Lowe's counsel challenged juror number 19 for\r\ncause, but the district court refused to strike the juror because\r\n\"[u]nlike the . . . two other women who were just in front of me\r\nwho appeared so visibly upset, she didn't.  She seemed to be able\r\nto put it aside, she said she'd be fair and impartial.\"\r\nJuror number 18 stated that she had a friend who had been\r\nbeaten and raped about 35 years ago and that the juror had been the\r\nvictim of an attempted rape about 40 years ago.  The juror said she\r\ndid not report her own case or go through a trial.  The judge asked\r\nwhether her experiences would in any way interfere with her ability\r\nto serve on the jury, she replied \"I don't think so.\"  The juror\r\nalso responded \"no\" to a question whether she would hold any bias\r\nagainst the defendant.  When Lowe's counsel moved to excuse this\r\njuror, the judge responded, \"I'm not going to excuse her based on\r\nmy evaluation of her demeanor that she could be fair and impartial. \r\nAnd I view her as credible.  It was a long time ago, 35, 40 years\r\nago.\"  Since the district court denied his motions to strike jurors\r\nnumber 18 and 19 for cause, defense counsel used two peremptory\r\nchallenges to exclude these jurors.\r\nWe find that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in denying Lowe's motions.  \"There are few aspects of a\r\njury trial where we would be less inclined to disturb a trial\r\njudge's exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling\r\non challenges for cause in the empaneling of a jury.\"  Gonzlez-\r\nSoberal, 109 F.3d at 69-70 (quoting United States v. McCarthy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581510\"><a href=\"/opinion/581510/united-states-v-william-e-mccarthy-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 976 (1st Cir. 1992)).  In the instant case, the judge\r\nasked each juror several questions regarding their experiences with\r\nsexual abuse to ascertain any potential bias.  We decline to\r\nsecond-guess the district court's determination that jurors number\r\n18 and 19 could be impartial at trial because \"[i]t is the\r\nfundamental task of the district court judge to make this sort of\r\ndistinction.\"  Cambara, 902 F.2d at 148.  The trial judge is in the\r\nbest position to assess a potential juror's credibility by\r\nobserving her demeanor, reaction to questioning, and overall\r\nbehavior on the stand.  Moreover, nothing in the record suggests\r\nthat the district court judge lacked judgment or was prejudiced\r\ntoward Lowe.  Cf. Gonzlez-Soberal, 109 F.3d at 70.\r\nBecause the district court did not abuse its discretion\r\nin denying the defendant's motions to exclude jurors number 18 and\r\n19 for cause, we need not reach the question whether Lowe's use of\r\ntwo of his peremptory challenges for these jurors mandates\r\nreversal.\r\nB.   Jury Exposure to Prejudicial Facts\r\nLowe contends that he was denied a fair trial because the\r\njury was presented with prejudicial facts not in evidence during\r\nvoir dire and the government's closing argument.  He argues that,\r\nduring voir dire, the jury was made aware of his pretrial escape\r\nfrom the Wyatt Detention Facility when the district court asked the\r\nentire panel of potential jurors, \"[H]as anyone read or heard\r\nanything about an escape involved in this case from a Rhode Island\r\njail?\"\r\nIt was well within the district court's discretion to\r\nprobe prospective jurors about the escape or any other pretrial\r\npublicity to uncover any bias.  Lowe himself moved for individual\r\nvoir dire on the issue of pretrial publicity.  \"When pretrial\r\npublicity threatens to impede selection of an unbiased jury, the\r\ntrial judge must take extra care to ensure that the particular\r\njurors selected do not come to the trial with preconceived notions\r\nabout the defendant's guilt.\"  See United States v. Samalot Prez,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454790\"><a href=\"/opinion/454790/united-states-v-carlos-a-samalot-perez-and-enrique-ramos-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir. 1985).  The district court, in fact,\r\nexcused two prospective jurors for cause because they said they\r\ncould not be fair and impartial due to publicity concerning the\r\nescape.  Another juror was excused because of publicity about the\r\ncase generally.\r\nOn the record, we see no specific proof that pretrial\r\npublicity either tainted the trial process or prejudiced jurors. \r\nOnly one of the deliberating jurors, juror number 28, had heard\r\nabout the case, and had done so over a year prior to the voir dire. \r\nThe district court asked this juror, among other questions, whether\r\nhe could put aside what he had heard on the news and decide the\r\ncase on the evidence.  The juror responded, \"Yes, I think so.\"  The\r\njuror also said that he was sure he could be fair and impartial. \r\nIndeed, Lowe's counsel did not move to excuse juror number 28 for\r\ncause.\r\nLowe also contends that the government's statement in\r\nclosing argument that \"K talked to Sweetser and she told her\r\neverything\" denied him the right to a fair trial.  The defendant's\r\ncounsel objected to this statement during side bar conference since\r\nK did not testify that she had told the nurse everything.  He then\r\nrequested an instruction that the jurors' deliberations should be\r\ncontrolled by their own memories of what happened.  While the\r\ndistrict court did not issue an immediate curative instruction,\r\nwhich is a practice we regularly encourage to dispel potential\r\nprejudice, see United States v. Rivera-Gmez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705988\"><a href=\"/opinion/705988/united-states-v-luis-raul-rivera-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 999 (1st\r\nCir. 1995), the judge stated during her charge to the jury:\r\n     There are certain things I want to\r\n  emphasize that are not evidence in this\r\n  case.  The first is, the opening\r\n  statements and the closing arguments made\r\n  by the lawyers are not evidence in this\r\n  case . . . .  In the final analysis, it's\r\n  your own recollection and your own\r\n  interpretation of the evidence that\r\n  controls in this case. . . .\r\n     Don't speculate about what was\r\n  redacted.  You will see the word \"redacted\"\r\n  when it was redacted, and you won't see\r\n  the word when the portions of the form are\r\n  simply blank.\r\n\nTranscript at 9:104-105.\r\nIn oral argument as well as in its brief, the government\r\nadmitted to inaccurately restating trial testimony when it made the\r\nchallenged comment.  In assessing whether improper statements\r\nduring closing argument require a new trial, we examine (1) whether\r\nthe prosecutor's conduct was isolated and/or deliberate; (2)\r\nwhether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary\r\ninstruction; and (3) whether it is likely that any prejudice\r\nsurviving the judge's instruction could have affected the outcome\r\nof the case.  See United States v. Hodge-Balwing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574885\"><a href=\"/opinion/574885/united-states-v-saver-hodge-balwing-aka-balwin-hodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610\r\n(1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Boldt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558024\"><a href=\"/opinion/558024/united-states-v-david-w-boldt/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\r\n1991).  We see no deliberate attempt on the government's part to\r\nmislead the jury with its stray comment.  During side bar, the\r\nprosecutor acknowledged that her memory of K.'s testimony may have\r\nbeen incorrect.  In addition, as previously mentioned, the\r\ngovernment was forthright in oral argument and in its brief in\r\nrecognizing its error.  It appears that the government made an\r\nhonest mistake rather than a deliberate one.\r\nWe also find that the district court's curative\r\ninstruction adequately addressed Lowe's concerns regarding the\r\ngovernment's misstatement.  The district court emphasized to the\r\njurors that any statement during the closing was not evidence and\r\nthat their interpretation of the evidence presented during trial\r\nshould control their decision.  While Lowe claims that the mistaken\r\nreference could have related to redacted parts of the hospital\r\nrecords, the district court specifically admonished the jury not to\r\nconsider any redacted portions of the record.  The court properly\r\naccounted for any possible prejudice from the government's remark. \r\nUnder these circumstances, we find no reversible error.\r\nC.   Evidentiary Rulings\r\nLowe opposes the admission of DNA evidence as well as\r\nevidence of his involvement in a car crash prior to the alleged\r\nrape.  In addition, he contests the sufficiency of evidence  used\r\nto convict him of kidnapping.  We review a district court's\r\ndecision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.  See United\r\nStates v. Alzanki, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196113\"><a href=\"/opinion/196113/united-states-v-alzanki/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1008 (1st Cir. 1995).  We engage in\r\nde novo review of claims of insufficient evidence.  See United\r\nStates v. Ruiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197202\"><a href=\"/opinion/197202/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1494 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nWith respect to the admissibility of the DNA evidence, we\r\naffirm on the grounds stated in the district court's well-written\r\nmemorandum and order on this issue.  See United States v. Lowe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Mass. 1996).  We write only to note the following. \r\nSince Lowe admitted to having sex with K., he contends that the\r\nprejudicial impact of the DNA evidence far outweighs its probative\r\nvalue on the issue of identity.  However, as the district court\r\nobserved, the evidence \"was probative not only on the issue of\r\nidentity but also on the location of the alleged rape.\"  Id. at\r\n408, n.8.  Thus, the district court found that, under Fed. R. Evid.\r\n403, \"[i]ts probative value was not substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\r\nthe jury.\"  Id.  On appeal, we afford a trial court's construction\r\nof a Rule 403 balancing substantial discretion.  See Veranda Beach\r\nClub Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563774\"><a href=\"/opinion/563774/veranda-beach-club-limited-partnership-v-western-surety-co-frg-ventures/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1372 (1st\r\nCir. 1991).  Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's determination.\r\nThe defendant also challenges the admission of evidence\r\nof his involvement in a car ramming incident hours prior to his\r\nencountering K. in her driveway.  Lowe asserts that the evidence\r\nshould have been excluded as prior bad acts evidence under Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 404(b) and 403.  Rule 404(b) provides:\r\n  Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\r\n  is not admissible to prove the character\r\n  of a person in order to show action in\r\n  conformity therewith.  It may, however, be\r\n  admissible for other purposes such as\r\n  proof of motive, opportunity, intent\r\n  preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\r\n  absence of mistake or accident . . . .\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 404(b).  In the instant case, the district court\r\nadmitted the car ramming evidence as probative of his desire for\r\nsex and of his motive for committing carjacking.\r\nLowe argues that the evidence did not have any relevance\r\nto his desire for sex because he conceded having sex with K.  To\r\nprevent the admission of bad acts evidence, a defendant's offer to\r\nconcede knowledge and/or intent issues must: (1) express a clear\r\nand unequivocal intention to remove the issue such that, in effect\r\nif not in form, it constitutes an offer to stipulate, and (2) the\r\nconcession must cover the necessary substantive ground to remove\r\nthe issue from the case.  See United States v. Garca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598972\"><a href=\"/opinion/598972/united-states-v-jose-a-garcia-united-states-v-pablo-h-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1174 (1st Cir. 1993).  Lowe's concession fails to satisfy the\r\nsecond prong of this test.  Evidence that is probative of Lowe's\r\ndesire for sex is also relevant to show motive and intent to commit\r\nkidnapping and interstate transportation for illegal sexual\r\nactivity. However, the defendant conceded to nothing more than\r\nhaving consensual sex with K.  He did not concede the element of\r\nintent required to prove kidnapping and the Mann Act offense. \r\nThus, the fact that Lowe admitted to having sex with K. did not\r\nremove the issue of intent from the case.\r\nThe district court also properly admitted the car-ramming\r\nevidence as probative of Lowe's motive and intent to carjack.  The\r\nevidence showed that Lowe damaged his truck in the ramming, and the\r\npolice then towed the truck.  The jury could have inferred from the\r\nevidence that the defendant needed to procure another vehicle to\r\nevade the Lowell police who were searching for him.\r\nLastly, despite Lowe's arguments to the contrary, the\r\nprobative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by\r\nthe risk of unfair prejudice under Rule 403.  In its jury\r\ninstructions on the challenged evidence, the district court warned:\r\n  The only use you may make of Mr. Lowe's\r\n  involvement in the car crash is to\r\n  determine whether he had the intent to\r\n  commit the offenses charged in the\r\n  indictment.\r\n\n  You are free to determine that Mr. Lowe's\r\n  alleged involvement in the car crash is\r\n  not probative of his intent to commit the\r\n  offense with which he is charged.  You may\r\n  not consider evidence of the car crash as\r\n  a substitute for proof that the defendant\r\n  committed the offenses charged, nor may\r\n  you consider evidence of the car crash as\r\n  proof that the defendant has a propensity\r\n  to engage in criminal acts or has a bad\r\n  character.\r\n\nTranscript at 9:112-113.  Here, the district court minimized the\r\npotential for prejudice by telling the jury explicitly not to draw\r\nthe forbidden inference.  Cf. United States v. Tuesta-Toro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195508\"><a href=\"/opinion/195508/united-states-v-tuesta-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding potential for prejudice minimized\r\nby contemporaneous jury instruction which was reiterated in final\r\ncharge).  Thus, we find no error.\r\nLowe's final evidentiary challenge relates to the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence to convict him of kidnapping K.  Lowe\r\nargues that since kidnapping is coextensive with the Mann Act,\r\nwhich also requires transportation or confinement, the district\r\ncourt may not convict him of kidnapping if the degree of\r\ntransportation or confinement imposed to commit the kidnapping is\r\nno greater than that required for the Mann Act, citing Government\r\nof Virgin Islands v. Berry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369086\"><a href=\"/opinion/369086/government-of-the-virgin-islands-v-warren-p-berry-appeal-of-warren/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227 (3d Cir. 1979);\r\nUnited States v.

See United States v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481044\"><a href=\"/opinion/481044/united-states-v-bryant-jones-curtis-young-and-donnis-glen-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566 (7th Cir.\r\n1986); United States v.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1550131\"><a href=\"/opinion/1550131/seadlund-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 747 (7th Cir. 1938).  It is irrelevant that the kidnapping may\r\nhave been incidental to the Mann Act offense as long as the\r\ngovernment proved the elements of the kidnapping charge.\r\nFor the kidnapping charge, the government needed to show\r\nthat Lowe knowingly and willfully seized, abducted, or confined K.,\r\ntransported her in interstate commerce, and held her for \"ransom,\r\nreward or otherwise.\"  See 18 U.S.C.  1201.  The term \"otherwise\"\r\ncan include sexual gratification.  See United States v. Sriyuth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728091\"><a href=\"/opinion/728091/united-states-v-nopporn-sriyuth-aka-thi-nopporn-sriyuth/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746-47 (3d Cir. 1996).  The Mann Act required the\r\ngovernment to prove that the defendant knowingly and willfully\r\ntransported K. in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution\r\nor any other illegal sexual activity.  See 18 U.S.C.  2421. \r\nConsent is a defense to kidnapping but not to a Mann Act charge. \r\nSee Jones, 808 F.2d at 565.\r\nOn the record, we find sufficient evidence of the\r\nelements of kidnapping.  In evaluating the sufficiency of evidence\r\nunderlying a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the prosecution.  See Ruiz, 105 F.3d at 1494.  The\r\nevidence shows that Lowe took and carried away K. against her will\r\nand held her for over six hours.  During the course of the\r\nabduction, Lowe forced K. to travel with him from Massachusetts to\r\nNew Hampshire and back.  In addition, he forced her to perform oral\r\nsex on him as well as raping her vaginally.  The government firmly\r\nestablished the elements of the kidnapping charge, and therefore,\r\nwe affirm the conviction.\r\nD.   Appeal of Carjacking Sentence\r\nLowe appeals his 25-year sentence under 18 U.S.C.\r\n2119(2), which enhances the 15-year sentence under  2119(1) \"if\r\nserious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 of this title)\r\nresults\" from the commission of a carjacking.  Lowe asserts that\r\nthe shorter sentence applies, arguing that K. did not suffer\r\nserious bodily injury as defined in the statute, and that even if\r\nthe rape constitutes serious bodily injury, the rape is outside the\r\ncoverage of the statute because it did not result from the force,\r\nviolence and intimidation used to take the car.\r\nSection 1365(g)(3) provides that \"serious bodily injury\"\r\nmeans bodily injury which involves:\r\n(A) a substantial risk of death;\r\n(B) extreme physical pain; \r\n(C) protracted and obvious disfigurement; or \r\n(D) protracted loss or impairment of the function of a\r\nbodily member, organ, or mental faculty . . . \r\n\n18 U.S.C.  1365(g)(3).  After reviewing the record, the district\r\ncourt determined that K. suffered \"protracted . . . impairment of\r\n. . . mental facult[ies].\"  During trial, nearly 10 months after\r\nthe crime, the court noted that K. was \"extremely tearful through\r\nparts of her testimony, particularly when she [was] looking in the\r\ndefendant's direction,\" and that she was in a \"fragile\" state.  The\r\nrecord reflects, inter alia, that K. underwent at least 10 months\r\nof counseling at a rape crisis center.  The district court properly\r\nenhanced Lowe's carjacking sentence.  The record amply demonstrates\r\nthat, as a direct consequence of the rape, K. suffered serious and\r\ncontinuing mental trauma, constituting a \"protracted . . .\r\nimpairment of . . . mental facult[ies]\" under  1365(g)(3).  Cf.\r\nUnited States v. Vzquez-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197770\"><a href=\"/opinion/197770/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177-78 (1st Cir.\r\n1998) (holding that persistent psychological trauma resulting from\r\nrape qualified as protracted impairment of mental faculties, and\r\ntherefore, as \"serious bodily injury\").\r\nWith respect to Lowe's claim that the rape was not the\r\nresult of the carjacking, we find our recent decision in Vzquez-\r\nRivera, 135 F.3d at 178, dispositive.  The defendant in that case,\r\nwho also raped his carjacking victim, raised a similar argument. \r\nHowever, we determined that \"the choice of the word 'results' in\r\nthe statutory phrase 'if serious bodily injury . . . results'\r\nsuggests that Congress intended to cover a fairly broad range of\r\nconsequences flowing from a carjacking.\"  Id.  In addition, we\r\nnoted that \"the legislative history characterized the provision as\r\nimposing the enhancement when the carjacking 'involves bodily\r\ninjury,' . . . which supports the view that the injuries covered\r\nare not limited to those resulting from the 'taking' of a vehicle,\r\nbut also include those caused by the carjacker at any point during\r\nhis or her retention of the vehicle.\"  Id. (internal citations\r\nomitted).  Accordingly, we conclude that the carjacking resulted in\r\nserious bodily injury.\r\n              III.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant's conviction is\r\naffirmed.\n</pre>",
