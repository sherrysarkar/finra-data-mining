Section 440(c)  of the  Antiterrorism and\r                            \r\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110\r\n\nStat. 1214,  1277 (Apr. 24,  1996) (AEDPA), provides  for the\r\n\nmandatory  detention of certain categories of criminal aliens\r\n\npending  deportation proceedings.   The  district  court here\r\n\ndetermined  that   440(c) did not apply to those aliens, such\r\n\nas  petitioner,  who had  been  convicted  and released  from\r\n\nincarceration prior to AEDPA's effective date.  See DeMelo v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCobb, 936 F. Supp.  30 (D. Mass. 1996).   Respondents, having\r                \r\n\nappealed from this ruling, now suggest  that their appeal has\r\n\nbecome  moot in  light of  the  intervening enactment  of the\r\n\nIllegal Immigration  Reform and Immigrant  Responsibility Act\r\n\nof 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996)\r\n\n(IIRIRA).   As a result, they request that the district court\r\n\norder be  vacated \"to the extent it  relies on a finding that\r\n\nsection  440(c) of the AEDPA  is inapplicable,\" and also that\r\n\nthe case be remanded for further proceedings.  Petitioner has\r\n\nfiled no opposition.\r\n\n     We agree that the advent of IIRIRA has rendered moot the\r\n\nquestion  of  whether  AEDPA's mandatory-detention  provision\r\n\napplies  here--the sole  issue raised  on appeal.   With  the\r\n\nimplementation of the \"transition period  custody rules,\" see\r                                                                         \r\n\nIIRIRA   303(b)(3), section  440(c) of AEDPA has specifically\r\n\nbeen  rendered inoperative  during  the interim  period,  see\r                                                                         \r\n\nIIRIRA   303(b)(2); the  question of AEDPA's applicability is\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthus no longer in  contention.  In so concluding,  we express\r\n\nno opinion  as  to whether  IIRIRA's  transitional  rules--as\r\n\nopposed to the rules  governing detention under the pre-AEDPA\r\n\nregime, to the extent they might differ--apply to petitioner.\r\n\n     We  likewise  agree that  it  is  appropriate under  the\r\n\ncircumstances  to vacate  the district  court's order  to the\r\n\nextent  it relies  on a  finding  that    440(c) of  AEDPA is\r\n\ninapplicable.
