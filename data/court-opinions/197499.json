In this diversity action,\r\n\nplaintiffs-appellants sued defendants-appellees for injuries\r\n\nsustained after receiving facial collagen injections from defendant\r\n\nBertha Montesinos. Plaintiffs filed their complaint nearly four\r\n\nyears after receiving the injurious injections. The district court\r\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of both defendants (Montesinos\r\n\nand Collagen Corporation), holding that all of plaintiffs' claims\r\n\nwere barred by the one-year Puerto Rico statute of limitation\r\n\napplicable to tort actions. 935 F. Supp. 71 (D.P.R. 1996). We\r\n\nreverse and remand with directions, as explained.\r\n\n                       I. Issues Presented\r\n\n          The principal legal issues in dispute in this case\r\n\nconcern limitation of tort actions under the law of Puerto Rico.\r\n\nMore precisely, the dispute centers on the meaning of statutory\r\n\nprovisions and opinions of courts of Puerto Rico interpreting them,\r\n\nparticularly with respect to levels of awareness of injury, source\r\n\nof injury, causal connection, and legal responsibility.\r\n\n          To what extent is the running of the statutory time limit\r\n\nof one year for the filing of tort actions for damages affected by\r\n\nlack of awareness of injury, a connection between injury and the\r\n\npersonal services or other conduct of a person, and legal\r\n\nresponsibility for the injury?\r\n\n          To what extent is the running of the statutory time limit\r\n\nof one year affected by lack of awareness of a connection between\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ninjury and a product of a manufacturer or other supplier of the\r\n\nproduct?\r\n\n          To what extent is the running of the limitation period\r\n\naffected by the representations of the person who caused the\r\n\ninjury, or of third persons, regarding the nature and source of a\r\n\nplaintiff's injury?\r\n\n          Answers to these questions must be determined as matters\r\n\nof law. Accordingly, this court reviews the district court's\r\n\nrulings on these issues de novo.\r\n\n          The matters of law we are deciding, of course, are\r\n\nmatters of the law of Puerto Rico. Both in the district court and\r\n\nin this court on appeal, the determination of these questions of\r\n\nlaw does not involve any discretion to fashion rules of law.\r\n\nInstead, our objective is solely to determine what is the law as\r\n\nindicated by authoritative sources. Primary among these\r\n\n\"authoritative sources\" are the plainly expressed holdings of the\r\n\nhighest court of Puerto Rico.   See, e.g.,  Daigle v. Maine \r                                                                       Med.\r\n\nCtr.,  \r                Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 689 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that in\r\n\napplying state law, a federal court is \"absolutely bound by a\r\n\ncurrent interpretation of that law formulated by the state's\r\n\nhighest tribunal\"). Where a jurisdiction's highest court has not\r\n\nspoken on a precise issue of law, we look to \"analogous state court\r\n\ndecisions, persuasive adjudications by courts of sister states,\r\n\nlearned treatises, and public policy considerations identified in\r\n\nstate decisional law\" in order to make an \"informed prophecy\" of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nhow the state court would rule on the precise issue.  Blinzler v.\r\n\nMarriott Int'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n    II. Puerto Rico Law Regarding the Statute of Limitation\r\n\nA. An Overview\r\n\n          The Puerto Rico statute of limitation for tort actions\r\n\nprovides for a one-year limitation period that begins to run from\r\n\n\"the time the aggrieved person has knowledge of the injury.\" P.R.\r\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31, S 5298 (1994). Plaintiff bears the burden of\r\n\nproving when the \"damage\" became known.    Rivera \r                                                            Encarnacion v.\r\n\nComm. of Puerto Rico\r                             , 113 P.R. Dec. 383, 385, 13 P.R. Offic. Trans.\r\n\n498, 501 (1982).\r\n\n          What is it that one must know in order to have \"knowledge\r\n\nof the injury?\" The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has stated that\r\n\na plaintiff will be deemed to have \"knowledge\" of the injury, for\r\n\npurposes of the statute of limitation, when she has \"notice of the\r\n\ninjury, plus notice of the person who caused it.\" Colon Prieto\r                                                                         v.\r\n\nGeigel, 115 P.R.

Parke Davis &amp; Co., 833 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n          \"Notice of the injury,\" as explained in a later case, is\r\n\nestablished by proof of:\r\n\n            some outward or physical signs through\r\n            which the aggrieved party may become aware\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            and realize that he [or she] has suffered\r\n            an injurious aftereffect, which when known\r\n            becomes a damage even if at the time its\r\n            full scope and extent cannot be weighed.\r\n            These circumstances need not be known in\r\n            order to argue that the damage has become\r\n            known, because its scope, extent and\r\n            weight may be established later on during\r\n            the prosecution of the remedial action.\r\n\nDelgado Rodriguez\r                           v. \r                              Nazario de Ferrer\r                                               , No. CE-86-417, slip op. at\r\n\n10 (Official English Translation) (P.R. May 16, 1988) (quoting H.\r\n\nBrau del Toro, \r                        Los Danos y Perjuicios Extracontractuales en Puerto\r\n\nRico 639-40, Pub. J.T.S., Inc. (2d ed. 1986)) (internal quotation\r\n\nmarks omitted). Once a plaintiff is on \"notice of the injury,\" the\r\n\nplaintiff may \"not wait for his [or her] injury to reach its final\r\n\ndegree of development and postpone the running of the period of\r\n\nlimitation according to his [or her] subjective appraisal and\r\n\njudgment.\"  Ortiz v. Municipality of Orocovis, 113 P.R. Dec. 484,\r\n\n487, 13 P.R. Offic. Trans. 619, 622 (1982).\r\n\n          In some circumstances, awareness of the existence of an\r\n\ninjury, on its own, will not be enough to trigger the running of\r\n\nthe limitation period. See, \r                                      e.g., \r                                            Galarza v. \r                                                       Zagury, 739 F.2d 20,\r\n\n24 (1st Cir. 1984) (stating that \"knowledge of the author of the\r\n\nharm means more than an awareness of some ill effects resulting\r\n\nfrom an operation by a particular doctor\"). If a plaintiff is not\r\n\naware of some level of reasonable likelihood of legal liability on\r\n\nthe part of the person or entity that caused the injury, the\r\n\nstatute of limitation will be tolled. In other words, a plaintiff\r\n\nmust also have \"knowledge of the author of the injury,\" a concept\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\narticulated at length in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's\r\n\ndecision in Colon Prieto. \r\n\n          In Colon  \r                              Prieto, the plaintiff experienced pain and\r\n\ninsensitivity in his tongue following dental surgery in November\r\n\n1971. 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 317. Geigel, the dental surgeon,\r\n\ntold plaintiff that he had bitten himself on the tongue and that\r\n\nthe symptoms would subside in a short while. \r                                                      Id. For over a year,\r\n\nColon Prieto continued to see Geigel, who told him that the pain\r\n\nwould go away. Id. But the symptoms did not subside. In November\r\n\n1972, plaintiff consulted with another physician, and learned for\r\n\nthe first time that the pain was the result of Geigel's having cut\r\n\na nerve during the initial operation.\r\n\n          Colon Prieto brought suit against Geigel on September 10,\r\n\n1973, more than one year after the original operation. Geigel\r\n\nasserted the statute of limitation as a defense. The Supreme Court\r\n\nof Puerto Rico rejected Geigel's defense, holding that, because\r\n\nColon Prieto did not acquire knowledge of the nature of his injury\r\n\nand Geigel's role in the injury until the November 1972\r\n\nconsultation with the other doctor, plaintiff was not barred under\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico statute of limitation.\r\n\n          Distinguishing Colon Prieto's case from the more\r\n\ntraditional tort case in which a plaintiff is aware from the moment\r\n\nof the tortious act of the injury and its cause (for example, where\r\n\na defendant's act causes something to fall on a plaintiff\r\n\nimmediately), the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico observed that the\r\n\nstatutory phrase \"'\r                            from the time the aggrieved person had knowledge\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthereof' ... rejects a literal and narrow reading.\"  Id. at 327.\r\n\nThe court noted that the legal reasoning behind a plaintiff's loss\r\n\nof rights under a statute of limitation is that the plaintiff is\r\n\ndeemed to have abandoned those rights.   Id. (quoting A. Borrell\r\n\nMacia, \r                Responsabilidades Derivadas de Culpa Extracontractual Civil\r                                                                          ,\r\n\n66, Barcelona, Ed. Bosch (2d ed. 1958)). In order for this legal\r\n\nreasoning to apply, therefore, \"such abandonment [on the part of\r\n\nthe plaintiff] should really exist.\"  Id.\r\n\nB. Three Analytically Separable Questions\r\n\n          We conclude that within the larger structure regarding\r\n\nthe law of Puerto Rico on limitation of tort actions are three\r\n\nanalytically separable subsidiary issues. These issues concern the\r\n\ncircumstances in which a plaintiff can be said to have, or to lack,\r\n\nthe requisite level of awareness for statute of limitation\r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n          First, the concept of \"true knowledge\" applies where a\r\n\nplaintiff is actually aware of all the necessary facts and the\r\n\nexistence of a likelihood of a legal cause of action. Second,\r\n\nconcepts of \"notice\" and \"deemed knowledge\" apply. Under these\r\n\nconcepts a plaintiff's subjective awareness is measured against the\r\n\nlevel of awareness that the plaintiff, having been put on notice as\r\n\nto certain facts and having exercised reasonable care regarding a\r\n\npotential claim, should have acquired. Third, the law or Puerto\r\n\nRico recognizes an exception to applicability of the concepts of\r\n\nnotice and deemed knowledge for circumstances in which a\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nplaintiff's failure to make a timely filing of a claim is\r\n\nreasonably based upon the assurances of the person who caused the\r\n\ninjury.\r\n\n          From a structural perspective, two of these questions\r\n\n(about true knowledge and deemed knowledge) concern alternative\r\n\nways in which a defendant may establish that a claim is barred\r\n\nbecause it is filed too late. If the defendant succeeds in showing\r\n\nthat plaintiff has not satisfied, or cannot satisfy, plaintiff's\r\n\nburden of proving lack of true knowledge (that is, lack of full\r\n\nawareness of all that need be known to preclude tolling), final\r\n\njudgment for the defendant on the ground of late filing is\r\n\nappropriate.\r\n\n          If, instead, the finder of fact finds (or the court, by\r\n\ndetermining that the evidence of record is so one-sided as to\r\n\ncompel a finding) that the plaintiff was aware of enough facts to\r\n\nconstitute notice and to satisfy the deemed knowledge rule of the\r\n\nPuerto Rico law of limitation of tort actions, final judgment for\r\n\nthe defendant on the ground of late filing is appropriate  unless\r\n\nplaintiff has proffered evidence sufficient to support a finding\r\n\nthat representations and assurances by the defendant persuaded\r\n\nplaintiff to rely reasonably and delay institution of a civil\r\n\naction.\r\n\n          The \"unless\" clause in the next preceding sentence may be\r\n\ntreated either as a condition to be satisfied before the deemed\r\n\nknowledge rule applies, or as a negation of an otherwise adequate\r\n\nshowing of applicability of the deemed knowledge rule. Under\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\neither analytic treatment of the substantive requirement of the\r\n\nlegal test for deemed knowledge, this substantive requirement is\r\n\nthe third of the analytically separable issues to which we referred\r\n\nabove. It creates another possibility of a plaintiff's showing\r\n\nthat a genuine dispute of material fact precludes a judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of law for the defendant on the limitation ground.\r\n\n          1. Full Awareness:\r                                        \r                                        A Subjective Component of the Legal\r\n          Test\r\n\n          In circumstances where a plaintiff has not abandoned a\r\n\ncause of action, but instead was never aware that such a cause of\r\n\naction existed, the statute of limitation would not operate as a\r\n\nbar to the exercise of the plaintiff's legal rights.   See  Colon\r\n\nPrieto, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 327-328. As the court noted in\r\n\nColon \r                Prieto, a plaintiff who is not aware of the existence of a\r\n\ncause of action is essentially incapable of bringing suit within\r\n\nthe limitation period.     Id. at 327. The emphasis on the\r\n\nplaintiff's \"subjective\" ability to bring suit is justified, at\r\n\nleast in part, by the brevity of the limitation period.   Id. at\r\n\n328.\r\n\n          Reasoning from these premises, the Supreme Court of\r\n\nPuerto Rico held that, in order for the limitation period to start\r\n\nto run, a plaintiff must be able to institute suit, which requires\r\n\nknowledge of the existence of an injury and knowledge of the person\r\n\nwho caused the injury. Knowledge of who caused the injury, the\r\n\ncourt held, was necessary so that the plaintiff would know whom to\r\n\nsue.  Id. at 330 (quoting I A. Barrell y Soler,    Derecho \r                                                                      Civil\r\n\nEspanol 500, Barcelona, Ed. Bosch (1955)). \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          In setting forth this standard, the court in \r                                                               Colon Prieto\r\n\nstated that it was adopting a \"subjective\" standard.  Id. at 328.\r\n\nIn the law of Puerto Rico, a legal test of this kind is sometimes\r\n\nreferred to as grounded in the \"cognitive\" theory of damages. \r                                                                       See,\r\n\ne.g., Barretto Peat, 896 F.2d at 657 (describing S 5298 of Puerto\r\n\nRico's Civil Code as codifying the cognitive theory).\r\n\n          To understand this component of the applicable legal\r\n\ntest, for the purpose of applying it to the case now before us, we\r\n\nmust understand what level of awareness is required as to\r\n\nparticulars of the injury and its source. Was the source in\r\n\npersonal services, or in some other form of conduct of some\r\n\nidentifiable person, or in a product used or supplied by some\r\n\nperson and obtained through a chain of distribution involving one\r\n\nor more others, including a manufacturer?\r\n\n          Under the law of Puerto Rico, the plaintiff's level of\r\n\nawareness about these matters may be relevant in more than a single\r\n\nway, bearing upon more than a single sub-issue.\r\n\n            First. What effect is to be given to evidence, if\r\n\ncreditworthy, of the effect that post-injury conduct of a person\r\n\nwho was a cause of the injury, or post-injury conduct of other\r\n\npersons, had on plaintiff's refraining from or delaying instituting\r\n\nsuit?\r\n\n          Second. What more would the plaintiff have learned about\r\n\nthe injury and authorship of the injury if the plaintiff, having\r\n\nnotice in the sense of awareness of some facts, had then made the\r\n\ninquiries that a careful person would have made?\r\n\n                              -10-\r\r\n\n          2. Notice and Deemed Knowledge:\r                                                    \r                                                    The Objective Component\r\n\n          We understand the court in  Colon \r                                                       Prieto to have been\r\n\nspeaking quite explicitly to the second of these two questions\r\n\n(stated immediately above) in the passage of the opinion noting\r\n\nthat, if a plaintiff's ignorance of an injury and its origin was\r\n\ndue to the plaintiff's own negligence or lack of care, then the\r\n\nstatute of limitation would not be tolled.  See Colon \r                                                                Prieto, 15\r\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. at 327-29 (quoting A. Borrell Macia,\r\n\nResponsabilidades Derivadas de Culpa Extracontractual Civil\r                                                                    344-345\r\n\n(Bosch ed. 2d ed. 1958)). This point is associated with the level\r\n\nof awareness implicit in the concept of notice. \r\n\n          The law of Puerto Rico treats a person as being aware of\r\n\nall that, having awareness constituting notice, that person would\r\n\nhave been likely to come to know through the exercise of care.\r\n\nThus, we understand the holdings of Puerto Rico decisions to mean\r\n\nthat \"actual knowledge is not required where, by due diligence,\r\n\nsuch knowledge would likely have been acquired.\" Villarini-Garcia\r\n\nv. Hospital del Maestro, Inc., 8 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir. 1993). It\r\n\nfollows, then, that to determine the point at which a plaintiff\r\n\nshould be held responsible for the required level of awareness of\r\n\nwhether another particular person was an author of the injury, a\r\n\ncourt looks to \"whether plaintiff knew or with the degree of\r\n\ndiligence required by law would have known whom to sue.\" \r                                                                  Kaiser v.\r\n\nArmstrong  \r                    World  \r                           Indus., 872 F.2d 512, 516 (1st Cir. 1989)\r\n\n(citations and internal quotation omitted). \r\n\n                              -11-\r\r\n\n          Once a plaintiff is made aware of facts sufficient to put\r\n\nher on notice that she has a potential tort claim, she must pursue\r\n\nthat claim with reasonable diligence, or risk being held to have\r\n\nrelinquished her right to pursue it later, after the limitation\r\n\nperiod has run.  See, e.g., Villarini, 8 F.3d at 85.\r\n\n          In Villarini, a plaintiff was made aware of facts\r\n\nsufficient for her to be able to file suit (as to two of her\r\n\nclaims) three weeks after her operation. We held that the\r\n\nplaintiff was time-barred from bringing those claims roughly two\r\n\nand a half years later.  Id. We recognized in  Villarini that the\r\n\nplaintiff may not have understood fully the legal significance of\r\n\nthe facts known to her after her operation, but also recognized\r\n\nthat the meaning of authoritative declarations of the law of Puerto\r\n\nRico is that \"there is nothing unfair in a policy that insists that\r\n\nthe plaintiff promptly assert her rights.\" Id. Thus, plaintiff's\r\n\nfailure to consult with a lawyer or otherwise investigate the claim\r\n\nto which she had been alerted by the factual circumstances\r\n\nassociated with the operation barred her from commencing that claim\r\n\nin the courts over one year after being on notice.  Id.\r\n\n          Similarly, once a plaintiff is put on notice that someone\r\n\nor some entity is the cause of the injury, the plaintiff may not\r\n\nsucceed in a late-filed claim by asserting ignorance about the\r\n\nprecise identity of the tortfeasor. Also, because corporate\r\n\nidentities and intracorporate relationships are a matter of public\r\n\nrecord, knowledge of the precise corporate identity of the entity\r\n\nresponsible for a plaintiff's injury is not required before the\r\n\n                              -12-\r\r\n\nperiod prescribed by the statute of limitation begins to run. See\r\n\nHodge v. Parke Davis &amp; Co., 833 F.2d 6, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n          3.  An Exception to the Rule of Notice\r\n\n          An exception to the rule of notice (the objective\r\n\ncomponent of the law of limitation of tort actions) is recognized.\r\n\nIf a plaintiff's suspicions that she may have been the victim of a\r\n\ntort are assuaged by assurances made by the person who caused the\r\n\ninjury, a plaintiff will not be held responsible for failing to\r\n\npursue her claim more aggressively.  Colon Prieto, 15 P.R. Offic.\r\n\nTrans. at 329-330.\r\n\n          In addition to holdings discussed above (in explanation\r\n\nof both the subjective and the objective components of the law of\r\n\nPuerto Rico), the court in   Colon  \r                                              Prieto held that, where the\r\n\nplaintiff's doctor (the person responsible for causing the injury)\r\n\nassured the plaintiff that the pain was normal and was due to\r\n\nplaintiff's biting his tongue during the operation, the plaintiff\r\n\nwould not be held to have \"known\" of the injury and the cause until\r\n\nthe later consultation. This ruling, the court observed, was\r\n\n            the fairest and most equitable. We\r\n            safeguard the aggrieved party's right to\r\n            seek redress, while we abstain from\r\n            rewarding the person who, having caused\r\n            the damage, took refuge in his patient's\r\n            trust and ignorance trying to avail\r\n            himself of the circumstances in order to\r\n            defeat the action.\r\n\nId. at 330. \r\n\n          In this context, where a diligent plaintiff reasonably\r\n\nrelies upon representations made by a tortfeasor that her symptoms\r\n\nare not the result of a negligent or otherwise tortious act, that\r\n\n                              -13-\r\r\n\nplaintiff is not barred, because of her \"own negligence or lack of\r\n\ncare,\" from the benefit of tolling of the limitation period.  See\r\n\nColon  \r                Prieto, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 329-330.         See  \r                                                                       also\r\n\nVillarini, 8 F.3d at 85-86. Stated another way, the condition\r\n\nattached to a plaintiff's right of tolling -- the condition that\r\n\nshe act with care to make additional inquiries once she is on\r\n\nnotice -- does not apply (or is excused, or negated) when the\r\n\nplaintiff reasonably relies on what others told her. The reliance,\r\n\nhowever, must be reasonable, and the determination of the\r\n\nreasonableness of a plaintiff's reliance on the assurances of\r\n\nothers involves an evaluation that, depending upon the\r\n\ncircumstances, may or may not be a question for the finder of fact,\r\n\nand thus may or may not preclude summary judgment. See \r                                                                 id. at 86-\r\n\n87.\r\n\n          Where facts sufficient to support every element of a\r\n\nclaim relating to an injury are apparent to a plaintiff at an\r\n\nearlier time, it will not be reasonable for the plaintiff to rely\r\n\non assurances of a tortfeasor and fail to pursue the claim.   See\r\n\nid. at 86 (where plaintiff had all the information necessary for\r\n\na failure-to-warn claim, doctor's subsequent reassurances would not\r\n\nexcuse plaintiff's lack of diligence in pursuing the claim). Our\r\n\nholdings, moreover, support the conclusion that a time will come at\r\n\nwhich, if the tortfeasor's initial predictions are not borne out,\r\n\na plaintiff's reliance is no longer reasonable.    Id. Finally,\r\n\nrepresentations made by third-party doctors constitute another\r\n\nfactor to consider in determining whether a plaintiff's continued\r\n\n                              -14-\r\r\n\nreliance upon the reassurances of a tortfeasor is reasonable. See\r\n\nVillarini, 8 F.3d at 86 (holding that varying diagnoses of\r\n\ndifferent doctors, along with the reassurances of the negligent\r\n\nphysician, \"could have lulled a reasonable person into believing\r\n\nfor a year or more that the operation had not been botched\"). \r\n\nC. Summary\r\n\n          In sum, we conclude (1) that within the larger questions\r\n\nregarding the law of Puerto Rico on limitation of tort actions are\r\n\nthree analytically separable subsidiary questions; (2) that from a\r\n\nstructural perspective, two of these questions (about true\r\n\nknowledge and deemed knowledge) concern alternative ways a\r\n\ndefendant may establish that a claim is barred because filed too\r\n\nlate; (3) that, if on the evidence proffered in a case, a finder of\r\n\nfact might reasonably find that representations and assurances\r\n\npersuaded plaintiff to rely reasonably and delay institution of a\r\n\ncivil action, summary judgment for defendants would be\r\n\ninappropriate; and (4) that this remains true even if the record\r\n\nwould otherwise require judgment for defendant under the rule of\r\n\nnotice and deemed knowledge.\r\n\n                     III. Record for Review\r\n\nA. Factual Background\r\n\n          Collagen is a natural protein found throughout the body\r\n\nthat provides support to other bodily tissues, including the skin.\r\n\nSince the 1970s, collagen obtained from animals has been used in a\r\n\n                              -15-\r\r\n\nvariety of medical procedures, including procedures designed to\r\n\nimprove the consistency and appearance of the skin. Defendant\r\n\nCollagen Corporation manufactures and distributes at least two\r\n\ntypes of bovine collagen (derived from cows), called Zyderm and\r\n\nZyplast. Both can be injected under the skin to improve the\r\n\nappearance and structure of the skin. Collagen's products are\r\n\ndistributed only to be sold to and administered by licensed\r\n\nphysicians.\r\n\n          In 1989, each of the plaintiffs, Edna Rodriguez-Suris\r\n\n(\"Rodriguez\"), Maria Rosa Gonzalez San Juan de Cortes (\"Gonzalez\"),\r\n\nAnnette Perez de Pedreira (\"Pedreira\"), and Vanessa Perez de\r\n\nFernandez (\"Fernandez\"), received collagen injections from\r\n\ndefendant Bertha Montesinos. Montesinos, who was not a licensed\r\n\nphysician, obtained injectable collagen from a doctor in Miami,\r\n\nFlorida, and administered the injections at her apartment in\r\n\nSanturce, Puerto Rico. In each instance, Montesinos injected\r\n\ncollagen into the forehead (between the eyebrows) and along the\r\n\n\"expression lines\" surrounding the nose and lips of each of the\r\n\nplaintiffs. None of the plaintiffs saw the material that was\r\n\ninjected. In some instances, Montesinos provided the plaintiff\r\n\nwith a brochure describing cosmetic collagen treatments, but none\r\n\nof the plaintiffs saw Collagen Corporation product packaging or\r\n\ninserts. In the fall of 1989, Montesinos gave each of the\r\n\nplaintiffs a treatment involving injections. Shortly thereafter,\r\n\neach plaintiff developed hard red nodules or bumps at the sites of\r\n\nthe injections.\r\n\n                              -16-\r\r\n\n          In the following summary of the evidence of record with\r\n\nrespect to each plaintiff's history of treatment and consequences,\r\n\nwe state the evidence as a finder of fact might find by a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence, where any genuine dispute exists,\r\n\nsince our purpose is to determine whether summary judgment for\r\n\ndefendants is appropriate.\r\n\n          1.  Rodriguez\r\n\n          Plaintiff Rodriguez went to Montesinos for injections for\r\n\nthe third time in November 1989. Immediately after the treatment,\r\n\nRodriguez developed a redness, accompanied by a burning sensation,\r\n\naround the area of the injections. Although the burning sensation\r\n\nsubsided within a week, Rodriguez was left with a \"red, raised\r\n\nridge\" on both sides of her nose and mouth. Over the next two and\r\n\na half years, Rodriguez received three to four more collagen\r\n\ninjections from Montesinos, who assured her that the marks would\r\n\ngradually go away. The ridge, however, remained hard and did not\r\n\ndiminish in size. Rodriguez last saw Montesinos in March 1992.\r\n\n          Rodriguez spoke informally with two doctors about her\r\n\nproblem. In late November 1989, Rodriguez talked with Dr. Robert\r\n\nNevarez, a plastic surgeon, during a party they were both\r\n\nattending. Rodriguez told Dr. Nevarez that she had received\r\n\ncollagen injections and that the red marks were a reaction to the\r\n\ninjections. Dr. Nevarez said that he thought that the marks were\r\n\nan adverse reaction to collagen, but that they would go away.\r\n\nNevarez told Rodriguez to come to his office for a consultation,\r\n\nbut the plaintiff never followed up. At another social event some\r\n\n                              -17-\r\r\n\ntime between 1989 and 1992, but closer to 1989, Rodriguez talked\r\n\nwith Dr. Pedro Borras, a neurosurgeon, who told her that if the\r\n\nmarks were a reaction to collagen, then they would go away. \r\n\n          In September 1992, Rodriguez went to see Dr. Tolbert\r\n\nWilkinson in San Antonio, Texas, at which time, according to\r\n\nRodriguez, she first learned that the marks had been caused by\r\n\nproducts of defendant Collagen Corporation and would be permanent.\r\n\n          2.  Fernandez\r\n\n          Plaintiff Fernandez, sister of plaintiff Pedreira,\r\n\nreceived her third collagen injection treatment from Montesinos in\r\n\nOctober 1989. Fernandez did not see what was injected into her\r\n\nface. The evening after her third treatment, Fernandez noticed\r\n\n\"slightly raised and red\" marks in the places where she had been\r\n\ninjected. When the marks did not disappear as she expected,\r\n\nFernandez went to see Dr. David Latoni-Cabanillas, a dermatologist,\r\n\nin early 1990. Fernandez told Dr. Latoni that she received\r\n\ncollagen injections from Montesinos in the areas where she\r\n\ndeveloped the marks. Dr. Latoni said that the marks looked\r\n\n\"strange\" to him, and that he did not know if they would go away.\r\n\n          Dr. Latoni attempted to treat Fernandez' symptoms with\r\n\nvarious techniques, including injections of other material and\r\n\ndermabrasion. His attempts to remedy her symptoms were\r\n\nunsuccessful. Fernandez also had a discussion with Montesinos, who\r\n\ntold plaintiff that the marks would go away. \r\n\n          In September 1992, Fernandez consulted with Dr. Wilkinson\r\n\nin San Antonio. Fernandez claims that she was not aware of the\r\n\n                              -18-\r\r\n\nsource and extent of her injuries until the meeting with\r\n\nDr. Wilkinson.\r\n\n          3.  Gonzalez\r\n\n          Plaintiff Gonzalez received two treatments from\r\n\nMontesinos in 1989 and two or three in 1990 or 1991. Gonzalez did\r\n\nnot see the material injected into her face, or any packaging, but\r\n\nMontesinos told her that it was \"animal collagen.\" Gonzalez\r\n\nreceived her second series of collagen injections on October 24,\r\n\n1989. The day after this second series, Gonzalez developed a rash-\r\n\nlike reaction at the sites of the injections. \r\n\n          A few months after the development of the rash, Gonzalez\r\n\nconsulted Dr. Isabel Banuchi, a dermatologist who administered\r\n\ncollagen injections as part of her practice. Dr. Banuchi expressed\r\n\nconcern after hearing that Gonzalez had received injections from an\r\n\nunlicensed person. Dr. Banuchi told Gonzalez that she did not know\r\n\nwhether the material that had been injected was in fact collagen,\r\n\nand that she had never seen the type of reaction to collagen that\r\n\nGonzalez was experiencing.\r\n\n          Gonzalez also consulted with two other doctors between\r\n\n1990 and 1992: Dr. Carranza, who told her that she should wait and\r\n\nsee what happened with the reaction, and Dr. Armando Silva, a\r\n\ndermatologist who said he did not know what had been injected into\r\n\nGonzalez' face. According to Gonzalez, although she informed all\r\n\nof these doctors that she developed the symptoms immediately after\r\n\nbeing injected by what she was told was collagen, the physicians\r\n\nsaid that her reaction seemed \"strange\" to them, because reactions\r\n\n                              -19-\r\r\n\nto collagen injections normally disappear. Dr. Carranza, however,\r\n\ndid tell Gonzalez that her rash was a result of whatever had been\r\n\ninjected into her face.\r\n\n          Despite directions from the physicians with whom she\r\n\nconsulted not to have any more injections, Gonzalez received more\r\n\ntreatments from Montesinos two or three times after developing the\r\n\nrash, in 1990 or 1991. Montesinos administered injections at the\r\n\nsite of the hard nodules because, she told Gonzalez, the reaction\r\n\nmight have been the result of \"dead\" collagen, and further\r\n\ninjections could help improve the condition of her facial skin.\r\n\n          Gonzalez also sought diagnosis and treatment from\r\n\nDr. Walter Benavent. On December 26, 1990, Dr. Benavent wrote to\r\n\na scientist at Collagen Corporation asking for assistance in\r\n\ndiagnosing one of his patients (Gonzalez) who had developed\r\n\n\"hardened nodules along both naso-labial folds, corner of the\r\n\nmouth, and chin following injections of Collagen\" some time in\r\n\nSeptember or October of 1989. According to Dr. Benavent, Gonzalez\r\n\nstated that the person who administered the injections told her it\r\n\nwas collagen, but that Gonzalez suspected that the collagen might\r\n\nnot have been properly refrigerated because of power outages in\r\n\nPuerto Rico following Hurricane Hugo. \r\n\n          Over a year later, in January 1992, Dr. Benavent received\r\n\na letter from Collagen Corporation stating that it was difficult to\r\n\ndetermine whether his patients (by this time, Gonzalez and\r\n\nPedreira) had in fact been injected with collagen, because their\r\n\ndescribed symptoms were not typical of a reaction to collagen, and\r\n\n                              -20-\r\r\n\nsuggesting that Dr. Benavent send the patients' blood samples to\r\n\nCollagen Corporation to test for the presence of collagen. At the\r\n\ndirection of Dr. Benavent, Gonzalez sent a sample of her blood to\r\n\nCollagen Corporation. On March 4, 1992, Collagen Corporation wrote\r\n\nto Dr. Benavent (who passed the letter on to Gonzalez) that\r\n\nGonzalez' blood tested negative for the presence of bovine collagen\r\n\nantibodies. The letter stated that the results were a \"research\r\n\ntool only and should not be considered diagnostic.\"\r\n\n          After receiving the results from Collagen Corporation,\r\n\nDr. Benavent told Gonzalez that he did not think that the material\r\n\ninjected into her face was collagen. He did, however, tell her\r\n\nthat her symptoms might be permanent.\r\n\n          In September 1992, Gonzalez traveled to San Antonio to\r\n\nmeet with Dr. Wilkinson, who told her that the marks on her face\r\n\nwere a reaction to bovine collagen. According to Gonzalez, this\r\n\nwas the first time that she became aware of the permanency and\r\n\ncause of her injury.\r\n\n          4.  Pedreira\r\n\n          The small bumps that appeared on plaintiff Pedreira's\r\n\nface after her third treatment with Montesinos in September 1989\r\n\nbecame \"quite noticeable\" four to six weeks later, and have\r\n\npersisted in that state ever since. Although Pedreira did not see\r\n\nthe material being injected, Montesinos told Pedreira that she was\r\n\nusing bovine collagen.\r\n\n          Starting in January or February of 1990, and continuing\r\n\nover the next two years, Pedreira consulted a number of physicians\r\n\n                              -21-\r\r\n\nfor diagnosis and treatment. These physicians, whom Pedreira told\r\n\nthat she had received injections of what she thought was collagen\r\n\nin the areas where the bumps appeared, tried various treatment\r\n\ntechniques to no avail. A dermatologist told Pedreira that she\r\n\nshould wait, because if it was collagen, the reaction would \"wear\r\n\naway,\" and a plastic surgeon stated that there was nothing he could\r\n\ndo to help her. After consulting some of the doctors, Pedreira\r\n\nwent to Montesinos, who told her to massage the affected area, and\r\n\nto wait because the reaction would \"wear away.\" Pedreira later\r\n\ntestified that in 1990, when she consulted the plastic surgeon, she\r\n\ndid suspect that collagen was the cause of her injury, but that,\r\n\nbased on the physicians' and Montesinos' assurances, she assumed\r\n\nthe marks would eventually go away.\r\n\n          In January 1992, after talking with her friend Gonzalez,\r\n\nPedreira went to see Dr. Benavent. In his notes following\r\n\nconsultation with Pedreira, Dr. Benavent stated that Pedreira had\r\n\nnodules around her nose and mouth that appeared after receiving\r\n\ninjections of what was purportedly collagen from a \"beautician.\"\r\n\nLike Gonzalez, Pedreira submitted a blood sample to Collagen\r\n\nCorporation for testing, the results of which were negative for the\r\n\npresence of collagen. Finally, Pedreira saw Dr. Wilkinson in\r\n\nSeptember 1989, at which time she asserts she first became aware of\r\n\nthe permanency and cause of her facial deformities.\r\n\nB. Procedural Background\r\n\n          Plaintiffs filed their separate complaints on August 31,\r\n\n1993. Their cases were subsequently consolidated. On August 20,\r\n\n                              -22-\r\r\n\n1996, the district court granted summary judgment for defendant\r\n\nCollagen Corporation, after concluding that plaintiffs' claims were\r\n\nbarred by Puerto Rico's one-year statute of limitations for tort\r\n\nactions. Specifically, the district court concluded that, based on\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' own testimony, each plaintiff had reasonable notice\r\n\nof her injury, \"sufficient to file suit\" well before they met with\r\n\nDr. Wilkinson in September 1992. Based on the district court's\r\n\ndetermination that the record indisputably showed that plaintiffs\r\n\nhad sufficient notice of their cause of action, the court held\r\n\nthat:\r\n\n            the one-year statute of limitation for\r\n            plaintiffs' causes of action began to run,\r\n            at the very latest, in the beginning of\r\n            1992. At that time, plaintiffs had\r\n            knowledge of their injuries, and of the\r\n            entity (\"collagen\") that caused the tort.\r\n            With due diligence, the identity of the\r\n            manufacturer of the material injected\r\n            could have easily been ascertained by the\r\n            plaintiffs. Further, suit could have been\r\n            commenced in this court, or at state\r\n            court, against Montesinos and a fictitious\r\n            named company defendant, to describe the\r\n            collagen manufacturer, as allowed under\r\n            Puerto Rico law. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32,\r\n            App. III R15.4 (1983).\r\n\n935 F. Supp. at 82.\r\n\n          In an order dated December 31, 1996, the district court\r\n\ngranted summary judgment, based on the same findings of fact and\r\n\nconclusions of law, for defendant Bertha Montesinos, and denied\r\n\nplaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.\r\n\n                              -23-\r\r\n\n  IV. Application of Standards of Review to the Present Record\r\n\n          As an initial matter, both appellants and appellees argue\r\n\nthat a decision in their favor is required because the other party\r\n\nis in some way bound to statements made in pleadings.\r\n\n          Appellants argue that appellee Collagen Corporation\r\n\ncannot succeed in contending that the plaintiffs knew, or at least\r\n\nhad notice, for purposes of applying the law of limitation of tort\r\n\nactions in Puerto Rico, that the material injected during\r\n\ntreatments by Montesinos was collagen, while at the same time\r\n\ndenying, as a primary defense, that the material injected was\r\n\nindeed a collagen product of Collagen Corporation. This argument\r\n\nfails adequately to take into account a procedural provision, in\r\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(e)(2), that allows parties to\r\n\ntake inconsistent positions in their pleadings. Especially at the\r\n\nearly stages of litigation, a party's pleading will not be treated\r\n\nas an admission precluding another, inconsistent, pleading.   See\r\n\nGens v. Resolution Trust Corp., 112 F.3d 569, 573 &amp; n.4 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1997) (noting the relaxed standard of the Federal Rules that allows\r\n\nalternative pleadings); Aetna \r                                        Cas. \r                                             Sur. \r                                                   Co. v.

Ct. 30 (1985).\r\n\n          Likewise, statements contained in plaintiffs' complaints\r\n\nwill not be construed as admissions by plaintiffs that they knew,\r\n\nbefore Montesinos administered injections, that Montesinos was\r\n\nusing one of Collagen's products. Collagen argues, unpersuasively,\r\n\nthat statements contained in the plaintiffs' complaints that in\r\n\n1989 Montesinos injected plaintiffs with \"Collagen, a product of\r\n\nCollagen Corporation,\" amount to judicial admissions that\r\n\nplaintiffs knew in 1989 what was being injected into their faces.\r\n\nThe pleading was simply asserting the alleged fact as to what\r\n\nhappened, not as to when plaintiffs learned about that fact.\r\n\n            Turning to the central issues in this appeal, we\r\n\nconclude that the factual record in this case is sufficiently\r\n\ndeveloped for this court to determine that the trial court\r\n\ncorrectly concluded that the notice component (the objective\r\n\ncomponent) was established in favor of all defendants against all\r\n\nplaintiffs as an initial or prima facie matter. We also conclude,\r\n\nhowever, that we must nevertheless vacate the judgment for\r\n\ndefendants because a trialworthy dispute of fact exists, on this\r\n\nrecord, with respect to the applicability of the recognized\r\n\nexception to the notice rule as to each plaintiff's claim against\r\n\neach defendant in this case.\r\n\n          Defendants' argument that plaintiff Rodriguez had\r\n\n\"notice\" by early 1992, if not earlier, has support in the record.\r\n\n                              -25-\r\r\n\nPlaintiff Rodriguez developed hard, red, raised bumps around the\r\n\narea of injections shortly after Montesinos' treatment in the fall\r\n\nof 1989. Over the next three years, these bumps did not dissipate\r\n\nor change in any way. Rodriguez' discussions with Drs. Nevarez and\r\n\nBorras between 1989 and 1992 show that she was already aware that\r\n\na raised ridge was a result of--or at least related to--the\r\n\ninjections she received from Montesinos. By March 1992 (if not\r\n\nearlier), when Rodriguez discontinued injection treatments with\r\n\nMontesinos, the intractable nature of Rodriguez' symptoms put her\r\n\non notice that she had been injured. By early 1992, enough facts\r\n\nwere available to Rodriguez to enable her to consult a lawyer and,\r\n\nwith the lawyer's help, investigate the manufacturing source of the\r\n\nmaterial injected by Montesinos into her face. Had she not\r\n\nreceived the assurances of Montesinos and encountered the\r\n\nuncertainty of the doctors, her failure to pursue a claim after two\r\n\nyears of unchanged symptoms would have barred her claim under the\r\n\nobjective rule of notice.\r\n\n          Plaintiff Fernandez developed the reactive bumps, at the\r\n\nsites of the injections, the evening after receiving her third\r\n\ntreatment from Montesinos. At some time in early 1990, she\r\n\nconsulted with Dr. Latoni. Fernandez told Dr. Latoni at that time\r\n\nthat she had received collagen injections from Montesinos at the\r\n\nsite of the reaction. Dr. Latoni treated Fernandez \"nine or ten\r\n\ntimes,\" using kenalog injections and dermabrasion techniques, but\r\n\nto no avail.\r\n\n                              -26-\r\r\n\n          Defendants contend, with support in the record, that by\r\n\nthe time Fernandez finished treatment with Dr. Latoni (the date is\r\n\nnot apparent from the record, but it was well before her visit to\r\n\nDr. Wilkinson), sufficient facts were available to put her on\r\n\nnotice that she had sustained an injury as a result of the\r\n\ninjections administered by Montesinos. That Fernandez was aware of\r\n\na possible link between the injections and her facial deformities\r\n\nis evidenced in her statements to Dr. Latoni, and her discussions\r\n\nwith Montesinos, whom she told about the reaction. When the\r\n\nsymptoms persisted unchanged, even after numerous treatments by\r\n\nDr. Latoni, Fernandez was put on notice that the marks on her face\r\n\nwere not a normal reaction to collagen injections that would \"wear\r\n\naway.\"\r\n\n          Plaintiff Gonzalez had numerous indications, well before\r\n\nher September 1992 visit to Dr. Wilkinson, that her reaction was a\r\n\nresult of the collagen injections that she received from Montesinos\r\n\non October 24, 1989. Montesinos told Gonzalez that she was using\r\n\ncollagen in the injections, and later told her that the reaction\r\n\nmight have been caused by \"dead\" collagen. Although some of the\r\n\ndoctors told Gonzalez that if it was collagen, the reaction would\r\n\ngo away, the bumps did not disappear for over two years. And at\r\n\nleast one of the doctors, Dr. Carranza, explicitly told Gonzalez\r\n\nthat the reaction was related to her facial injections.\r\n\n          The reaction did not subside over time, despite further\r\n\ntreatments from Montesinos. The fact that Gonzalez continued to\r\n\nsee the unlicensed cosmetologist after being advised by her\r\n\n                              -27-\r\r\n\nphysicians that she should not continue to have injections,\r\n\nmoreover, tends to undermine any claim by Gonzalez that she was not\r\n\non notice. Also, as she did with the other doctors that she saw,\r\n\nGonzalez told Dr. Benavent in 1990 that she had received what she\r\n\nbelieved was collagen injected into her face, and that she had\r\n\ndeveloped the rash at the same location as the injections. In his\r\n\nletter to the Collagen Corporation, Dr. Benavent related how\r\n\nGonzalez told him that she believed that Montesinos might have\r\n\ninjected collagen that was not properly refrigerated. Gonzalez was\r\n\ninformed of the letter from Collagen stating that her blood tested\r\n\nnegative for collagen antibodies. After receiving these results,\r\n\nDr. Benavent told Gonzalez that he did not know what had been\r\n\ninjected into her face. \r\n\n          Defendants contend, with support in the record, that\r\n\nGonzalez was aware, when she consulted with the various doctors\r\n\nbetween 1989 and 1991, that her facial deformities were related to\r\n\nthe injection she received in the fall of 1989. She even told\r\n\nDr. Benavent that she suspected that the injection that resulted in\r\n\nher deformities might have contained improperly stored collagen.\r\n\nThe representations of Collagen and Benavent were not enough to\r\n\nundermine an impression, supported by facts known to Gonzalez at\r\n\nthe time, that she had been injured as a result of the particular\r\n\ninjection administered by Montesinos. We conclude that, as a\r\n\nmatter of law, she was on notice.\r\n\n          Like plaintiff Gonzalez, plaintiff Pedreira consulted\r\n\nwith Dr. Benavent; similarly, she received the results of the blood\r\n\n                              -28-\r\r\n\ntests and Dr. Benavent's opinion that the reaction was probably not\r\n\ncaused by collagen. For the reasons just discussed, defendants\r\n\ncontend, with support in the record, that Pedreira told the doctors\r\n\nwith whom she consulted that the bumps on her face appeared after\r\n\nreceiving collagen injections into her face, and that the bumps\r\n\nwere located at the sites of the injections. Pedreira admitted\r\n\nthat in late 1990 she suspected the collagen injection as the\r\n\nculprit in her injury, but that she believed that the symptoms\r\n\nwould just go away. It is true that this belief was based in part\r\n\non the representations of Montesinos, with whom she talked in the\r\n\nsummer of 1990, and who told her to massage the bumps, which would\r\n\neventually go away. We conclude, nevertheless, that as a matter of\r\n\nlaw Pedreira was on notice.\r\n\n          In the present case, each of the plaintiffs had notice\r\n\nwell before September 1992 that her symptoms were related to the\r\n\ncollagen injections administered by Montesinos. Each of the\r\n\nplaintiffs was told by Montesinos, either before the damaging\r\n\ninjections, or after the plaintiff developed the marks on her face,\r\n\nthat Montesinos had used injectable collagen. All of the\r\n\nplaintiffs told their doctors that the marks appeared after\r\n\nreceiving the collagen injections, at the same sites as the\r\n\ninjections. Many of the doctors confirmed plaintiffs' suspicions\r\n\nthat the bumps or marks were a result of the collagen injections.\r\n\nAll of plaintiffs received more than one collagen reaction; most\r\n\nreceived injections after the one that resulted in the rash. That\r\n\nthe red raised bumps were not a normal, more mild, reaction to\r\n\n                              -29-\r\r\n\ncollagen should have been apparent to plaintiffs, given that they\r\n\ndid not experience a similar reaction to any of the other\r\n\ninjections. \r\n\n          Even if the plaintiffs were on notice as to the\r\n\nlikelihood of a legal claim springing from their facial\r\n\ndeformities, an arguable question of fact remains as to whether the\r\n\nrepresentations of Montesinos and others contributed, in a material\r\n\nway, to plaintiffs' delay in bringing suit. In other words, a\r\n\nquestion of material fact remains as to whether the exception to\r\n\nthe notice rule applies in this case. Plaintiffs received repeated\r\n\nreassurances from Montesinos that the reactions would go away. The\r\n\ndoctors consulted by the plaintiffs gave a wide range of diagnoses\r\n\nand prognoses, including reassurances that the symptoms would\r\n\nsubside, statements of uncertainty as to the composition of the\r\n\ninjected material, and prescriptions for treatments that\r\n\npurportedly would remedy the facial marks. The effect of these\r\n\nrepresentations, although not made by the alleged torfeasors, is a\r\n\nfactor to consider in determining whether plaintiffs reasonably\r\n\nrelied on Montesinos' assurances. \r\n\n          After full consideration of the factual record before us\r\n\nin this appeal, we conclude that we cannot say that a finder of\r\n\nfact, reasoning on the basis of the evidence in the record before\r\n\nus, could come to only one finding, a finding for the defendants on\r\n\nthe limitation issue on all claims against all defendants. The\r\n\nevidence in the record in this case is not so one-sided that we can\r\n\nsay that defendants are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\r\n\n                              -30-\r\r\n\nthat the exception to the notice concept does not apply. It is a\r\n\ndefendant's burden, in moving for summary judgment, to establish\r\n\nthat all material facts are undisputed, and that no finder of fact\r\n\ncould reasonably find a genuine dispute of material fact and\r\n\nresolve that dispute in the plaintiff's favor. In view of the\r\n\nrelatively particularized nature of evidence favorable to each\r\n\nplaintiff in this case with respect to reassurances after\r\n\nsuspicions were aroused, in relation to her claim against each\r\n\ndefendant, we cannot say that a finder of fact must find this\r\n\nevidence not creditworthy.\r\n\n          First. The evidence does not compel a finding, as to any\r\n\nplaintiff, that she has failed to show by a preponderance of the\r\n\nevidence that she did not have true knowledge of injury, source of\r\n\ninjury, and awareness of all facts constituting the factual grounds\r\n\nfor legal responsibility of an identifiable actor or supplier of\r\n\ncollagen.\r\n\n          Second. The evidence does not compel a finding, as to\r\n\nany plaintiff, that she has failed to show by a preponderance of\r\n\nthe evidence that she reasonably relied upon repeated assurances by\r\n\nMontesinos and others.\r\n\n          For these reasons, even though we have ruled that but for\r\n\nthe second of the foregoing genuine disputes of fact defendants\r\n\nwould have been entitled to summary judgment under the notice rule\r\n\n(the objective component of the legal test), the judgment for\r\n\ndefendants entered in the trial court must be vacated and the case\r\n\nmust be remanded. We direct, explicitly, that the only limitation-\r\n\n                              -31-\r\r\n\nof-actions issue remaining for proceedings on remand is the issue\r\n\nregarding reasonableness of reliance on assurances of the\r\n\ndefendants, evaluated in the context of evidence of assurances by\r\n\nunaffiliated third parties.\r\n\n          It is so ordered. Costs are awarded to plaintiffs.\r\n\n                              -32-\r\n",

Issues Presented\r\n\n          The principal legal issues in dispute in this case\r\n\nconcern limitation of tort actions under the law of Puerto Rico.\r\n\nMore precisely, the dispute centers on the meaning of statutory\r\n\nprovisions and opinions of courts of Puerto Rico interpreting them,\r\n\nparticularly with respect to levels of awareness of injury, source\r\n\nof injury, causal connection, and legal responsibility.\r\n\n          To what extent is the running of the statutory time limit\r\n\nof one year for the filing of tort actions for damages affected by\r\n\nlack of awareness of injury, a connection between injury and the\r\n\npersonal services or other conduct of a person, and legal\r\n\nresponsibility for the injury?\r\n\n          To what extent is the running of the statutory time limit\r\n\nof one year affected by lack of awareness of a connection between\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ninjury and a product of a manufacturer or other supplier of the\r\n\nproduct?\r\n\n          To what extent is the running of the limitation period\r\n\naffected by the representations of the person who caused the\r\n\ninjury, or of third persons, regarding the nature and source of a\r\n\nplaintiff's injury?\r\n\n          Answers to these questions must be determined as matters\r\n\nof law. Accordingly, this court reviews the district court's\r\n\nrulings on these issues de novo.\r\n\n          The matters of law we are deciding, of course, are\r\n\nmatters of the law of Puerto Rico. Both in the district court and\r\n\nin this court on appeal, the determination of these questions of\r\n\nlaw does not involve any discretion to fashion rules of law.\r\n\nInstead, our objective is solely to determine what is the law as\r\n\nindicated by authoritative sources. Primary among these\r\n\n\"authoritative sources\" are the plainly expressed holdings of the\r\n\nhighest court of Puerto Rico.   See, e.g.,  Daigle v.

If a plaintiff is not\r\n\naware of some level of reasonable likelihood of legal liability on\r\n\nthe part of the person or entity that caused the injury, the\r\n\nstatute of limitation will be tolled.

Offic. Trans. at 317. Geigel, the dental surgeon,\r\n\ntold plaintiff that he had bitten himself on the tongue and that\r\n\nthe symptoms would subside in a short while. \r                                                      Id. For over a year,\r\n\nColon Prieto continued to see Geigel, who told him that the pain\r\n\nwould go away. Id. But the symptoms did not subside. In November\r\n\n1972, plaintiff consulted with another physician, and learned for\r\n\nthe first time that the pain was the result of Geigel's having cut\r\n\na nerve during the initial operation.\r\n\n          Colon Prieto brought suit against Geigel on September 10,\r\n\n1973, more than one year after the original operation. Geigel\r\n\nasserted the statute of limitation as a defense. The Supreme Court\r\n\nof Puerto Rico rejected Geigel's defense, holding that, because\r\n\nColon Prieto did not acquire knowledge of the nature of his injury\r\n\nand Geigel's role in the injury until the November 1972\r\n\nconsultation with the other doctor, plaintiff was not barred under\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico statute of limitation.\r\n\n          Distinguishing Colon Prieto's case from the more\r\n\ntraditional tort case in which a plaintiff is aware from the moment\r\n\nof the tortious act of the injury and its cause (for example, where\r\n\na defendant's act causes something to fall on a plaintiff\r\n\nimmediately), the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico observed that the\r\n\nstatutory phrase \"'\r                            from the time the aggrieved person had knowledge\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthereof' ... rejects a literal and narrow reading.\"  Id. at 327.\r\n\nThe court noted that the legal reasoning behind a plaintiff's loss\r\n\nof rights under a statute of limitation is that the plaintiff is\r\n\ndeemed to have abandoned those rights.   Id. (quoting A. Borrell\r\n\nMacia, \r                Responsabilidades Derivadas de Culpa Extracontractual Civil\r                                                                          ,\r\n\n66, Barcelona, Ed. Bosch (2d ed. 1958)). In order for this legal\r\n\nreasoning to apply, therefore, \"such abandonment [on the part of\r\n\nthe plaintiff] should really exist.\"  Id.\r\n\nB. Three Analytically Separable Questions\r\n\n          We conclude that within the larger structure regarding\r\n\nthe law of Puerto Rico on limitation of tort actions are three\r\n\nanalytically separable subsidiary issues. These issues concern the\r\n\ncircumstances in which a plaintiff can be said to have, or to lack,\r\n\nthe requisite level of awareness for statute of limitation\r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n          First, the concept of \"true knowledge\" applies where a\r\n\nplaintiff is actually aware of all the necessary facts and the\r\n\nexistence of a likelihood of a legal cause of action. Second,\r\n\nconcepts of \"notice\" and \"deemed knowledge\" apply. Under these\r\n\nconcepts a plaintiff's subjective awareness is measured against the\r\n\nlevel of awareness that the plaintiff, having been put on notice as\r\n\nto certain facts and having exercised reasonable care regarding a\r\n\npotential claim, should have acquired. Third, the law or Puerto\r\n\nRico recognizes an exception to applicability of the concepts of\r\n\nnotice and deemed knowledge for circumstances in which a\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nplaintiff's failure to make a timely filing of a claim is\r\n\nreasonably based upon the assurances of the person who caused the\r\n\ninjury.\r\n\n          From a structural perspective, two of these questions\r\n\n(about true knowledge and deemed knowledge) concern alternative\r\n\nways in which a defendant may establish that a claim is barred\r\n\nbecause it is filed too late. If the defendant succeeds in showing\r\n\nthat plaintiff has not satisfied, or cannot satisfy, plaintiff's\r\n\nburden of proving lack of true knowledge (that is, lack of full\r\n\nawareness of all that need be known to preclude tolling), final\r\n\njudgment for the defendant on the ground of late filing is\r\n\nappropriate.\r\n\n          If, instead, the finder of fact finds (or the court, by\r\n\ndetermining that the evidence of record is so one-sided as to\r\n\ncompel a finding) that the plaintiff was aware of enough facts to\r\n\nconstitute notice and to satisfy the deemed knowledge rule of the\r\n\nPuerto Rico law of limitation of tort actions, final judgment for\r\n\nthe defendant on the ground of late filing is appropriate  unless\r\n\nplaintiff has proffered evidence sufficient to support a finding\r\n\nthat representations and assurances by the defendant persuaded\r\n\nplaintiff to rely reasonably and delay institution of a civil\r\n\naction.\r\n\n          The \"unless\" clause in the next preceding sentence may be\r\n\ntreated either as a condition to be satisfied before the deemed\r\n\nknowledge rule applies, or as a negation of an otherwise adequate\r\n\nshowing of applicability of the deemed knowledge rule. Under\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\neither analytic treatment of the substantive requirement of the\r\n\nlegal test for deemed knowledge, this substantive requirement is\r\n\nthe third of the analytically separable issues to which we referred\r\n\nabove. It creates another possibility of a plaintiff's showing\r\n\nthat a genuine dispute of material fact precludes a judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of law for the defendant on the limitation ground.\r\n\n          1. Full Awareness:\r                                        \r                                        A Subjective Component of the Legal\r\n          Test\r\n\n          In circumstances where a plaintiff has not abandoned a\r\n\ncause of action, but instead was never aware that such a cause of\r\n\naction existed, the statute of limitation would not operate as a\r\n\nbar to the exercise of the plaintiff's legal rights.   See  Colon\r\n\nPrieto, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 327-328. As the court noted in\r\n\nColon \r                Prieto, a plaintiff who is not aware of the existence of a\r\n\ncause of action is essentially incapable of bringing suit within\r\n\nthe limitation period.     Id. at 327. The emphasis on the\r\n\nplaintiff's \"subjective\" ability to bring suit is justified, at\r\n\nleast in part, by the brevity of the limitation period.   Id. at\r\n\n328.\r\n\n          Reasoning from these premises, the Supreme Court of\r\n\nPuerto Rico held that, in order for the limitation period to start\r\n\nto run, a plaintiff must be able to institute suit, which requires\r\n\nknowledge of the existence of an injury and knowledge of the person\r\n\nwho caused the injury. Knowledge of who caused the injury, the\r\n\ncourt held, was necessary so that the plaintiff would know whom to\r\n\nsue.  Id. at 330 (quoting I A. Barrell y Soler,    Derecho \r                                                                      Civil\r\n\nEspanol 500, Barcelona, Ed. Bosch (1955)). \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          In setting forth this standard, the court in \r                                                               Colon Prieto\r\n\nstated that it was adopting a \"subjective\" standard.  Id. at 328.\r\n\nIn the law of Puerto Rico, a legal test of this kind is sometimes\r\n\nreferred to as grounded in the \"cognitive\" theory of damages. \r                                                                       See,\r\n\ne.g., Barretto Peat, 896 F.2d at 657 (describing S 5298 of Puerto\r\n\nRico's Civil Code as codifying the cognitive theory).\r\n\n          To understand this component of the applicable legal\r\n\ntest, for the purpose of applying it to the case now before us, we\r\n\nmust understand what level of awareness is required as to\r\n\nparticulars of the injury and its source. Was the source in\r\n\npersonal services, or in some other form of conduct of some\r\n\nidentifiable person, or in a product used or supplied by some\r\n\nperson and obtained through a chain of distribution involving one\r\n\nor more others, including a manufacturer?\r\n\n          Under the law of Puerto Rico, the plaintiff's level of\r\n\nawareness about these matters may be relevant in more than a single\r\n\nway, bearing upon more than a single sub-issue.\r\n\n            First. What effect is to be given to evidence, if\r\n\ncreditworthy, of the effect that post-injury conduct of a person\r\n\nwho was a cause of the injury, or post-injury conduct of other\r\n\npersons, had on plaintiff's refraining from or delaying instituting\r\n\nsuit?\r\n\n          Second. What more would the plaintiff have learned about\r\n\nthe injury and authorship of the injury if the plaintiff, having\r\n\nnotice in the sense of awareness of some facts, had then made the\r\n\ninquiries that a careful person would have made?\r\n\n                              -10-\r\r\n\n          2. Notice and Deemed Knowledge:\r                                                    \r                                                    The Objective Component\r\n\n          We understand the court in  Colon \r                                                       Prieto to have been\r\n\nspeaking quite explicitly to the second of these two questions\r\n\n(stated immediately above) in the passage of the opinion noting\r\n\nthat, if a plaintiff's ignorance of an injury and its origin was\r\n\ndue to the plaintiff's own negligence or lack of care, then the\r\n\nstatute of limitation would not be tolled.  See Colon \r                                                                Prieto, 15\r\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. at 327-29 (quoting A. Borrell Macia,\r\n\nResponsabilidades Derivadas de Culpa Extracontractual Civil\r                                                                    344-345\r\n\n(Bosch ed. 2d ed. 1958)). This point is associated with the level\r\n\nof awareness implicit in the concept of notice. \r\n\n          The law of Puerto Rico treats a person as being aware of\r\n\nall that, having awareness constituting notice, that person would\r\n\nhave been likely to come to know through the exercise of care.\r\n\nThus, we understand the holdings of Puerto Rico decisions to mean\r\n\nthat \"actual knowledge is not required where, by due diligence,\r\n\nsuch knowledge would likely have been acquired.\" Villarini-Garcia\r\n\nv.

It\r\n\nfollows, then, that to determine the point at which a plaintiff\r\n\nshould be held responsible for the required level of awareness of\r\n\nwhether another particular person was an author of the injury, a\r\n\ncourt looks to \"whether plaintiff knew or with the degree of\r\n\ndiligence required by law would have known whom to sue.\" \r                                                                  Kaiser v.\r\n\nArmstrong  \r                    World  \r                           Indus., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521534\"><a href=\"/opinion/521534/sol-kaiser-v-armstrong-world-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516 (1st Cir. 1989)\r\n\n(citations and internal quotation omitted). \r\n\n                              -11-\r\r\n\n          Once a plaintiff is made aware of facts sufficient to put\r\n\nher on notice that she has a potential tort claim, she must pursue\r\n\nthat claim with reasonable diligence, or risk being held to have\r\n\nrelinquished her right to pursue it later, after the limitation\r\n\nperiod has run.  See, e.g., Villarini, 8 F.3d at 85.\r\n\n          In Villarini, a plaintiff was made aware of facts\r\n\nsufficient for her to be able to file suit (as to two of her\r\n\nclaims) three weeks after her operation. We held that the\r\n\nplaintiff was time-barred from bringing those claims roughly two\r\n\nand a half years later.  Id. We recognized in  Villarini that the\r\n\nplaintiff may not have understood fully the legal significance of\r\n\nthe facts known to her after her operation, but also recognized\r\n\nthat the meaning of authoritative declarations of the law of Puerto\r\n\nRico is that \"there is nothing unfair in a policy that insists that\r\n\nthe plaintiff promptly assert her rights.\" Id. Thus, plaintiff's\r\n\nfailure to consult with a lawyer or otherwise investigate the claim\r\n\nto which she had been alerted by the factual circumstances\r\n\nassociated with the operation barred her from commencing that claim\r\n\nin the courts over one year after being on notice.  Id.\r\n\n          Similarly, once a plaintiff is put on notice that someone\r\n\nor some entity is the cause of the injury, the plaintiff may not\r\n\nsucceed in a late-filed claim by asserting ignorance about the\r\n\nprecise identity of the tortfeasor. Also, because corporate\r\n\nidentities and intracorporate relationships are a matter of public\r\n\nrecord, knowledge of the precise corporate identity of the entity\r\n\nresponsible for a plaintiff's injury is not required before the\r\n\n                              -12-\r\r\n\nperiod prescribed by the statute of limitation begins to run.

An Exception to the Rule of Notice\r\n\n          An exception to the rule of notice (the objective\r\n\ncomponent of the law of limitation of tort actions) is recognized.\r\n\nIf a plaintiff's suspicions that she may have been the victim of a\r\n\ntort are assuaged by assurances made by the person who caused the\r\n\ninjury, a plaintiff will not be held responsible for failing to\r\n\npursue her claim more aggressively.  Colon Prieto, 15 P.R. Offic.\r\n\nTrans. at 329-330.\r\n\n          In addition to holdings discussed above (in explanation\r\n\nof both the subjective and the objective components of the law of\r\n\nPuerto Rico), the court in   Colon  \r                                              Prieto held that, where the\r\n\nplaintiff's doctor (the person responsible for causing the injury)\r\n\nassured the plaintiff that the pain was normal and was due to\r\n\nplaintiff's biting his tongue during the operation, the plaintiff\r\n\nwould not be held to have \"known\" of the injury and the cause until\r\n\nthe later consultation. This ruling, the court observed, was\r\n\n            the fairest and most equitable. We\r\n            safeguard the aggrieved party's right to\r\n            seek redress, while we abstain from\r\n            rewarding the person who, having caused\r\n            the damage, took refuge in his patient's\r\n            trust and ignorance trying to avail\r\n            himself of the circumstances in order to\r\n            defeat the action.\r\n\nId. at 330. \r\n\n          In this context, where a diligent plaintiff reasonably\r\n\nrelies upon representations made by a tortfeasor that her symptoms\r\n\nare not the result of a negligent or otherwise tortious act, that\r\n\n                              -13-\r\r\n\nplaintiff is not barred, because of her \"own negligence or lack of\r\n\ncare,\" from the benefit of tolling of the limitation period.  See\r\n\nColon  \r                Prieto, 15 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 329-330.         See  \r                                                                       also\r\n\nVillarini, 8 F.3d at 85-86. Stated another way, the condition\r\n\nattached to a plaintiff's right of tolling -- the condition that\r\n\nshe act with care to make additional inquiries once she is on\r\n\nnotice -- does not apply (or is excused, or negated) when the\r\n\nplaintiff reasonably relies on what others told her. The reliance,\r\n\nhowever, must be reasonable, and the determination of the\r\n\nreasonableness of a plaintiff's reliance on the assurances of\r\n\nothers involves an evaluation that, depending upon the\r\n\ncircumstances, may or may not be a question for the finder of fact,\r\n\nand thus may or may not preclude summary judgment. See \r                                                                 id. at 86-\r\n\n87.\r\n\n          Where facts sufficient to support every element of a\r\n\nclaim relating to an injury are apparent to a plaintiff at an\r\n\nearlier time, it will not be reasonable for the plaintiff to rely\r\n\non assurances of a tortfeasor and fail to pursue the claim.   See\r\n\nid. at 86 (where plaintiff had all the information necessary for\r\n\na failure-to-warn claim, doctor's subsequent reassurances would not\r\n\nexcuse plaintiff's lack of diligence in pursuing the claim). Our\r\n\nholdings, moreover, support the conclusion that a time will come at\r\n\nwhich, if the tortfeasor's initial predictions are not borne out,\r\n\na plaintiff's reliance is no longer reasonable.    Id. Finally,\r\n\nrepresentations made by third-party doctors constitute another\r\n\nfactor to consider in determining whether a plaintiff's continued\r\n\n                              -14-\r\r\n\nreliance upon the reassurances of a tortfeasor is reasonable. See\r\n\nVillarini, 8 F.3d at 86 (holding that varying diagnoses of\r\n\ndifferent doctors, along with the reassurances of the negligent\r\n\nphysician, \"could have lulled a reasonable person into believing\r\n\nfor a year or more that the operation had not been botched\"). \r\n\nC. Summary\r\n\n          In sum, we conclude (1) that within the larger questions\r\n\nregarding the law of Puerto Rico on limitation of tort actions are\r\n\nthree analytically separable subsidiary questions; (2) that from a\r\n\nstructural perspective, two of these questions (about true\r\n\nknowledge and deemed knowledge) concern alternative ways a\r\n\ndefendant may establish that a claim is barred because filed too\r\n\nlate; (3) that, if on the evidence proffered in a case, a finder of\r\n\nfact might reasonably find that representations and assurances\r\n\npersuaded plaintiff to rely reasonably and delay institution of a\r\n\ncivil action, summary judgment for defendants would be\r\n\ninappropriate; and (4) that this remains true even if the record\r\n\nwould otherwise require judgment for defendant under the rule of\r\n\nnotice and deemed knowledge.\r\n\n                     III. Record for Review\r\n\nA. Factual Background\r\n\n          Collagen is a natural protein found throughout the body\r\n\nthat provides support to other bodily tissues, including the skin.\r\n\nSince the 1970s, collagen obtained from animals has been used in a\r\n\n                              -15-\r\r\n\nvariety of medical procedures, including procedures designed to\r\n\nimprove the consistency and appearance of the skin. Defendant\r\n\nCollagen Corporation manufactures and distributes at least two\r\n\ntypes of bovine collagen (derived from cows), called Zyderm and\r\n\nZyplast. Both can be injected under the skin to improve the\r\n\nappearance and structure of the skin. Collagen's products are\r\n\ndistributed only to be sold to and administered by licensed\r\n\nphysicians.\r\n\n          In 1989, each of the plaintiffs, Edna Rodriguez-Suris\r\n\n(\"Rodriguez\"), Maria Rosa Gonzalez San Juan de Cortes (\"Gonzalez\"),\r\n\nAnnette Perez de Pedreira (\"Pedreira\"), and Vanessa Perez de\r\n\nFernandez (\"Fernandez\"), received collagen injections from\r\n\ndefendant Bertha Montesinos. Montesinos, who was not a licensed\r\n\nphysician, obtained injectable collagen from a doctor in Miami,\r\n\nFlorida, and administered the injections at her apartment in\r\n\nSanturce, Puerto Rico. In each instance, Montesinos injected\r\n\ncollagen into the forehead (between the eyebrows) and along the\r\n\n\"expression lines\" surrounding the nose and lips of each of the\r\n\nplaintiffs. None of the plaintiffs saw the material that was\r\n\ninjected. In some instances, Montesinos provided the plaintiff\r\n\nwith a brochure describing cosmetic collagen treatments, but none\r\n\nof the plaintiffs saw Collagen Corporation product packaging or\r\n\ninserts. In the fall of 1989, Montesinos gave each of the\r\n\nplaintiffs a treatment involving injections. Shortly thereafter,\r\n\neach plaintiff developed hard red nodules or bumps at the sites of\r\n\nthe injections.\r\n\n                              -16-\r\r\n\n          In the following summary of the evidence of record with\r\n\nrespect to each plaintiff's history of treatment and consequences,\r\n\nwe state the evidence as a finder of fact might find by a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence, where any genuine dispute exists,\r\n\nsince our purpose is to determine whether summary judgment for\r\n\ndefendants is appropriate.\r\n\n          1.  Rodriguez\r\n\n          Plaintiff Rodriguez went to Montesinos for injections for\r\n\nthe third time in November 1989. Immediately after the treatment,\r\n\nRodriguez developed a redness, accompanied by a burning sensation,\r\n\naround the area of the injections. Although the burning sensation\r\n\nsubsided within a week, Rodriguez was left with a \"red, raised\r\n\nridge\" on both sides of her nose and mouth. Over the next two and\r\n\na half years, Rodriguez received three to four more collagen\r\n\ninjections from Montesinos, who assured her that the marks would\r\n\ngradually go away. The ridge, however, remained hard and did not\r\n\ndiminish in size. Rodriguez last saw Montesinos in March 1992.\r\n\n          Rodriguez spoke informally with two doctors about her\r\n\nproblem. In late November 1989, Rodriguez talked with Dr. Robert\r\n\nNevarez, a plastic surgeon, during a party they were both\r\n\nattending. Rodriguez told Dr. Nevarez that she had received\r\n\ncollagen injections and that the red marks were a reaction to the\r\n\ninjections. Dr. Nevarez said that he thought that the marks were\r\n\nan adverse reaction to collagen, but that they would go away.\r\n\nNevarez told Rodriguez to come to his office for a consultation,\r\n\nbut the plaintiff never followed up. At another social event some\r\n\n                              -17-\r\r\n\ntime between 1989 and 1992, but closer to 1989, Rodriguez talked\r\n\nwith Dr. Pedro Borras, a neurosurgeon, who told her that if the\r\n\nmarks were a reaction to collagen, then they would go away. \r\n\n          In September 1992, Rodriguez went to see Dr. Tolbert\r\n\nWilkinson in San Antonio, Texas, at which time, according to\r\n\nRodriguez, she first learned that the marks had been caused by\r\n\nproducts of defendant Collagen Corporation and would be permanent.\r\n\n          2.  Fernandez\r\n\n          Plaintiff Fernandez, sister of plaintiff Pedreira,\r\n\nreceived her third collagen injection treatment from Montesinos in\r\n\nOctober 1989. Fernandez did not see what was injected into her\r\n\nface. The evening after her third treatment, Fernandez noticed\r\n\n\"slightly raised and red\" marks in the places where she had been\r\n\ninjected. When the marks did not disappear as she expected,\r\n\nFernandez went to see Dr. David Latoni-Cabanillas, a dermatologist,\r\n\nin early 1990. Fernandez told Dr. Latoni that she received\r\n\ncollagen injections from Montesinos in the areas where she\r\n\ndeveloped the marks. Dr. Latoni said that the marks looked\r\n\n\"strange\" to him, and that he did not know if they would go away.\r\n\n          Dr. Latoni attempted to treat Fernandez' symptoms with\r\n\nvarious techniques, including injections of other material and\r\n\ndermabrasion. His attempts to remedy her symptoms were\r\n\nunsuccessful. Fernandez also had a discussion with Montesinos, who\r\n\ntold plaintiff that the marks would go away. \r\n\n          In September 1992, Fernandez consulted with Dr. Wilkinson\r\n\nin San Antonio. Fernandez claims that she was not aware of the\r\n\n                              -18-\r\r\n\nsource and extent of her injuries until the meeting with\r\n\nDr. Wilkinson.\r\n\n          3.  Gonzalez\r\n\n          Plaintiff Gonzalez received two treatments from\r\n\nMontesinos in 1989 and two or three in 1990 or 1991. Gonzalez did\r\n\nnot see the material injected into her face, or any packaging, but\r\n\nMontesinos told her that it was \"animal collagen.\" Gonzalez\r\n\nreceived her second series of collagen injections on October 24,\r\n\n1989. The day after this second series, Gonzalez developed a rash-\r\n\nlike reaction at the sites of the injections. \r\n\n          A few months after the development of the rash, Gonzalez\r\n\nconsulted Dr. Isabel Banuchi, a dermatologist who administered\r\n\ncollagen injections as part of her practice. Dr. Banuchi expressed\r\n\nconcern after hearing that Gonzalez had received injections from an\r\n\nunlicensed person. Dr. Banuchi told Gonzalez that she did not know\r\n\nwhether the material that had been injected was in fact collagen,\r\n\nand that she had never seen the type of reaction to collagen that\r\n\nGonzalez was experiencing.\r\n\n          Gonzalez also consulted with two other doctors between\r\n\n1990 and 1992: Dr. Carranza, who told her that she should wait and\r\n\nsee what happened with the reaction, and Dr. Armando Silva, a\r\n\ndermatologist who said he did not know what had been injected into\r\n\nGonzalez' face. According to Gonzalez, although she informed all\r\n\nof these doctors that she developed the symptoms immediately after\r\n\nbeing injected by what she was told was collagen, the physicians\r\n\nsaid that her reaction seemed \"strange\" to them, because reactions\r\n\n                              -19-\r\r\n\nto collagen injections normally disappear. Dr. Carranza, however,\r\n\ndid tell Gonzalez that her rash was a result of whatever had been\r\n\ninjected into her face.\r\n\n          Despite directions from the physicians with whom she\r\n\nconsulted not to have any more injections, Gonzalez received more\r\n\ntreatments from Montesinos two or three times after developing the\r\n\nrash, in 1990 or 1991. Montesinos administered injections at the\r\n\nsite of the hard nodules because, she told Gonzalez, the reaction\r\n\nmight have been the result of \"dead\" collagen, and further\r\n\ninjections could help improve the condition of her facial skin.\r\n\n          Gonzalez also sought diagnosis and treatment from\r\n\nDr. Walter Benavent. On December 26, 1990, Dr. Benavent wrote to\r\n\na scientist at Collagen Corporation asking for assistance in\r\n\ndiagnosing one of his patients (Gonzalez) who had developed\r\n\n\"hardened nodules along both naso-labial folds, corner of the\r\n\nmouth, and chin following injections of Collagen\" some time in\r\n\nSeptember or October of 1989. According to Dr. Benavent, Gonzalez\r\n\nstated that the person who administered the injections told her it\r\n\nwas collagen, but that Gonzalez suspected that the collagen might\r\n\nnot have been properly refrigerated because of power outages in\r\n\nPuerto Rico following Hurricane Hugo. \r\n\n          Over a year later, in January 1992, Dr. Benavent received\r\n\na letter from Collagen Corporation stating that it was difficult to\r\n\ndetermine whether his patients (by this time, Gonzalez and\r\n\nPedreira) had in fact been injected with collagen, because their\r\n\ndescribed symptoms were not typical of a reaction to collagen, and\r\n\n                              -20-\r\r\n\nsuggesting that Dr. Benavent send the patients' blood samples to\r\n\nCollagen Corporation to test for the presence of collagen. At the\r\n\ndirection of Dr. Benavent, Gonzalez sent a sample of her blood to\r\n\nCollagen Corporation. On March 4, 1992, Collagen Corporation wrote\r\n\nto Dr. Benavent (who passed the letter on to Gonzalez) that\r\n\nGonzalez' blood tested negative for the presence of bovine collagen\r\n\nantibodies. The letter stated that the results were a \"research\r\n\ntool only and should not be considered diagnostic.\"\r\n\n          After receiving the results from Collagen Corporation,\r\n\nDr. Benavent told Gonzalez that he did not think that the material\r\n\ninjected into her face was collagen. He did, however, tell her\r\n\nthat her symptoms might be permanent.\r\n\n          In September 1992, Gonzalez traveled to San Antonio to\r\n\nmeet with Dr. Wilkinson, who told her that the marks on her face\r\n\nwere a reaction to bovine collagen. According to Gonzalez, this\r\n\nwas the first time that she became aware of the permanency and\r\n\ncause of her injury.\r\n\n          4.  Pedreira\r\n\n          The small bumps that appeared on plaintiff Pedreira's\r\n\nface after her third treatment with Montesinos in September 1989\r\n\nbecame \"quite noticeable\" four to six weeks later, and have\r\n\npersisted in that state ever since. Although Pedreira did not see\r\n\nthe material being injected, Montesinos told Pedreira that she was\r\n\nusing bovine collagen.\r\n\n          Starting in January or February of 1990, and continuing\r\n\nover the next two years, Pedreira consulted a number of physicians\r\n\n                              -21-\r\r\n\nfor diagnosis and treatment. These physicians, whom Pedreira told\r\n\nthat she had received injections of what she thought was collagen\r\n\nin the areas where the bumps appeared, tried various treatment\r\n\ntechniques to no avail. A dermatologist told Pedreira that she\r\n\nshould wait, because if it was collagen, the reaction would \"wear\r\n\naway,\" and a plastic surgeon stated that there was nothing he could\r\n\ndo to help her. After consulting some of the doctors, Pedreira\r\n\nwent to Montesinos, who told her to massage the affected area, and\r\n\nto wait because the reaction would \"wear away.\" Pedreira later\r\n\ntestified that in 1990, when she consulted the plastic surgeon, she\r\n\ndid suspect that collagen was the cause of her injury, but that,\r\n\nbased on the physicians' and Montesinos' assurances, she assumed\r\n\nthe marks would eventually go away.\r\n\n          In January 1992, after talking with her friend Gonzalez,\r\n\nPedreira went to see Dr. Benavent. In his notes following\r\n\nconsultation with Pedreira, Dr. Benavent stated that Pedreira had\r\n\nnodules around her nose and mouth that appeared after receiving\r\n\ninjections of what was purportedly collagen from a \"beautician.\"\r\n\nLike Gonzalez, Pedreira submitted a blood sample to Collagen\r\n\nCorporation for testing, the results of which were negative for the\r\n\npresence of collagen. Finally, Pedreira saw Dr. Wilkinson in\r\n\nSeptember 1989, at which time she asserts she first became aware of\r\n\nthe permanency and cause of her facial deformities.\r\n\nB. Procedural Background\r\n\n          Plaintiffs filed their separate complaints on August 31,\r\n\n1993. Their cases were subsequently consolidated. On August 20,\r\n\n                              -22-\r\r\n\n1996, the district court granted summary judgment for defendant\r\n\nCollagen Corporation, after concluding that plaintiffs' claims were\r\n\nbarred by Puerto Rico's one-year statute of limitations for tort\r\n\nactions. Specifically, the district court concluded that, based on\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' own testimony, each plaintiff had reasonable notice\r\n\nof her injury, \"sufficient to file suit\" well before they met with\r\n\nDr. Wilkinson in September 1992. Based on the district court's\r\n\ndetermination that the record indisputably showed that plaintiffs\r\n\nhad sufficient notice of their cause of action, the court held\r\n\nthat:\r\n\n            the one-year statute of limitation for\r\n            plaintiffs' causes of action began to run,\r\n            at the very latest, in the beginning of\r\n            1992. At that time, plaintiffs had\r\n            knowledge of their injuries, and of the\r\n            entity (\"collagen\") that caused the tort.\r\n            With due diligence, the identity of the\r\n            manufacturer of the material injected\r\n            could have easily been ascertained by the\r\n            plaintiffs. Further, suit could have been\r\n            commenced in this court, or at state\r\n            court, against Montesinos and a fictitious\r\n            named company defendant, to describe the\r\n            collagen manufacturer, as allowed under\r\n            Puerto Rico law. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32,\r\n            App. III R15.4 (1983).\r\n\n935 F. Supp. at 82.\r\n\n          In an order dated December 31, 1996, the district court\r\n\ngranted summary judgment, based on the same findings of fact and\r\n\nconclusions of law, for defendant Bertha Montesinos, and denied\r\n\nplaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.\r\n\n                              -23-\r\r\n\n  IV. Application of Standards of Review to the Present Record\r\n\n          As an initial matter, both appellants and appellees argue\r\n\nthat a decision in their favor is required because the other party\r\n\nis in some way bound to statements made in pleadings.\r\n\n          Appellants argue that appellee Collagen Corporation\r\n\ncannot succeed in contending that the plaintiffs knew, or at least\r\n\nhad notice, for purposes of applying the law of limitation of tort\r\n\nactions in Puerto Rico, that the material injected during\r\n\ntreatments by Montesinos was collagen, while at the same time\r\n\ndenying, as a primary defense, that the material injected was\r\n\nindeed a collagen product of Collagen Corporation.

Collagen argues, unpersuasively,\r\n\nthat statements contained in the plaintiffs' complaints that in\r\n\n1989 Montesinos injected plaintiffs with \"Collagen, a product of\r\n\nCollagen Corporation,\" amount to judicial admissions that\r\n\nplaintiffs knew in 1989 what was being injected into their faces.\r\n\nThe pleading was simply asserting the alleged fact as to what\r\n\nhappened, not as to when plaintiffs learned about that fact.\r\n\n            Turning to the central issues in this appeal, we\r\n\nconclude that the factual record in this case is sufficiently\r\n\ndeveloped for this court to determine that the trial court\r\n\ncorrectly concluded that the notice component (the objective\r\n\ncomponent) was established in favor of all defendants against all\r\n\nplaintiffs as an initial or prima facie matter. We also conclude,\r\n\nhowever, that we must nevertheless vacate the judgment for\r\n\ndefendants because a trialworthy dispute of fact exists, on this\r\n\nrecord, with respect to the applicability of the recognized\r\n\nexception to the notice rule as to each plaintiff's claim against\r\n\neach defendant in this case.\r\n\n          Defendants' argument that plaintiff Rodriguez had\r\n\n\"notice\" by early 1992, if not earlier, has support in the record.\r\n\n                              -25-\r\r\n\nPlaintiff Rodriguez developed hard, red, raised bumps around the\r\n\narea of injections shortly after Montesinos' treatment in the fall\r\n\nof 1989. Over the next three years, these bumps did not dissipate\r\n\nor change in any way. Rodriguez' discussions with Drs. Nevarez and\r\n\nBorras between 1989 and 1992 show that she was already aware that\r\n\na raised ridge was a result of--or at least related to--the\r\n\ninjections she received from Montesinos. By March 1992 (if not\r\n\nearlier), when Rodriguez discontinued injection treatments with\r\n\nMontesinos, the intractable nature of Rodriguez' symptoms put her\r\n\non notice that she had been injured. By early 1992, enough facts\r\n\nwere available to Rodriguez to enable her to consult a lawyer and,\r\n\nwith the lawyer's help, investigate the manufacturing source of the\r\n\nmaterial injected by Montesinos into her face. Had she not\r\n\nreceived the assurances of Montesinos and encountered the\r\n\nuncertainty of the doctors, her failure to pursue a claim after two\r\n\nyears of unchanged symptoms would have barred her claim under the\r\n\nobjective rule of notice.\r\n\n          Plaintiff Fernandez developed the reactive bumps, at the\r\n\nsites of the injections, the evening after receiving her third\r\n\ntreatment from Montesinos. At some time in early 1990, she\r\n\nconsulted with Dr. Latoni. Fernandez told Dr. Latoni at that time\r\n\nthat she had received collagen injections from Montesinos at the\r\n\nsite of the reaction. Dr. Latoni treated Fernandez \"nine or ten\r\n\ntimes,\" using kenalog injections and dermabrasion techniques, but\r\n\nto no avail.\r\n\n                              -26-\r\r\n\n          Defendants contend, with support in the record, that by\r\n\nthe time Fernandez finished treatment with Dr. Latoni (the date is\r\n\nnot apparent from the record, but it was well before her visit to\r\n\nDr. Wilkinson), sufficient facts were available to put her on\r\n\nnotice that she had sustained an injury as a result of the\r\n\ninjections administered by Montesinos. That Fernandez was aware of\r\n\na possible link between the injections and her facial deformities\r\n\nis evidenced in her statements to Dr. Latoni, and her discussions\r\n\nwith Montesinos, whom she told about the reaction. When the\r\n\nsymptoms persisted unchanged, even after numerous treatments by\r\n\nDr. Latoni, Fernandez was put on notice that the marks on her face\r\n\nwere not a normal reaction to collagen injections that would \"wear\r\n\naway.\"\r\n\n          Plaintiff Gonzalez had numerous indications, well before\r\n\nher September 1992 visit to Dr. Wilkinson, that her reaction was a\r\n\nresult of the collagen injections that she received from Montesinos\r\n\non October 24, 1989. Montesinos told Gonzalez that she was using\r\n\ncollagen in the injections, and later told her that the reaction\r\n\nmight have been caused by \"dead\" collagen. Although some of the\r\n\ndoctors told Gonzalez that if it was collagen, the reaction would\r\n\ngo away, the bumps did not disappear for over two years. And at\r\n\nleast one of the doctors, Dr. Carranza, explicitly told Gonzalez\r\n\nthat the reaction was related to her facial injections.\r\n\n          The reaction did not subside over time, despite further\r\n\ntreatments from Montesinos. The fact that Gonzalez continued to\r\n\nsee the unlicensed cosmetologist after being advised by her\r\n\n                              -27-\r\r\n\nphysicians that she should not continue to have injections,\r\n\nmoreover, tends to undermine any claim by Gonzalez that she was not\r\n\non notice. Also, as she did with the other doctors that she saw,\r\n\nGonzalez told Dr. Benavent in 1990 that she had received what she\r\n\nbelieved was collagen injected into her face, and that she had\r\n\ndeveloped the rash at the same location as the injections. In his\r\n\nletter to the Collagen Corporation, Dr. Benavent related how\r\n\nGonzalez told him that she believed that Montesinos might have\r\n\ninjected collagen that was not properly refrigerated. Gonzalez was\r\n\ninformed of the letter from Collagen stating that her blood tested\r\n\nnegative for collagen antibodies. After receiving these results,\r\n\nDr. Benavent told Gonzalez that he did not know what had been\r\n\ninjected into her face. \r\n\n          Defendants contend, with support in the record, that\r\n\nGonzalez was aware, when she consulted with the various doctors\r\n\nbetween 1989 and 1991, that her facial deformities were related to\r\n\nthe injection she received in the fall of 1989. She even told\r\n\nDr. Benavent that she suspected that the injection that resulted in\r\n\nher deformities might have contained improperly stored collagen.\r\n\nThe representations of Collagen and Benavent were not enough to\r\n\nundermine an impression, supported by facts known to Gonzalez at\r\n\nthe time, that she had been injured as a result of the particular\r\n\ninjection administered by Montesinos. We conclude that, as a\r\n\nmatter of law, she was on notice.\r\n\n          Like plaintiff Gonzalez, plaintiff Pedreira consulted\r\n\nwith Dr. Benavent; similarly, she received the results of the blood\r\n\n                              -28-\r\r\n\ntests and Dr. Benavent's opinion that the reaction was probably not\r\n\ncaused by collagen. For the reasons just discussed, defendants\r\n\ncontend, with support in the record, that Pedreira told the doctors\r\n\nwith whom she consulted that the bumps on her face appeared after\r\n\nreceiving collagen injections into her face, and that the bumps\r\n\nwere located at the sites of the injections. Pedreira admitted\r\n\nthat in late 1990 she suspected the collagen injection as the\r\n\nculprit in her injury, but that she believed that the symptoms\r\n\nwould just go away. It is true that this belief was based in part\r\n\non the representations of Montesinos, with whom she talked in the\r\n\nsummer of 1990, and who told her to massage the bumps, which would\r\n\neventually go away. We conclude, nevertheless, that as a matter of\r\n\nlaw Pedreira was on notice.\r\n\n          In the present case, each of the plaintiffs had notice\r\n\nwell before September 1992 that her symptoms were related to the\r\n\ncollagen injections administered by Montesinos. Each of the\r\n\nplaintiffs was told by Montesinos, either before the damaging\r\n\ninjections, or after the plaintiff developed the marks on her face,\r\n\nthat Montesinos had used injectable collagen. All of the\r\n\nplaintiffs told their doctors that the marks appeared after\r\n\nreceiving the collagen injections, at the same sites as the\r\n\ninjections. Many of the doctors confirmed plaintiffs' suspicions\r\n\nthat the bumps or marks were a result of the collagen injections.\r\n\nAll of plaintiffs received more than one collagen reaction; most\r\n\nreceived injections after the one that resulted in the rash. That\r\n\nthe red raised bumps were not a normal, more mild, reaction to\r\n\n                              -29-\r\r\n\ncollagen should have been apparent to plaintiffs, given that they\r\n\ndid not experience a similar reaction to any of the other\r\n\ninjections. \r\n\n          Even if the plaintiffs were on notice as to the\r\n\nlikelihood of a legal claim springing from their facial\r\n\ndeformities, an arguable question of fact remains as to whether the\r\n\nrepresentations of Montesinos and others contributed, in a material\r\n\nway, to plaintiffs' delay in bringing suit. In other words, a\r\n\nquestion of material fact remains as to whether the exception to\r\n\nthe notice rule applies in this case. Plaintiffs received repeated\r\n\nreassurances from Montesinos that the reactions would go away. The\r\n\ndoctors consulted by the plaintiffs gave a wide range of diagnoses\r\n\nand prognoses, including reassurances that the symptoms would\r\n\nsubside, statements of uncertainty as to the composition of the\r\n\ninjected material, and prescriptions for treatments that\r\n\npurportedly would remedy the facial marks. The effect of these\r\n\nrepresentations, although not made by the alleged torfeasors, is a\r\n\nfactor to consider in determining whether plaintiffs reasonably\r\n\nrelied on Montesinos' assurances. \r\n\n          After full consideration of the factual record before us\r\n\nin this appeal, we conclude that we cannot say that a finder of\r\n\nfact, reasoning on the basis of the evidence in the record before\r\n\nus, could come to only one finding, a finding for the defendants on\r\n\nthe limitation issue on all claims against all defendants. The\r\n\nevidence in the record in this case is not so one-sided that we can\r\n\nsay that defendants are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\r\n\n                              -30-\r\r\n\nthat the exception to the notice concept does not apply. It is a\r\n\ndefendant's burden, in moving for summary judgment, to establish\r\n\nthat all material facts are undisputed, and that no finder of fact\r\n\ncould reasonably find a genuine dispute of material fact and\r\n\nresolve that dispute in the plaintiff's favor. In view of the\r\n\nrelatively particularized nature of evidence favorable to each\r\n\nplaintiff in this case with respect to reassurances after\r\n\nsuspicions were aroused, in relation to her claim against each\r\n\ndefendant, we cannot say that a finder of fact must find this\r\n\nevidence not creditworthy.\r\n\n          First. The evidence does not compel a finding, as to any\r\n\nplaintiff, that she has failed to show by a preponderance of the\r\n\nevidence that she did not have true knowledge of injury, source of\r\n\ninjury, and awareness of all facts constituting the factual grounds\r\n\nfor legal responsibility of an identifiable actor or supplier of\r\n\ncollagen.\r\n\n          Second. The evidence does not compel a finding, as to\r\n\nany plaintiff, that she has failed to show by a preponderance of\r\n\nthe evidence that she reasonably relied upon repeated assurances by\r\n\nMontesinos and others.\r\n\n          For these reasons, even though we have ruled that but for\r\n\nthe second of the foregoing genuine disputes of fact defendants\r\n\nwould have been entitled to summary judgment under the notice rule\r\n\n(the objective component of the legal test), the judgment for\r\n\ndefendants entered in the trial court must be vacated and the case\r\n\nmust be remanded. We direct, explicitly, that the only limitation-\r\n\n                              -31-\r\r\n\nof-actions issue remaining for proceedings on remand is the issue\r\n\nregarding reasonableness of reliance on assurances of the\r\n\ndefendants, evaluated in the context of evidence of assurances by\r\n\nunaffiliated third parties.\r\n\n          It is so ordered. Costs are awarded to plaintiffs.\r\n\n                              -32-\r\n</pre>",
