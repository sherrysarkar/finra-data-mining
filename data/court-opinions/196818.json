Petitioner David  Silverman,\r\n\nindividually, reported another such loss  on his 1980 tax return.\r\n\nLater, the company and its investors were audited by IRS.  Within\r\n\nthree  years after filing their returns, see 26 U.S.C.   6501(a),\r                                                      \r\n\nthe Silvermans agreed to extend the limitation periods applicable\r\n\nto  these four  reporting  years, by  executing  IRS Form  872-A,\r\n\nentitled Special Consent  to Extend the Time to Assess  Tax.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.   6501(c)(4) (authorizing extensions by agreement).1  \r             \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In  relevant part, the Form 872-A provided that the tax due\r\nfor the specified years     \r\n\n          may be assessed on  or before the 90th (nine-\r\n          tieth)  day after:   (a) the Internal Revenue\r                                                                 \r\n          Service office considering the  case receives\r                                                                 \r\n          Form 872-T, Notice  of Termination of Special\r                                                                 \r\n          Consent  to Extend  the Time  to Assess  Tax,\r                                                                 \r\n          from  the  taxpayer(s); or  (b)  the Internal\r                                              \r\n          Revenue Service mails Form 872-T  to the tax-\r\n          payer(s); or (c) the Internal Revenue Service\r                                \r\n          mails  a notice of  deficiency for such peri-\r\n          ods. . . .\r\n\n(Emphasis added.) \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          Thereafter, the  Silvermans and  IRS signed a  Form 906\r\n\n\"Closing Agreement,\" which  bound them  to the outcome  in a  so-\r\n\ncalled \"controlling  case\" before the  tax court,  relating to  a\r\n\nsimilar  tax shelter.  The  Form 906 closing agreement authorized\r\n\nIRS to assess a tax deficiency within one year after the decision\r\n\nin the controlling case became final, notwithstanding the expira-\r\n\ntion  of  any period  of  limitation prescribed  by  the Internal\r\n\nRevenue Code.   The closing  agreement made no  reference to  the\r\n\nForm 872-A extensions.\r\n\n          The  tax court  ruling in  the controlling  case became\r\n\nfinal on July  18, 1991.   Almost two  years later, IRS  received\r\n\nfrom the  Silvermans separate Forms 872-T,  Notice of Termination\r\n\nof Special Consent to  Extend the Time to Assess Tax, relating to\r\n\nall four tax years.  Within ninety days from its receipt of these\r\n\nForms  872-T, IRS sent notices of income tax deficiencies for the\r\n\ntax years in  question, calculated in  conformity with the  final\r\n\noutcome in the controlling case.  \r\n\n          The Silvermans promptly initiated a tax  court proceed-\r\n\ning,  claiming that  the Form  906 closing  agreement effectively\r\n\nterminated their  earlier  consent  to  extend  indefinitely  the\r\n\nlimitation periods  as previously  indicated in their  Form 872-A\r\n\nfilings,  with the  result  that IRS  was  required to  make  its\r\n\nsupplemental  tax assessments  within  one year  after the  final\r\n\ndecision  in the controlling case.   IRS responded  that the Form\r\n\n906 closing agreement had  no effect upon the earlier  Form 872-A\r\n\nextensions.  \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          The  tax court  rejected the  taxpayers' argument  that\r\n\ntheir  Form 872-A  extensions  were superseded  by  the Form  906\r\n\nclosing  agreement, holding  that  the tax  assessments were  not\r\n\ntime-barred  since  IRS had  issued  its  tax deficiency  notices\r\n\nwithin  ninety days  of its  receipt of  the Forms  872-T.   This\r\n\nappeal followed.      \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          A  tax court decision is reviewed in the same manner as\r\n\na civil judgment in a case tried to the district  court without a\r\n\njury.   See 26 U.S.C.    7482(a); Alexander v. IRS,  72 F.3d 938,\r                                                            \r\n\n941 (1st Cir. 1995).  As  the instant matter was submitted to the\r\n\ntax court on  a stipulated record,  the proper interpretation  of\r\n\nthe Forms 872-A  and the  Form 906 closing  agreement presents  a\r\n\npure  question of  law subject  to plenary review.   Id.  at 941;\r                                                                 \r\n\nHempel v. United States, 14 F.3d 572, 575-76 (11th Cir. 1994).\r                                 \r\n\n          The first  argument raised  by IRS on  appeal, but  by-\r\n\npassed in the tax court, maintains that the Forms 872-A submitted\r\n\nby the  Silvermans extended the  limitation periods  indefinitely\r\n\nand  constituted their agreement to use only Form 872-T to termi-\r                                                      \r\n\nnate  their Form 872-A extensions.   Several circuits, in various\r\n\ncontexts, have declined to enforce attempted terminations of Form\r\n\n872-A extensions  unless correctly  implemented in a  manner pre-\r\n\nscribed  within Form 872-A itself.2  See, e.g., Coggin v. Commis-\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Form 872-A plainly states, on its face, that its indefinite\r\nextension of a statute of limitations terminates on the ninetieth\r\nday following one  of three events:   (1) the  receipt by IRS  of\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsioner,  71 F.3d 855, 861-62 (11th Cir. 1996) (sending Form 872-T\r                \r\n\nto wrong IRS division); Stenclik v.

Commissioner, 875 F.2d 812, 813 (10th Cir. 1989).\r                                     \r\n\n          The Silvermans note  that no court  of appeals has  yet\r\n\ndecided  whether  a Form  906  closing  agreement constitutes  an\r\n\nexception  to this  exclusivity  rule.   Nonetheless, a  district\r\n\ncourt  has rejected the contention that a Form 906 closing agree-\r\n\nment effectively terminates a Form 872-A extension.  See DeSantis\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. United States, 783 F.Supp. 165, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).  Nor  are\r                          \r\n\nwe  persuaded by  the bald  assertion that  DeSantis  was wrongly\r                                                              \r\n\ndecided.   Furthermore, as  it appears entirely  appropriate that\r\n\nForm 872-A  extensions be  literally construed, cf.  Badaracco v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCommissioner, 464  U.S. 386,  391-92 (1984) (statutes  of limita-\r                      \r\n\ntions on tax collections are to be strictly construed in favor of\r\n\nIRS), and we are presented with no principled basis for not doing\r\n\nso, there is  every reason to conclude that the  Form 906 closing\r\n\nagreement did  not constitute a  valid termination device  in the\r\n\ninstant case. \r\n\n          Form  872-A was  designed to  eliminate the  repetitive\r\n\ntask of renewing extensions of  limitation periods, and to  mini-\r\n\nmize  the  daunting  administrative  burden of  preventing  their\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nForm 872-T from  the taxpayer; (2)  the mailing of Form  872-T by\r\nIRS to  the taxpayer; or (3)  the mailing by IRS  of a deficiency\r                                  \r\nnotice to the taxpayer.

Petitioner David Silverman, individually, reported another such loss on his 1980 tax return.   Later, the company and its investors were audited by IRS.   Within three years after filing their returns, see 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6501(a), the Silvermans agreed to extend the limitation periods applicable to these four reporting years, by executing IRS Form 872-A, entitled Special Consent to Extend the Time to Assess Tax.   See id. &#167; 6501(c)(4) (authorizing extensions by agreement).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the Silvermans and IRS signed a Form 906 \"Closing Agreement,\" which bound them to the outcome in a so-called \"controlling case\" before the tax court, relating to a similar tax shelter.   The Form 906 closing agreement authorized IRS to assess a tax deficiency within one year after the decision in the controlling case became final, notwithstanding the expiration of any period of limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code.   The closing agreement made no reference to the Form 872-A extensions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax court ruling in the controlling case became final on July 18, 1991.   Almost two years later, IRS received from the Silvermans separate Forms 872-T, Notice of Termination of Special Consent to Extend the Time to Assess Tax, relating to all four tax years.   Within ninety days from its receipt of these Forms 872-T, IRS sent notices of income tax deficiencies for the tax years in question, calculated in conformity with the final outcome in the controlling case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Silvermans promptly initiated a tax court proceeding, claiming that the Form 906 closing agreement effectively terminated their earlier consent to extend indefinitely the limitation periods as previously indicated in their Form 872-A filings, with the result that IRS was required to make its supplemental tax assessments within one year after the final decision in the controlling case.   IRS responded that the Form 906 closing agreement had no effect upon the earlier Form 872-A extensions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax court rejected the taxpayers' argument that their Form 872-A extensions were superseded by the Form 906 closing agreement, holding that the tax assessments were not time-barred since IRS had issued its tax deficiency notices within ninety days of its receipt of the Forms 872-T.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A tax court decision is reviewed in the same manner as a civil judgment in a case tried to the district court without a jury.   See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7482(a);  Alexander v. IRS, 72 F.3d 938, 941 (1st Cir.1995).   As the instant matter was submitted to the tax court on a stipulated record, the proper interpretation of the Forms 872-A and the Form 906 closing agreement presents a pure question of law subject to plenary review.  Id. at 941;  Hempel v. United States, 14 F.3d 572, 575-76 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first argument raised by IRS on appeal, but bypassed in the tax court, maintains that the Forms 872-A submitted by the Silvermans extended the limitation periods indefinitely and constituted their agreement to use only Form 872-T to terminate their Form 872-A extensions.   Several circuits, in various contexts, have declined to enforce attempted terminations of Form 872-A extensions unless correctly implemented in a manner prescribed within Form 872-A itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., Coggin v. Commissioner, 71 F.3d 855, 861-62 (11th Cir.1996) (sending Form 872-T to wrong IRS division);  Stenclik v. Commissioner, 907 F.2d 25, 27 (2d Cir.)  (passage of reasonable time), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 984, 111 S.Ct. 516, 112 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990);  Kernen v. Commissioner, 902 F.2d 17, 18 (9th Cir.1990) (executing Form 872 containing specific consent-termination date);  Wall v. Commissioner, 875 F.2d 812, 813 (10th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Silvermans note that no court of appeals has yet decided whether a Form 906 closing agreement constitutes an exception to this exclusivity rule.   Nonetheless, a district court has rejected the contention that a Form 906 closing agreement effectively terminates a Form 872-A extension.   See DeSantis v. United States, 783 F.Supp. 165, 169 (S.D.N.Y.1992).   Nor are we persuaded by the bald assertion that DeSantis was wrongly decided.   Furthermore, as it appears entirely appropriate that Form 872-A extensions be literally construed, cf. Badaracco v. Commissioner, 464 U.S. 386, 391-92, 104 S.Ct. 756, 760-61, 78 L.Ed.2d 549 (1984) (statutes of limitations on tax collections are to be strictly construed in favor of IRS), and we are presented with no principled basis for not doing so, there is every reason to conclude that the Form 906 closing agreement did not constitute a valid termination device in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Form 872-A was designed to eliminate the repetitive task of renewing extensions of limitation periods, and to minimize the daunting administrative burden of preventing their inadvertent expiration before a reliable tax assessment can be made.   Rev.Proc. 79-22, &#167; 2.03, 1979-1 C.B. 563;  see also Stenclik, 907 F.2d at 27 (noting that Form 872-T reduces litigation);  Kernen, 902 F.2d at 18 (standardized form required to cope with millions of taxpayer communications).   A plain need for certainty prompted IRS to devise Form 872-T as the exclusive means, apart from mailing a deficiency notice, for either the IRS or taxpayers to terminate a Form 872-A consent to extend a limitation period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Given the unmistakable language employed in Revenue Procedure 79-22 and in Form 872-A itself, as well as the evident importance of the policy considerations at work in the tax collection context, we adhere to the plain language of Forms 872-A and 872-T, as informed by the applicable Revenue Procedure, see supra note 3, in holding that the Form 906 closing agreement did not terminate these Form 872-A extensions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that a contrary ruling is not necessary to protect legitimate taxpayer interests in closing out past tax years.   First, taxpayers need never agree to extend the prescribed three-year limitation period.   See Stange v. United States, 282 U.S. 270, 276, 51 S.Ct. 145, 147, 75 L.Ed. 335 (1931) (consenting to extension is a \"voluntary, unilateral waiver of a defense by the taxpayer\").   Moreover, taxpayers may execute waivers for prescribed periods by using Form 872, see Coggin, 71 F.3d at 861, and in all events Form 872-T is available as a simple and effective means to terminate indefinite Form 872-A extensions.   Finally, if petitioners had intended to limit IRS to the time specified in the Form 906 closing agreement, they need simply have filed Forms 872-T, as they eventually did.   Accordingly, we can discern no sound reason to adopt a strained interpretation of Form 872-A to excuse their failure to submit Form 872-T at an earlier time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Form 906 closing agreement did not supersede the Form 872-A extensions, and petitioners' remaining arguments are without merit, the tax court judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, the Form 872-A provided that the tax due for the specified years--</p>\n        <p>may be assessed on or before the 90th (ninetieth) day after:  (a) the Internal Revenue Service office considering the case receives Form 872-T, Notice of Termination of Special Consent to Extend the Time to Assess Tax, from the taxpayer(s);  or (b) the Internal Revenue Service mails Form 872-T to the taxpayer(s);  or (c) the Internal Revenue Service mails a notice of deficiency for such periods....</p>\n        <p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Form 872-A plainly states, on its face, that its indefinite extension of a statute of limitations terminates on the ninetieth day following one of three events:  (1) the receipt by IRS of Form 872-T from the taxpayer;  (2) the mailing of Form 872-T by IRS to the taxpayer;  or (3) the mailing by IRS of a deficiency notice to the taxpayer.

The Form 906 closing agreement authorized IRS to assess a tax deficiency within one year after the decision in the controlling case became final, notwithstanding the expiration of any period of limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code.   The closing agreement made no reference to the Form 872-A extensions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax court ruling in the controlling case became final on July 18, 1991.   Almost two years later, IRS received from the Silvermans separate Forms 872-T, Notice of Termination of Special Consent to Extend the Time to Assess Tax, relating to all four tax years.   Within ninety days from its receipt of these Forms 872-T, IRS sent notices of income tax deficiencies for the tax years in question, calculated in conformity with the final outcome in the controlling case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Silvermans promptly initiated a tax court proceeding, claiming that the Form 906 closing agreement effectively terminated their earlier consent to extend indefinitely the limitation periods as previously indicated in their Form 872-A filings, with the result that IRS was required to make its supplemental tax assessments within one year after the final decision in the controlling case.   IRS responded that the Form 906 closing agreement had no effect upon the earlier Form 872-A extensions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax court rejected the taxpayers' argument that their Form 872-A extensions were superseded by the Form 906 closing agreement, holding that the tax assessments were not time-barred since IRS had issued its tax deficiency notices within ninety days of its receipt of the Forms 872-T.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A tax court decision is reviewed in the same manner as a civil judgment in a case tried to the district court without a jury.   See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7482(a);  Alexander v. IRS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196488\"><a href=\"/opinion/196488/alexander-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span>, 941 (1st Cir.1995).   As the instant matter was submitted to the tax court on a stipulated record, the proper interpretation of the Forms 872-A and the Form 906 closing agreement presents a pure question of law subject to plenary review.  Id. at 941;  Hempel v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></span>, 575-76 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first argument raised by IRS on appeal, but bypassed in the tax court, maintains that the Forms 872-A submitted by the Silvermans extended the limitation periods indefinitely and constituted their agreement to use only Form 872-T to terminate their Form 872-A extensions.   Several circuits, in various contexts, have declined to enforce attempted terminations of Form 872-A extensions unless correctly implemented in a manner prescribed within Form 872-A itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., Coggin v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></span>, 861-62 (11th Cir.1996) (sending Form 872-T to wrong IRS division);  Stenclik v.

Nonetheless, a district court has rejected the contention that a Form 906 closing agreement effectively terminates a Form 872-A extension.   See DeSantis v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span>, 169 (S.D.N.Y.1992).   Nor are we persuaded by the bald assertion that DeSantis was wrongly decided.   Furthermore, as it appears entirely appropriate that Form 872-A extensions be literally construed, cf. Badaracco v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111060\"><a href=\"/opinion/111060/badaracco-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 391-92, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111060\"><a href=\"/opinion/111060/badaracco-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span>, 760-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111060\"><a href=\"/opinion/111060/badaracco-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span> (1984) (statutes of limitations on tax collections are to be strictly construed in favor of IRS), and we are presented with no principled basis for not doing so, there is every reason to conclude that the Form 906 closing agreement did not constitute a valid termination device in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Form 872-A was designed to eliminate the repetitive task of renewing extensions of limitation periods, and to minimize the daunting administrative burden of preventing their inadvertent expiration before a reliable tax assessment can be made.   Rev.Proc. 79-22, &#167; 2.03, 1979-1 C.B. 563;  see also Stenclik, 907 F.2d at 27 (noting that Form 872-T reduces litigation);  Kernen, 902 F.2d at 18 (standardized form required to cope with millions of taxpayer communications).   A plain need for certainty prompted IRS to devise Form 872-T as the exclusive means, apart from mailing a deficiency notice, for either the IRS or taxpayers to terminate a Form 872-A consent to extend a limitation period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Given the unmistakable language employed in Revenue Procedure 79-22 and in Form 872-A itself, as well as the evident importance of the policy considerations at work in the tax collection context, we adhere to the plain language of Forms 872-A and 872-T, as informed by the applicable Revenue Procedure, see supra note 3, in holding that the Form 906 closing agreement did not terminate these Form 872-A extensions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that a contrary ruling is not necessary to protect legitimate taxpayer interests in closing out past tax years.   First, taxpayers need never agree to extend the prescribed three-year limitation period.   See Stange v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101637\"><a href=\"/opinion/101637/stange-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 276, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101637\"><a href=\"/opinion/101637/stange-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101637\"><a href=\"/opinion/101637/stange-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span> (1931) (consenting to extension is a \"voluntary, unilateral waiver of a defense by the taxpayer\").   Moreover, taxpayers may execute waivers for prescribed periods by using Form 872, see Coggin, 71 F.3d at 861, and in all events Form 872-T is available as a simple and effective means to terminate indefinite Form 872-A extensions.   Finally, if petitioners had intended to limit IRS to the time specified in the Form 906 closing agreement, they need simply have filed Forms 872-T, as they eventually did.   Accordingly, we can discern no sound reason to adopt a strained interpretation of Form 872-A to excuse their failure to submit Form 872-T at an earlier time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Form 906 closing agreement did not supersede the Form 872-A extensions, and petitioners' remaining arguments are without merit, the tax court judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, the Form 872-A provided that the tax due for the specified years--</p>\n        <p>may be assessed on or before the 90th (ninetieth) day after:  (a) the Internal Revenue Service office considering the case receives Form 872-T, Notice of Termination of Special Consent to Extend the Time to Assess Tax, from the taxpayer(s);  or (b) the Internal Revenue Service mails Form 872-T to the taxpayer(s);  or (c) the Internal Revenue Service mails a notice of deficiency for such periods....</p>\n        <p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Form 872-A plainly states, on its face, that its indefinite extension of a statute of limitations terminates on the ninetieth day following one of three events:  (1) the receipt by IRS of Form 872-T from the taxpayer;  (2) the mailing of Form 872-T by IRS to the taxpayer;  or (3) the mailing by IRS of a deficiency notice to the taxpayer.   See supra note 1</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The applicable Revenue Procedure provides:</p>\n        <p>.02 With the exception of the mailing of a notice of deficiency, written notification by the Service to the taxpayer(s) of termination of Service consideration can only be made using Form 872-T.</p>\n        <p>.03 Written notification to the Internal Revenue Service from the taxpayer(s) of an election to terminate Form 872-A is to be made using Form 872-T.
