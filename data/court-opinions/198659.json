Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n                Hill, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Daniel L. Cummings and Norman, Hanson &amp; DeTroy, LLC on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\n   Ray R. Pallas and Law Office of Ray R. Pallas on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nOctober 1, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  On June 15, 1997, Robert Nelson,\r\nthe appellant in this court, petitioned for bankruptcy protection\r\nunder chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.  701 et seq. \r\nThe petition was filed jointly with his wife Donata Nelson.  Among\r\nthe assets of the estate is the Nelsons' interest in their\r\nPortland, Maine residence, of which each is a 50-percent owner. \r\nThe bankruptcy court has valued the residence--around which this\r\nappeal centers--at $185,000.  (In giving figures throughout, we\r\ndisregard pennies and round out to the nearest dollar.)\r\nSection 522(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \r\n522(b), allows a debtor to exempt from his estate property exempt\r\nunder state or local law.  Maine, in which the Nelsons are\r\napparently domiciled, exempts the debtor's interest in his\r\nresidence but only up to the amount of $12,500.  14 M.R.S.A. \r\n4422.  Even this modest amount is not automatically secure because\r\nthe exemption, standing alone, merely protects the assets from\r\ndistribution to the general creditors; the exemption itself is not\r\ndeemed to nullify liens that give secured creditors a security\r\ninterest in property.  Dewsnup v. Timm, 502 U.S. 410, 418 (1992);\r\nOwen v. Owen, 500 U.S. 305, 308 (1991).\r\nHowever, in 1978, Congress separately provided that the\r\ndebtor may \"avoid\" certain liens under certain circumstances where\r\nthe lien would \"impair an exemption,\" Bankruptcy Reform Act of\r\n1978, Pub. L. No. 95-598,  522(f), 92 Stat. 2549, 2589 (1978)\r\n(codified as amended at 11 U.S.C.  522(f)); and it later adopted\r\na definition of this impairment concept.  Bankruptcy Reform Act of\r\n1994, Pub. L. No. 103-394,  303, 108 Stat. 4106, 4132 (1994)\r\n(codified at 11 U.S.C.  522(f)(2)(A)).  Ordinary real property\r\nmortgages are not avoidable but among liens that may be avoided are\r\nmost (although not all) \"judicial liens,\" such as those imposed to\r\nsecure an ordinary civil judgment.  11 U.S.C.  522(f)(1)(A).\r\nOn August 11, 1997, Robert Nelson invoked this avoidance \r\nprovision by requesting the bankruptcy court to avoid in their\r\nentirety two existing judicial liens held by Joseph Scala in the\r\namount of $24,000 against Robert Nelson's interest in the\r\nresidence; this amount was owed to Scala by Robert Nelson alone and\r\nDonata Nelson's interest in the property was not subject to the\r\nScala liens.  No challenge was made to four other mortgages upon,\r\nand a tax lien against, the property, totaling $134,626 and\r\nrepresenting joint obligations of both Nelsons.  Thus, apart from\r\nthe Scala liens, the Nelsons' net equity in the residence was only\r\n$50,374 ($185,000-$134,626).    \r\nIn due course, the bankruptcy court ruled that Robert\r\nNelson was entitled to avoid the Scala liens only to the extent\r\nnecessary to preserve $12,500 for Robert Nelson out of his half of\r\nthe couple's net equity; since his share of the couple's net equity\r\nwas $25,187 (50% of $50,374), the court ordered the Scala liens \r\navoided in the amount of $11,313, leaving $12,687 encumbered for\r\nScala and $12,500 for Robert Nelson.  The district court affirmed,\r\nNelson v. Scala, 229 B.R. 262 (D. Me. (1998)), and Robert Nelson\r\nnow seeks review in this court, urging that he is entitled to have\r\nthe Scala liens set aside in their entirety.\r\nAt first blush, Robert Nelson's claim appears to be\r\noverreaching because the evident purpose of the avoidance provision\r\nwas to permit him to keep free of judicial liens only his exempt\r\nproperty and Robert Nelson's exemption as to his residence is only\r\n$12,500.  While the Scala liens must be avoided in part to allow\r\nNelson this amount (otherwise they would capture $24,000 of Robert\r\nNelson's $25,187 equity), avoiding the liens in full would appear\r\neither to give Robert Nelson a windfall or enrich the general\r\ncreditors at the expense of Scala as a secured creditor.  One would\r\nexpect that the differential would go to the general creditors (see\r\ndiscussion below) although Robert Nelson may be litigating this\r\ncase on the basis of a contrary assumption.\r\nNevertheless, Robert Nelson's claim to full avoidance of\r\nthe Scala liens rests on statutory language, presenting a legal\r\nissue subject to de novo review in this court.  Strickland v.\r\nCommissioner, Me. Dep't of Human Servs., 96 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  This claim is based on the peculiar language that Congress\r\nadopted in defining the concept of \"impairment\" of an exemption for\r\npurposes of section 522(f).  Section 522(f)(2)(A) provides:\r\n     For the purposes of this subsection, a lien\r\nshall be considered to impair an exemption to\r\nthe extent that the sum of--\r\n\n         (i) the lien;\r\n\n         (ii) all other liens on the property;  \r\n       and\r\n\n      (iii) the amount of the\r\n  exemption that the debtor could\r\n  claim if there were no liens on\r\n  the property;\r\n\n  exceeds the value that the debtor's interest\r\nin the property would have in the absence of\r\nany liens.\r\n\n11 U.S.C.  522(f)(2)(A).\r\nRobert Nelson points out that under this formula \"the\r\nlien\" sought to be avoided is $24,000; \"all other liens\" on the\r\nproperty total $134,626; and \"the amount of the exemption\" absent\r\nany liens is $12,500.  The \"sum\" of these three figures-- $171,126-\r\n-exceeds \"the debtor's interest in the property in the absence of\r\nany liens\"--here, $92,500 (50% of $185,000)--by almost $80,000. \r\nThus, says Robert Nelson, the courts must treat the Scala liens as\r\nimpairing the exemption \"to the extent\" of this differential, which\r\n(at almost $80,000) greatly exceeds the Scala liens ($24,000) in\r\ntheir entirety.  If the statute were taken literally, this would\r\nrender the Scala liens liable to avoidance in full.\r\nSuch a result would need some explaining.  Exemptions\r\nserve the \"fresh start\" aim of the bankruptcy statute, as well as\r\nother social ends, by preserving certain assets--like an interest\r\nin the bankrupt residence or the debtor's work tools--against most\r\nclaims by general creditors.  But, as already noted, under the Code\r\nexemptions do not themselves defeat security interests in property. \r\nAn expressed purpose of Congress in enacting section 522(f)'s\r\navoidance provision was to prevent unsecured creditors from\r\nbypassing exemptions simply by converting their claims into\r\njudicial liens and obtaining security interests in otherwise exempt\r\nproperty.  H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, 126-27 (1977), reprinted in 1978\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6087-88.\r\nThis aim--to protect the debtor's exemption--is fully\r\nachieved by allowing Robert Nelson to avoid the Scala liens in\r\npart, as ordered by the district court, since this would free up\r\nfor Nelson his full $12,500 exempt interest.  Yet, mechanically\r\napplied, the formula in section 522(f)(2)(A) perversely seems to\r\ncall for avoidance of the Scala liens in full and to Scala's\r\ndisadvantage.  Courts are not required to follow literal language\r\nwhere it would produce an outcome at odds with the purpose of\r\nCongress and where the result stems merely from an unintended quirk\r\nin drafting.  E.g., Sagansky v. United States, 358 F.2d 195, 201\r\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 816 (1966).  \r\nThe legislative history of the amendment that added the\r\n(2)(A) formula to subsection (f) is instructive.  The House report\r\nmakes clear that Congress was dissatisfied with the results reached\r\nby pre-amendment decisions in four cases interpreting section\r\n522(f) and was adopting the new formula to alter the results.  H.R.\r\nRep. No. 103-835, 52-54 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N.\r\n3340, 3361-63.  For each scenario, the report cites the case and\r\nexplains why Congress proposed to change the outcome for future\r\ncases.  Id.  But in each of the scenarios, the court's result (to\r\nbe overruled by the amendment) in some fashion impaired an\r\nexemption or an exempt interest in property to the disadvantage of\r\nthe debtor; and in none did the scenario resemble that presented by\r\nRobert Nelson's case.\r\nAs already shown, the partial avoidance of the Scala\r\nliens ordered by the district court leaves exactly $12,500 for\r\nRobert Nelson as exempt property not subject to any lien.  See note\r\n3, above.  Further, were the Scala liens to be avoided in full, the\r\nMaine exemption would still entitle Robert Nelson to keep only\r\n$12,500; the balance of his remaining equity (after the mortgages\r\nand tax lien) seemingly would go to satisfy general creditors,\r\nincluding among others the now unsecured Scala claim.  It serves no\r\nknown purpose of the 1994 amendment merely to rearrange priorities\r\namong creditors.\r\nWhere Congressional language diverges from apparent\r\npurpose, no simple answer tells the court which path to follow in\r\ninterpreting the statute.  More than one variable bears on the\r\nchoice--explicitness of language, clarity of purpose, explanation\r\nfor the discrepancy between them, the unfairness or anomaly worked\r\nby the literal application--and each is a matter of degree.  But\r\nalong with much else, judging involves making such judgments,\r\nalways difficult where Congress did not focus upon the precise\r\nproblem before the court.  Here, a literal reading of the formula\r\nproduces a measure of lien avoidance that goes beyond the\r\nprotection that Congress sought to provide for the debtor and\r\nsimply distorts priorities as between creditors.\r\nThere is no circuit precedent directly in point.  Scala\r\nsays that we rejected a \"formalistic\" (i.e., literal) reading of\r\nthe formula in In re Silveira, 141 F.3d 34, 36-38 (1st Cir. 1998). \r\nBut while Silveira stressed the same practical concerns that we do,\r\nthe opinion was also able to square its result with the formula's\r\nlanguage.  See In re Silveira.  That is harder to do in this case\r\nwhere (unlike Silveira) a literal application of the formula\r\nproduces an outcome at odds with statutory purpose.  This contrast\r\nis apparent if one troubles to insert into the statutory formula\r\nthe figures from each case.\r\nThe reason why the statutory formula does not quite\r\n\"work\" in our case has to do with the asymmetry of obligations as\r\nbetween Robert Nelson and his wife (remember that both are\r\nobligated on five of the debts but only Robert is liable on the\r\nstatutory liens).  As the bankruptcy and district courts proved in\r\ntheir respective opinions, it is possible to adjust for this\r\nasymmetry--each judge used a different adjustment--to produce the\r\npartial avoidance result that we affirm.  But it is not clear that\r\neither adjustment will work in every variant case; and neither\r\nreally avoids the charge that the court is departing from a literal\r\nreading of the formula.\r\nHowever, the result reached by the bankruptcy and\r\ndistrict courts achieves Congress's aim to protect in full (but\r\nonly in full) Robert Nelson's exempt interest in his residence.  To\r\ngo beyond this would work an injustice to Scala, provide a windfall\r\nto other creditors, and (so far as we can tell) fail to benefit\r\nRobert Nelson at all, let alone benefit him in any way intended by\r\nCongress.  In these circumstances, we think that the departure from\r\nliteral language--always a step to be taken with hesitation--is\r\nnevertheless well justified.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

L. No. 95-598,  522(f), 92 Stat. 2549, 2589 (1978) (codified as amended at 11 U.S.C.  522(f)); and it later adopted a definition of this impairment concept. Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-394,  303, 108 Stat. 4106, 4132 (1994) (codified at 11 U.S.C.  522(f)(2)(A)). Ordinary real property mortgages are not avoidable but among liens that may be avoided are most (although not all) \"judicial liens,\" such as those imposed to secure an ordinary civil judgment. 11 U.S.C.  522(f)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 1997, Robert Nelson invoked this avoidance provision by requesting the bankruptcy court to avoid in their entirety two existing judicial liens held by Joseph Scala in the amount of $ 24,000 against Robert Nelson's interest in the residence; this amount was owed to Scala by Robert Nelson alone and Donata Nelson's interest in the property was not subject to the Scala liens. No challenge was made to four other    mortgages upon, and a tax lien against, the property, totaling $ 134,626 and representing joint obligations of both Nelsons. Thus, apart from the Scala liens, the Nelsons' net equity in the residence was only $ 50,374 ($ 185,000 - $ 134,626).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the bankruptcy court ruled that Robert Nelson was entitled to avoid the Scala liens only to the extent necessary to preserve $ 12,500 for Robert Nelson out of his half of the couple's net equity; since his share of the couple's net equity was $ 25,187 (50% of $ 50,374), the court ordered the Scala liens avoided in the amount of $ 11,313, leaving $ 12,687 encumbered for Scala and $ 12,500 for Robert Nelson. The district court affirmed, Nelson v. Scala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1550311\"><a href=\"/opinion/1550311/in-re-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span> (D.

While the Scala liens must be avoided in    part to allow Nelson this amount (otherwise they would capture $ 24,000 of Robert Nelson's $ 25,187 equity), avoiding the liens in full would appear either to give Robert Nelson a windfall or enrich the general creditors at the expense of Scala as a secured creditor. One would expect that the differential would go to the general creditors (see discussion below) although Robert Nelson may be litigating this case on the basis of a contrary assumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Robert Nelson's claim to full avoidance of the Scala liens rests on statutory language, presenting a legal issue subject to de novo review in this court. Strickland v. Commissioner, Me. Dep't of Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196992\"><a href=\"/opinion/196992/strickland-v-comm-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 545 (1st Cir. 1996). This claim is based on the peculiar language that Congress adopted in defining the concept of \"impairment\" of an exemption for purposes of section 522(f). Section 522(f)(2)(A) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this subsection, a lien shall be      considered to impair an exemption to the extent that the      sum of--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) the lien;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) all other liens on the property; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) the amount of the exemption that the debtor could      claim if there were no liens on the property;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">exceeds the value that the debtor's interest in the      property would have in the absence of any liens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C.  522(f)(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert Nelson points out that under this formula \"the lien\" sought to be avoided is $ 24,000; \"all other liens\" on the property total $ 134,626; and \"the amount of the exemption\" absent any liens is $ 12,500. The \"sum\" of these three figures-- $ 171,126--exceeds \"the debtor's interest in the property in the absence of any liens\"--here, $ 92,500 (50% of $ 185,000)--by almost $ 80,000. Thus, says Robert Nelson, the courts must treat the Scala liens as impairing the exemption \"to the extent\" of this differential, which (at almost $ 80,000) greatly exceeds the Scala liens ($ 24,000) in their entirety. If the statute were taken literally, this would render the Scala liens liable to avoidance in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a result would need some explaining. Exemptions serve the \"fresh start\" aim of the bankruptcy statute, as well as other social ends, by preserving certain assets--like an interest in the bankrupt residence or the debtor's work tools--against most claims by general creditors. But, as already noted, under the Code exemptions    do not themselves defeat security interests in property. An expressed purpose of Congress in enacting section 522(f)'s avoidance provision was to prevent unsecured creditors from bypassing exemptions simply by converting their claims into judicial liens and obtaining security interests in otherwise exempt property. H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, 126-27 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6087-88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This aim--to protect the debtor's exemption--is fully achieved by allowing Robert Nelson to avoid the Scala liens in part, as ordered by the district court, since this would free up for Nelson his full $ 12,500 exempt interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Yet, mechanically applied, the formula in section 522(f)(2)(A) perversely seems to call for avoidance of the Scala liens in full and to Scala's disadvantage. Courts are not required to follow literal language where it would produce an outcome at odds with the purpose of Congress and where the result stems merely from an unintended quirk in drafting. E.g., Sagansky v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"271129\"><a href=\"/opinion/271129/harry-sagansky-v-united-states-of-america-morris-weinstein-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 201 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

The House report makes clear that Congress was dissatisfied with the results reached by pre-amendment decisions in four cases interpreting section 522(f) and was adopting the new formula to alter the results. H.R. Rep. No. 103-835, 52-54 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3340, 3361-63. For each scenario, the report cites the case and explains why Congress proposed to change the outcome for future cases. Id. But in each of the scenarios, the court's result (to be overruled by the amendment) in some fashion impaired an exemption or an exempt interest in property to the disadvantage of the debtor; and in none did the scenario resemble that presented by Robert Nelson's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already shown, the partial avoidance of the Scala liens ordered by the district court leaves exactly $ 12,500 for Robert Nelson as exempt property not subject to any lien.
