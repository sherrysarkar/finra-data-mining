Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Mayra Vazquez-Morales for appellant.\n     Mirta E. Rodriguez-Mora for appellees Dr. Edwin Bossolo-\nLopez; Irma Rivera-de-Bossolo; Conyugal Partnership, Bossolo-\nRivera;   Sindicato  de  Aseguaradores   de  Impericia  Medico\nHospitalaria.\n     Roberto Marques-Sanchez for appellee Ashford Presbyterian\nCommunity Hospital.\n\fFebruary 15, 2001\n\f              COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.        This is a diversity tort\n\naction, brought in the district court of Puerto Rico, in which\n\nthe plaintiff-appellant, who alleged medical malpractice against\n\na    doctor    and   a   hospital,   appeals     from    a    grant    of   summary\n\njudgment for defendants-appellees that dismissed the action as\n\ntime barred.         We affirm.\n\n              After suffering burns on her legs from an oven mishap,\n\nappellant received treatment from appellee, Dr. Bossolo-Lopez,\n\non November 24, 1988.             On the next day, she received further\n\ntreatment       from     appellee,     Ashford    Presbyterian          Community\n\nHospital.      Three days later on November 28th, appellant, still\n\nin   pain     and    unsatisfied,    sought    further       medical   help   from\n\nanother doctor, who told her she had been negligently treated by\n\nboth Dr. Bossolo and the hospital.\n\n              The law of Puerto Rico, which governs this diversity\n\ncase, sets a one-year statute of limitations for tort actions.\n\n31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5298; see also Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr.,\n\nInc., 14 F.3d 684, 689 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"A federal court sitting\n\nin diversity jurisdiction and called upon in that role to apply\n\nstate law is absolutely bound by a current interpretation of\n\nthat law formulated by the state's highest tribunal.\").                       Suit\n\nwas brought on July 5, 1990, long after November 29, 1989, when\n\nthe one-year period expired.            Under Puerto Rico law, however,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe period of limitation may be tolled by one of three events:\n\na court action, an acknowledgment of debt by a debtor, or an\n\nextrajudicial claim.          31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5303.         The issue\n\npresented in this case is whether the one-year limitations\n\nperiod was tolled by subsequent extrajudicial claims.\n\n          Five        letters,    appellant      argues,      constituted\n\nextrajudicial claims that tolled the statute of limitations.\n\nThe   first   three    were   considered    in   a   motion   for   summary\n\njudgment; the latter two were presented in a post-judgment\n\nmotion for reconsideration.        The district court found that the\n\nfirst letter, sent on March 21, 1989, by appellant's counsel to\n\nDr. Bossolo, who acknowledged receipt, met the criteria of an\n\nextrajudicial claim required by Puerto Rico law.           This preserved\n\nthe cause of action until March 22, 1990, but was of no avail to\n\nappellant, whose suit was not filed until almost four months\n\nlater.    A   second     letter   from    appellant's    counsel    to   Dr.\n\nBossolo's insurer dated July 5, 1989, enclosed a medical report\n\ndiagnosing appellant's allegedly inadequate treatment.                   The\n\ndistrict court held that this letter lacked the specificity\n\nneeded to state an extrajudicial claim.          The third letter, dated\n\nNovember 22, 1989, sent by appellant to the hospital, was found\n\nto meet all of the requirements of an extrajudicial claim, but\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fdid not toll the statute of limitations because there was no\n\nproof the hospital actually received the letter.\n\n            After    the   court       rendered    summary    judgment     for\n\nappellees, appellant moved for reconsideration, seeking to amend\n\nthe judgment.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).            Appended to that\n\nmotion were two letters, dated November 10 and November 17,\n\n1989, in which the hospital purportedly acknowledged appellant's\n\nclaim.    The court denied the motion in a margin endorsement.\n\n            As there is no dispute over the adequacy of the March\n\n21st letter, we begin our analysis with the July 5th letter,\n\nwhich     reportedly submitted a medical report to Dr. Bossolo’s\n\ninsurer    and   indicated      that   counsel    was   willing   to   discuss\n\nsettlement.      We say \"reportedly\" because the letter, written in\n\nSpanish, has not been produced in the appendix in an English\n\ntranslation.     Under our local rules, this Court may not consider\n\nnon-English documents unless a translation is provided.                See 1st\n\nCir. R. 30.7 (“The court will not receive documents not in the\n\nEnglish language unless translations are furnished.”).                  In the\n\npast we have refused to consider untranslated documents provided\n\nin an appendix.     See United States v. Angueira, 951 F.2d 12, 14\n\nn.1 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            In   this   case,    the   district    court,    without    demur,\n\naccepted the untranslated document, referring to it in the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fsummary judgment ruling.            It was a letter of only four lines of\n\ntext,   from   which      we   might       accurately     divine       the    essential\n\nmessage.       But    overlooking          our   mandatory      rule     would       raise\n\ndifficult      questions:        Can       the   district       court's         generous\n\naccommodation render meaningless our rule governing appellate\n\npresentations?           Can   we    feel    free   to    invoke       the     rule   for\n\ncommunications       we    deem      complex      but    ignore        the    rule    for\n\nrelatively simple documents we feel competent to interpret?                             To\n\nanswer either of these questions affirmatively would make our\n\n\"rule\" no more subject to even application than the legendary\n\nchancellor's foot.         What might be sensible in the benign arena\n\nof equity is not transferable to a workable rule of procedure.\n\n            All      counsel,        therefore,         have    the          undelegable\n\nresponsibility       to   know      and    follow   the    rules       applicable      to\n\nappeals in this court.              That translations may not have been\n\ninsisted upon by a district court does not give license to\n\nignore the appellate rules.               Our insistence on adhering to Local\n\nRule 30.7 arises not from any ideological preference but from a\n\nrecognition       that    loose      application        leads     to     uneven,      and\n\ntherefore unjust, treatment.\n\n            We therefore do not consider the July 5th letter, nor\n\nthe other untranslated Spanish letters.                  For whatever balm it is\n\nworth, we do not think appellant is sorely prejudiced by this\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fprocedural       misstep.       Puerto       Rico    law     takes     a    restrictive\n\napproach    to     recognizing        extrajudicial         claims.         See,    e.g.,\n\nAndino-Pastrana v. Municipio De San Juan, 215 F.3d 179, 180 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); Fernandez v. Chardon, 681 F.2d 42, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n1982) (citing Diaz de Diana v. A.J.A.S. Ins. Co., 110 P.R.R.\n\n602, 607-08 n.1 (1980) (\"[A]nything causing an interruption must\n\nbe    interpreted      restrictively.\")).             The    Puerto        Rico   Supreme\n\nCourt's    recent      application         of     extrajudicial       claim       tolling\n\nindicates its limited nature.                    See De Leon Crespo v. Caparra\n\nCenter, 99 TSPR 24 (1999) (trans.).\n\n            In    De   Leon    Crespo,       the    Puerto     Rico    Supreme      Court\n\nconstrued    a     letter     from    a    claimant      who   refused       a    nominal\n\nsettlement and added, \"[w]e will promptly file the pertinent\n\naction in the Courts of Puerto Rico.\"                    Id., Offic. Trans. at 6.\n\nThe court found this language \"not a model of perfection, but at\n\nleast it met the minimum requirements for an extrajudicial\n\nclaim.\"      Id.    at   8.      It       held    that   the   letter       tolled      the\n\napplicable statute.           The letter of July 5th, by contrast, \"did\n\nnot    contain     the   precision         and     specificity        needed      for    an\n\nextrajudicial claim.\"          Dist. Ct. Op. at 9.              In short, we doubt\n\nthe July 5th letter would qualify as an extrajudicial claim.\n\n            The third letter, that of November 22, 1989, written\n\nin English, met all extrajudicial claim requirements except for\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fproof of receipt by the putative tortfeasor.          At oral argument,\n\ncounsel for the first time sought to rely on an unidentified\n\nstatutory presumption of receipt where letters were properly\n\naddressed and mailed.    This argument had never been made in the\n\ndistrict court or briefed to us, and is therefore waived.             See,\n\ne.g., Romero v. Colegio De Abogados De Puerto Rico, 204 F.3d\n\n291, 296 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n          This brings us to the last two letters, which didn't\n\nsurface until after summary judgment.           Two procedural barriers\n\nbar our consideration of these letters.          First, the letters of\n\nNovember 10th and 17th, like the July 5th letter, were provided\n\nto us only in Spanish.   Second, they were first disclosed to the\n\ndistrict court in a post-judgment motion for reconsideration,\n\nwithout   any   explanation   of   why   they    could   not   have   been\n\ndiscovered earlier.     See Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d\n\n22, 25 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[W]e will not overturn the trial\n\ncourt's decision on [a motion for reconsideration] unless the\n\nappellant can persuade us that the refusal to grant the motion\n\nwas a manifest abuse of discretion.\").          We find no such abuse.\n\n          Finally, we do not reach appellant's argument that a\n\n\"relationship of solidarity\" between Dr. Bossolo and Ashford\n\nHospital made them joint tortfeasors such that a claim which\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\ftolled for one, tolled for the other.   This argument founders on\n\nour failure to discern any qualifying extrajudicial claim.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -9-\n\f",

Suit was brought on July 5, 1990, long after November 29, 1989, when the one-year period expired. Under Puerto Rico law, however, the period of limitation may be tolled by one of three events: a court action, an acknowledgment of debt by a debtor, or an extrajudicial claim. 31 P.R.

See Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[W]e will not overturn the trial court's decision on [a motion for reconsideration] unless the appellant can persuade us that the refusal to grant the motion was a manifest abuse of discretion.\").

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After suffering burns on her legs from an oven mishap, appellant received treatment from appellee, Dr. Bossolo-Lopez, on November 24, 1988. On the next day, she received further treatment from appellee, Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital. Three days later on November 28th, appellant, still in pain and unsatisfied, sought further medical help from another doctor, who told her she had been negligently treated by both Dr. Bossolo and the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law of Puerto Rico, which governs this diversity case, sets a one-year statute of limitations for tort actions. 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5298; see also Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 689 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"A federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction and called upon in that role to apply state law is absolutely bound by a current interpretation of that law formulated by the state's highest tribunal.\"). Suit was brought on July 5, 1990, long after November 29, 1989, when the one-year period expired. Under Puerto Rico law, however, the period of limitation may be tolled by one of three events: a court action, an acknowledgment of debt by a debtor, or an extrajudicial claim. 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5303. The issue presented in this case is whether the one-year limitations period was tolled by subsequent extrajudicial claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five letters, appellant argues, constituted extrajudicial claims that tolled the statute of limitations. The first three were considered in a motion for summary judgment; the latter two were presented in a post-judgment motion for reconsideration. The district court found that the first letter, sent on March 21, 1989, by appellant's counsel to Dr. Bossolo, who acknowledged receipt, met the criteria of an extrajudicial claim required by Puerto Rico law. This preserved the cause of action until March 22, 1990, but was of no avail to appellant, whose suit was not filed until almost four months later. A second letter from appellant's counsel to Dr. Bossolo's insurer dated July 5, 1989, enclosed a medical report diagnosing appellant's allegedly inadequate treatment. The district court held that this letter lacked the specificity needed to state an extrajudicial claim. The third letter, dated November 22, 1989, sent by appellant to the hospital, was found to meet all of the requirements of an extrajudicial claim, but did not toll the statute of limitations because there was no proof the hospital actually received the letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court rendered summary judgment for appellees, appellant moved for reconsideration, seeking to amend the judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). Appended to that motion were two letters, dated November 10 and November 17, 1989, in which the hospital purportedly acknowledged appellant's claim. The court denied the motion in a margin endorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there is no dispute over the adequacy of the March 21st letter, we begin our analysis with the July 5th letter, which reportedly submitted a medical report to Dr. Bossolo's insurer and indicated that counsel was willing to discuss settlement. We say \"reportedly\" because the letter, written in Spanish, has not been produced in the appendix in an English translation. Under our local rules, this Court may not consider non-English documents unless a translation is provided. See 1st Cir. R. 30.7 (\"The court will not receive documents not in the English language unless translations are furnished.\"). In the past we have refused to consider untranslated documents provided in an appendix. See United States v. Angueira, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573152\"><a href=\"/opinion/573152/united-states-v-alexis-javier-angueira/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 14 n.1 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court, without demur, accepted the untranslated document, referring to it in the summary judgment ruling. It was a letter of only four lines of text, from which we might accurately divine the essential message. But overlooking our mandatory rule would raise difficult questions: Can the district court's generous accommodation render meaningless our rule governing appellate presentations? Can we feel free to invoke the rule for communications we deem complex but ignore the rule for relatively simple documents we feel competent to interpret? To answer either of these questions affirmatively would make our \"rule\" no more subject to even application than the legendary chancellor's foot. What might be sensible in the benign arena of equity is not transferable to a workable rule of procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All counsel, therefore, have the undelegable responsibility to know and follow the rules applicable to appeals in this court. That translations may not have been insisted upon by a district court does not give license to ignore the appellate rules. Our insistence on adhering to Local Rule 30.7 arises not from any ideological preference but from a recognition that loose application leads to uneven, and therefore unjust, treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore do not consider the July 5th letter, nor the other untranslated Spanish letters. For whatever balm it is worth, we do not think appellant is sorely prejudiced by this procedural misstep. Puerto Rico law takes a restrictive approach to recognizing extrajudicial claims. See, e.g., Andino-Pastrana v. Municipio De San Juan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198974\"><a href=\"/opinion/198974/andino-pastrana-v-municipio-de-san/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 180 (1st Cir. 2000); Fernandez v. Chardon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405331\"><a href=\"/opinion/405331/rafael-rivera-fernandez-v-carlos-chardon-etc-juan-fumero-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir. 1982) (citing Diaz de Diana v. A.J.A.S. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></span>, 607-08 n.1 (1980) (\"[A]nything causing an interruption must be interpreted restrictively.\")). The Puerto Rico Supreme Court's recent application of extrajudicial claim tolling indicates its limited nature. See De Leon Crespo v. Caparra Center, 99 TSPR 24 (1999) (trans.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In De Leon Crespo, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court construed a letter from a claimant who refused a nominal settlement and added, \"[w]e will promptly file the pertinent action in the Courts of Puerto Rico.\" Id., Offic. Trans. at 6. The court found this language \"not a model of perfection, but at least it met the minimum requirements for an extrajudicial claim.\" Id. at 8. It held that the letter tolled the applicable statute. The letter of July 5th, by contrast, \"did not contain the precision and specificity needed for an extrajudicial claim.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 9. In short, we doubt the July 5th letter would qualify as an extrajudicial claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third letter, that of November 22, 1989, written in English, met all extrajudicial claim requirements except for proof of receipt by the putative tortfeasor. At oral argument, counsel for the first time sought to rely on an unidentified statutory presumption of receipt where letters were properly addressed and mailed. This argument had never been made in the district court or briefed to us, and is therefore waived. See, e.g., Romero v. Colegio De Abogados De Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198842\"><a href=\"/opinion/198842/romero-v-colegio-de-abogados/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 296 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the last two letters, which didn't surface until after summary judgment. Two procedural barriers bar our consideration of these letters. First, the letters of November 10th and 17th, like the July 5th letter, were provided to us only in Spanish. Second, they were first disclosed to the district court in a post-judgment motion for reconsideration, without any explanation of why they could not have been discovered earlier.
