Richard Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Althea Garrison on brief pro se.\r\n Joseph G. Donnellan on brief for appellees.\r\n\nApril 2, 1999\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Althea Garrison appeals pro se from a\r\ndistrict court order dismissing her complaint against a union\r\nand various union officials.  Having carefully reviewed the\r\nbriefs and record, we affirm essentially for the reasons stated\r\nby the district court.  We add that a litigant cannot make an\r\nend-run around the six-month limitation period by repackaging\r\na hybrid  301/fair representation suit under the Labor\r\nManagement Relations Act (\"LMRA\") as a claim under the Labor-\r\nManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act (\"LMRDA\").  See Linnanev. General Elec. Co., 948 F.2d 69, 73 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nAccordingly, even if we assume for the sake of argument that\r\nGarrison's amended complaint states a claim under the LMRDA, it\r\nis time-barred.  Finally, Garrison's contention that the\r\ndistrict judge should have recused himself, made for the first\r\ntime in her reply brief, is waived based on her failure to\r\nraise the issue in the district court.  See In re Abijoe Realty\r\nCorp., 943 F.2d 121, 127 (1st Cir. 1991).  In any event, her\r\nsuggestion of a conflict of interest is entirely speculative.\r\n        Affirmed.    \r\n",
