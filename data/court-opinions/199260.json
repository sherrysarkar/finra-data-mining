Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Michael D. Ricciuti, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Stephen B. Hrones, with whom Hrones & Garrity was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       February 6, 2001\n\f\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.        In this sentencing appeal, the\n\ngovernment,    qua    appellant,     protests       the      district     court's\n\nreliance, in granting a downward departure for extraordinary\n\npresentence rehabilitation, on an ex parte conversation with a\n\ncourt-appointed psychologist.           The defendant, Alfred Craven,\n\nresists the government's appeal and simultaneously attempts to\n\npersuade us that the Supreme Court's recent decision in Apprendi\n\nv. New Jersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), demands further paring of\n\nhis   sentence.      Because   Craven      has   not   cross-appealed,        his\n\nApprendi-based claim is not properly before us and we refrain\n\nfrom burrowing into its merits.            This leaves the government's\n\nappeal — an appeal which requires us to consider the district\n\ncourt's authority vel non to engage in ex parte discussions of\n\nsubstantive matters with court-appointed experts.                  We conclude\n\nthat the sentencing court erred in undertaking, and then basing\n\nits departure decision on, an ex parte communication.                   Hence, we\n\nvacate Craven's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n           On June 23, 1999, Craven pleaded guilty to nine counts\n\narising from his involvement in a massive marijuana distribution\n\nscheme.    A series of sentencing hearings ensued.                At the first\n\nsession,    held     on   December   13,    1999,      the     district     court\n\ntentatively fixed the guideline sentencing range (GSR) at 235-\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f293 months, based on an adjusted offense level of thirty-six\n\n(including, inter alia, a three-level downward adjustment for\n\nacceptance of responsibility under USSG §3E1.1) and a criminal\n\nhistory category of III.        Craven then lobbied for a downward\n\ndeparture, asserting that he had turned his life around about a\n\nyear before his arrest (e.g., he had stopped drinking and using\n\ndrugs,     obtained   gainful   employment,    reconciled     with   his\n\ngirlfriend, and begun to act as a parent to his young son).           In\n\nsupport,     he   tendered   letters    from   family   and     friends\n\ncorroborating this about-face.\n\n            The judge advised the parties that she intended to have\n\nan expert \"document\" Craven's rehabilitation.       To this end, she\n\nentered an order directing Dr. Laurence Weisman, a psychologist,\n\nto conduct a substance abuse evaluation and submit a report.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3552(b) (authorizing the sentencing court to\n\norder a study of the defendant if additional information is\n\nneeded).    Dr. Weisman interviewed Craven and prepared a report\n\nconcluding:\n\n            Alfred Craven is a man at a crossroads in\n            his life. From a chaotic and dysfunctional\n            background that lacked warmth, modelling and\n            supervision, he eased into a life of self-\n            destructive drug addiction and criminal\n            activity through which to support the\n            addiction.   Through some innate resources\n            and strength, he appears to have made the\n            necessary commitment to self-rehabilitation,\n            sobriety   and   a   productive   lifestyle.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f           Although he has had no formal treatment, his\n           claims to have lived for over a year as a\n           sober, contributing member of a community,\n           as well as his involvement in a nuclear\n           family as father and partner, bode well for\n           a successful adjustment back to society upon\n           his release from prison.       As with any\n           individual   attempting    to   overcome   a\n           background   of   addiction   and   criminal\n           lifestyle, the prognosis remains guardedly\n           optimistic if the individual participates in\n           a comprehensive, longterm recovery program.\n           Mr. Craven appears to have demonstrated both\n           the willingness and capability which would\n           make him a good candidate to succeed.\n\n           Notwithstanding           this      optimistic       prognosis,     the\n\ngovernment      remained        skeptical      about     Craven's     purported\n\nrehabilitation.          To   help   prove      its    point,   the   government\n\nproduced disciplinary records from the correctional facility in\n\nwhich    Craven    had   been    detained      pending    disposition     of   the\n\ncharges against him.          These records showed that during a period\n\nof slightly less than two years, ending December 10, 1999,\n\nCraven    had     committed     no   fewer     than    eighteen    disciplinary\n\ninfractions.        These included twice threatening correctional\n\nofficers, twice flooding his cell, fighting on four occasions,\n\npossessing      homemade      alcohol,      refusing    to   accept   a   housing\n\nassignment, refusing to obey other orders, and causing various\n\ndisruptions.       The records also showed that Craven had admitted\n\nto at least eleven of the infractions, including fighting,\n\nthreatening an officer, and possessing homemade alcohol.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f            The district court reconvened the disposition hearing\n\non March 10, 2000.        At that time, it weighed Dr. Weisman's\n\nopinions     against    Craven's   sorry    disciplinary    record      and\n\nexpressed    concern    about   whether   Craven's   behavior   while    in\n\ncustody \"undermine[d] Dr. Weisman's conclusions.\"           Troubled by\n\nthat seeming paradox, the court gave Craven's lawyer additional\n\ntime to address the disciplinary violations.            The court noted\n\nthat \"in the absence of dealing with [those violations], I can't\n\ndepart downward.\"\n\n            At the third and final sentencing hearing, held five\n\ndays later, Craven's counsel did not deal with the paradox.             The\n\ndistrict court nonetheless made two downward departures.          First,\n\nit reduced Craven's criminal history category from III to I on\n\nthe ground that the higher category overstated his criminal\n\npast.      See USSG §4A1.3, p.s. (authorizing such departures).\n\nThis step shrank Craven's GSR to 188-235 months.         The government\n\nhas not inveighed against this aspect of Craven's sentence, and\n\nwe do not discuss it further.\n\n            The judge then turned to the issue of extraordinary\n\nrehabilitation.        She began her explanation by attempting to\n\nreconcile Craven's disciplinary infractions with a finding of\n\nrehabilitation:\n\n                  I had about an hour conversation with\n            Dr. Weisman.  First, this case began with\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe representations made both to [the\nProbation Department] and to various members\nof Alfred Craven's family that he had\nvoluntarily and successfully discontinued\nhis   use  of   all   alcohol   and  illicit\nsubstances in August of '96. . . .\n       [S]uccessfully    discontinuing   all\nalcohol and illicit substances without any\ncounseling, without any drug treatment,\nwithout any efforts to get at the underlying\ncause, is a very difficult thing and is\nparticularly difficult for someone with the\nbackground of Mr. Craven.       He had been\ninvolved in substance abuse and addictions\nsince age 14, which is a very long time, and\n. . . his family was, as Dr. Weisman\ndescribes, dysfunctional, chaotic. . . .\n\n       . . . .\n\n       I   faxed   to    [Dr.   Weisman]   the\ndisciplinary records.     I was concerned the\nlast time, because there were extraordinary\ndisciplinary records for pretrial detention.\n. . .\n       I asked him if that suggests, then,\nthat this rehabilitation wasn't in good\nfaith. And he said no. He said judges are\nwrong in believing that . . . rehabilitation\n.   .   .   is   a    continuous    unilinear,\nuninterrupted    pattern,     and   that   the\nobservations that he had made of Mr. Alfred\nCraven still are true . . . .\n       So, he is not at all concerned that\nthese would be problems of accommodation in\na prison, that are still consistent with\nsomeone who is struggling with a very\ndifficult and very extensive drug addiction.\nAnd, in fact, he said to me, it comes from\nhaving dealt with drug addiction on your own\nrather than in a structured situation with\ncounseling, where you're dealing with what\nthe causes are.\n\n\n\n\n                     -7-\n\fThen, invoking USSG §5K2.0, the judge departed downward on the\n\nbasis     of    extraordinary       rehabilitation.          This     departure,\n\nequivalent to two offense levels, lowered the GSR to 151-188\n\nmonths.    The judge thereupon imposed a sentence at the bottom of\n\nthe newly-calculated range.          The government appeals the sentence\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742(b)(3).\n\n               In our ensuing discussion, we first dispose of Craven's\n\nApprendi-based claim.          We then address the government's appeal.\n\nII.     THE DEFENDANT'S NON-APPEAL\n\n               Blithely   overlooking       his   failure   to   cross-appeal,\n\nCraven asseverates that the Supreme Court's recent                      Apprendi\n\ndecision       calls    into   question     the   constitutionality      of   his\n\nsentence.       His argument goes this way:           21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D)\n\nsets a maximum sentence of five years for controlled substance\n\nviolations involving marijuana; longer sentences can be imposed\n\nonly for specific drug quantities; and since the indictment\n\nreturned against him did not state any specific drug quantity\n\n(although he signed a plea agreement that did), no sentence\n\nlonger than five years is permissible under Apprendi.                    To rub\n\nsalt in the resultant wound, Craven further argues that he must\n\nbe    sentenced        based   on   the     minimum     amount   of   marijuana\n\ncontemplated by the statute (250 grams), which, with a criminal\n\nhistory category of I, would yield a maximum sentence of no\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\flonger than six months.          See USSG §2D1.1(c)(17); USSG Ch.5, Pt.\n\nA (sentencing table).\n\n           Craven's argument has some problematic aspects. In the\n\nfirst place, Apprendi requires that \"any fact (other than prior\n\nconviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must\n\nbe charged in an indictment . . . .\"            120 S. Ct. at 2355.       At\n\nfirst   blush,   it   is    unclear   whether   drug   quantity    in   this\n\ninstance   increases       the   \"maximum   penalty\"   permitted   by   the\n\nstatute.   Cf. United States v. Baltas, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st\n\nCir. 2001) [No. 99-1547, slip op. at 26-30] (holding Apprendi\n\ninapplicable in heroin trafficking prosecution, even though drug\n\nquantity not determined by the jury, because district court\n\nsentenced defendant within the statutory maximum); United States\n\nv. Lafreniere, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 99-1318,\n\nslip op. at 14-19] (same).            In the second place, an omitted\n\nelement of an offense, if not seasonably called to the attention\n\nof the trial court, may well engender plain error review and,\n\ntherefore, not automatically require reversal.              E.g., United\n\nStates v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 306-07 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nThe problematic aspects of Craven's thesis would appear to be\n\nparticularly acute because he admitted in the plea agreement to\n\nresponsibility for 1,000 to 3,000 kilograms of marijuana and the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fstatutory maximum for distributing 1,000 kilograms or more of\n\nmarijuana is life imprisonment.   See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).\n\n          In all events, we leave these arguments for another day\n\nsince we lack jurisdiction to decide the merits of Craven's\n\nplaint.   The district court entered judgment in this case on\n\nApril 13, 2000.   The government filed its appeal on May 8, 2000.\n\n Craven had ten days thereafter within which to file notice of\n\na cross-appeal.   See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (explaining that\n\na defendant's notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of\n\nthe entry of judgment or the filing of a government notice of\n\nappeal, whichever last occurs).   Craven did not avail himself of\n\nthis opportunity.   That omission forecloses his Apprendi claim.\n\n          To be sure, an appellee may defend the judgment below\n\non any ground made manifest by the record.    See Mass. Mut. Life\n\nIns. Co. v. Ludwig, 426 U.S. 479, 481 (1976) (\"[I]t is . . .\n\nsettled that the appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal,\n\nurge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record,\n\nalthough his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning\n\nof the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or\n\nignored by it.\") (citation omitted); Olsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d\n\n52, 58 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999) (indicating that a cross-appeal is\n\nnot needed \"unless a party is trying to expand its rights by\n\nmodifying the judgment in some fashion\").    This paradigm applies\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fin criminal cases.   See United States v. Lieberman, 971 F.2d\n\n989, 996 n.5 (3d Cir. 1992).   Nevertheless, a party may not seek\n\nto revise the trial court's judgment without first filing a\n\ntimely notice of appeal.\n\n          The Supreme Court limned the basic rule three-quarters\n\nof a century ago:\n\n          It is true that a party who does not appeal\n          from a final decree of the trial court\n          cannot be heard in opposition thereto when\n          the case is brought here by the appeal of\n          the adverse party.     In other words, the\n          appellee may not attack the decree with a\n          view either to enlarging his own rights\n          thereunder or of lessening the rights of his\n          adversary, whether what he seeks is to\n          correct an error or to supplement the decree\n          with respect to a matter not dealt with\n          below.\n\nUnited States v. Am. Ry. Exp. Co., 265 U.S. 425, 435 (1924).\n\nThe Court reaffirmed the rule in Ludwig, 426 U.S. at 480-81.   It\n\nis fully applicable in criminal cases.    E.g., United States v.\n\nNeal, 93 F.3d 219, 224 (6th Cir. 1996) (applying the rule to bar\n\nnon-appealing criminal defendant's effort to seek judgment of\n\nacquittal).   Thus, a criminal defendant, qua appellee, may not\n\nseek a reduction in his sentence without having filed a cross-\n\nappeal.\n\n          Craven has two responses to this jurisdictional bar.\n\nFirst, he makes a plea for us to hear his claim based on\n\njudicial economy (the fact that the case is already before us on\n\n                               -11-\n\fthe government's appeal).         Second, he points to cases that treat\n\nfailure to charge elements of a crime in the indictment as\n\njurisdictional defects that can be raised at any time.\n\n              As to Craven's first contention, any appellee could\n\ntrumpet judicial economy as a reason for allowing him or her to\n\nattack a judgment without having filed a notice of appeal.                   To\n\naccept this contention would therefore require us to turn a deaf\n\near to the Court's unambiguous teachings.                 We are unwilling to\n\nfollow this renegade course.\n\n              Like a seldom-used ketchup bottle, Craven's second\n\nasseveration looks full at a glance, but it is almost impossible\n\nto get anything out of it.            Craven grounds this asseveration\n\nupon statements that, devoid of context, might appear to support\n\nhis position.        E.g., United States v. Foley, 73 F.3d 484, 488\n\n(2d Cir. 1996) (\"In a criminal case, a failure of the indictment\n\nto   charge    an    offense   may   be   treated    as    [a]   jurisdictional\n\ndefect, and an appellate court must notice such a flaw even if\n\nthe issue was raised neither in the district court nor on\n\nappeal.\") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted),\n\nabrogated on other grounds by Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S.\n\n52 (1997).     But we have warned before of the perils of wrenching\n\nstatements      in    judicial   opinions     free    of    their    contextual\n\nmoorings and then attempting to rely on them.                    E.g., Liberty\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fMut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 752\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           So it is here:            in each and every case that Craven\n\ncites, the defendant was appealing his sentence.                    Thus, the\n\nappellate court had jurisdiction to consider the effect of the\n\ngovernment's failure to include an element of the offense of\n\nconviction in the indictment.           Craven does not proffer a single\n\ncase, nor do we know of one, in which a court of appeals decided\n\nthe issue of whether elements were missing from an indictment\n\nwhen the defendant had entered a guilty plea and elected not to\n\nappeal his sentence.\n\n           To      say   more   on   this   point   would   serve   no    useful\n\npurpose.      We    hold,   without     serious     question,   that     we   lack\n\njurisdiction to entertain Craven's Apprendi-based claim in this\n\nproceeding.\n\nIII.   THE GOVERNMENT'S APPEAL\n\n           Because the federal sentencing guidelines are designed\n\nto reduce the incidence of disparities, departures are the\n\nexception, not the rule.         United States v. Jackson, 30 F.3d 199,\n\n201 (1st Cir. 1994).             But that does not mean that a rote\n\napplication of the guidelines always must dictate the dimensions\n\nof a defendant's sentence.              A court may impose a sentence\n\noutside the GSR whenever the court supportably determines \"that\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a\n\nkind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by\n\nthe Sentencing Commission . . . .\"           18 U.S.C. § 3553(b); see\n\nalso USSG §5K2.0 (implementing statute).\n\n           Departure    decisions     are    reviewed     for    abuse     of\n\ndiscretion.   Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 96-100 (1996);\n\nUnited States v. Martin, 221 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 2000).                  As\n\nKoon   explains,   in   deciding   whether    or   not    to   depart    “the\n\ndistrict court must make a refined assessment of the many facts\n\nbearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-\n\nto-day experience in criminal sentencing.”          518 U.S. at 98.        In\n\nturn, the court of appeals must respect the district court's\n\nspecial competence in sentencing matters.                Consequently, we\n\nafford substantial deference to most departure decisions.               E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(deferring to district court’s determination that defendant’s\n\nextraordinary post-sentence rehabilitation warranted a downward\n\ndeparture); United States v. Amirault, 224 F.3d 9, 11-14 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (affirming upward departure premised on defendant's\n\nsexual abuse of sisters-in-law).            Respect, however, does not\n\ncompel blind allegiance.     Koon, 518 U.S. at 98; see also United\n\nStates v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67-70 (1st Cir. 1998) (vacating\n\ndownward   departure     grounded     on     federal/state      sentencing\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fdisparity).           Were       the    law   otherwise,       appellate        review   of\n\ndeparture decisions would be an empty exercise.\n\n              In this instance, the government argues that the lower\n\ncourt abused its discretion when it departed downward on the\n\nbasis of what it described as Craven's extraordinary presentence\n\nrehabilitation.             The government offers two main theories in\n\nsupport of this argument.                First, it maintains that the district\n\ncourt improperly included in the sentencing calculus knowledge\n\ngleaned       during       its    ex    parte    discussion       with    Dr.    Weisman.\n\nSecond, the government maintains that the record in this case,\n\nwith     or    without       the        fruits   of      the   forbidden        ex   parte\n\ncommunication,         fails      to     sustain     a   reasoned      conclusion    that\n\nCraven    achieved          the    extraordinary         level    of     rehabilitation\n\nnecessary to justify a downward departure.                       Craven responds that\n\nthe ex parte discourse was entirely proper, and that the record\n\nsupplies       an    adequate          factual   foundation       for    a   finding     of\n\nextraordinary presentence rehabilitation.\n\n              Some prefatory comments are useful to place these\n\narguments           into     perspective.                Ordinarily,         presentence\n\nrehabilitation is not a permissible ground for departure because\n\nit can be factored adequately into the sentencing equation by an\n\n\n\n\n                                              -15-\n\facceptance-of-responsibility credit.1            See USSG §3E1.1, comment.\n\n(n.1(g)) (listing \"post-offense rehabilitative efforts (e.g.,\n\ncounseling or drug treatment)\" as considerations in granting an\n\nacceptance-of-responsibility credit); see also United States v.\n\nSklar, 920 F.2d 107, 115-16 (1st Cir. 1990).              But a datum that\n\nis taken into account by a guideline nonetheless can form the\n\nbasis for a departure if it is \"present to an exceptional\n\ndegree\" or \"makes the case different from the ordinary case\n\nwhere the factor is present.\"            Koon, 518 U.S. at 96.            In an\n\nappropriate      case,     therefore,       extraordinary         presentence\n\nrehabilitation can ground a downward departure.              United States\n\nv. Whitaker, 152 F.3d 1238, 1240 (10th Cir. 1998); United States\n\nv. Kapitzke, 130 F.3d 820, 823 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v.\n\nSally, 116 F.3d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1997); United States v. Brock,\n\n108 F.3d 31, 35 (4th Cir. 1997); Sklar,                920   F.2d    at   116.\n\nWithal, downward departures for presentence rehabilitation are\n\nhen's-teeth     rare,    and   our   precedent    makes   clear    that    such\n\ndepartures are to be granted sparingly.            See Sklar, 920 F.2d at\n\n116.       \"It is only the occasional instance, where time and\n\ncircumstances permit and the accused takes full advantage of\n\n\n\n       1\n     In this case, the district court gave Craven the maximum\nthree-level credit for acceptance of responsibility (in addition\nto the downward departure for extraordinary presentence\nrehabilitation).\n\n                                     -16-\n\fboth, that will produce rehabilitation so dramatic as to cross\n\nthe boundary.\"    Id. at 117.\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the question, broadly\n\nstated, of whether the facts pertaining to Craven's claimed\n\nrehabilitation, as supportably found by the district court,\n\nqualify under this rubric.      In conducting such an inquiry, we\n\nuse   a   three-part   test.    First,    we   evaluate   whether   the\n\ncircumstances cited by the sentencing court are sufficiently\n\nunusual to justify the departure.        If so, we next inquire into\n\nwhether those circumstances are adequately documented in the\n\nrecord.     If the departure clears these two hurdles, we then\n\nmeasure its reasonableness.     See United States v. Dethlefs, 123\n\nF.3d 39, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1997); Sklar, 920 F.2d at 114.\n\n            The first two inquiries sometimes overlap and the lines\n\nthat separate them sometimes blur.       This case is a paradigmatic\n\nexample of that phenomenon:     because of the doubts surrounding\n\nthe propriety of the ex parte communication, the question of\n\nwhether the set of circumstances relied upon by the district\n\ncourt was legally sufficient to justify a downward departure\n\ncannot easily be separated from the question of whether the\n\ncourt's findings rest upon an acceptable evidentiary foundation.\n\nHence, we consider the first two branches of the test in the\n\nensemble.\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f             Precedent provides some guideposts.                   We have twice\n\nbefore been called upon to assess a defendant's efforts to purge\n\nhimself of addiction as a ground for a rehabilitation-based\n\ndeparture.          On both occasions, we found that the efforts fell\n\nshort.      In Sklar, the defendant, after his arrest, attempted to\n\nvanquish his drug addiction by admitting himself to a halfway\n\nhouse and undertaking other rehabilitative measures.                      920 F.2d\n\nat   114.     We    nevertheless      set    aside     the   sentencing    court's\n\ndownward       departure,        finding           that      the     defendant's\n\naccomplishments, though laudable, were not exceptional enough to\n\nsupport      such    a    hard-to-achieve         departure.       Id.    at   117.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Rushby, 936 F.2d 41 (1st Cir.\n\n1991), we concluded that the defendant's endeavors, including\n\nhis post-arrest abstinence and his enrollment in a treatment\n\nprogram for substance abuse, did not warrant a rehabilitation-\n\nbased    downward        departure.         Id.   at   42-43.      This    was   so\n\nnotwithstanding other exemplary behavior on the defendant's\n\npart, e.g., attending to family responsibilities and holding\n\ngainful employment.         See id.\n\n             Craven argues here, as he did below, that his case\n\ndiffers materially from our earlier precedents because both\n\nSklar's and Rushby's rehabilitative efforts began post-arrest,\n\nwhereas he disavowed drugs and alcohol approximately a year\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fbefore federal authorities apprehended him.              To drive home the\n\nsignificance of this distinction, Craven notes that other courts\n\nhave given this sort of sequencing weight in assessing whether\n\na   defendant's     presentence       rehabilitation    merits   a   downward\n\ndeparture.       E.g., United States v. DeShon, 183 F.3d 888, 889\n\n(8th Cir. 1999) (affirming downward departure where defendant\n\nhad     made     radical    lifestyle     changes   a   year     before   his\n\nindictment); United States v. Workman, 80 F.3d 688, 701 (2d Cir.\n\n1996)    (affirming        downward    departure    where   defendant     had\n\ncompleted military service honorably before his arrest).\n\n               We agree that the distinction advocated by Craven may,\n\non occasion, be salient.              Here, however, the circumstances\n\neffectively nullify its potential importance.               The reason that\n\ntiming matters in rehabilitation cases is that a defendant who\n\ndecides independently to turn his life around likely deserves\n\nhigher marks than one who undertakes rehabilitation mainly (or\n\nat least partially) to gain advantage in imminent criminal\n\nproceedings.        See Workman, 80 F.3d at 701 (emphasizing that\n\n\"rehabilitation was not undertaken at the spur of impending\n\nprosecution\").       But that rationale is inapplicable here:             the\n\ndistrict court warrantably found that Craven knew the government\n\nwas \"at the door\" early in 1996, well before he ceased using\n\nillicit substances and set out along the path of rehabilitation.\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fSince Craven knew that he was the target of an investigation\n\nprior to commencing his efforts at rehabilitation, the fact that\n\nhe renounced drugs and alcohol before he was actually arrested\n\ndoes not serve to distinguish his situation from Sklar and\n\nRushby in any meaningful way.\n\n            In this case, moreover, Craven's disciplinary record\n\nwhile in pretrial detention casts significant doubt over the\n\nadvisability of the downward departure.           After all, overcoming\n\ndrug   addiction     is   neither   the    equivalent    of   extraordinary\n\nrehabilitation nor a guaranteed ticket to a downward departure\n\non that basis.       See United States v. Herman, 172 F.3d 205, 209\n\n(2d Cir. 1999) (finding defendant \"merely a rehabilitated drug\n\naddict, not a rehabilitated criminal\").                 The touchstone of\n\nextraordinary      rehabilitation     is    a   fundamental     change   in\n\nattitude.     See,    e.g.,   Bradstreet, 207 F.3d at 78-79, 83-84\n\n(affirming downward departure for extraordinary post-sentence\n\nrehabilitation on basis of defendant's tutoring other prisoners,\n\nteaching adult education classes in prison, serving as prison\n\nchaplain's assistant and clerk of prison parenting program, and\n\nlecturing in the community on ethical perils in the business\n\nworld); DeShon, 183 F.3d at 890-92 (affirming downward departure\n\nfor extraordinary presentence rehabilitation on the basis of\n\ndefendant's genuine acknowledgment of responsibility for his\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fcrimes    and    radical    alteration       of    his    lifestyle   to   include\n\nattending       church   four   times    a    week,       receiving   continuous\n\ncounseling, and working over seventy hours a week to catch up on\n\nbills).     Craven's       prison   record        seems    inconsistent    with   a\n\nfundamental change in attitude (and, thus, with the high level\n\nof rehabilitation essential for a downward departure).2\n\n            We nevertheless hesitate to say, as a matter of law,\n\nthat Craven does not qualify for a downward departure.                        Both\n\nSklar and Rushby predate the Court's decision in Koon, and Koon\n\nhighlights the desirability of deference to the sentencing court\n\nin such fact-sensitive judgments.                 Thus, although Koon may not\n\nhave changed the mode of analysis that previously prevailed in\n\ndeparture cases in this circuit, e.g., United States v. Rivera,\n\n994 F.2d 942, 950-52 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Diaz-\n\nVillafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49-52 (1st Cir. 1989), it added a gloss\n\nthat gives us pause.\n\n\n    2The only reported case in which an appellate court has\naffirmed a downward departure for presentence rehabilitation\nbased solely on overcoming addiction is United States v. Newlon,\n212 F.3d 423 (8th Cir. 2000).    The Newlon panel authorized a\ndeparture where the defendant, prior to his arrest, had spent\napproximately eighty-five hours in a structured treatment\nprogram, his counselor attested to his sincere desire for a\ncure, and his family noticed a marked improvement in his\ndemeanor. Id. at 424. Newlon is readily distinguishable from\nthe instant case for at least two reasons.      First, Newlon's\nrehabilitation occurred before the authorities zeroed in on him.\nSecond, no factors were present there that belied the claimed\nexistence of a fundamental change in attitude.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f            This is a highly ramified question — and one which\n\nought not be addressed on an uncertain record.           We think that\n\nthe course of prudence is for us to leave open the question of\n\nwhether the circumstances justify a departure until we first\n\nanswer the closely related question of whether the sentencing\n\ncourt acted on the basis of information that was properly before\n\nit.    We turn, then, to that inquiry.\n\n            The court below departed downward based on two key\n\nfindings.    First, it concluded that Craven, on his own, gave up\n\ndrugs prior to his arrest and conquered a long-term addiction.\n\nSecond, it solicited Dr. Weisman's opinion ex parte and, based\n\non that opinion, found that the proliferation of disciplinary\n\nviolations did not undercut this supposed rehabilitation.            The\n\nnub of the question, then, is whether the sentencing court erred\n\nin undertaking this ex parte contact and premising a critical\n\nfinding on information received during the ensuing conversation.\n\n            What transpired below is not disputed.       At the second\n\nof    Craven’s   three   sentencing   hearings,   the   district   judge\n\nstruggled with the conflicting evidence on rehabilitation.           She\n\ndetermined that she could not grant a downward departure without\n\nsome cogent rationalization of Craven's disciplinary violations:\n\n            [Y]ou have to deal with the record in\n            prison, because . . . I actually haven’t\n            seen this in other defendants. . . .\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f                 If there’s an explanation, I want to\n          hear it.   But you have to deal with this.\n          This is not – having surfaced this, it can’t\n          be ignored. . . .\n                 I have to deal with this and you have\n          to deal with it.     And in the absence of\n          dealing with it, I can’t depart downward. .\n          . .\n\nThe   judge    gave   defense   counsel    time    to    investigate   the\n\ninfractions and to reconcile them, if possible, with the claim\n\nof rehabilitation.\n\n          At    the   final   sentencing   hearing,      Craven’s   lawyer\n\nprovided no further explanation for the parlous disciplinary\n\nrecord.   The district court nonetheless departed downward for\n\nextraordinary presentence rehabilitation based on a one-hour ex\n\nparte conversation with Dr. Weisman.              The government made a\n\nproper contemporaneous objection to the court’s reliance on this\n\nex parte conversation.\n\n          On appeal, the government notes that the lawyers were\n\nnot privy to the court's conversation with the expert; that the\n\nsubstance of the discussion was not placed in the record; and\n\nthat the government had no opportunity either to cross-examine\n\nthe expert or to respond to his opinions.               We agree with the\n\ngovernment that a sentencing court may not utilize an ex parte\n\nconversation with a court-appointed expert as a means to acquire\n\ninformation critical to a sentencing determination and then rely\n\non that information in fashioning the defendant's sentence.             We\n\n                                  -23-\n\fconclude, moreover, that the district court's violation of this\n\nprinciple taints the factual basis for the departure decision\n\nand leaves us unable to determine whether Craven’s efforts to\n\novercome his addiction qualify him for a downward departure.\n\nSee Martin, 221 F.3d at 58 (ending analysis upon determining\n\nthat    sentencing   court        relied    on   forbidden   information      in\n\ndeparting).    We explain our thinking below.\n\n            In general, the law frowns upon ex parte communications\n\nbetween judges and court-appointed experts.                   See Bradley v.\n\nMilliken,    620   F.2d    1143,    1158     (6th   Cir.   1980)    (expressing\n\nconcern that reports of court-appointed experts were not placed\n\nin record or made available to parties); United States v. Green,\n\n544 F.2d 138, 146 n.16 (3d Cir. 1976) (\"Generally . . . the\n\ncourt    should    avoid     ex     parte    communications        with   anyone\n\nassociated with the trial, even its own appointed expert.\"); see\n\ngenerally 29 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 6305 (1997 & Supp. 2000) (\"[E]x parte communications\n\nbetween the judge and the expert . . . are discouraged.\").                   The\n\nreason is obvious:        most ex parte contacts between a trial judge\n\nand another participant in the proceedings risk harm, and ex\n\nparte communications with key witnesses (such as court-appointed\n\nexperts) are no exception.             To the contrary, such ex parte\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fcontacts      can      create      situations          pregnant     with     problematic\n\npossibilities.\n\n            Nor      is    there    any       convincing      reason     for   exempting\n\ncommunications undertaken in the course of sentencing from this\n\ngeneral prohibition.             In point of fact, the statutory provision\n\nunder which the district court recruited Dr. Weisman does not\n\ncontemplate substantive ex parte communications between the\n\nappointer and the appointee.                        Rather, it requires that the\n\nexpert file with the court \"a written report of the pertinent\n\nresults of the study,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3552(b), and the court must\n\nensure    that      the    report       is    disclosed     to    the   defendant,     his\n\ncounsel, and the prosecutor prior to the disposition hearing,\n\nid. § 3552(d).         While the statute does not deal explicitly with\n\nthe procedure to be followed if the court requires information\n\nover and above that contained in the original report, it follows\n\nlogically     that        the    same    or    equivalent        safeguards       (i.e.,    a\n\nwritten    response         delivered          to     all   parties     in   advance       of\n\nsentencing) should obtain.                   Accord United States v. Blythe, 944\n\nF.2d   356,      360      (7th    Cir.        1991)    (determining        that    section\n\n3552(d)'s framework for review by all interested parties applies\n\nto an addendum to the presentence report).\n\n            We hold, therefore, that if a sentencing court desires\n\nadditional information from a court-appointed expert, it must\n\n\n                                              -25-\n\feither (1) make a written request for a supplemental report and\n\nprovide that supplemental report to the parties in accordance\n\nwith the procedure described in 18 U.S.C. § 3552(d), or (2)\n\nbring the expert into court to be questioned in the presence of\n\nthe parties.    Such an even-handed approach not only honors what\n\nwe believe to be the intent of the drafters of section 3552, but\n\nalso fits neatly with the prevailing view as to how courts\n\nshould communicate with court-appointed experts on matters of\n\nsubstance.     E.g., Bradley, 620 F.2d at 1158 (opining that \"if\n\nany experts are employed to advise the district court . . . they\n\nshall prepare written reports, copies of which shall become part\n\nof the record and shall be made available to all parties or\n\ntheir attorneys\"); Green, 544 F.2d at 146 n.16 (observing that\n\nthe most appropriate way for a court to talk with its appointed\n\nexpert would be through \"an on-the-record conference in chambers\n\nor an on-the-record conference call so that counsel for all\n\nparties may participate\"); Joe S. Cecil & Thomas E. Willging,\n\nCourt-Appointed Experts:     Defining the Role of Experts Appointed\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 706, at 91-92 (1993) (\"If the\n\njudge   and   the   expert   expect   to   confer   in   person   .   .   .\n\n[r]epresentatives of the parties can be invited to attend the\n\nconference or . . . a record of the discussion can be forwarded\n\nto the parties.\").\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\f            The court below acted in a manner inconsistent with\n\nthis prudential rule and therefore erred.                  On the record before\n\nus, we conclude that the error cannot be deemed harmless.3                             We\n\nbase this determination on several factors.\n\n            First,        the   ex    parte     conversation      dealt        with     a\n\nsubstantive sentencing matter (whether Craven's rehabilitation\n\ncould be considered extraordinary given his prison disciplinary\n\nrecord).     Second, the conversation was plainly determinative of\n\nthe court's decision to depart.                 Indeed, like a pearl around a\n\ngrain of sand, the decision anent the proper sentence to be\n\nimposed     was     formed      around        the    impermissible        ex     parte\n\nconversation.         Third,         since    the    court      sentenced       Craven\n\nimmediately       after    it   revealed      that   it   had    spoken   with        Dr.\n\nWeisman ex parte, the government had no realistic opportunity to\n\nchallenge    the    expert's         conclusions     by   cross-examination            or\n\notherwise.        Fourth, and finally, there is no contemporaneous\n\nrecord of the conversation — only the district court's oral\n\nsummary of its contents — thereby complicating harmless-error\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n    3We hasten to add that not every ex parte contact between a\njudge and a court-appointed expert automatically will result in\nreversal.   E.g., Green, 544 F.2d at 146.   Here, however, the\nrisk of taint runs high:   the court relied heavily on its ex\nparte communication with Dr. Weisman to ground the downward\ndeparture.\n\n                                         -27-\n\f              Let us be perfectly clear.             We do not doubt the trial\n\njudge's      good    intentions    —    but     in   her    zeal    to    collect      all\n\npossible information without further delaying the disposition\n\nhearing, she went too far.              Under the circumstances that obtain\n\nhere, we cannot permit the tainted departure to stand.                                 The\n\nsentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.\n\n              This determination does not end our odyssey.                             The\n\nquestion remains whether the remand should be to the same or a\n\ndifferent judge.          Engaging in ex parte communications with\n\ncourt-appointed experts need not inevitably require a judge's\n\ndisqualification, but such conduct sometimes can lead to that\n\nresult.       See Edgar v. K.L., 93 F.3d 256, 262 (7th Cir. 1996)\n\n(per    curiam)      (ordering    disqualification           where       the    ex   parte\n\ndiscussions with court-appointed experts touched on the merits\n\nof     the    dispute    and     were    not     justified         by     any    exigent\n\ncircumstances).         The Seventh Circuit's rationale applies here.\n\nWhen    a    judge   receives     information        that    does       not    enter   the\n\nrecord, the reliability of that information may not be tested\n\nthrough the adversary process.                Id. at 259 (noting that \"[o]ff-\n\nthe-record briefings . . . leave no trace in the record\" and\n\n\"[w]hat information passed to the judge, and how reliable it may\n\nhave been, are now unknowable\").                Moreover, it is difficult, if\n\nnot impossible, for a judge, no matter how sincere, to purge\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fthat information from her mind — and, equally, to maintain the\n\nperception of impartiality.\n\n           These    concerns   crest      in    the    criminal    sentencing\n\ncontext.    See generally United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301,\n\n305 (1st Cir. 1993) (remarking that \"a court must take pains to\n\nbase    sentencing     judgments     upon        reliable    and    accurate\n\ninformation\").      The level of concern is heightened even further\n\nwhere, as in this case, the information gleaned ex parte was\n\nincontrovertibly     the   basis    for        the    sentencing   decision.\n\nFinally, were we to remand this case for resentencing by the\n\nsame judge, we believe that it would be surpassingly difficult\n\nfor her to disregard the guidance that she previously received\n\nfrom Dr. Weisman.    For these reasons, we direct that the case be\n\nreassigned to a new trier.         See United States v. Curran, 926\n\nF.2d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 1991) (remanding to a different judge for\n\nresentencing   where    the    sentencing       judge    considered   victim\n\nletters that were neither included in record nor made available\n\nto the defense); cf. United States v. Berzon, 941 F.2d 8, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (directing sentencing judge to step aside on\n\nremand for resentencing if he had relied on improperly obtained\n\ninformation during original sentencing hearing).\n\n\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\f          We need go no further.         Since Craven did not file a\n\ncross-appeal, we lack jurisdiction over his attempted attack on\n\nhis sentence and do not pass upon its merits.                We do have\n\njurisdiction, however, over the government's appeal.            In that\n\nregard,   we   annul   the   downward    departure   for   extraordinary\n\npresentence rehabilitation, vacate the sentence, and remand for\n\nresentencing before a different judge.\n\n\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\f",

The defendant, Alfred Craven, resists the government's appeal and simultaneously attempts to persuade us that the Supreme Court's recent decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), demands further paring of his sentence. Because Craven has not cross-appealed, his Apprendi-based claim is not properly before us and we refrain from burrowing into its merits. This leaves the government's appeal -- an appeal which requires us to consider the district court's authority vel non to engage in ex parte discussions of substantive matters with court-appointed experts. We conclude that the sentencing court erred in undertaking, and then basing its departure decision on, an ex parte communication. Hence, we vacate Craven's sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1999, Craven pleaded guilty to nine counts arising from his involvement in a massive marijuana distribution scheme. A series of sentencing hearings ensued. At the first session, held on December 13, 1999, the district court tentatively fixed the guideline sentencing range (GSR) at 235-293 months, based on an adjusted offense level of thirty-six (including, inter alia, a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under USSG &#167;3E1.1) and a criminal history category of III. Craven then lobbied for a downward departure, asserting that he had turned his life around about a year before his arrest (e.g., he had stopped drinking and using drugs, obtained gainful employment, reconciled with his girlfriend, and begun to act as a parent to his young son). In support, he tendered letters from family and friends corroborating this about-face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge advised the parties that she intended to have an expert \"document\" Craven's rehabilitation. To this end, she entered an order directing Dr. Laurence Weisman, a psychologist, to conduct a substance abuse evaluation and submit a report. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3552(b) (authorizing the sentencing court to order a study of the defendant if additional information is needed). Dr. Weisman interviewed Craven and prepared a report concluding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alfred Craven is a man at a crossroads in his life. From a chaotic and dysfunctional background that lacked warmth, modelling and supervision, he eased into a life of self-destructive drug addiction and criminal activity through which to support the addiction. Through some innate resources and strength, he appears to have made the necessary commitment to self-rehabilitation, sobriety and a productive lifestyle. Although he has had no formal treatment, his claims to have lived for over a year as a sober, contributing member of a community, as well as his involvement in a nuclear family as father and partner, bode well for a successful adjustment back to society upon his release from prison. As with any individual attempting to overcome a background of addiction and criminal lifestyle, the prognosis remains guardedly optimistic if the individual participates in a comprehensive, longterm recovery program. Mr. Craven appears to have demonstrated both the willingness and capability which would make him a good candidate to succeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this optimistic prognosis, the government remained skeptical about Craven's purported rehabilitation. To help prove its point, the government produced disciplinary records from the correctional facility in which Craven had been detained pending disposition of the charges against him. These records showed that during a period of slightly less than two years, ending December 10, 1999, Craven had committed no fewer than eighteen disciplinary infractions. These included twice threatening correctional officers, twice flooding his cell, fighting on four occasions, possessing homemade alcohol, refusing to accept a housing assignment, refusing to obey other orders, and causing various disruptions. The records also showed that Craven had admitted to at least eleven of the infractions, including fighting, threatening an officer, and possessing homemade alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reconvened the disposition hearing on March 10, 2000. At that time, it weighed Dr. Weisman's opinions against Craven's sorry disciplinary record and expressed concern about whether Craven's behavior while in custody \"undermine[d] Dr. Weisman's conclusions.\" Troubled by that seeming paradox, the court gave Craven's lawyer additional time to address the disciplinary violations. The court noted that \"in the absence of dealing with [those violations], I can't depart downward.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the third and final sentencing hearing, held five days later, Craven's counsel did not deal with the paradox. The district court nonetheless made two downward departures. First, it reduced Craven's criminal history category from III to I on the ground that the higher category overstated his criminal past. See USSG &#167;4A1.3, p.s. (authorizing such departures). This step shrank Craven's GSR to 188-235 months. The government has not inveighed against this aspect of Craven's sentence, and we do not discuss it further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge then turned to the issue of extraordinary rehabilitation. She began her explanation by attempting to reconcile Craven's disciplinary infractions with a finding of rehabilitation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I had about an hour conversation with Dr. Weisman. First, this case began with the representations made both to [the Probation Department] and to various members of Alfred Craven's family that he had voluntarily and successfully discontinued his use of all alcohol and illicit substances in August of '96. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[S]uccessfully discontinuing all alcohol and illicit substances without any counseling, without any drug treatment, without any efforts to get at the underlying cause, is a very difficult thing and is particularly difficult for someone with the background of Mr. Craven. He had been involved in substance abuse and addictions since age 14, which is a very long time, and . . . his family was, as Dr. Weisman describes, dysfunctional, chaotic. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I faxed to [Dr. Weisman] the disciplinary records. I was concerned the last time, because there were extraordinary disciplinary records for pretrial detention. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I asked him if that suggests, then, that this rehabilitation wasn't in good faith. And he said no. He said judges are wrong in believing that . . . rehabilitation . . . is a continuous unilinear, uninterrupted pattern, and that the observations that he had made of Mr. Alfred Craven still are true . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, he is not at all concerned that these would be problems of accommodation in a prison, that are still consistent with someone who is struggling with a very difficult and very extensive drug addiction. And, in fact, he said to me, it comes from having dealt with drug addiction on your own rather than in a structured situation with counseling, where you're dealing with what the causes are.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, invoking USSG &#167;5K2.0, the judge departed downward on the basis of extraordinary rehabilitation. This departure, equivalent to two offense levels, lowered the GSR to 151-188 months. The judge thereupon imposed a sentence at the bottom of the newly-calculated range. The government appeals the sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our ensuing discussion, we first dispose of Craven's Apprendi-based claim. We then address the government's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE DEFENDANT'S NON-APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blithely overlooking his failure to cross-appeal, Craven asseverates that the Supreme Court's recent Apprendi decision calls into question the constitutionality of his sentence. His argument goes this way: 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(D) sets a maximum sentence of five years for controlled substance violations involving marijuana; longer sentences can be imposed only for specific drug quantities; and since the indictment returned against him did not state any specific drug quantity (although he signed a plea agreement that did), no sentence longer than five years is permissible under Apprendi. To rub salt in the resultant wound, Craven further argues that he must be sentenced based on the minimum amount of marijuana contemplated by the statute (250 grams), which, with a criminal history category of I, would yield a maximum sentence of no longer than six months. See USSG &#167;2D1.1(c)(17); USSG Ch.5, Pt. A (sentencing table).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Craven's argument has some problematic aspects. In the first place, Apprendi requires that \"any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment . . . .\" 120 S. Ct. at 2355. At first blush, it is unclear whether drug quantity in this instance increases the \"maximum penalty\" permitted by the statute. Cf. United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, (1st Cir. 2001)(holding Apprendi inapplicable in heroin trafficking prosecution, even though drug quantity not determined by the jury, because district court sentenced defendant within the statutory maximum); United States v. Lafreniere, 236 F.3d 41, (1st Cir. 2001)(same). In the second place, an omitted element of an offense, if not seasonably called to the attention of the trial court, may well engender plain error review and, therefore, not automatically require reversal. E.g., United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 306-07 (1st Cir. 2000). The problematic aspects of Craven's thesis would appear to be particularly acute because he admitted in the plea agreement to responsibility for 1,000 to 3,000 kilograms of marijuana and the statutory maximum for distributing 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana is life imprisonment. See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we leave these arguments for another day since we lack jurisdiction to decide the merits of Craven's plaint. The district court entered judgment in this case on April 13, 2000. The government filed its appeal on May 8, 2000. Craven had ten days thereafter within which to file notice of a cross-appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (explaining that a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of the entry of judgment or the filing of a government notice of appeal, whichever last occurs). Craven did not avail himself of this opportunity. That omission forecloses his Apprendi claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, an appellee may defend the judgment below on any ground made manifest by the record. See Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ludwig, 426 U.S. 479, 481 (1976) (\"[I]t is . . . settled that the appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it.\") (citation omitted); Olsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d 52, 58 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999) (indicating that a cross-appeal is not needed \"unless a party is trying to expand its rights by modifying the judgment in some fashion\"). This paradigm applies in criminal cases. See United States v. Lieberman, 971 F.2d 989, 996 n.5 (3d Cir. 1992). Nevertheless, a party may not seek to revise the trial court's judgment without first filing a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court limned the basic rule three-quarters of a century ago:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that a party who does not appeal from a final decree of the trial court cannot be heard in opposition thereto when the case is brought here by the appeal of the adverse party. In other words, the appellee may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary, whether what he seeks is to correct an error or to supplement the decree with respect to a matter not dealt with below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Am. Ry. Exp. Co., 265 U.S. 425, 435 (1924). The Court reaffirmed the rule in Ludwig, 426 U.S. at 480-81. It is fully applicable in criminal cases. E.g., United States v. Neal, 93 F.3d 219, 224 (6th Cir. 1996) (applying the rule to bar non-appealing criminal defendant's effort to seek judgment of acquittal). Thus, a criminal defendant, qua appellee, may not seek a reduction in his sentence without having filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Craven has two responses to this jurisdictional bar. First, he makes a plea for us to hear his claim based on judicial economy (the fact that the case is already before us on the government's appeal). Second, he points to cases that treat failure to charge elements of a crime in the indictment as jurisdictional defects that can be raised at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Craven's first contention, any appellee could trumpet judicial economy as a reason for allowing him or her to attack a judgment without having filed a notice of appeal. To accept this contention would therefore require us to turn a deaf ear to the Court's unambiguous teachings. We are unwilling to follow this renegade course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like a seldom-used ketchup bottle, Craven's second asseveration looks full at a glance, but it is almost impossible to get anything out of it. Craven grounds this asseveration upon statements that, devoid of context, might appear to support his position. E.g., United States v. Foley, 73 F.3d 484, 488 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"In a criminal case, a failure of the indictment to charge an offense may be treated as [a] jurisdictional defect, and an appellate court must notice such a flaw even if the issue was raised neither in the district court nor on appeal.\") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52 (1997). But we have warned before of the perils of wrenching statements in judicial opinions free of their contextual moorings and then attempting to rely on them. E.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 752 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it is here: in each and every case that Craven cites, the defendant was appealing his sentence. Thus, the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider the effect of the government's failure to include an element of the offense of conviction in the indictment. Craven does not proffer a single case, nor do we know of one, in which a court of appeals decided the issue of whether elements were missing from an indictment when the defendant had entered a guilty plea and elected not to appeal his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would serve no useful purpose. We hold, without serious question, that we lack jurisdiction to entertain Craven's Apprendi-based claim in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE GOVERNMENT'S APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the federal sentencing guidelines are designed to reduce the incidence of disparities, departures are the exception, not the rule. United States v. Jackson, 30 F.3d 199, 201 (1st Cir. 1994). But that does not mean that a rote application of the guidelines always must dictate the dimensions of a defendant's sentence. A court may impose a sentence outside the GSR whenever the court supportably determines \"that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b); seealso USSG &#167;5K2.0 (implementing statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Departure decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 96-100 (1996); United States v. Martin, 221 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 2000). As Koon explains, in deciding whether or not to depart \"the district court must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing.\" 518 U.S. at 98. In turn, the court of appeals must respect the district court's special competence in sentencing matters. Consequently, we afford substantial deference to most departure decisions. E.g., United States v. Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2000) (deferring to district court's determination that defendant's extraordinary post-sentence rehabilitation warranted a downward departure); United States v. Amirault, 224 F.3d 9, 11-14 (1st Cir. 2000) (affirming upward departure premised on defendant's sexual abuse of sisters-in-law). Respect, however, does not compel blind allegiance. Koon, 518 U.S. at 98; see also United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67-70 (1st Cir. 1998) (vacating downward departure grounded on federal/state sentencing disparity). Were the law otherwise, appellate review of departure decisions would be an empty exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the government argues that the lower court abused its discretion when it departed downward on the basis of what it described as Craven's extraordinary presentence rehabilitation. The government offers two main theories in support of this argument. First, it maintains that the district court improperly included in the sentencing calculus knowledge gleaned during its ex parte discussion with Dr. Weisman. Second, the government maintains that the record in this case, with or without the fruits of the forbidden ex parte communication, fails to sustain a reasoned conclusion that Craven achieved the extraordinary level of rehabilitation necessary to justify a downward departure. Craven responds that the ex parte discourse was entirely proper, and that the record supplies an adequate factual foundation for a finding of extraordinary presentence rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some prefatory comments are useful to place these arguments into perspective. Ordinarily, presentence rehabilitation is not a permissible ground for departure because it can be factored adequately into the sentencing equation by an acceptance-of-responsibility credit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See USSG &#167;3E1.1, comment. (n.1(g)) (listing \"post-offense rehabilitative efforts (e.g., counseling or drug treatment)\" as considerations in granting an acceptance-of-responsibility credit); see also United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 115-16 (1st Cir. 1990). But a datum that is taken into account by a guideline nonetheless can form the basis for a departure if it is \"present to an exceptional degree\" or \"makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.\" Koon, 518 U.S. at 96. In an appropriate case, therefore, extraordinary presentence rehabilitation can ground a downward departure. United States v. Whitaker, 152 F.3d 1238, 1240 (10th Cir. 1998); United States v. Kapitzke, 130 F.3d 820, 823 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Sally, 116 F.3d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1997); United States v. Brock, 108 F.3d 31, 35 (4th Cir. 1997); Sklar, 920 F.2d at 116. Withal, downward departures for presentence rehabilitation are hen's-teeth rare, and our precedent makes clear that such departures are to be granted sparingly. See Sklar, 920 F.2d at 116. \"It is only the occasional instance, where time and circumstances permit and the accused takes full advantage of both, that will produce rehabilitation so dramatic as to cross the boundary.\" Id. at 117.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the question, broadly stated, of whether the facts pertaining to Craven's claimed rehabilitation, as supportably found by the district court, qualify under this rubric. In conducting such an inquiry, we use a three-part test. First, we evaluate whether the circumstances cited by the sentencing court are sufficiently unusual to justify the departure. If so, we next inquire into whether those circumstances are adequately documented in the record. If the departure clears these two hurdles, we then measure its reasonableness. See United States v. Dethlefs, 123 F.3d 39, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1997); Sklar, 920 F.2d at 114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two inquiries sometimes overlap and the lines that separate them sometimes blur. This case is a paradigmatic example of that phenomenon: because of the doubts surrounding the propriety of the ex parte communication, the question of whether the set of circumstances relied upon by the district court was legally sufficient to justify a downward departure cannot easily be separated from the question of whether the court's findings rest upon an acceptable evidentiary foundation. Hence, we consider the first two branches of the test in the ensemble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precedent provides some guideposts. We have twice before been called upon to assess a defendant's efforts to purge himself of addiction as a ground for a rehabilitation-based departure.On both occasions, we found that the efforts fell short. In Sklar, the defendant, after his arrest, attempted to vanquish his drug addiction by admitting himself to a halfway house and undertaking other rehabilitative measures. 920 F.2d at 114. We nevertheless set aside the sentencing court's downward departure, finding that the defendant's accomplishments, though laudable, were not exceptional enough to support such a hard-to-achieve departure. Id. at 117. Similarly, in United States v. Rushby, 936 F.2d 41 (1st Cir. 1991), we concluded that the defendant's endeavors, including his post-arrest abstinence and his enrollment in a treatment program for substance abuse, did not warrant a rehabilitation-based downward departure. Id. at 42-43. This was so notwithstanding other exemplary behavior on the defendant's part, e.g., attending to family responsibilities and holding gainful employment. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Craven argues here, as he did below, that his case differs materially from our earlier precedents because both Sklar's and Rushby's rehabilitative efforts began post-arrest, whereas he disavowed drugs and alcohol approximately a year before federal authorities apprehended him. To drive home the significance of this distinction, Craven notes that other courts have given this sort of sequencing weight in assessing whether a defendant's presentence rehabilitation merits a downward departure. E.g., United States v. DeShon, 183 F.3d 888, 889 (8th Cir. 1999) (affirming downward departure where defendant had made radical lifestyle changes a year before his indictment); United States v. Workman, 80 F.3d 688, 701 (2d Cir. 1996) (affirming downward departure where defendant had completed military service honorably before his arrest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the distinction advocated by Craven may, on occasion, be salient. Here, however, the circumstances effectively nullify its potential importance. The reason that timing matters in rehabilitation cases is that a defendant who decides independently to turn his life around likely deserves higher marks than one who undertakes rehabilitation mainly (or at least partially) to gain advantage in imminent criminal proceedings. See Workman, 80 F.3d at 701 (emphasizing that \"rehabilitation was not undertaken at the spur of impending prosecution\"). But that rationale is inapplicable here: the district court warrantably found that Craven knew the government was \"at the door\" early in 1996, well before he ceased using illicit substances and set out along the path of rehabilitation. Since Craven knew that he was the target of an investigation prior to commencing his efforts at rehabilitation, the fact that he renounced drugs and alcohol before he was actually arrested does not serve to distinguish his situation from Sklar and Rushby in any meaningful way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, moreover, Craven's disciplinary record while in pretrial detention casts significant doubt over the advisability of the downward departure. After all, overcoming drug addiction is neither the equivalent of extraordinary rehabilitation nor a guaranteed ticket to a downward departure on that basis. See United States v. Herman, 172 F.3d 205, 209 (2d Cir. 1999) (finding defendant \"merely a rehabilitated drug addict, not a rehabilitated criminal\"). The touchstone of extraordinary rehabilitation is a fundamental change in attitude. See, e.g., Bradstreet, 207 F.3d at 78-79, 83-84 (affirming downward departure for extraordinary post-sentence rehabilitation on basis of defendant's tutoring other prisoners, teaching adult education classes in prison, serving as prison chaplain's assistant and clerk of prison parenting program, and lecturing in the community on ethical perils in the business world); DeShon, 183 F.3d at 890-92 (affirming downward departure for extraordinary presentence rehabilitation on the basis of defendant's genuine acknowledgment of responsibility for his crimes and radical alteration of his lifestyle to include attending church four times a week, receiving continuous counseling, and working over seventy hours a week to catch up on bills). Craven's prison record seems inconsistent with a fundamental change in attitude (and, thus, with the high level of rehabilitation essential for a downward departure).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nevertheless hesitate to say, as a matter of law, that Craven does not qualify for a downward departure. Both Sklar and Rushby predate the Court's decision in Koon, and Koon highlights the desirability of deference to the sentencing court in such fact-sensitive judgments. Thus, although Koon may not have changed the mode of analysis that previously prevailed in departure cases in this circuit, e.g., United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 950-52 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49-52 (1st Cir. 1989), it added a gloss that gives us pause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a highly ramified question -- and one which ought not be addressed on an uncertain record. We think that the course of prudence is for us to leave open the question of whether the circumstances justify a departure until we first answer the closely related question of whether the sentencing court acted on the basis of information that was properly before it. We turn, then, to that inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below departed downward based on two key findings. First, it concluded that Craven, on his own, gave up drugs prior to his arrest and conquered a long-term addiction. Second, it solicited Dr. Weisman's opinion ex parte and, based on that opinion, found that the proliferation of disciplinary violations did not undercut this supposed rehabilitation. The nub of the question, then, is whether the sentencing court erred in undertaking this ex parte contact and premising a critical finding on information received during the ensuing conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What transpired below is not disputed. At the second of Craven's three sentencing hearings, the district judge struggled with the conflicting evidence on rehabilitation. She determined that she could not grant a downward departure without some cogent rationalization of Craven's disciplinary violations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Y]ou have to deal with the record in prison, because . . . I actually haven't seen this in other defendants. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there's an explanation, I want to hear it. But you have to deal with this. This is not - having surfaced this, it can't be ignored. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have to deal with this and you have to deal with it. And in the absence of dealing with it, I can't depart downward. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge gave defense counsel time to investigate the infractions and to reconcile them, if possible, with the claim of rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the final sentencing hearing, Craven's lawyer provided no further explanation for the parlous disciplinary record. The district court nonetheless departed downward for extraordinary presentence rehabilitation based on a one-hour ex parte conversation with Dr. Weisman. The government made a proper contemporaneous objection to the court's reliance on this ex parte conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the government notes that the lawyers were not privy to the court's conversation with the expert; that the substance of the discussion was not placed in the record; and that the government had no opportunity either to cross-examine the expert or to respond to his opinions. We agree with the government that a sentencing court may not utilize an ex parte conversation with a court-appointed expert as a means to acquire information critical to a sentencing determination and then rely on that information in fashioning the defendant's sentence. We conclude, moreover, that the district court's violation of this principle taints the factual basis for the departure decision and leaves us unable to determine whether Craven's efforts to overcome his addiction qualify him for a downward departure. See Martin, 221 F.3d at 58 (ending analysis upon determining that sentencing court relied on forbidden information in departing). We explain our thinking below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, the law frowns upon ex parte communications between judges and court-appointed experts. See Bradley v. Milliken, 620 F.2d 1143, 1158 (6th Cir. 1980) (expressing concern that reports of court-appointed experts were not placed in record or made available to parties); United States v. Green, 544 F.2d 138, 146 n.16 (3d Cir. 1976) (\"Generally . . . the court should avoid ex parte communications with anyone associated with the trial, even its own appointed expert.\"); seegenerally 29 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 6305 (1997 &amp; Supp. 2000) (\"[E]x parte communications between the judge and the expert . . . are discouraged.\"). The reason is obvious: most ex parte contacts between a trial judge and another participant in the proceedings risk harm, and ex parte communications with key witnesses (such as court-appointed experts) are no exception. To the contrary, such ex parte contacts can create situations pregnant with problematic possibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any convincing reason for exempting communications undertaken in the course of sentencing from this general prohibition. In point of fact, the statutory provision under which the district court recruited Dr. Weisman does not contemplate substantive ex parte communications between the appointer and the appointee. Rather, it requires that the expert file with the court \"a written report of the pertinent results of the study,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3552(b), and the court must ensure that the report is disclosed to the defendant, his counsel, and the prosecutor prior to the disposition hearing, id. &#167; 3552(d). While the statute does not deal explicitly with the procedure to be followed if the court requires information over and above that contained in the original report, it follows logically that the same or equivalent safeguards (i.e., a written response delivered to all parties in advance of sentencing) should obtain. Accord United States v. Blythe, 944 F.2d 356, 360 (7th Cir. 1991) (determining that section 3552(d)'s framework for review by all interested parties applies to an addendum to the presentence report).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that if a sentencing court desires additional information from a court-appointed expert, it must either (1) make a written request for a supplemental report and provide that supplemental report to the parties in accordance with the procedure described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3552(d), or (2) bring the expert into court to be questioned in the presence of the parties. Such an even-handed approach not only honors what we believe to be the intent of the drafters of section 3552, but also fits neatly with the prevailing view as to how courts should communicate with court-appointed experts on matters of substance. E.g., Bradley, 620 F.2d at 1158 (opining that \"if any experts are employed to advise the district court . . . they shall prepare written reports, copies of which shall become part of the record and shall be made available to all parties or their attorneys\"); Green, 544 F.2d at 146 n.16 (observing that the most appropriate way for a court to talk with its appointed expert would be through \"an on-the-record conference in chambers or an on-the-record conference call so that counsel for all parties may participate\"); Joe S. Cecil &amp; Thomas E. Willging, Court-Appointed Experts: Defining the Role of Experts Appointed Under Federal Rule of Evidence 706, at 91-92 (1993) (\"If the judge and the expert expect to confer in person . . . [r]epresentatives of the parties can be invited to attend the conference or . . . a record of the discussion can be forwarded to the parties.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below acted in a manner inconsistent with this prudential rule and therefore erred. On the record before us, we conclude that the error cannot be deemed harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We base this determination on several factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the ex parte conversation dealt with a substantive sentencing matter (whether Craven's rehabilitation could be considered extraordinary given his prison disciplinary record). Second, the conversation was plainly determinative of the court's decision to depart. Indeed, like a pearl around a grain of sand, the decision anent the proper sentence to be imposed was formed around the impermissible ex parte conversation. Third, since the court sentenced Craven immediately after it revealed that it had spoken with Dr. Weisman ex parte, the government had no realistic opportunity to challenge the expert's conclusions by cross-examination or otherwise. Fourth, and finally, there is no contemporaneous record of the conversation -- only the district court's oral summary of its contents -- thereby complicating harmless-error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We do not doubt the trial judge's good intentions -- but in her zeal to collect all possible information without further delaying the disposition hearing, she went too far. Under the circumstances that obtain here, we cannot permit the tainted departure to stand. The sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This determination does not end our odyssey. The question remains whether the remand should be to the same or a different judge. Engaging in ex parte communications with court-appointed experts need not inevitably require a judge's disqualification, but such conduct sometimes can lead to that result. See Edgar v. K.L., 93 F.3d 256, 262 (7th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (ordering disqualification where the ex parte discussions with court-appointed experts touched on the merits of the dispute and were not justified by any exigent circumstances). The Seventh Circuit's rationale applies here. When a judge receives information that does not enter the record, the reliability of that information may not be tested through the adversary process. Id. at 259 (noting that \"[o]ff-the-record briefings . . . leave no trace in the record\" and \"[w]hat information passed to the judge, and how reliable it may have been, are now unknowable\"). Moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a judge, no matter how sincere, to purge that information from her mind -- and, equally, to maintain the perception of impartiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These concerns crest in the criminal sentencing context. See generally United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir. 1993) (remarking that \"a court must take pains to base sentencing judgments upon reliable and accurate information\"). The level of concern is heightened even further where, as in this case, the information gleaned ex parte was incontrovertibly the basis for the sentencing decision. Finally, were we to remand this case for resentencing by the same judge, we believe that it would be surpassingly difficult for her to disregard the guidance that she previously received from Dr. Weisman. For these reasons, we direct that the case be reassigned to a new trier. See United States v. Curran, 926 F.2d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 1991) (remanding to a different judge for resentencing where the sentencing judge considered victim letters that were neither included in record nor made available to the defense); cf. United States v. Berzon, 941 F.2d 8, 20 (1st Cir. 1991) (directing sentencing judge to step aside on remand for resentencing if he had relied on improperly obtained information during original sentencing hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Since Craven did not file a cross-appeal, we lack jurisdiction over his attempted attack on his sentence and do not pass upon its merits. We do have jurisdiction, however, over the government's appeal. In that regard, we annul the downward departure for extraordinary presentence rehabilitation, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing before a different judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this case, the district court gave Craven the maximum three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility (in addition to the downward departure for extraordinary presentence rehabilitation).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The only reported case in which an appellate court has affirmed a downward departure for presentence rehabilitation based solely on overcoming addiction is United States v. Newlon, 212 F.3d 423 (8th Cir. 2000). The Newlon panel authorized a departure where the defendant, prior to his arrest, had spent approximately eighty-five hours in a structured treatment program, his counselor attested to his sincere desire for a cure, and his family noticed a marked improvement in his demeanor. Id. at 424. Newlon is readily distinguishable from the instant case for at least two reasons. First, Newlon's rehabilitation occurred before the authorities zeroed in on him. Second, no factors were present there that belied the claimed existence of a fundamental change in attitude.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We hasten to add that not every ex parte contact between a judge and a court-appointed expert automatically will result in reversal. E.g., Green, 544 F.2d at 146. Here, however, the risk of taint runs high: the court relied heavily on its ex parte communication with Dr. Weisman to ground the downward departure.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The defendant, Alfred Craven, resists the government's appeal and simultaneously attempts to persuade us that the Supreme Court's recent decision in Apprendi v.

Because Craven has not cross-appealed, his Apprendi-based claim is not properly before us and we refrain from burrowing into its merits. This leaves the government's appeal -- an appeal which requires us to consider the district court's authority vel non to engage in ex parte discussions of substantive matters with court-appointed experts. We conclude that the sentencing court erred in undertaking, and then basing its departure decision on, an ex parte communication. Hence, we vacate Craven's sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1999, Craven pleaded guilty to nine counts arising from his involvement in a massive marijuana distribution scheme. A series of sentencing hearings ensued. At the first session, held on December 13, 1999, the district court tentatively fixed the guideline sentencing range (GSR) at 235-293 months, based on an adjusted offense level of thirty-six (including, inter alia, a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under USSG &#167;3E1.1) and a criminal history category of III. Craven then lobbied for a downward departure, asserting that he had turned his life around about a year before his arrest (e.g., he had stopped drinking and using drugs, obtained gainful employment, reconciled with his girlfriend, and begun to act as a parent to his young son). In support, he tendered letters from family and friends corroborating this about-face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge advised the parties that she intended to have an expert \"document\" Craven's rehabilitation. To this end, she entered an order directing Dr. Laurence Weisman, a psychologist, to conduct a substance abuse evaluation and submit a report. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3552(b) (authorizing the sentencing court to order a study of the defendant if additional information is needed). Dr. Weisman interviewed Craven and prepared a report concluding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alfred Craven is a man at a crossroads in his life. From a chaotic and dysfunctional background that lacked warmth, modelling and supervision, he eased into a life of self-destructive drug addiction and criminal activity through which to support the addiction. Through some innate resources and strength, he appears to have made the necessary commitment to self-rehabilitation, sobriety and a productive lifestyle. Although he has had no formal treatment, his claims to have lived for over a year as a sober, contributing member of a community, as well as his involvement in a nuclear family as father and partner, bode well for a successful adjustment back to society upon his release from prison. As with any individual attempting to overcome a background of addiction and criminal lifestyle, the prognosis remains guardedly optimistic if the individual participates in a comprehensive, longterm recovery program. Mr. Craven appears to have demonstrated both the willingness and capability which would make him a good candidate to succeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this optimistic prognosis, the government remained skeptical about Craven's purported rehabilitation. To help prove its point, the government produced disciplinary records from the correctional facility in which Craven had been detained pending disposition of the charges against him. These records showed that during a period of slightly less than two years, ending December 10, 1999, Craven had committed no fewer than eighteen disciplinary infractions. These included twice threatening correctional officers, twice flooding his cell, fighting on four occasions, possessing homemade alcohol, refusing to accept a housing assignment, refusing to obey other orders, and causing various disruptions. The records also showed that Craven had admitted to at least eleven of the infractions, including fighting, threatening an officer, and possessing homemade alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reconvened the disposition hearing on March 10, 2000. At that time, it weighed Dr. Weisman's opinions against Craven's sorry disciplinary record and expressed concern about whether Craven's behavior while in custody \"undermine[d] Dr. Weisman's conclusions.\" Troubled by that seeming paradox, the court gave Craven's lawyer additional time to address the disciplinary violations. The court noted that \"in the absence of dealing with [those violations], I can't depart downward.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the third and final sentencing hearing, held five days later, Craven's counsel did not deal with the paradox. The district court nonetheless made two downward departures. First, it reduced Craven's criminal history category from III to I on the ground that the higher category overstated his criminal past. See USSG &#167;4A1.3, p.s. (authorizing such departures). This step shrank Craven's GSR to 188-235 months. The government has not inveighed against this aspect of Craven's sentence, and we do not discuss it further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge then turned to the issue of extraordinary rehabilitation. She began her explanation by attempting to reconcile Craven's disciplinary infractions with a finding of rehabilitation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I had about an hour conversation with Dr. Weisman. First, this case began with the representations made both to [the Probation Department] and to various members of Alfred Craven's family that he had voluntarily and successfully discontinued his use of all alcohol and illicit substances in August of '96. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[S]uccessfully discontinuing all alcohol and illicit substances without any counseling, without any drug treatment, without any efforts to get at the underlying cause, is a very difficult thing and is particularly difficult for someone with the background of Mr. Craven. He had been involved in substance abuse and addictions since age 14, which is a very long time, and . . . his family was, as Dr. Weisman describes, dysfunctional, chaotic. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I faxed to [Dr. Weisman] the disciplinary records. I was concerned the last time, because there were extraordinary disciplinary records for pretrial detention. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I asked him if that suggests, then, that this rehabilitation wasn't in good faith. And he said no. He said judges are wrong in believing that . . . rehabilitation . . . is a continuous unilinear, uninterrupted pattern, and that the observations that he had made of Mr. Alfred Craven still are true . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, he is not at all concerned that these would be problems of accommodation in a prison, that are still consistent with someone who is struggling with a very difficult and very extensive drug addiction. And, in fact, he said to me, it comes from having dealt with drug addiction on your own rather than in a structured situation with counseling, where you're dealing with what the causes are.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, invoking USSG &#167;5K2.0, the judge departed downward on the basis of extraordinary rehabilitation. This departure, equivalent to two offense levels, lowered the GSR to 151-188 months. The judge thereupon imposed a sentence at the bottom of the newly-calculated range. The government appeals the sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our ensuing discussion, we first dispose of Craven's Apprendi-based claim. We then address the government's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE DEFENDANT'S NON-APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blithely overlooking his failure to cross-appeal, Craven asseverates that the Supreme Court's recent Apprendi decision calls into question the constitutionality of his sentence. His argument goes this way: 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(D) sets a maximum sentence of five years for controlled substance violations involving marijuana; longer sentences can be imposed only for specific drug quantities; and since the indictment returned against him did not state any specific drug quantity (although he signed a plea agreement that did), no sentence longer than five years is permissible under Apprendi. To rub salt in the resultant wound, Craven further argues that he must be sentenced based on the minimum amount of marijuana contemplated by the statute (250 grams), which, with a criminal history category of I, would yield a maximum sentence of no longer than six months. See USSG &#167;2D1.1(c)(17); USSG Ch.5, Pt. A (sentencing table).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Craven's argument has some problematic aspects. In the first place, Apprendi requires that \"any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment . . . .\" 120 S. Ct. at 2355. At first blush, it is unclear whether drug quantity in this instance increases the \"maximum penalty\" permitted by the statute. Cf. United States v. Baltas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199221\"><a href=\"/opinion/199221/united-states-v-baltas/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, (1st Cir. 2001)(holding Apprendi inapplicable in heroin trafficking prosecution, even though drug quantity not determined by the jury, because district court sentenced defendant within the statutory maximum); United States v. Lafreniere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199220\"><a href=\"/opinion/199220/united-states-v-lafreniere/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, (1st Cir. 2001)(same). In the second place, an omitted element of an offense, if not seasonably called to the attention of the trial court, may well engender plain error review and, therefore, not automatically require reversal. E.g., United States v. Mojica-Baez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770724\"><a href=\"/opinion/770724/united-states-v-john-alexis-mojica-baez-united-states-of-america-v-josue/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 306-07 (1st Cir. 2000). The problematic aspects of Craven's thesis would appear to be particularly acute because he admitted in the plea agreement to responsibility for 1,000 to 3,000 kilograms of marijuana and the statutory maximum for distributing 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana is life imprisonment. See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we leave these arguments for another day since we lack jurisdiction to decide the merits of Craven's plaint. The district court entered judgment in this case on April 13, 2000. The government filed its appeal on May 8, 2000. Craven had ten days thereafter within which to file notice of a cross-appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (explaining that a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of the entry of judgment or the filing of a government notice of appeal, whichever last occurs). Craven did not avail himself of this opportunity. That omission forecloses his Apprendi claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, an appellee may defend the judgment below on any ground made manifest by the record. See Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ludwig, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109485\"><a href=\"/opinion/109485/massachusetts-mut-ins-co-v-ludwig/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 481 (1976) (\"[I]t is . . . settled that the appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it.\") (citation omitted); Olsen v. Correiro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198609\"><a href=\"/opinion/198609/olsen-v-correiro/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 58 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999) (indicating that a cross-appeal is not needed \"unless a party is trying to expand its rights by modifying the judgment in some fashion\"). This paradigm applies in criminal cases. See United States v. Lieberman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588121\"><a href=\"/opinion/588121/united-states-v-arthur-lieberman/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>, 996 n.5 (3d Cir. 1992). Nevertheless, a party may not seek to revise the trial court's judgment without first filing a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court limned the basic rule three-quarters of a century ago:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that a party who does not appeal from a final decree of the trial court cannot be heard in opposition thereto when the case is brought here by the appeal of the adverse party. In other words, the appellee may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary, whether what he seeks is to correct an error or to supplement the decree with respect to a matter not dealt with below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Am. Ry. Exp. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100457\"><a href=\"/opinion/100457/united-states-v-american-ry-exp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 435 (1924). The Court reaffirmed the rule in Ludwig, 426 U.S. at 480-81. It is fully applicable in criminal cases. E.g., United States v. Neal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724891\"><a href=\"/opinion/724891/united-states-v-edwin-a-neal/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 224 (6th Cir. 1996) (applying the rule to bar non-appealing criminal defendant's effort to seek judgment of acquittal). Thus, a criminal defendant, qua appellee, may not seek a reduction in his sentence without having filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Craven has two responses to this jurisdictional bar. First, he makes a plea for us to hear his claim based on judicial economy (the fact that the case is already before us on the government's appeal). Second, he points to cases that treat failure to charge elements of a crime in the indictment as jurisdictional defects that can be raised at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Craven's first contention, any appellee could trumpet judicial economy as a reason for allowing him or her to attack a judgment without having filed a notice of appeal. To accept this contention would therefore require us to turn a deaf ear to the Court's unambiguous teachings. We are unwilling to follow this renegade course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like a seldom-used ketchup bottle, Craven's second asseveration looks full at a glance, but it is almost impossible to get anything out of it. Craven grounds this asseveration upon statements that, devoid of context, might appear to support his position. E.g., United States v. Foley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710876\"><a href=\"/opinion/710876/united-states-v-richard-foley-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 488 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"In a criminal case, a failure of the indictment to charge an offense may be treated as [a] jurisdictional defect, and an appellate court must notice such a flaw even if the issue was raised neither in the district court nor on appeal.\") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Salinas v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span> (1997). But we have warned before of the perils of wrenching statements in judicial opinions free of their contextual moorings and then attempting to rely on them. E.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593905\"><a href=\"/opinion/593905/liberty-mutual-insurance-company-v-commercial-union-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 752 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it is here: in each and every case that Craven cites, the defendant was appealing his sentence. Thus, the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider the effect of the government's failure to include an element of the offense of conviction in the indictment. Craven does not proffer a single case, nor do we know of one, in which a court of appeals decided the issue of whether elements were missing from an indictment when the defendant had entered a guilty plea and elected not to appeal his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would serve no useful purpose. We hold, without serious question, that we lack jurisdiction to entertain Craven's Apprendi-based claim in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE GOVERNMENT'S APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the federal sentencing guidelines are designed to reduce the incidence of disparities, departures are the exception, not the rule. United States v. Jackson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195501\"><a href=\"/opinion/195501/united-states-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 201 (1st Cir. 1994). But that does not mean that a rote application of the guidelines always must dictate the dimensions of a defendant's sentence. A court may impose a sentence outside the GSR whenever the court supportably determines \"that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b); seealso USSG &#167;5K2.0 (implementing statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Departure decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. Koon v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 96-100 (1996); United States v. Martin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799752\"><a href=\"/opinion/799752/united-states-v-eugene-edward-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir. 2000). As Koon explains, in deciding whether or not to depart \"the district court must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing.\" 518 U.S. at 98. In turn, the court of appeals must respect the district court's special competence in sentencing matters. Consequently, we afford substantial deference to most departure decisions. E.g., United States v. Bradstreet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768063\"><a href=\"/opinion/768063/united-states-v-bernard-f-bradstreet/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2000) (deferring to district court's determination that defendant's extraordinary post-sentence rehabilitation warranted a downward departure); United States v. Amirault, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799753\"><a href=\"/opinion/799753/united-states-v-alan-lee-amirault/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 11-14 (1st Cir. 2000) (affirming upward departure premised on defendant's sexual abuse of sisters-in-law). Respect, however, does not compel blind allegiance. Koon, 518 U.S. at 98; see also United States v. Snyder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197800\"><a href=\"/opinion/197800/united-states-v-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 67-70 (1st Cir. 1998) (vacating downward departure grounded on federal/state sentencing disparity). Were the law otherwise, appellate review of departure decisions would be an empty exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the government argues that the lower court abused its discretion when it departed downward on the basis of what it described as Craven's extraordinary presentence rehabilitation. The government offers two main theories in support of this argument. First, it maintains that the district court improperly included in the sentencing calculus knowledge gleaned during its ex parte discussion with Dr. Weisman. Second, the government maintains that the record in this case, with or without the fruits of the forbidden ex parte communication, fails to sustain a reasoned conclusion that Craven achieved the extraordinary level of rehabilitation necessary to justify a downward departure. Craven responds that the ex parte discourse was entirely proper, and that the record supplies an adequate factual foundation for a finding of extraordinary presentence rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some prefatory comments are useful to place these arguments into perspective. Ordinarily, presentence rehabilitation is not a permissible ground for departure because it can be factored adequately into the sentencing equation by an acceptance-of-responsibility credit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See USSG &#167;3E1.1, comment. (n.1(g)) (listing \"post-offense rehabilitative efforts (e.g., counseling or drug treatment)\" as considerations in granting an acceptance-of-responsibility credit); see also United States v. Sklar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 115-16 (1st Cir. 1990). But a datum that is taken into account by a guideline nonetheless can form the basis for a departure if it is \"present to an exceptional degree\" or \"makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.\" Koon, 518 U.S. at 96. In an appropriate case, therefore, extraordinary presentence rehabilitation can ground a downward departure. United States v. Whitaker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757281\"><a href=\"/opinion/757281/united-states-v-john-hudson-whitaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span>, 1240 (10th Cir. 1998); United States v. Kapitzke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748796\"><a href=\"/opinion/748796/united-states-v-james-allen-kapitzke/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, 823 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Sally, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741915\"><a href=\"/opinion/741915/united-states-v-albert-sally-aka-pj-albert-sally/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 80 (3d Cir. 1997); United States v. Brock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736966\"><a href=\"/opinion/736966/united-states-v-donald-reece-brock/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35 (4th Cir. 1997); Sklar, 920 F.2d at 116. Withal, downward departures for presentence rehabilitation are hen's-teeth rare, and our precedent makes clear that such departures are to be granted sparingly. See Sklar, 920 F.2d at 116. \"It is only the occasional instance, where time and circumstances permit and the accused takes full advantage of both, that will produce rehabilitation so dramatic as to cross the boundary.\" Id. at 117.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the question, broadly stated, of whether the facts pertaining to Craven's claimed rehabilitation, as supportably found by the district court, qualify under this rubric. In conducting such an inquiry, we use a three-part test. First, we evaluate whether the circumstances cited by the sentencing court are sufficiently unusual to justify the departure. If so, we next inquire into whether those circumstances are adequately documented in the record. If the departure clears these two hurdles, we then measure its reasonableness. See United States v. Dethlefs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197512\"><a href=\"/opinion/197512/united-states-v-dethlefs/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1997); Sklar, 920 F.2d at 114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two inquiries sometimes overlap and the lines that separate them sometimes blur. This case is a paradigmatic example of that phenomenon: because of the doubts surrounding the propriety of the ex parte communication, the question of whether the set of circumstances relied upon by the district court was legally sufficient to justify a downward departure cannot easily be separated from the question of whether the court's findings rest upon an acceptable evidentiary foundation. Hence, we consider the first two branches of the test in the ensemble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precedent provides some guideposts. We have twice before been called upon to assess a defendant's efforts to purge himself of addiction as a ground for a rehabilitation-based departure.On both occasions, we found that the efforts fell short. In Sklar, the defendant, after his arrest, attempted to vanquish his drug addiction by admitting himself to a halfway house and undertaking other rehabilitative measures. 920 F.2d at 114. We nevertheless set aside the sentencing court's downward departure, finding that the defendant's accomplishments, though laudable, were not exceptional enough to support such a hard-to-achieve departure. Id. at 117. Similarly, in United States v. Rushby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563223\"><a href=\"/opinion/563223/united-states-v-john-rushby/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1991), we concluded that the defendant's endeavors, including his post-arrest abstinence and his enrollment in a treatment program for substance abuse, did not warrant a rehabilitation-based downward departure. Id. at 42-43. This was so notwithstanding other exemplary behavior on the defendant's part, e.g., attending to family responsibilities and holding gainful employment. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Craven argues here, as he did below, that his case differs materially from our earlier precedents because both Sklar's and Rushby's rehabilitative efforts began post-arrest, whereas he disavowed drugs and alcohol approximately a year before federal authorities apprehended him. To drive home the significance of this distinction, Craven notes that other courts have given this sort of sequencing weight in assessing whether a defendant's presentence rehabilitation merits a downward departure. E.g., United States v. DeShon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765176\"><a href=\"/opinion/765176/united-states-v-richard-andrew-deshon-also-known-as-andy-deshon/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 889 (8th Cir. 1999) (affirming downward departure where defendant had made radical lifestyle changes a year before his indictment); United States v. Workman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715778\"><a href=\"/opinion/715778/united-states-of-america-appellee-cross-appellant-v-norman-workman/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, 701 (2d Cir. 1996) (affirming downward departure where defendant had completed military service honorably before his arrest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the distinction advocated by Craven may, on occasion, be salient. Here, however, the circumstances effectively nullify its potential importance. The reason that timing matters in rehabilitation cases is that a defendant who decides independently to turn his life around likely deserves higher marks than one who undertakes rehabilitation mainly (or at least partially) to gain advantage in imminent criminal proceedings. See Workman, 80 F.3d at 701 (emphasizing that \"rehabilitation was not undertaken at the spur of impending prosecution\"). But that rationale is inapplicable here: the district court warrantably found that Craven knew the government was \"at the door\" early in 1996, well before he ceased using illicit substances and set out along the path of rehabilitation. Since Craven knew that he was the target of an investigation prior to commencing his efforts at rehabilitation, the fact that he renounced drugs and alcohol before he was actually arrested does not serve to distinguish his situation from Sklar and Rushby in any meaningful way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, moreover, Craven's disciplinary record while in pretrial detention casts significant doubt over the advisability of the downward departure. After all, overcoming drug addiction is neither the equivalent of extraordinary rehabilitation nor a guaranteed ticket to a downward departure on that basis. See United States v. Herman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762754\"><a href=\"/opinion/762754/united-states-v-wayne-herman-and-van-talley-raulo-jeffers/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 209 (2d Cir. 1999) (finding defendant \"merely a rehabilitated drug addict, not a rehabilitated criminal\"). The touchstone of extraordinary rehabilitation is a fundamental change in attitude. See, e.g., Bradstreet, 207 F.3d at 78-79, 83-84 (affirming downward departure for extraordinary post-sentence rehabilitation on basis of defendant's tutoring other prisoners, teaching adult education classes in prison, serving as prison chaplain's assistant and clerk of prison parenting program, and lecturing in the community on ethical perils in the business world); DeShon, 183 F.3d at 890-92 (affirming downward departure for extraordinary presentence rehabilitation on the basis of defendant's genuine acknowledgment of responsibility for his crimes and radical alteration of his lifestyle to include attending church four times a week, receiving continuous counseling, and working over seventy hours a week to catch up on bills). Craven's prison record seems inconsistent with a fundamental change in attitude (and, thus, with the high level of rehabilitation essential for a downward departure).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nevertheless hesitate to say, as a matter of law, that Craven does not qualify for a downward departure. Both Sklar and Rushby predate the Court's decision in Koon, and Koon highlights the desirability of deference to the sentencing court in such fact-sensitive judgments. Thus, although Koon may not have changed the mode of analysis that previously prevailed in departure cases in this circuit, e.g., United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 950-52 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Diaz-Villafane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49-52 (1st Cir. 1989), it added a gloss that gives us pause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a highly ramified question -- and one which ought not be addressed on an uncertain record. We think that the course of prudence is for us to leave open the question of whether the circumstances justify a departure until we first answer the closely related question of whether the sentencing court acted on the basis of information that was properly before it. We turn, then, to that inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below departed downward based on two key findings. First, it concluded that Craven, on his own, gave up drugs prior to his arrest and conquered a long-term addiction. Second, it solicited Dr. Weisman's opinion ex parte and, based on that opinion, found that the proliferation of disciplinary violations did not undercut this supposed rehabilitation. The nub of the question, then, is whether the sentencing court erred in undertaking this ex parte contact and premising a critical finding on information received during the ensuing conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What transpired below is not disputed. At the second of Craven's three sentencing hearings, the district judge struggled with the conflicting evidence on rehabilitation. She determined that she could not grant a downward departure without some cogent rationalization of Craven's disciplinary violations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Y]ou have to deal with the record in prison, because . . . I actually haven't seen this in other defendants. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there's an explanation, I want to hear it. But you have to deal with this. This is not - having surfaced this, it can't be ignored. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have to deal with this and you have to deal with it. And in the absence of dealing with it, I can't depart downward. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge gave defense counsel time to investigate the infractions and to reconcile them, if possible, with the claim of rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the final sentencing hearing, Craven's lawyer provided no further explanation for the parlous disciplinary record. The district court nonetheless departed downward for extraordinary presentence rehabilitation based on a one-hour ex parte conversation with Dr. Weisman. The government made a proper contemporaneous objection to the court's reliance on this ex parte conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the government notes that the lawyers were not privy to the court's conversation with the expert; that the substance of the discussion was not placed in the record; and that the government had no opportunity either to cross-examine the expert or to respond to his opinions. We agree with the government that a sentencing court may not utilize an ex parte conversation with a court-appointed expert as a means to acquire information critical to a sentencing determination and then rely on that information in fashioning the defendant's sentence. We conclude, moreover, that the district court's violation of this principle taints the factual basis for the departure decision and leaves us unable to determine whether Craven's efforts to overcome his addiction qualify him for a downward departure. See Martin, 221 F.3d at 58 (ending analysis upon determining that sentencing court relied on forbidden information in departing). We explain our thinking below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, the law frowns upon ex parte communications between judges and court-appointed experts. See Bradley v. Milliken, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377924\"><a href=\"/opinion/377924/ronald-bradley-v-william-g-milliken-governor-and-board-of-education-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span>, 1158 (6th Cir. 1980) (expressing concern that reports of court-appointed experts were not placed in record or made available to parties); United States v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"340060\"><a href=\"/opinion/340060/united-states-v-michael-stanley-green-aka-m-s-greene-and-lulseged/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 146 n.16 (3d Cir. 1976) (\"Generally . . . the court should avoid ex parte communications with anyone associated with the trial, even its own appointed expert.\"); seegenerally 29 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 6305 (1997 &amp; Supp. 2000) (\"[E]x parte communications between the judge and the expert . . . are discouraged.\"). The reason is obvious: most ex parte contacts between a trial judge and another participant in the proceedings risk harm, and ex parte communications with key witnesses (such as court-appointed experts) are no exception. To the contrary, such ex parte contacts can create situations pregnant with problematic possibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any convincing reason for exempting communications undertaken in the course of sentencing from this general prohibition. In point of fact, the statutory provision under which the district court recruited Dr. Weisman does not contemplate substantive ex parte communications between the appointer and the appointee. Rather, it requires that the expert file with the court \"a written report of the pertinent results of the study,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3552(b), and the court must ensure that the report is disclosed to the defendant, his counsel, and the prosecutor prior to the disposition hearing, id. &#167; 3552(d). While the statute does not deal explicitly with the procedure to be followed if the court requires information over and above that contained in the original report, it follows logically that the same or equivalent safeguards (i.e., a written response delivered to all parties in advance of sentencing) should obtain. Accord United States v. Blythe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567977\"><a href=\"/opinion/567977/united-states-v-william-scott-blythe/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 360 (7th Cir. 1991) (determining that section 3552(d)'s framework for review by all interested parties applies to an addendum to the presentence report).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that if a sentencing court desires additional information from a court-appointed expert, it must either (1) make a written request for a supplemental report and provide that supplemental report to the parties in accordance with the procedure described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3552(d), or (2) bring the expert into court to be questioned in the presence of the parties. Such an even-handed approach not only honors what we believe to be the intent of the drafters of section 3552, but also fits neatly with the prevailing view as to how courts should communicate with court-appointed experts on matters of substance. E.g., Bradley, 620 F.2d at 1158 (opining that \"if any experts are employed to advise the district court . . . they shall prepare written reports, copies of which shall become part of the record and shall be made available to all parties or their attorneys\"); Green, 544 F.2d at 146 n.16 (observing that the most appropriate way for a court to talk with its appointed expert would be through \"an on-the-record conference in chambers or an on-the-record conference call so that counsel for all parties may participate\"); Joe S. Cecil &amp; Thomas E. Willging, Court-Appointed Experts: Defining the Role of Experts Appointed Under Federal Rule of Evidence 706, at 91-92 (1993) (\"If the judge and the expert expect to confer in person . . . [r]epresentatives of the parties can be invited to attend the conference or . . . a record of the discussion can be forwarded to the parties.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below acted in a manner inconsistent with this prudential rule and therefore erred. On the record before us, we conclude that the error cannot be deemed harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We base this determination on several factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the ex parte conversation dealt with a substantive sentencing matter (whether Craven's rehabilitation could be considered extraordinary given his prison disciplinary record). Second, the conversation was plainly determinative of the court's decision to depart. Indeed, like a pearl around a grain of sand, the decision anent the proper sentence to be imposed was formed around the impermissible ex parte conversation. Third, since the court sentenced Craven immediately after it revealed that it had spoken with Dr. Weisman ex parte, the government had no realistic opportunity to challenge the expert's conclusions by cross-examination or otherwise. Fourth, and finally, there is no contemporaneous record of the conversation -- only the district court's oral summary of its contents -- thereby complicating harmless-error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We do not doubt the trial judge's good intentions -- but in her zeal to collect all possible information without further delaying the disposition hearing, she went too far. Under the circumstances that obtain here, we cannot permit the tainted departure to stand. The sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This determination does not end our odyssey. The question remains whether the remand should be to the same or a different judge. Engaging in ex parte communications with court-appointed experts need not inevitably require a judge's disqualification, but such conduct sometimes can lead to that result. See Edgar v. K.L., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724897\"><a href=\"/opinion/724897/in-the-matter-of-james-r-edgar-governor-of-illinois-and-ann-patla/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 262 (7th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (ordering disqualification where the ex parte discussions with court-appointed experts touched on the merits of the dispute and were not justified by any exigent circumstances). The Seventh Circuit's rationale applies here. When a judge receives information that does not enter the record, the reliability of that information may not be tested through the adversary process. Id. at 259 (noting that \"[o]ff-the-record briefings . . . leave no trace in the record\" and \"[w]hat information passed to the judge, and how reliable it may have been, are now unknowable\"). Moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a judge, no matter how sincere, to purge that information from her mind -- and, equally, to maintain the perception of impartiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These concerns crest in the criminal sentencing context. See generally United States v. Tavano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195113\"><a href=\"/opinion/195113/united-states-v-tavano/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 305 (1st Cir. 1993) (remarking that \"a court must take pains to base sentencing judgments upon reliable and accurate information\"). The level of concern is heightened even further where, as in this case, the information gleaned ex parte was incontrovertibly the basis for the sentencing decision. Finally, were we to remand this case for resentencing by the same judge, we believe that it would be surpassingly difficult for her to disregard the guidance that she previously received from Dr. Weisman. For these reasons, we direct that the case be reassigned to a new trier. See United States v. Curran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556392\"><a href=\"/opinion/556392/united-states-v-walter-f-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir. 1991) (remanding to a different judge for resentencing where the sentencing judge considered victim letters that were neither included in record nor made available to the defense); cf. United States v. Berzon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566304\"><a href=\"/opinion/566304/united-states-v-robert-alan-berzon/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir. 1991) (directing sentencing judge to step aside on remand for resentencing if he had relied on improperly obtained information during original sentencing hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Since Craven did not file a cross-appeal, we lack jurisdiction over his attempted attack on his sentence and do not pass upon its merits. We do have jurisdiction, however, over the government's appeal. In that regard, we annul the downward departure for extraordinary presentence rehabilitation, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing before a different judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this case, the district court gave Craven the maximum three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility (in addition to the downward departure for extraordinary presentence rehabilitation).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The only reported case in which an appellate court has affirmed a downward departure for presentence rehabilitation based solely on overcoming addiction is United States v. Newlon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768697\"><a href=\"/opinion/768697/united-states-v-kelvin-newlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span> (8th Cir. 2000). The Newlon panel authorized a departure where the defendant, prior to his arrest, had spent approximately eighty-five hours in a structured treatment program, his counselor attested to his sincere desire for a cure, and his family noticed a marked improvement in his demeanor. Id. at 424. Newlon is readily distinguishable from the instant case for at least two reasons. First, Newlon's rehabilitation occurred before the authorities zeroed in on him. Second, no factors were present there that belied the claimed existence of a fundamental change in attitude.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We hasten to add that not every ex parte contact between a judge and a court-appointed expert automatically will result in reversal. E.g., Green, 544 F.2d at 146. Here, however, the risk of taint runs high: the court relied heavily on its ex parte communication with Dr. Weisman to ground the downward departure.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
