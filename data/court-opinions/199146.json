Ogden, Acting\nAssistant Attorney General, Richard M. Evans, Assistant\nDirector, and John L. Davis, Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, were on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                         November 1, 2000\n\n\n________________\n\f      *Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\n\n          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.            During a cocaine-trafficking\n\ninvestigation in 1990, the police conducted a search of Antonia-\n\nAybar-Alejo's       residence,    where     they     found      a    .38   caliber\n\nderringer pistol loaded with two live rounds of ammunition.                     She\n\nwas charged with possession of a firearm by an alien under Rhode\n\nIsland law.    Alejo pled nolo contendre to the firearms charge in\n\n1992; a second charge for cocaine possession was dismissed.\n\n          Petitioner was placed into deportation proceedings on\n\nNovember 10, 1992.        The Immigration Judge found Alejo deportable\n\nunder Section 241(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct   (INA)   due    to    her   conviction      for     firearm      possession.\n\nSubsequently, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed\n\nAlejo's   appeal,     finding     that     she     had   been       convicted   of\n\npossession of a firearm and was not eligible for suspension of\n\ndeportation.\n\n          Alejo was convicted under R.I.G.L. § 11-47-7, which\n\nstates the following:\n\n      No unnaturalized foreign born person who entered the\n      United States in violation of the laws of the United\n      States or, having legally entered the United States in\n      a lawful manner but now remains in the United States\n      in violation of the laws of the United States, shall\n      purchase, own, carry, transport, or have in his or her\n      possession or under his or her control any firearm.\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f(Emphasis added.)\n\nPetitioner argues that either possession or control of the\n\nfirearm is a possible offense under the Rhode Island statute,\n\nand that conviction for control of the firearm would not make\n\nher deportable.    We hold that \"control\" of the firearm under the\n\nRhode   Island   law   constitutes   constructive   possession   of   a\n\nfirearm and, thus, a violation of federal immigration law.\n\nGiven Alejo's conviction of a deportable offense, we have no\n\njurisdiction to review her petition.          Accordingly, we must\n\ndismiss it.\n\n                                 I.\n\nPossession of a Firearm under the INA\n\n          We must first ascertain whether the INA intends a\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdistinction      between    possession     and   control   of   a   firearm.1\n\nSection 241(a)(2)(C) of the Act specifies:\n\n            Certain firearm offenses. Any alien who at\n            any time after admission is convicted under\n            any law of purchasing, selling, offering for\n            sale, exchanging, using, owning, possessing,\n            or carrying, or of attempting or conspiring\n            to purchase, sell, offer for sale, exchange,\n            use, own, possess, or carry, any weapon,\n            part, or accessory which is a firearm or\n            destructive device (as defined in section\n            921(a) of title 18, United States Code) in\n            violation of any law is deportable.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C).\n\n            Although we have not found cases addressing the meaning\n\nof   \"possession\"    under    this   provision,     we   have   found    cases\n\ndealing with firearm possession under other federal laws.                Those\n\ncases     make   clear     that   possession     means   both   actual    and\n\n\n      1\n     Appellate review of deportation determinations is curtailed\nby Section 440(a) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996, Pub.L.No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1277\n(\"AEDPA\") (enacted April 24, 1996), and subsequently by Section\n309(c)(4)(G) of the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L.No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009\n(\"IIRIRA\")(enacted September 30, 1996). Because Alejo was in\ndeportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997, this action is\ngoverned by the transitional rules of section 309(c)(4) of the\nIIRIRA, which apply to judicial review of deportation orders\nentered on or after October 31, 1996. These rules state: \"there\nshall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who\nis...deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense\ncovered in section...241(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of the\n[INA].\" IIRIRA § 309(c)(4)(G). We may determine whether Alejo\nwas convicted of a crime encompassed by this section.      If we\nfind that petitioner was in fact convicted of such an offense,\nwe must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. See Maghsoudi v. INS,\n181 F.3d 8, 12 (1999).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fconstructive possession, with the latter involving the concept\n\nof   control.     \"[W]hile   actual    possession   involves      physical\n\ncontact or like\n\nintimate association with the object possessed, constructive\n\npossession may be shown by evidence of an exercise of indirect\n\ndominion or control, either personally or through others, over\n\nobjects not touched or otherwise directly controlled.\" Russell\n\nG.

See United\n\nStates v. Hernandez, 995 F.2d 307, 313 (1st Cir. 1993)(affirming\n\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) for possession that was\n\nconstructive    when   firearm   was    on   the    person   of    a   co-\n\nconspirator); United States v. Smith, 930 F.2d 1081, 1086 (5th\n\nCir. 1991)(finding control and dominion over firearm or premises\n\nto qualify as possession in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861 and 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1)); United States v.

Rogers, 41\n\nF.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 1994)(commenting on violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(1), convicted felon in possession of a firearm).                    See\n\nalso United States v. Maldonado, 23 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1994),\n\ncert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 451 (1994); United States v. Lamare,\n\n711 F.2d 3, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1983).               Furthermore, \"constructive\n\npossession...may be inferred from a defendant's dominion and\n\ncontrol.\" United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).       See also Maldonado, at 7.\n\n            Although we are bound to construe ambiguity in favor\n\nof the alien where it occurs, see Costello v. INS, 376 U.S. 120,\n\n128 (1964);       Fong Haw Tan v.         Phelan, 333 U.S. 6, 10 (1948);\n\nPacheco v. INS, 546 F.2d 448, 449 (1st Cir. 1976), cert. denied,\n\n430 U.S. 985 (1977)(acknowledging principle), we discern no\n\nambiguity in the meaning of \"possessing\" or \"possess\" in section\n\n241(a)(2)(c).        Those words include constructive possession,\n\nwhich     means    the    exercise   of    dominion    or   control   over   the\n\nfirearm.\n\n\n      2Like conclusions have been reached in cases involving\npossession of marijuana, cocaine and other contraband.  See,\ne.g., United States v. Williams-Hendricks, 805 F.2d 496, 500\n(5th Cir. 1986)(regarding violation of 21 U.S.C. § 952(a),\nimportation of controlled substance or narcotic drug).\n\n                                      -6-\n\f                                  II.\n\nThe State Law Conviction\n\n            As noted, Alejo argues that the separate references to\n\npossession and control in the Rhode Island statute mean that\n\nconviction for control of a firearm cannot mean conviction for\n\npossession of a firearm. See supra.           We disagree.    The statute\n\nsimply   describes    both   actual     possession,    \"in   his   or   her\n\npossession\", and constructive possession, \"under his or her\n\ncontrol.\"\n\n            We find confirmation for this view in decisions of the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court.        \"Possession of an object can be\n\neither actual or constructive.          Constructive possession of an\n\nobject occurs when an individual exercises dominion and control\n\nover such object even though it is not within his immediate\n\nphysical possession.\" State v. Jenison, 442 A.2d 866, 875 (R.I.\n\n1982)(involving      conviction   under    R.I.G.L.    §   12-12-1.7    for\n\npossession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver).\n\nSee also State v. Reyes, 671 A.2d 1236, 1238 (R.I. 1996)(finding\n\nconstructive    possession   to   be    the   same    as   possession   for\n\npurposes of conviction under R.I.G.L. § 11-47-8, which involves\n\nany firearm \"in his or her possession or under his or her\n\ncontrol\").     Rhode Island law embraces the familiar principle\n\nthat constructive possession, meaning dominion and control over\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fan item, is tantamount to actual possession.        Accordingly,\n\nAlejo's conviction for possession of a firearm by an alien under\n\nR.I.G.L. § 11-47-7 means that she was convicted of possessing a\n\nfirearm within the meaning of section 241(a)(2)(c) of the INA,\n\nand she is therefore deportable.\n\n                               III.\n\nConclusion\n\n         Alejo's record of conviction is for a firearm offense\n\ngoverned by the INA.   We have no further authority to review the\n\ndecision of the BIA.   We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n         Petition dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

See supra.           We disagree.    The statute\n\nsimply   describes    both   actual     possession,    \"in   his   or   her\n\npossession\", and constructive possession, \"under his or her\n\ncontrol.\"\n\n            We find confirmation for this view in decisions of the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court.        \"Possession of an object can be\n\neither actual or constructive.
