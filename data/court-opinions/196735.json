Narcisa Velasquez petitions this court for\r                              \r\n\nreview  of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\r\n\ndenying her  motion to reopen  her deportation proceedings.   For\r\n\nthe following reasons, we deny the petition.\r\n\n     Velasquez  is  a  native  and  citizen  of Ecuador  who  was\r\n\nadmitted  to this country as  a lawful permanent  resident on May\r\n\n12,  1988.  On  April 28, 1994,  the INS issued  an Order to Show\r\n\nCause  charging   Velasquez  with  deportability  based   on  two\r\n\nconvictions of crimes of moral turpitude, namely, shoplifting and\r\n\nwelfare  fraud.  See 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A)(ii).  A deportation\r                              \r\n\nhearing was held before  an immigration judge (\"IJ\") on  July 26,\r\n\n1994,  at  which  Velasquez   was  represented  by  an  attorney.\r\n\nVelasquez admitted  the convictions  but  sought a  discretionary\r\n\nwaiver  under   212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as\r\n\nwell as suspension of  deportation and voluntary departure.   The\r\n\nIJ found that Velasquez was ineligible for any form of relief and\r\n\nordered her to be deported  to Ecuador.  On May 4,  1995, the BIA\r\n\ndismissed Velasquez's appeal from this decision.\r\n\n     On June 16,  1995, Velasquez  filed a motion  to reopen  the\r\n\ndeportation proceedings to  apply for a    212(c) waiver, arguing\r\n\nthat she was now statutorily eligible  for such relief.  The  BIA\r\n\ndenied the motion to  reopen on November 9, 1995.   This petition\r\n\nfor review followed.\r\n\n     Represented by  new counsel, Velasquez argues  for the first\r\n\ntime that she was deprived  of due process because the IJ  failed\r\n\nto advise her of her eligibility for relief under   212(h) of the\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nAct,  8 U.S.C.    1182(h).  See  8 C.F.R.    242.17(a).   We lack\r                                         \r\n\njurisdiction to reach this  argument.  The exhaustion requirement\r\n\nthat applies in immigration proceedings, see 8 U.S.C.   1105a(c),\r                                                      \r\n\nbars consideration of arguments  not raised before the BIA.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nThomas v.  INS, 976 F.2d 786,  789 (1st Cir. 1992).   Although an\r                        \r\n\nexception exists for constitutional challenges to the Immigration\r\n\nand  Nationality  Act and  INS  procedures,  a petitioner  cannot\r\n\nobtain  review  of  procedural   errors  not  raised  before  the\r\n\nadministrative  tribunal merely  by framing  them as  due process\r\n\nviolations.  See Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 762-63 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1992).    Since  the  BIA could  have  corrected  the  deficiency\r\n\nVelasquez  complains of, see id.  at 762 (observing  that the BIA\r                                          \r\n\nhas  the power to remand a case  to the IJ to remedy deficiencies\r\n\nin procedure), she is barred from raising the issue here.  We add\r\n\nthat, in any event, our review  is limited to the BIA's denial of\r\n\nthe motion to  reopen.   Velasquez makes  no meaningful  argument\r\n\nthat this  denial was in  error.  Indeed,  she concedes  that the\r\n\nmotion to reopen was frivolous.   \r\n\n     Velasquez  also argues  for  the  first  time that  she  was\r\n\ndeprived  of  due  process  by the  incompetency  of  her  former\r\n\ncounsel.   In particular, she  complains that former  counsel was\r\n\nineffective in failing to  raise and pursue a   212(h)  waiver at\r\n\nher deportation hearing, in  raising a non-meritorious ground for\r\n\nrelief before the BIA, and in raising an equally frivolous ground\r\n\nfor  relief in her motion to reopen.   We agree with those courts\r\n\nthat have required petitioners to present ineffective  assistance\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof  counsel claims to the BIA in  the first instance.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nLiu  v.

INS, 993 F.2d  142, 144-45 (7th  Cir. 1993); Dokic  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nINS, 899  F.2d 530, 532 (6th Cir. 1990).  Velasquez may raise her\r             \r\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel argument  before the BIA  in a\r\n\nmotion to  reopen.1   See 8  C.F.R.    3.2,  3.8 (procedures  for\r                                   \r\n\nmotion to reopen or reconsider); see also Matter of Lozado, 19 I.\r                                                                    \r\n\n&amp; N.
