Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                        Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nDonald J.

The district court dismissed the \r\ncomplaint under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for a failure to state a\r\nclaim.  The complaint seeks declaratory and other relief\r\nagainst the state parole authorities for alleged constitutional\r\nviolations in failing to take action on a pending parole\r\nrevocation warrant, delaying or denying a parole hearing, and \r\nmiscalculating plaintiff's parole eligibility date.  \r\n         While the appeal was pending, this court decided, in\r\nWhite v. Gittens, 121 F.3d 803 (1st Cir. 1997), that a  1983\r\naction challenging the validity of a state parole revocation on\r\nconstitutional grounds is not cognizable in federal court\r\nunless and until the parole revocation \"has been reversed on\r\ndirect appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by\r\na state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or\r\ncalled into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus.\"  Id. at 806 (quoting, and extending to parole\r\nrevocations, the rule of Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487\r\n(1994)).   The same rule applies to claims challenging a denial\r\nof parole, and plaintiff's other challenges to the validity or\r\nduration of his confinement.  Id. at 805.\r\n         Accordingly, we need not reach the merits of\r\nplaintiff's pleading.  Id. at 806.  The judgment of dismissal\r\nis affirmed and modified to reflect that the dismissal is\r\nwithout prejudice.  \r\n",
