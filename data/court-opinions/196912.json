(\"MBE\"),  510 Common-\r\n\nwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.  On April 14, he telephoned\r\n\ncompanies  in California,  New York,  Texas, and New  Jersey, and\r\n\nusing the name \"Halford,\" placed orders for computer equipment in\r\n\nbehalf  of a fictitious company, American Telemark, purportedly a\r\n\ndivision  of AT&amp;T,  for delivery  to the  MBE address  in Boston.\r\n\nHensley  remitted  five  forged checks  via  Federal  Express, in\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  charges included mail fraud, 18  U.S.C.   1341 (1994);\r\nwire  fraud, id.   1343; making or possessing counterfeit securi-\r                          \r\nties, id.   513; interstate transportation of counterfeit securi-\r                   \r\nties,  id.    2314; and  receipt of  stolen goods  transported in\r                    \r\ninterstate commerce, id.   2315. \r                                  \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\namounts  ranging from  $20,000 to  $31,000 and  bearing the  AT&amp;T\r\n\nlogo.   Once  the  computer equipment  arrived, Hensley  used the\r\n\nalias \"William Noonan\"  to rent storage space and  a U-Haul truck\r\n\nto  transport the  equipment.   On  his next  visit  to the  MBE,\r\n\nHensley was arrested by the FBI.    \r\n\n          After Hensley  pled guilty and  before sentencing,  the\r\n\ngovernment  learned that  he had committed  additional fraudulent\r\n\nacts during  the same time  period.  According to  the undisputed\r                                                                           \r\n\nfacts  set forth  in the presentence  report (\"PSR\"),  see United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Benjamin, 30 F.3d 196,  197 (1st Cir. 1994) (failing to\r                            \r\n\nobject bars appellate challenge to facts stated in PSR), on March\r\n\n30, 1995, Hensley had used  the \"William Noonan\" alias to  rent a\r\n\nsecond box at another MBE  location, on Newbury Street in Boston.\r\n\nOn  April  3,  \"Noonan\" placed  an  $837.86  telephone  order for\r\n\ncomputer software  with Creative Computers, a California company,\r\n\nfor delivery to the  Newbury Street MBE.  He tendered  a counter-\r\n\nfeit money order drawn on a Boston Check Cashiers (\"BCC\") company\r\n\naccount, which was  dishonored after he  absconded with the  Cre-\r\n\native  Computers software.  Hensley issued three more counterfeit\r\n\nBCC money  orders in payment  for another  computer order  placed\r\n\nwith  ATS Technologies  (\"ATS\"), a  credit card  bill, and  a car\r\n\nrental.\r\n\n          Although  the charged  conduct  resulted  in no  actual\r\n\nlosses because the  equipment was recovered, the  PSR recommended\r\n\nthat  Hensley reimburse  the car  rental  company ($500.00),  the\r\n\ncredit card company ($725.00), Creative Computers  ($837.86), and\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nATS ($1,026.12),  each of  which had  accepted a  counterfeit BCC\r\n\nmoney order.   Hensley objected that the four  companies were not\r\n\nvictims of  the offense of  conviction as the indictment  did not\r\n\ncharge him with passing the counterfeit money  orders.  Following\r\n\nbriefing and oral argument, the district court found that ATS had\r\n\nsustained no loss, and that neither the credit card bill nor  the\r\n\ncar rental  came within the  scope of the offense  of conviction.\r\n\nThe  court nonetheless ruled that the Creative Computers acquisi-\r\n\ntion was within the alleged scheme to defraud.  The court accord-\r\n\ningly directed Hensley to make restitution to Creative Computers,\r\n\nand Hensley appealed. \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Federal courts possess  no inherent authority  to order\r\n\nrestitution, and may do so  only as explicitly empowered by stat-\r\n\nute.   United States v. Gilberg, 75 F.3d  15, 22 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                         \r\n\nThe  VWPA authorizes  restitutionary  sentences  by the  district\r\n\ncourts  for the  benefit  of  victims of  federal  offenses.   As\r\n\nHensley's criminal conduct and conviction occurred after November\r\n\n29,  1990, the effective date  of the Crime  Control Act of 1990,\r\n\nthe 1990 VWPA amendments govern our decision.2     \r\n\n          The VWPA provides that \"[t]he court . . . may order . .\r\n\n. restitution  to any  victim  of such  offense.\"   18  U.S.C.   \r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Gilberg, 75 F.3d at 20-22.  Moreover, the Sentencing Guide-\r                       \r\nlines  do not purport to  expand the sentencing court's authority\r\nto order restitution.  U.S.S.G.   5E1.1(a)(1) (1995) (incorporat-\r\ning the VWPA). \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n3663(a)(1) (emphasis added).   Prior to the  1990 amendments, the\r\n\nVWPA had been interpreted by the Supreme Court as limiting resti-\r\n\ntution to the \"loss caused by the specific conduct that [was] the\r                                                            \r\n\nbasis of  the offense of  conviction.\"  Hughey v.

The  Hughey Court\r                                                                     \r\n\ntherefore reversed a restitutionary sentence which had been based\r\n\non the  total loss  attributable to all  counts in  an indictment\r                                                 \r\n\ncharging unauthorized use  of credit cards and theft  by a Postal\r\n\nService employee, rather than on the loss attributable to the one\r\n\ncount to which Hughey had pled guilty.  Id. at 422.\r                                                     \r\n\n          After Hughey, this court held that the specific conduct\r                                                                           \r\n\nunderlying a  mail fraud  conviction, which  requires proof of  a\r\n\nbroader scheme to  defraud, includes only the  particular mailing\r\n\ncharged and  not the entire mail fraud  scheme.  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCronin, 990 F.2d  663, 666 (1st Cir. 1993);  accord United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Newman, 49 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1995) (wire fraud).   Thus, we\r                   \r\n\nadopted  the more  narrow and  lenient majority  view during  the\r\n\ninterim preceding the  1990 amendments to the VWPA.   Cronin, 990\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 666.  \r\n\n          The present controversy requires us to reexamine Cronin\r                                                                           \r\n\nin light  of the 1990  amendments.  Consistent with  the minority\r\n\nview we rejected in Cronin, in 1990 Congress amended  the VWPA to\r                                    \r\n\nprovide that  \"a victim of an offense that involves as an element\r                                                                           \r\n\na scheme, a  conspiracy, or a pattern of  criminal activity means\r                                                                           \r\n\nany person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe course of the scheme, conspiracy,  or pattern.\"  18 U.S.C.   \r                                  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n3663(a)(2) (emphasis added).   As Hensley concedes  that a scheme\r\n\nto defraud is an element of  the mail and wire fraud offenses  to\r\n\nwhich he  pled guilty, see United States  v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713,\r                                                             \r\n\n723 (1st Cir. 1996), the  district court correctly applied VWPA  \r\n\n3663(a)(2) in this case.  Compare United  States v. Reed, 80 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n1419, 1423 (9th  Cir. 1996) (\"felon  in possession\" offense  does\r\n\nnot require proof of scheme).\r\n\n          Under current VWPA   3663(a)(2), the district court may\r\n\norder   restitution  to  every  victim  directly  harmed  by  the\r\n\ndefendant's conduct \"in the course  of the scheme, conspiracy, or\r\n\npattern of criminal  activity\" that is an element  of the offense\r\n\nof  conviction, without regard to whether the particular criminal\r                                                                           \r\n\nconduct  of the defendant  which directly  harmed the  victim was\r                 \r\n\nalleged in a  count to which  the defendant pled  guilty, or  was\r\n\neven charged in the indictment.

Pepper,  51 F.3d 469, 473  (5th Cir. 1995).   Thus, the\r                          \r\n\nouter limits of  a VWPA   3663(a)(2)  restitution order encompass\r\n\nall direct harm from the  criminal conduct of the defendant which\r\n\nwas within any  scheme, conspiracy, or  pattern of activity  that\r\n\nwas an element of any offense of conviction.  See Kones,  77 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 70 (discussing causation requirement).     \r\n\n          Although Hensley acknowledges the  expansiveness of the\r\n\n1990 amendments,  he contends  that the  fraudulent order  placed\r\n\nwith Creative Computers  was not within the  same scheme embraced\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nby the  offense to which he pled guilty.   We approach this claim\r\n\nby examining the terms of  the indictment and the plea agreement.\r\n\nHenoud, 81 F.3d at  488.

Thus, in determining whether particular criminal conduct\r\n\ncomprised  part of a  unitary scheme  to defraud,  the sentencing\r\n\ncourt  should consider the totality of the circumstances, includ-\r\n\ning the  nature of the  scheme, the identity of  its participants\r\n\nand  victims, and  any commonality  in  timing, goals,  and modus\r\n\noperandi.

The  undisputed  evidence plainly\r\n\nsupported  the district court  finding that Hensley  launched the\r\n\nunitary scheme with  the Creative Computers purchase,  by renting\r\n\nthe two drop boxes at MBE locations  in Boston within two days of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3We reject the assertion by Hensley that this interpretation\r\npermits restitution for  \"any loss caused by  defendant's fraudu-\r\nlent conduct, no  matter how unrelated to the  specific scheme at\r\nissue.\"   The district court  finding that the  counterfeit money\r\norders Hensley used to \"pay\" a credit card bill and a  car rental\r\nbill  were not  part  of  the scheme  underlying  the offense  of\r\nconviction  illustrates  the  limits upon  a  sentencing  court's\r\nauthority  to order restitution  under the 1990  VWPA amendments.\r\nMoreover, the criteria we endorse for determining whether various\r\nconduct comprised a single scheme  serves as a guide to both  the\r\ninitial restitutionary sentencing  decision and appellate review,\r\nand, in keeping  with the amendatory statute, allows the sentenc-\r\ning  court  substantial,  though  not  unbridled,  discretion  to\r\nreimburse crime victims. \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\none another,  placing all  the fraudulent  orders for  goods with\r\n\ncomputer-products suppliers  (similar victims)  within less  than\r\n\ntwo weeks, using  interstate wires in each instance, and \"paying\"\r\n\nfor  the goods with  counterfeit instruments.

(\"MBE\"), 510 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.  On April 14, he telephoned companies in California, New York, Texas, and New Jersey, and using the name \"Halford,\" placed orders for computer equipment in behalf of a fictitious company, American Telemark, purportedly a division of AT &amp; T, for delivery to the MBE address in Boston.  Hensley remitted five forged checks via Federal Express, in amounts ranging from $20,000 to $31,000 and bearing the AT &amp; T logo.  Once the computer equipment arrived, Hensley used the alias \"William Noonan\" to rent storage space and a U-Haul truck to transport the equipment.  On his next visit to the MBE, Hensley was arrested by the FBI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Hensley pled guilty and before sentencing, the government learned that he had committed additional fraudulent acts during the same time period.  According to the undisputed facts set forth in the presentence report (\"PSR\"), see United States v. Benjamin, 30 F.3d 196, 197 (1st Cir.1994) (failing to object bars appellate challenge to facts stated in PSR), on March 30, 1995, Hensley had used the \"William Noonan\" alias to rent a second box at another MBE location, on Newbury Street in Boston.  On April 3, \"Noonan\" placed an $837.86 telephone order for computer software with Creative Computers, a California company, for delivery to the Newbury Street MBE.  He tendered a counterfeit money order drawn on a Boston Check Cashiers (\"BCC\") company account, which was dishonored after he absconded with the Creative Computers software.  Hensley issued three more counterfeit BCC money orders in payment for another computer order placed with ATS Technologies (\"ATS\"), a credit card bill, and a car rental.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the charged conduct resulted in no actual losses because the equipment was recovered, the PSR recommended that Hensley reimburse the car rental company ($500.00), the credit card company ($725.00), Creative Computers ($837.86), and ATS ($1,026.12), each of which had accepted a counterfeit BCC money order.  Hensley objected that the four companies were not victims of the offense of conviction as the indictment did not charge him with passing the counterfeit money orders.  Following briefing and oral argument, the district court found that ATS had sustained no loss, and that neither the credit card bill nor the car rental came within the scope of the offense of conviction.  The court nonetheless ruled that the Creative Computers acquisition was within the alleged scheme to defraud.  The court accordingly directed Hensley to make restitution to Creative Computers, and Hensley appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts possess no inherent authority to order restitution, and may do so only as explicitly empowered by statute.  United States v. Gilberg, 75 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir.1996).  The VWPA authorizes restitutionary sentences by the district courts for the benefit of victims of federal offenses.  As Hensley's criminal conduct and conviction occurred after November 29, 1990, the effective date of the Crime Control Act of 1990, the 1990 VWPA amendments govern our decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VWPA provides that \"[t]he court ... may order ... restitution to any victim of such offense.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Prior to the 1990 amendments, the VWPA had been interpreted by the Supreme Court as limiting restitution to the \"loss caused by the specific conduct that [was] the basis of the offense of conviction.\"  Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 413, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 1981, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990) (emphasis added).  The Hughey Court therefore reversed a restitutionary sentence which had been based on the total loss attributable to all counts in an indictment charging unauthorized use of credit cards and theft by a Postal Service employee, rather than on the loss attributable to the one count to which Hughey had pled guilty.  Id. at 422, 110 S.Ct. at 1985-86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Hughey, this court held that the specific conduct underlying a mail fraud conviction, which requires proof of a broader scheme to defraud, includes only the particular mailing charged and not the entire mail fraud scheme.  United States v. Cronin, 990 F.2d 663, 666 (1st Cir.1993);  accord United States v. Newman, 49 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1995) (wire fraud).  Thus, we adopted the more narrow and lenient majority view during the interim preceding the 1990 amendments to the VWPA.  Cronin, 990 F.2d at 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present controversy requires us to reexamine Cronin in light of the 1990 amendments.  Consistent with the minority view we rejected in Cronin, in 1990 Congress amended the VWPA to provide that \"a victim of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, a conspiracy, or a pattern of criminal activity means any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(2) (emphasis added).  As Hensley concedes that a scheme to defraud is an element of the mail and wire fraud offenses to which he pled guilty, see United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 723 (1st Cir.1996), the district court correctly applied VWPA &#167; 3663(a)(2) in this case.  Compare United States v. Reed, 80 F.3d 1419, 1423 (9th Cir.1996) (\"felon in possession\" offense does not require proof of scheme).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under current VWPA &#167; 3663(a)(2), the district court may order restitution to every victim directly harmed by the defendant's conduct \"in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity\" that is an element of the offense of conviction, without regard to whether the particular criminal conduct of the defendant which directly harmed the victim was alleged in a count to which the defendant pled guilty, or was even charged in the indictment.  United States v. Henoud, 81 F.3d 484, 488 (4th Cir.1996) (unnamed victim);  United States v. Kones, 77 F.3d 66, 70 (3d Cir.1996) (providing example);  United States v. Pepper, 51 F.3d 469, 473 (5th Cir.1995).  Thus, the outer limits of a VWPA &#167; 3663(a)(2) restitution order encompass all direct harm from the criminal conduct of the defendant which was within any scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of activity that was an element of any offense of conviction.  See Kones, 77 F.3d at 70 (discussing causation requirement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Hensley acknowledges the expansiveness of the 1990 amendments, he contends that the fraudulent order placed with Creative Computers was not within the same scheme embraced by the offense to which he pled guilty.  We approach this claim by examining the terms of the indictment and the plea agreement.  Henoud, 81 F.3d at 488.   For the most part, courts require that the indictment \"specifically\" define the scheme in order to ensure that the restitutionary amount not exceed the harm directly caused the victim of the scheme embraced by the offense of conviction, id.;   see also United States v. Bennett, 943 F.2d 738, 741 (7th Cir.1991) (noting amorphous nature of \"scheme\" concept), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 987, 112 S.Ct. 2970, 119 L.Ed.2d 590 (1992).  Nevertheless, the courts of appeals consistently have upheld restitutionary sentences based simply on evidence sufficient to enable the sentencing court to demarcate the scheme, including its \"mechanics ... [,] the location of the operation, the duration of the criminal activity, [and] the methods used\" to effect it.  Henoud, 81 F.3d at 489-90 n. 11;  Pepper, 51 F.3d at 473;  United States v.

We think the 1990 amendments to the VWPA and the relevant caselaw, see, e.g., Turino, 978 F.2d at 318-19 (discussing Seventh Circuit cases), preclude so narrow a definition of the \"scheme\" element, which amounts to an attempt to revive the Hughey holding discarded by Congress in the 1990 VWPA amendments.

Thus, in determining whether particular criminal conduct comprised part of a unitary scheme to defraud, the sentencing court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the scheme, the identity of its participants and victims, and any commonality in timing, goals, and modus operandi.

This abundance of proof on the commonality of the victims, timing, and modus operandi utterly precludes a finding of clear error.

(\"MBE\"), 510 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.  On April 14, he telephoned companies in California, New York, Texas, and New Jersey, and using the name \"Halford,\" placed orders for computer equipment in behalf of a fictitious company, American Telemark, purportedly a division of AT &amp; T, for delivery to the MBE address in Boston.  Hensley remitted five forged checks via Federal Express, in amounts ranging from $20,000 to $31,000 and bearing the AT &amp; T logo.  Once the computer equipment arrived, Hensley used the alias \"William Noonan\" to rent storage space and a U-Haul truck to transport the equipment.  On his next visit to the MBE, Hensley was arrested by the FBI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Hensley pled guilty and before sentencing, the government learned that he had committed additional fraudulent acts during the same time period.  According to the undisputed facts set forth in the presentence report (\"PSR\"), see United States v. Benjamin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195479\"><a href=\"/opinion/195479/united-states-v-benjamin/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 197 (1st Cir.1994) (failing to object bars appellate challenge to facts stated in PSR), on March 30, 1995, Hensley had used the \"William Noonan\" alias to rent a second box at another MBE location, on Newbury Street in Boston.  On April 3, \"Noonan\" placed an $837.86 telephone order for computer software with Creative Computers, a California company, for delivery to the Newbury Street MBE.  He tendered a counterfeit money order drawn on a Boston Check Cashiers (\"BCC\") company account, which was dishonored after he absconded with the Creative Computers software.  Hensley issued three more counterfeit BCC money orders in payment for another computer order placed with ATS Technologies (\"ATS\"), a credit card bill, and a car rental.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the charged conduct resulted in no actual losses because the equipment was recovered, the PSR recommended that Hensley reimburse the car rental company ($500.00), the credit card company ($725.00), Creative Computers ($837.86), and ATS ($1,026.12), each of which had accepted a counterfeit BCC money order.  Hensley objected that the four companies were not victims of the offense of conviction as the indictment did not charge him with passing the counterfeit money orders.  Following briefing and oral argument, the district court found that ATS had sustained no loss, and that neither the credit card bill nor the car rental came within the scope of the offense of conviction.  The court nonetheless ruled that the Creative Computers acquisition was within the alleged scheme to defraud.  The court accordingly directed Hensley to make restitution to Creative Computers, and Hensley appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts possess no inherent authority to order restitution, and may do so only as explicitly empowered by statute.  United States v. Gilberg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196544\"><a href=\"/opinion/196544/united-states-v-gilberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1996).  The VWPA authorizes restitutionary sentences by the district courts for the benefit of victims of federal offenses.  As Hensley's criminal conduct and conviction occurred after November 29, 1990, the effective date of the Crime Control Act of 1990, the 1990 VWPA amendments govern our decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The VWPA provides that \"[t]he court ... may order ... restitution to any victim of such offense.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Prior to the 1990 amendments, the VWPA had been interpreted by the Supreme Court as limiting restitution to the \"loss caused by the specific conduct that [was] the basis of the offense of conviction.\"  Hughey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112428\"><a href=\"/opinion/112428/hughey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 413, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112428\"><a href=\"/opinion/112428/hughey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span> (1990) (emphasis added).  The Hughey Court therefore reversed a restitutionary sentence which had been based on the total loss attributable to all counts in an indictment charging unauthorized use of credit cards and theft by a Postal Service employee, rather than on the loss attributable to the one count to which Hughey had pled guilty.  Id. at 422, 110 S.Ct. at 1985-86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Hughey, this court held that the specific conduct underlying a mail fraud conviction, which requires proof of a broader scheme to defraud, includes only the particular mailing charged and not the entire mail fraud scheme.  United States v. Cronin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604121\"><a href=\"/opinion/604121/united-states-v-john-m-cronin-united-states-of-america-v-robert-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span>, 666 (1st Cir.1993);  accord United States v.

Thus, we adopted the more narrow and lenient majority view during the interim preceding the 1990 amendments to the VWPA.  Cronin, 990 F.2d at 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present controversy requires us to reexamine Cronin in light of the 1990 amendments.  Consistent with the minority view we rejected in Cronin, in 1990 Congress amended the VWPA to provide that \"a victim of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, a conspiracy, or a pattern of criminal activity means any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(2) (emphasis added).  As Hensley concedes that a scheme to defraud is an element of the mail and wire fraud offenses to which he pled guilty, see United States v. Sawyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196785\"><a href=\"/opinion/196785/united-states-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 723 (1st Cir.1996), the district court correctly applied VWPA &#167; 3663(a)(2) in this case.  Compare United States v. Reed, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715841\"><a href=\"/opinion/715841/96-cal-daily-op-serv-2539-96-daily-journal-dar-4192-96-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1419</span></a></span>, 1423 (9th Cir.1996) (\"felon in possession\" offense does not require proof of scheme).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under current VWPA &#167; 3663(a)(2), the district court may order restitution to every victim directly harmed by the defendant's conduct \"in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity\" that is an element of the offense of conviction, without regard to whether the particular criminal conduct of the defendant which directly harmed the victim was alleged in a count to which the defendant pled guilty, or was even charged in the indictment.

Thus, the outer limits of a VWPA &#167; 3663(a)(2) restitution order encompass all direct harm from the criminal conduct of the defendant which was within any scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of activity that was an element of any offense of conviction.  See Kones, 77 F.3d at 70 (discussing causation requirement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Hensley acknowledges the expansiveness of the 1990 amendments, he contends that the fraudulent order placed with Creative Computers was not within the same scheme embraced by the offense to which he pled guilty.  We approach this claim by examining the terms of the indictment and the plea agreement.  Henoud, 81 F.3d at 488.   For the most part, courts require that the indictment \"specifically\" define the scheme in order to ensure that the restitutionary amount not exceed the harm directly caused the victim of the scheme embraced by the offense of conviction, id.;   see also United States v. Bennett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567677\"><a href=\"/opinion/567677/united-states-v-gary-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 741 (7th Cir.1991) (noting amorphous nature of \"scheme\" concept), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nevertheless, the courts of appeals consistently have upheld restitutionary sentences based simply on evidence sufficient to enable the sentencing court to demarcate the scheme, including its \"mechanics ... [,] the location of the operation, the duration of the criminal activity, [and] the methods used\" to effect it.  Henoud, 81 F.3d at 489-90 n. 11;  Pepper, 51 F.3d at 473;  United States v.

We think the 1990 amendments to the VWPA and the relevant caselaw, see, e.g., Turino, 978 F.2d at 318-19 (discussing Seventh Circuit cases), preclude so narrow a definition of the \"scheme\" element, which amounts to an attempt to revive the Hughey holding discarded by Congress in the 1990 VWPA amendments.

Thus, the indictment adequately detailed the offense of conviction, as well as the underlying scheme to defraud, so as to enable the district court reliably to fashion a restitutionary sentence which fairly reimbursed any victim directly harmed by Hensley's criminal conduct during the course of the scheme involved in the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback position, Hensley claims that the Creative Computers software purchase was not part of the scheme underlying the offense of conviction, even under the broad definition we now adopt.

The undisputed evidence plainly supported the district court finding that Hensley launched the unitary scheme with the Creative Computers purchase, by renting the two drop boxes at MBE locations in Boston within two days of one another, placing all the fraudulent orders for goods with computer-products suppliers (similar victims) within less than two weeks, using interstate wires in each instance, and \"paying\" for the goods with counterfeit instruments.  This abundance of proof on the commonality of the victims, timing, and modus operandi utterly precludes a finding of clear error.  See Savoie, 985 F.2d at 617.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly concluded that Creative Computers was a victim of the offense of conviction for purposes of the restitution statute, its $837.86 restitutionary sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The charges included mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (1994);  wire fraud, id. &#167; 1343;  making or possessing counterfeit securities, id. &#167; 513;  interstate transportation of counterfeit securities, id. &#167; 2314;  and receipt of stolen goods transported in interstate commerce, id. &#167; 2315</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Gilberg, 75 F.3d at 20-22.   Moreover, the Sentencing Guidelines do not purport to expand the sentencing court's authority to order restitution.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.1(a)(1) (1995) (incorporating the VWPA)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We reject the assertion by Hensley that this interpretation permits restitution for \"any loss caused by defendant's fraudulent conduct, no matter how unrelated to the specific scheme at issue.\"   The district court finding that the counterfeit money orders Hensley used to \"pay\" a credit card bill and a car rental bill were not part of the scheme underlying the offense of conviction illustrates the limits upon a sentencing court's authority to order restitution under the 1990 VWPA amendments.  Moreover, the criteria we endorse for determining whether various conduct comprised a single scheme serves as a guide to both the initial restitutionary sentencing decision and appellate review, and, in keeping with the amendatory statute, allows the sentencing court substantial, though not unbridled, discretion to reimburse crime victims</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
