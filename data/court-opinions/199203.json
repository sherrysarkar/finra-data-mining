The controversy in this appeal\n\narises out of the not-so-infrequent scenario where, after the\n\nconfirmation of a bankruptcy plan under Chapter 13, but before the\n\ncase is closed or converted to Chapter 7, the debtors sell property\n\nof the estate which “vested” in them “free and clear of any claim or\n\ninterest of any creditor” pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. §\n\n1327.1   The distribution of the proceeds from the sale of such\n\nproperty is usually controversial; especially when, as here, the\n\nproperty sold has considerably appreciated in value and as a\n\nconsequence, the debtors received substantial profits which they\n\nintend to keep to themselves.2    On the other hand, the debtors’\n\nunsecured creditors and the Chapter 13 Trustee moved to compel the\n\n\n\n     1   11 U.S.C. § 1327 provides, in relevant part:\n\n     (a) The provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each\ncreditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by\nthe plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, has\naccepted, or has rejected the plan.\n     (b) Except as otherwise provided in the plan or the order\nconfirming the plan, the confirmation of a plan vests all of the\nproperty of the estate in the debtor.\n     (c) Except as otherwise provided in the plan or in the order\nconfirming the plan, the property vesting in the debtor under\nsubsection (b) of this section is free and clear of any claim or\ninterest of any creditor provided for by the plan. (Emphasis added).\n     2 After payment in full of all secured bankruptcy claims, plus\ninterest, and all closing costs, taxes, insurance premiums and other\namounts, there remains $50,668.35 in excess proceeds.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdebtors to amend their bankruptcy plan in order to distribute the\n\nproceeds from the sale to the unsecured creditors.\n\n                         I.   BACKGROUND\n\n         The property sold in this particular case consists of a\n\ntwo-family building retained by the debtors for investment purposes\n\n(“the Property”), which was subject to a lien in the amount of\n\n$114,000 held by Mellon Mortgage Company (“Mellon”).     On May 5, 1997,\n\nMellon entered into a stipulation with the Debtors, Marcelino and\n\nMariana Barbosa (“the Debtors”), whereby they agreed that the market\n\nvalue of the Property was $64,000 (“the Stipulation”).     Therefore,\n\nMellon’s secured claim was “stripped down” by $50,000, from $114,000\n\nto $64,000.   The Stipulation also provided for payment in full of the\n\nstripped-down secured claim plus interest.    The balance, now\n\nunsecured, would be repaid “at a rate of not less than 10%.”     As a\n\nguarantee, Mellon “retain[ed] its lien in full until successful\n\ncompletion of the repayment plan.”\n\n         On July 17, 1998, the Debtors filed their repayment plan,\n\nin consonance with the terms of the Stipulation.     It was confirmed by\n\nthe bankruptcy court on September 23, 1998.    The Plan provided, among\n\nother things, the following: (1) full payment of Mellon’s stipulated\n\nsecured claim plus interest at a 9% annual interest rate; (2)\n\nprepayment of Mellon’s stipulated secured claim at any time, without\n\npremium or penalty; (3) payment of a dividend to unsecured creditors\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fequal to 10% of the amount of their claims; and (4) reduction of the\n\nmonthly plan payment, in the event that Mellon’s secured claim was\n\nprepaid.\n\n           The bankruptcy court’s Confirmation Order approved the\n\nDebtors’ Plan and summarized the disbursements to be made under it.\n\nIn addition, it acknowledged the modification of Mellon’s secured\n\nclaim as explained above.   Regarding the unsecured claims, it stated\n\nthat they “shall be paid [at] a dividend of not less than 10%.”\n\nFinally, in compliance with 11 U.S.C. § 1327, the Confirmation Order\n\nprovided that: “[T]he provisions of the confirmed Plan bind the\n\ndebtors and all creditors; the confirmation of the Plan vests all\n\nproperty of the estate in the debtors; and all property vesting in\n\nthe debtors is free and clear of any claim or interest of any\n\ncreditor, except as provided in the Plan or this order.” (Emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n           After the entry of the Confirmation Order, the Debtors\n\nsought leave from the bankruptcy court to sell the Property free of\n\nliens or encumbrances pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 1303 and 363.    Leave\n\nwas obtained and accordingly, the property was sold for $137,500 to a\n\ngood faith purchaser.   The bankruptcy court’s order approving the\n\nsale (the “Sale Order”) provided for payment in full of Mellon’s\n\nsecured claim pursuant to the Plan and the Confirmation Order; while\n\nthe balance of the proceeds were to be held in escrow by the Debtors’\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fcounsel “until the earlier of (a) an agreement by and between the\n\nDebtors and ... the Chapter 13 Trustee ... regarding disbursement of\n\nsuch proceeds, and (b) disposition by the Court, by a final order,\n\nadjudicating a motion filed by the Chapter 13 Trustee seeking an\n\namendment to the Plan....”\n\n           The Debtors and the Chapter 13 Trustee were unable to\n\nreach an agreement for the distribution of the proceeds.    Therefore,\n\nthe Trustee moved to compel the Debtors to modify their Plan in order\n\nto pay the excess of the proceeds to the Debtors’ unsecured\n\ncreditors.3    The end result under the Trustee’s proposed plan would\n\nbe that the dividend paid to unsecured creditors would increase from\n\n10% to 100%.\n\n           The Debtors opposed the Trustee’s motion.   On July 30,\n\n1999, after a hearing, the bankruptcy court entered a Modification\n\nOrder granting the Trustee’s motion and holding that the Debtors were\n\ncompelled to amend their Plan in order to distribute the proceeds to\n\nthe unsecured creditors. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. 540 (Bankr.D.Mass.\n\n1999).    The court reasoned that since the Debtors’ bankruptcy plan\n\ndid not provide for prepayment of the unsecured claims, the Debtors,\n\nthrough their Sale Motion, were “implicitly seek[ing] to modify their\n\nplan to reduce the time for satisfying the claims of unsecured\n\n\n\n    3     Mellon joined the Trustee’s efforts by filing a separate\nmotion.\n\n                                -5-\n\fcreditors.” Id. at 545.4      Accordingly, the court rejected Debtors’\n\nimplied amendments to reduce the time of payment to the unsecured\n\ncreditors and satisfy their claims by paying the 10% dividend,\n\nwithout any regard to the change in circumstances. Id. at 548-49,\n\n556.       In addition, the bankruptcy court found that the Debtors’\n\nintention to keep the proceeds of the sale, while paying the 10%\n\ndividend provided by the Plan to the unsecured creditors, failed to\n\nmeet both the good faith requirement and the best-interests-of-the-\n\ncreditors test of 11 U.S.C. §§ 13295 and 1325(a)6 in order to modify\n\n\n       4The court also ruled that pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1329, the\nTrustee had standing to seek modification of the plan, and that\n“[e]ven if this Court were to conclude that the Chapter 13 Trustee\nmust show a substantial change in circumstances, the Court observes\nthat the Chapter 13 Trustee could satisfy that standard [given that]\n[a]lthough the Debtors contemplated the sale of their Property in\ntheir Chapter 13 plan, the sales price was more than double the\nstipulated value of Mellon’s secured claim.” In re Barbosa, 236 B.R.\nat 547 n. 8.\n       5\n\n     Section 1329(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides for the\nmodification of a confirmed Chapter 13 plan upon request of the debtor,\nthe trustee, or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim, for the\nfollowing limited modifications:\n\n       (1) increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of\n       a particular class provided for by the plan;\n       (2) extend or reduce the time for such payments; or\n       (3) alter the amount of the distribution to a creditor whose\n       claim is provided for by the plan to the extent necessary to\n       take account of any payment of such claim other than under\n       the plan.\n\n11 U.S.C. § 1329(a).\n\n                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                   -6-\n\fa confirmed plan, given the substantial and unanticipated change in\n\nthe Debtors’ financial circumstances. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 552-\n\n56.\n\n          Further, the bankruptcy court noted that although pursuant\n\nto 11 U.S.C. § 1327(b), the Property sold vested in the Debtors free\n\nand clear of any claim from the creditors (accord In re Rangel, 233\n\nB.R. 191 (Bankr.D.Mass. 1999)), the result in this case by allocating\n\nthe appreciation of property, which the court characterized as\n\nwindfall profits, to the Debtors rather than to the unsecured\n\ncreditors “is antithetical to the results that would be achieved in\n\nthe absence of a confirmed plan that vested the Property in the\n\nDebtors.” In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 551.       The court continued:\n\n          Moreover, there is something unsavory about\n          Chapter 13 Debtors ‘stripping down’ a mortgage\n          under § 506(a) and (d) and receiving the\n          ‘super’ discharge provided by § 1328(a) while\n          walking away with substantial cash proceeds due\n          to the appreciation in value of their Property,\n\n\n      5\n      (...continued)\n     Section 1329(b) of the Code provides in turn, that a proposed plan\nmodification must meet the requirements of sections 1322(a), 1322(b),\n1323(c) and 1325(a) of the Code.\n      6\n\n     Section 1325(a) provides in the pertinent part that a\nbankruptcy plan may only be confirmed if “[it] has been proposed in\ngood faith and not by any means forbidden by law.” 11 U.S.C. §\n1325(a)(3). While “the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of\nproperty to be distributed under [it] on account of each allowed\nunsecured claim” must be “not less than the amount that would be paid\non such claim if the estate of the debtor were liquidated under chapter\n7 of [the Code] on such date.” 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(4).\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          without amending their plan to satisfy the\n          claims of their unsecured creditors... Putting\n          aside the various inconsistent Code sections,\n          the problems created by the vesting language in\n          § 1327(b) and the order of confirmation used in\n          this case, and hairsplitting arguments about\n          what constitutes property of the estate in\n          Chapter 13, the spectacle of the Debtors\n          profiting while in bankruptcy is disconcerting\n          and may be indicative of a bad faith\n          manipulation of the Code.\n\n\nId. at 551-52.     Accordingly, the bankruptcy court held that the\n\nDebtors were required to amend their plan as requested by the Trustee\n\nto provide for full compensation to the unsecured creditors. Id. at\n\n556.\n\n          On appeal, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy\n\ncourt’s decision and order. Barbosa v. Solomon, 243 B.R. 562 (D.\n\nMass. 2000).     However, it used a different rationale.   It found that\n\nthe central issue was the meaning of the phrase “property of the\n\nestate” as used in the various sections of the Bankruptcy Code. Id.\n\nat 565.   It then noted that a reading of the bankruptcy court’s\n\nmemorandum opinion might give the impression that the Trustee “admits\n\nthat ... [proceeds of the foreclosure sale are] no longer property of\n\nthe estate....” Id.     However, in the district court’s opinion, “if\n\nth[at] is what the bankruptcy court’s Memorandum means, it is an\n\nerror of law.” Id.     Rather, the district court’s interpretation of\n\nthe concept “property of the estate” as used by section 1327 of the\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fCode, vested title to the realty in the Debtors at confirmation, but\n\nnot the proceeds of the sale. Id. at 567-68.     The district court\n\nconcurred with the bankruptcy court in all other aspects and\n\ntherefore, it affirmed the judgment below.\n\n          The Debtors appealed from that decision and raise various\n\nissues.   In particular, they contend that the district court erred in\n\nruling that the proceeds were part of the bankruptcy estate, based on\n\n11 U.S.C. §§ 1327 and 541(a)(6).     They rely on the vesting language\n\nof section 1327 of the Code and the Confirmation Order for the\n\nproposition that Mellon forfeited any claim to the excess proceeds\n\nfrom the property when it entered into the Stipulation, and that such\n\nforfeiture became effective when the Confirmation Order was entered.\n\n          Second, Debtors argue that the bankruptcy and district\n\ncourts erred by improperly applying 11 U.S.C. § 1329 by finding that\n\nthey had implicitly sought a modification of the Plan through the\n\nmotion for confirmation of sale.\n\n                II.   ANALYSIS OF APPLICABLE LAW\n\n          Since this case presents primarily questions of law, this\n\nCourt’s review of the bankruptcy and district court’s decisions is de\n\nnovo. In re Savage Industries, Inc., 43 F.3d 714, 719 n. 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1994); In re DN Associates, 3 F.3d 512, 515 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nHowever, any findings of fact by the lower courts are reviewed on a\n\nclearly erroneous standard. In re Savage Indus., 43 F.3d at 720.\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f      A.   The Confirmed Plan in a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case.\n\n           Section 1327(b) of the Bankruptcy Code states that “the\n\nconfirmation of a plan vests all property of the estate in the\n\ndebtor.” 11 U.S.C. § 1327(b).    In addition, section 1327(c) adds that\n\nsuch vesting “is free and clear of any claim or interest of any\n\ncreditor provided for by the plan.” Id.    The language used by the\n\nbankruptcy court in its Confirmation Order was in consonance with\n\nthese Code provisions.\n\n           The Debtors argue that in defining the concept “property\n\nof the estate” the district court ignored various sections of the\n\nBankruptcy Code; particularly section 541(a)(6) which establishes\n\nthat the concept “property of the estate” includes proceeds “of or\n\nfrom property of the estate.” 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(6).    Therefore, the\n\nDebtors argue that section 1327 of the Code, combined with section\n\n541, vested in them the Property along with its proceeds “free and\n\nclear of any claim or interest of any creditor.” 11 U.S.C. § 1327(c).\n\n\n\n           However, in direct contraposition with the Debtors’\n\nintended interpretation is section 1306(a) of the Bankruptcy Code,\n\nwhich defines the concept “property of the estate” within a Chapter\n\n13 bankruptcy thus:\n\n           Property of the estate includes, in addition to\n           the property specified in section 541 of this\n           title:\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f             (1) all property of the kind specified in\n          such section that the debtor acquires after the\n          commencement of the case but before the case is\n          closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under\n          chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title, whichever\n          occurs first; and\n             (2) earnings from services performed by the\n          debtor after the commencement of the case but\n          before the case is closed, dismissed, or\n          converted to a case under chapter 7, 11, or 12\n          of this title, whichever occurs first.\n11 U.S.C. § 1306(a). While this section does extend the application\n\nof section 541 to cases filed under Chapter 13, it does so within a\n\nspecific context.   In particular, the status of the property of the\n\nestate after the confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan is a controversial\n\nissue in itself. See Russell G. Donaldson, Continued Existence of\n\nBankruptcy Code Chapter 13 Estate After Confirmation of the Chapter\n\n13 Plan, 126 ALR Fed. 665 (1995)(Supp. 1999); David B. Wheeler, Whose\n\nProperty Is It Anyway? 18-NOV Am. Bankr. Inst. J. 14 (1999)(brief\n\nreview and analysis of the four different approaches currently used\n\nby the bankruptcy courts to harmonize §§ 1327 and 1306 of the\n\nBankruptcy Code); Thomas E. Ray, Post-Petition Claims and the\n\nAutomatic Stay in Chapter 13, 19-FEB Am. Bankr. Inst. J. 12\n\n(2000)(reference to the same variety of interpretations given by the\n\nbankruptcy courts to §§ 1327 and 1306 of the Code); Vickie L. Vaska,\n\nCommentary: Property of the Estate After Confirmation of a Chapter 13\n\nRepayment Plan: Balancing Competing Interests, 65 Wash. L. Rev. 677\n\n(July 1990); see also In re Reynard, 250 B.R. 241, 246-47\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f(Bankr.E.D.Va. 2000); In re Holden, 236 B.R. 156, 160-63 (Bankr.D.Vt.\n\n1999); In re Rangel, 233 B.R. at 198.\n\n          By stating that the bankruptcy estate continues to be\n\nreplenished by post-petition property until the case is closed,\n\ndismissed, or converted under chapter 7, 11 or 12 of the Bankruptcy\n\nCode, section 1306(a) is actually providing for the continued\n\nexistence of the bankruptcy estate until the earliest of any of the\n\nabove-mentioned events occur.    The meaning of the “vesting” language\n\nof section 1327(b) within this context has been explored far and wide\n\nthroughout the nation.   In fact, the bankruptcy court noted that\n\nsections 1306(a) and 1327(b) of the Code “are difficult to reconcile”\n\nin this regard. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 545, quoting In re Rangel,\n\n233 B.R. at 193.\n\n         Some courts have interpreted section 1306(a) as actually\n\nproviding for the continuation of the bankruptcy estate until the\n\nearliest of any of the above-mentioned events. See Security Bank of\n\nMarshall Town v. Neiman, 1 F.3d 687 (8th Cir. 1993).   Still others\n\nhave held that the confirmation order terminates the estate\n\naltogether, re-vesting all property of the estate in the debtor. In\n\nre Olivier, 193 B.R. 992 (Bankr.N.D.Ga. 1996); In re Petruccelli, 113\n\nB.R. 5 (Bankr.S.D.Cal. 1990).    A third approach, called “the-middle-\n\nof-the-road approach”, stands for the proposition that the estate\n\ncontinues to exist only with regard to property used to fund the\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fplan. In re Leavell, 190 B.R. 156 (Bankr.E.D.Va. 1995); In re\n\nZiegler, 136 B.R. 191 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1992).    All of these positions\n\nhave been criticized; the first two for overly emphasizing either\n\nsection 1306 or 1327, rendering the opposing section meaningless,\n\nWheeler, supra at 14, while the third approach is criticized for\n\ninvolving a subjective analysis not contemplated, or provided for, by\n\nthe Code. Id.; see also Donaldson, supra, 126 ALR Fed. 665 §§ 2-5.\n\n         However, a fourth line of cases has held that by virtue of\n\nsections 1327(b)-(c), property of the estate at the time of\n\nconfirmation vests in the debtors free of any claims from the\n\ncreditors.   The estate does not cease to exist however, and it\n\ncontinues to be funded by the Debtors’ regular income and post-\n\npetition assets as specified in section 1306(a). In re Reynard, 250\n\nB.R. at 247; In re Trumbas, 245 B.R. 764, 766 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2000);\n\nIn re Holden, 236 B.R. at 162-63; In re Rangel, 233 B.R. at 198.\n\n         Many commentators consider this approach to be the best,\n\nsince it gives meaning to both sections 1306 and 1327, without the\n\nsubjective analysis required by the middle-of-the-road approach. E.g.\n\nWheeler, supra.   It was also the approach followed by the bankruptcy\n\ncourt in this case.   Because we think that this approach has a\n\nlogical consistency that harmonizes two apparent inconsistent\n\nsections, we hereby adopt it.    However, we note that this rule cannot\n\nbe applied in an inflexible manner, for in spite of the “vesting”\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fprovided by section 1327 of the Code, until all payments due under\n\nthe plan are made, both the trustee and the unsecured creditors have\n\nan interest in the preservation of the debtor’s financial situation,\n\nand in the extension of the ability-to-pay standard to future\n\nsituations under the plan.     In this particular case, “receiving\n\nproceeds has also altered the debtor’s financial circumstances”,\n\nwhich brings into play § 1329 of the Code. In re Suratt, 1996 WL\n\n914095, *1 (D.Or. 1996).7\n\n        B.   Modification of a Confirmed Chapter 13 Plan.\n\n             Section 1329 of the Code provides that a confirmed plan\n\nmay be modified at the request of the debtor, the trustee, or the\n\nholder of an allowed unsecured claim in order to “increase or reduce\n\n\n\n    7  In In re Suratt, 1996 WL 914095 at *1, the bankruptcy court\nrejected debtor’s argument that by “vesting” the property on him upon\nconfirmation, § 1327 operated to exclude the trustee and the\nunsecured creditors from partaking in the post-confirmation sale\nproceeds of former estate property. The court noted that:\n\n    The logical extension of the debtor’s argument is ... that\n    there must be a provision in all Chapter 13 plans\n    requiring post-confirmation sale proceeds from property\n    originally part of the estate to be paid to creditors, in\n    order to preclude the debtor from receiving those funds.\n    There is no such requirement in the Bankruptcy Code, nor\n    has any court imposed such a requirement. 11 U.S.C. §\n    1329(a) is intended, in part, to provide the protection\n    the debtor claims is missing. Its purpose is to protect\n    creditors’ rights to a debtor’s increased income,\n    including from proceeds from the sale of property that has\n    appreciated in value, post-confirmation.\n\nId. at *3.\n\n                                -14-\n\fthe amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for\n\nby the plan; [or to] extend or reduce the time for such payments...”\n\n11 U.S.C. § 1329(a)(1,2).     Any such post-confirmation modifications\n\nshall comply with sections 1322(a)-(b)8, 1323(c)9, and 1325(a)10 of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code.\n\n11 U.S.C. § 1329(b)(1).\n\n          The Debtors argue that both the bankruptcy court and the\n\ndistrict court erred in applying section 1329 of the Code to allow a\n\nmodification of the confirmed plan at the request of the Trustee and\n\nMellon without their showing a substantial and unanticipated change\n\n\n\n     8\n\n     Section 1322(a) of the Code establishes the requirements that must\nbe met by a bankruptcy repayment plan in order to be approved by the\ncourt. Section 1322(b) on the other hand, enumerates all permissible\nprovisions which can be included in a bankruptcy repayment plan. 11\nU.S.C. § 1322(a)-(b).\n     9\n\n     Section 1323(c) provides that: “Any holder of a secured claim that\nhas accepted or rejected the plan is deemed to have accepted or\nrejected, as the case may be, the plan as modified, unless the\nmodification provides for a change in the rights of such holder from\nwhat such rights were under the plan before modification, and such\nholder changes such holder’s previous acceptance or rejection.” 11\nU.S.C. § 1323(c).\n     10\n\n     Section 1325(a) of the Code provides, in the pertinent part, that\nthe courts “shall confirm a plan if” (1) it complies with all\napplicable provisions of the Code; (2) it “has been proposed in good\nfaith and not by any means forbidden by law”; (3) the value of property\nto be distributed under the plan on account of all allowed unsecured\nclaims is not less than what would be paid under a chapter 7\nliquidation; and (4) the debtor is able to comply with the plan. 11\nU.S.C. § 1325(a)(1), (3)-(4), (6).\n\n                                 -15-\n\fin the Debtors’ financial circumstances from the time of\n\nconfirmation.    They argue that the Property’s sale was contemplated\n\nby the parties at the time of entering into the Stipulation and by\n\nthe Court when it confirmed the Plan.    Therefore, they aver that the\n\nmodification requested by the Trustee and Mellon is precluded by res\n\njudicata.    For that purpose, they allege that the sale was not an\n\nunanticipated event, and that the appreciation in value of the\n\nproperty was foreseeable.    They do not dispute however, nor can they\n\ngiven the facts, that the change in the Debtors’ financial\n\ncircumstances is substantial.\n\n            From the start, we note that Debtors’ arguments are not\n\ngrounded on the specific provisions of the Code; since section 1329\n\ndoes not in itself establish a criterion for granting a modification,\n\nother than the plan as modified must comply with all applicable\n\nprovisions of the Code. 11 U.S.C. § 1329(b), incorporating by\n\nreference 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a).    This means that the Plan as modified\n\nmust be proposed in good-faith. 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(3).    Also, it\n\nmust comply with the “best-interests-of-the-creditors” test and the\n\n“ability-to-pay” standard. 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(4-6).    However, the\n\nCode says nothing about the applicability of the doctrine of res\n\njudicata or the threshold requirement of unanticipated and\n\nsubstantial change in the debtor’s financial circumstances.     These\n\nare doctrines of judicial origin. See, e.g., In re Witkowski, 16 F.3d\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f739, 746 (7th Cir. 1994)(“The clear and unambiguous language of §\n\n1329 negates any threshold change in circumstances requirement and\n\nclearly demonstrates that the doctrine of res judicata does not\n\napply.”); In re Than, 215 B.R. 430, 435 (B.A.P.9th Cir 1997)(“The\n\nunanticipated, substantial change test is judicial gloss to § 1329,\n\n... and the standard was seriously questioned by the Seventh\n\nCircuit’s 1994 Witkowski opinion.”); In re Powers, 202 B.R. 618, 622\n\n(B.A.P.9th Cir. 1996)(“[W]e decline to hold that the change must be\n\nsubstantial and unanticipated as suggested by various cases in this\n\ncircuit.   The plain language of § 1329 simply does not support a\n\nchange in circumstances as a prerequisite to modification.”); In re\n\nEuler, 251 B.R. 740, 744 (Bankr.M.D.Fla. 2000)(recognizing that\n\nsection 1329 “is silent as to whether the court should impose any\n\nconditions on a modification ... other than those provided by §\n\n1329(b).”); In re Fitak, 92 B.R. 243, 249 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1988),\n\naff’d 121 B.R. 224 (S.D.Ohio 1990)(“While the legislative history\n\nindicates that a post-confirmation modification should be ordered\n\npursuant to § 1329(a) upon a showing of changed circumstances which\n\naffect a debtor’s ability to pay, the case law suggests that the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata limits the scope of appropriate post-\n\nconfirmation modifications.”).\n\n           Some of the stated grounds for the application of the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata within the context of a modification sought\n\n\n                              -17-\n\fpursuant to § 1329, are: (1) the “awkward” application of section\n\n1329, In re Euler, 251 B.R. at 744, quoting In re Perkins, 111 B.R.\n\nat 673 (“Unfortunately... section 1329 is ‘somewhat awkward in\n\nconcept and application.”); (2) the apparent inconsistency of\n\nsections 1321 and 1329 of the Code; while the first provides that\n\nonly the debtor shall file a plan, the second provides standing to\n\nthe trustee and the unsecured creditors to seek to modify it after\n\nconfirmation, id. at 745-46; (3) the “little, if any, guidance as to\n\nthe standard to be applied by a bankruptcy court in determining\n\nwhether a request for a post-confirmation modification of a Chapter\n\n13 plan should be granted,” In re Fitak, 92 B.R. at 248; (4) the\n\nlegislative history of § 1329, In re Euler, 251 B.R. at 746; (5) the\n\ncase law, e.g. In re Fitak, 92 B.R. at 249, citing In re Moseley, 74\n\nB.R. 701, 799-800 (Bankr.C.D.Cal. 1987)11, Anaheim Savings & Loan\n\nAss’n v. Evans (In re Evans), 30 B.R. 530, 531 (B.A.P.9th Cir.\n\n1983)12; and (5) the finality accorded to the confirmed plan, In re\n\n\n     11\n\n     In re Moseley, supra, makes a distinction between motions to\nmodify a confirmed plan filed by the debtor, and motions to modify\nfiled by the trustee or the unsecured creditors. The debtor may file\nmotions to modify liberally, “on a proper showing of changed\ncircumstances”; 74 B.R. at 799; while “a creditor may move to modify a\nplan adversely to a debtor after confirmation only upon a showing of a\npost-confirmation default by the debtor, or that the circumstances have\nchanged since confirmation.” Id. As to everything else, the confirmed\nplan is res judicata. Id.\n     12\n\n                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                 -18-\n\fEuler, 251 B.R. at 746.     Of all these factors, the need to accord a\n\ndegree of finality to the confirmation order is one of the most\n\nweighty for some courts. See, e.g., Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 745, and\n\ncases cited therein.\n\n          However, while the doctrine of res judicata has been\n\napplied by some courts in this context, e.g. In re Arnold, 869 F.2d\n\n240, 243 (4th Cir. 1989)(“The doctrine of res judicata bars an\n\nincrease in the amount of monthly payments only where there have been\n\nno unanticipated, substantial changes in the debtor’s financial\n\nsituation.”); In re Suratt, 1996 WL 914095 at *2 (D.Or. 1996)(“The\n\ndoctrine of res judicata limits post confirmation modifications to\n\ncases in which the change in a debtor’s ability to pay was\n\nunanticipated at the time of confirmation.”); In re Solis, 172 B.R.\n\n530, 532 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y. 1994) quoting 5 L.King, Collier on\n\nBankruptcy ¶ 1329.01 (15th ed. 1994) (“A trustee’s application\n\n‘should be limited to situations in which there has been a\n\nsubstantial change in the debtor’s income or expenses that was not\n\nanticipated at the time of the confirmation hearing.’”); In re Fitak,\n\n92 B.R. at 250 (“[T]he doctrine of res judicata operates as a\n\n\n\n     12(...continued)\n     Anaheim Savings & Loan Ass’n v.

Witkowski, 16 F.3d at\n\n745; In re Powers, 202 B.R. at 622 (“Although a party has an absolute\n\nright to request modification between confirmation and completion of\n\nthe plan, modification under § 1329 is not without limits.”); In re\n\nThan, 215 B.R. at 436 (same); In re Trumbas, 245 B.R. at 767\n\n(following In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 548, and Witkowski, supra); In\n\nre Meeks, 237 B.R. 856, 859-60 (M.D.Fla. 1999)(“[T]he Debtors need\n\nnot demonstrate a substantial, unanticipated change in circumstances\n\nin order to modify their confirmed chapter 13 plan.   However, neither\n\ncan Chapter 13 debtors simply modify their plans willy nilly.”); In\n\nre Laye, 1994 WL 905759, *2 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1994)(following\n\nWitkowski, supra).   This approach is based on the clear language of\n\nthe statute. In re Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 746; In re Powers, 202 B.R.\n\nat 622 (“[W]e decline to hold that the change [under § 1329] must be\n\nsubstantial and unanticipated as suggested by various cases in [the\n\nNinth Circuit].   The plain language of § 1329 simply does not support\n\na change in circumstances as a prerequisite to modification.”)     Also,\n\nit acknowledges that section 1329 does provide a criterion for\n\n\n                              -20-\n\fgranting a modification. In re Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 745-46.         First,\n\n“modifications are only allowed in [the] three limited circumstances”\n\nprovided by the statute. Id. at 745.      Second, as provided by §\n\n1329(b)(1) of the Code, “a modified plan is only available if §§\n\n1322(a), 1322(b), 1325(a) and 1329(c) of the bankruptcy code are\n\nmet.” Id.    Third, a modification may only be proposed in good faith.\n\nId. at 746.13   Fourth, “all proposed modifications need not be\n\napproved and in practice not all modifications are approved.” Id.\n\nMoreover, the statutory framework is clear in allowing post-\n\nconfirmation modifications, a feature that is incongruent with the\n\napplication of the doctrine of res judicata. Id. at 745.14\n\n            The legislative history of section 1329(a) is not\n\nconclusive on this issue either, and if anything, it supports the\n\ninference that res judicata should not be applied.        Section 1329(a)\n\nwas amended in 1984 to provide standing to the trustee and the\n\nholders of unsecured claims to move to amend the confirmed bankruptcy\n\nrepayment plan. Consumer Credit Amendments, Section 319, Title III of\n\n\n     13\n\n     Specifically, “lack of good faith can be shown by manipulation of\ncode provisions.” In re Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 746.\n     14\n\n     The Witkwoski court stated: “The common-law principle of res\njudicata ... does not apply when a statutory purpose to the contrary\nis evident.” In re Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 744 (internal quotations\nomitted). It then noted that “the statutory framework of the\nBankruptcy Code plainly assumes the possibility of modifications of\nbankruptcy plans after they are confirmed.” Id. at 745.\n\n                                -21-\n\fthe Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984\n\n(“BAFJA”), Publ. L. No. 98-353;    8 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 1329.03\n\n(Lawrence P. King, chief ed., 15th ed. 2000).    Prior to the\n\namendment, only the debtor was authorized to request a modification\n\nof the plan. Id.; see also William L. Norton Jr., Bankruptcy Law and\n\nPractice 2d, Bankruptcy Code 1270, eds.’ comm. (1998-1999).      However,\n\nCongress saw fit to allow the trustee and holders of unsecured claims\n\nto seek an amendment to the confirmed plan in order to carry the\n\nability-to-pay standard forward in time, allowing upward or downward\n\nadjustment of plan payments in response to changes in the debtor’s\n\nfinancial circumstances which affect his/her ability to make\n\npayments. See Oversight Hearings on Personal Bankruptcy Before the\n\nSubcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the Committee on the\n\nJudiciary, House of Representatives, 97th Cong., 1st and 2nd Sess. 22-\n\n23 (1981-1982).15\n\n\n     15\n\n     See Statement of Professor Vern Countryman:\n\n     Since plans are confirmed on the basis of projections of\n     future income of the debtor, any subsequent change in the\n     debtor’s income, either an increase or a reduction, during\n     the term of the plan will result in an excessive or an\n     inadequate commitment of his disposable income under the\n     plan.   Because we believe that, in exchange for the\n     advantages of Chapter 13 over Chapter 7, the debtor should\n     commit his disposable income for the term of the plan, we\n     propose a new section 1329(d) to deal with that problem.\n     While this provision will permit the debtor to seek a\n     modification of the plan in the event of a reduction in\n                                                     (continued...)\n\n                               -22-\n\f          There was an indication at the Congressional Oversight\n\nHearings on Personal Bankruptcy that the standing conferred to the\n\ntrustee and the unsecured creditors would serve to accommodate any\n\nchanges in the financial circumstances of the debtor (either\n\nadversely or favorably), which substantially affect his ability to\n\nmake future payments under the plan. Oversight Hearings, supra, at\n\n215-216, 221-222 (1981-1982) (statement of the Hon. Conrad K. Cyr,\n\nBankruptcy Judge for the District of Maine, speaking on behalf of the\n\nNational Bankruptcy Conference and the National Conference of\n\nBankruptcy Judges); Arnold & Porter, BANKR84, Hearings(21).         However,\n\nthe reference to a substantial change was never accompanied by the\n\n\n     15\n      (...continued)\n     income, it will also permit an unsecured creditor, in the\n     event of an improvement in the debtor’s income position at\n     any time during the period of the plan, to seek a\n     modification so that the full amount of the debtor’s\n     disposable income remains committed to payments under the\n     plan. This proposal ... seems to us to be a reasonable quid\n     pro quo for the benefits conferred on the debtor under\n     Chapter 13 which would not be available to him in a Chapter\n     7 case.\n\nOversight Hearings on Personal Bankruptcy Before the Subcommittee on\nMonopolies and Commercial Law of the Committee on the Judiciary, House\nof Representatives, 97th Cong., 1st and 2nd Sess. 22-23 (1981-\n1982)(statement of Mr. Vern Countryman, Harvard Law School Professor\nand Vice-Chairman of the National Bankruptcy Conference); Arnold &\nPorter, BANKR84, Hearings(21).\n\n     Although the proposed subsection 1329(d) was not finally enacted\nby Congress, the essential purpose behind it, to permit the unsecured\ncreditors (and the trustee) to request an amendment to the confirmed\nbankruptcy plan if there was a change in the debtor’s income, did\nbecome law.\n\n                                -23-\n\frequirement that the change be unanticipated.16       Moreover, the\n\nlegislative history indicates that the application of the doctrine of\n\nres judicata was never discussed, considered, or contemplated by\n\nCongress. Oversight Hearings, supra.\n\n          Faced with this legislative intention, and the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute, we are compelled to concur with the district\n\ncourt and the bankruptcy court that the Witkowski approach is the\n\nmore sensible one. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 547.        However, the\n\nbankruptcy judge was careful to note that “motions to modify cannot\n\nbe used to circumvent the appeals process for those creditors who\n\nhave failed to object confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan or whose\n\nobjections to confirmation have been overruled.” Id.        Moreover, the\n\nbankruptcy judge noted that “§§ 1327 and 1330 accord significant\n\nfinality to confirmation orders in Chapter 13 cases.” Id.\n\nAccordingly, the court concluded that “while Witkowski may be a\n\n\n     16\n\n     In fact, the original proposed amendment read:\n\n     On request of the debtor or of a creditor holding an allowed\n     unsecured claim and after notice and a hearing, the plan\n     shall be modified under subsection (a) of this section to\n     any extent that any change in the debtor’s total projected\n     disposable income, as defined in section 1320 of this title,\n     substantially affects whether the plan, before modification,\n     complies with the conditions specified in sections\n     1325(a)(6) and 1325(c) of this title.\n\nProposed Section 1329(d); Oversight Hearings, supra, at 31. The\nreference to a “substantial change” was later deleted from the section\nand did not become law.\n\n                                -24-\n\fcorrect statement of the law, as a practical matter, parties\n\nrequesting modifications of Chapter 13 plans must advance a\n\nlegitimate reason for doing so, and they must strictly conform to the\n\nthree limited circumstances set forth in § 1329.” Id. at 548.\n\n           Upon a close analysis, the bankruptcy court’s conclusions\n\nof law do accord significant finality to confirmed plans without\n\nrequiring specific threshold tests not contemplated by the statute.\n\nTherefore, we adopt the Witkowski approach as modified by the\n\nbankruptcy court and refrain from adopting the substantial and\n\nunanticipated test for seeking a modification pursuant to § 1329.\n\nAccordingly, we find that the Trustee and Mellon were not precluded\n\nby res judicata from seeking an amendment to the plan.   In addition,\n\ngiven the factual circumstances of this case — where the Debtors\n\nrealized through the sale an appreciation in value of almost 215% of\n\nthe stipulated value of the property at confirmation — we find that\n\nthe bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in granting the\n\namendment. Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 746 (“Because modification under §\n\n1329 is discretionary, our review is limited to a determination of\n\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in modifying the\n\nplan.”).\n\n           Finally, as the bankruptcy judge said, it is antithetical\n\nto the bankruptcy system to allow a debtor to “strip down” a\n\nmortgage, underpay the unsecured creditors, and obtain a super\n\n\n                              -25-\n\fdischarge under section 1328(a) of the Code, while selling the\n\nproperty mortgaged for a price of two times its estimated value for\n\npurposes of the “strip down”, and keeping to himself the excess of\n\nthe proceeds. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 552.   In fact, to allow the\n\nDebtors to keep the proceeds of the sale in such circumstances\n\neffectively defeats Congress’ intention to extend the application of\n\nthe “ability-to-pay” standard forward throughout the duration of the\n\nplan. Oversight Hearings, supra.\n\n                       III.   CONCLUSION\n\n         On these grounds, the district court’s order upholding the\n\nbankruptcy court’s judgment is Affirmed. Costs are awarded to the\n\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                              -26-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The property sold in this particular case consists of a  two-family building retained by the debtors for investment purposes  (\"the Property\"), which was subject to a lien in the amount of  $114,000 held by Mellon Mortgage Company (\"Mellon\").  On May 5, 1997,  Mellon entered into a stipulation with the Debtors, Marcelino and  Mariana Barbosa (\"the Debtors\"), whereby they agreed that the market  value of the Property was $64,000 (\"the Stipulation\").  Therefore,  Mellon's secured claim was \"stripped down\" by $50,000, from $114,000  to $64,000.  The Stipulation also provided for payment in full of the  stripped-down secured claim plus interest.  The balance, now  unsecured, would be repaid \"at a rate of not less than 10%.\"  As a  guarantee, Mellon \"retain[ed] its lien in full until successful  completion of the repayment plan.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1998, the Debtors filed their repayment plan,  in consonance with the terms of the Stipulation.  It was confirmed by  the bankruptcy court on September 23, 1998.  The Plan provided, among  other things, the following: (1) full payment of Mellon's stipulated  secured claim plus interest at a 9% annual interest rate; (2)  prepayment of Mellon's stipulated secured claim at any time, without  premium or penalty; (3) payment of a dividend to unsecured creditorsequal to 10% of the amount of their claims; and (4) reduction of the  monthly plan payment, in the event that Mellon's secured claim was  prepaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court's Confirmation Order approved the  Debtors' Plan and summarized the disbursements to be made under it. In addition, it acknowledged the modification of Mellon's secured  claim as explained above.  Regarding the unsecured claims, it stated  that they \"shall be paid [at] a dividend of not less than 10%.\" Finally, in compliance with 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1327, the Confirmation Order  provided that: \"[T]he provisions of the confirmed Plan bind the  debtors and all creditors; the confirmation of the Plan vests all  property of the estate in the debtors; and all property vesting in  the debtors is free and clear of any claim or interest of any  creditor, except as provided in the Plan or this order.\" (Emphasis  added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the entry of the Confirmation Order, the Debtors  sought leave from the bankruptcy court to sell the Property free of  liens or encumbrances pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1303 and 363.  Leave  was obtained and accordingly, the property was sold for $137,500 to a  good faith purchaser.  The bankruptcy court's order approving the  sale (the \"Sale Order\") provided for payment in full of Mellon's  secured claim pursuant to the Plan and the Confirmation Order; while  the balance of the proceeds were to be held in escrow by the Debtors'  counsel \"until the earlier of (a) an agreement by and between the  Debtors and ... the Chapter 13 Trustee ... regarding disbursement of  such proceeds, and (b) disposition by the Court, by a final order,  adjudicating a motion filed by the Chapter 13 Trustee seeking an  amendment to the Plan....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtors and the Chapter 13 Trustee were unable to  reach an agreement for the distribution of the proceeds.  Therefore,  the Trustee moved to compel the Debtors to modify their Plan in order  to pay the excess of the proceeds to the Debtors' unsecured  creditors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The end result under the Trustee's proposed plan would  be that the dividend paid to unsecured creditors would increase from  10% to 100%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtors opposed the Trustee's motion.  On July 30,  1999, after a hearing, the bankruptcy court entered a Modification  Order granting the Trustee's motion and holding that the Debtors were  compelled to amend their Plan in order to distribute the proceeds to  the unsecured creditors. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. 540 (Bankr.D.Mass.  1999).  The court reasoned that since the Debtors' bankruptcy plan  did not provide for prepayment of the unsecured claims, the Debtors,  through their Sale Motion, were \"implicitly seek[ing] to modify their  plan to reduce the time for satisfying the claims of unsecured  creditors.\" Id. at 545.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Accordingly, the court rejected Debtors'  implied amendments to reduce the time of payment to the unsecured  creditors and satisfy their claims by paying the 10% dividend,  without any regard to the change in circumstances. Id. at 548-49,  556.  In addition, the bankruptcy court found that the Debtors'  intention to keep the proceeds of the sale, while paying the 10%  dividend provided by the Plan to the unsecured creditors, failed to  meet both the good faith requirement and the best-interests-of-the-creditors test of 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1329<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and 1325(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> in order to modify  a confirmed plan, given the substantial and unanticipated change in  the Debtors' financial circumstances. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 552-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the bankruptcy court noted that although pursuant  to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1327(b), the Property sold vested in the Debtors free  and clear of any claim from the creditors (accord In re Rangel, 233  B.R. 191 (Bankr.D.Mass. 1999)), the result in this case by allocating  the appreciation of property, which the court characterized as  windfall profits, to the Debtors rather than to the unsecured  creditors \"is antithetical to the results that would be achieved in  the absence of a confirmed plan that vested the Property in the  Debtors.\" In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 551.  The court continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is something unsavory about  Chapter 13 Debtors 'stripping down' a mortgage  under &#167; 506(a) and (d) and receiving the  'super' discharge provided by &#167; 1328(a) while  walking away with substantial cash proceeds due  to the appreciation in value of their Property,  without amending their plan to satisfy the  claims of their unsecured creditors... Putting  aside the various inconsistent Code sections,  the problems created by the vesting language in  &#167; 1327(b) and the order of confirmation used in  this case, and hairsplitting arguments about  what constitutes property of the estate in  Chapter 13, the spectacle of the Debtors  profiting while in bankruptcy is disconcerting  and may be indicative of a bad faith  manipulation of the Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 551-52.  Accordingly, the bankruptcy court held that the  Debtors were required to amend their plan as requested by the Trustee  to provide for full compensation to the unsecured creditors. Id. at  556.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy  court's decision and order. Barbosa v. Solomon, 243 B.R. 562 (D.  Mass. 2000).  However, it used a different rationale.  It found that  the central issue was the meaning of the phrase \"property of the  estate\" as used in the various sections of the Bankruptcy Code. Id. at 565.  It then noted that a reading of the bankruptcy court's  memorandum opinion might give the impression that the Trustee \"admits  that ... [proceeds of the foreclosure sale are] no longer property of  the estate....\" Id.  However, in the district court's opinion, \"if  th[at] is what the bankruptcy court's Memorandum means, it is an  error of law.\" Id.  Rather, the district court's interpretation of  the concept \"property of the estate\" as used by section 1327 of the  Code, vested title to the realty in the Debtors at confirmation, but  not the proceeds of the sale. Id. at 567-68.  The district court  concurred with the bankruptcy court in all other aspects and  therefore, it affirmed the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtors appealed from that decision and raise various  issues.  In particular, they contend that the district court erred in  ruling that the proceeds were part of the bankruptcy estate, based on  11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1327 and 541(a)(6).  They rely on the vesting language  of section 1327 of the Code and the Confirmation Order for the  proposition that Mellon forfeited any claim to the excess proceeds  from the property when it entered into the Stipulation, and that such  forfeiture became effective when the Confirmation Order was entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Debtors argue that the bankruptcy and district  courts erred by improperly applying 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1329 by finding that  they had implicitly sought a modification of the Plan through the  motion for confirmation of sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  ANALYSIS OF APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this case presents primarily questions of law, this  Court's review of the bankruptcy and district court's decisions is de  novo. In re Savage Industries, Inc., 43 F.3d 714, 719 n. 8 (1st Cir.  1994); In re DN Associates, 3 F.3d 512, 515 (1st Cir. 1993). However, any findings of fact by the lower courts are reviewed on a  clearly erroneous standard. In re Savage Indus., 43 F.3d at 720.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.  The Confirmed Plan in a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1327(b) of the Bankruptcy Code states that \"the  confirmation of a plan vests all property of the estate in the  debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1327(b).  In addition, section 1327(c) adds that  such vesting \"is free and clear of any claim or interest of any  creditor provided for by the plan.\" Id.  The language used by the  bankruptcy court in its Confirmation Order was in consonance with  these Code provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtors argue that in defining the concept \"property  of the estate\" the district court ignored various sections of the  Bankruptcy Code; particularly section 541(a)(6) which establishes  that the concept \"property of the estate\" includes proceeds \"of or  from property of the estate.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(6).  Therefore, the  Debtors argue that section 1327 of the Code, combined with section  541, vested in them the Property along with its proceeds \"free and  clear of any claim or interest of any creditor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1327(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in direct contraposition with the Debtors'  intended interpretation is section 1306(a) of the Bankruptcy Code,  which defines the concept \"property of the estate\" within a Chapter  13 bankruptcy thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Property of the estate includes, in addition to  the property specified in section 541 of this  title:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) all property of the kind specified in  such section that the debtor acquires after the  commencement of the case but before the case is  closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under  chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title, whichever  occurs first; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) earnings from services performed by the  debtor after the commencement of the case but  before the case is closed, dismissed, or  converted to a case under chapter 7, 11, or 12  of this title, whichever occurs first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 1306(a).  While this section does extend the application  of section 541 to cases filed under Chapter 13, it does so within a  specific context.  In particular, the status of the property of the  estate after the confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan is a controversial  issue in itself. See Russell G. Donaldson, Continued Existence of  Bankruptcy Code Chapter 13 Estate After Confirmation of the Chapter  13 Plan, 126 ALR Fed. 665 (1995)(Supp. 1999); David B.

Rev. 677  (July 1990); see also In re Reynard, 250 B.R. 241, 246-47  (Bankr.E.D.Va. 2000); In re Holden, 236 B.R. 156, 160-63 (Bankr.D.Vt.  1999); In re Rangel, 233 B.R. at 198.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By stating that the bankruptcy estate continues to be  replenished by post-petition property until the case is closed,  dismissed, or converted under chapter 7, 11 or 12 of the Bankruptcy  Code, section 1306(a) is actually providing for the continued  existence of the bankruptcy estate until the earliest of any of the  above-mentioned events occur.  The meaning of the \"vesting\" language  of section 1327(b) within this context has been explored far and wide  throughout the nation.  In fact, the bankruptcy court noted that  sections 1306(a) and 1327(b) of the Code \"are difficult to reconcile\"  in this regard. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 545, quoting In re Rangel,  233 B.R. at 193.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts have interpreted section 1306(a) as actually  providing for the continuation of the bankruptcy estate until the  earliest of any of the above-mentioned events. See Security Bank of  Marshall Town v. Neiman, 1 F.3d 687 (8th Cir. 1993).  Still others  have held that the confirmation order terminates the estate  altogether, re-vesting all property of the estate in the debtor. In  re Olivier, 193 B.R. 992 (Bankr.N.D.Ga. 1996); In re Petruccelli, 113  B.R. 5 (Bankr.S.D.Cal. 1990).  A third approach, called \"the-middle-of-the-road approach\", stands for the proposition that the estate  continues to exist only with regard to property used to fund the  plan. In re Leavell, 190 B.R. 156 (Bankr.E.D.Va. 1995); In re  Ziegler, 136 B.R. 191 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1992).  All of these positions  have been criticized; the first two for overly emphasizing either  section 1306 or 1327, rendering the opposing section meaningless,  Wheeler, supra at 14, while the third approach is criticized for  involving a subjective analysis not contemplated, or provided for, by  the Code. Id.; see also Donaldson, supra, 126 ALR Fed. 665 &#167;&#167; 2-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, a fourth line of cases has held that by virtue of  sections 1327(b)-(c), property of the estate at the time of  confirmation vests in the debtors free of any claims from the  creditors.  The estate does not cease to exist however, and it  continues to be funded by the Debtors' regular income and post-petition assets as specified in section 1306(a). In re Reynard, 250  B.R. at 247; In re Trumbas, 245 B.R. 764, 766 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2000); In re Holden, 236 B.R. at 162-63; In re Rangel, 233 B.R. at 198.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many commentators consider this approach to be the best,  since it gives meaning to both sections 1306 and 1327, without the  subjective analysis required by the middle-of-the-road approach. E.g. Wheeler, supra.  It was also the approach followed by the bankruptcy  court in this case.  Because we think that this approach has a  logical consistency that harmonizes two apparent inconsistent  sections, we hereby adopt it.  However, we note that this rule cannot  be applied in an inflexible manner, for in spite of the \"vesting\"  provided by section 1327 of the Code, until all payments due under  the plan are made, both the trustee and the unsecured creditors have  an interest in the preservation of the debtor's financial situation,  and in the extension of the ability-to-pay standard to future  situations under the plan.  In this particular case, \"receiving  proceeds has also altered the debtor's financial circumstances\",  which brings into play &#167; 1329 of the Code. In re Suratt, 1996 WL  914095, *1 (D.Or. 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

They argue that the Property's sale was contemplated  by the parties at the time of entering into the Stipulation and by  the Court when it confirmed the Plan.  Therefore, they aver that the  modification requested by the Trustee and Mellon is precluded by res  judicata.  For that purpose, they allege that the sale was not an  unanticipated event, and that the appreciation in value of the  property was foreseeable.  They do not dispute however, nor can they  given the facts, that the change in the Debtors' financial  circumstances is substantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the start, we note that Debtors' arguments are not  grounded on the specific provisions of the Code; since section 1329  does not in itself establish a criterion for granting a modification,  other than the plan as modified must comply with all applicable  provisions of the Code. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1329(b), incorporating by  reference 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(a).  This means that the Plan as modified  must be proposed in good-faith. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(a)(3).  Also, it  must comply with the \"best-interests-of-the-creditors\" test and the  \"ability-to-pay\" standard. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(a)(4-6).  However, the  Code says nothing about the applicability of the doctrine of res  judicata or the threshold requirement of unanticipated and  substantial change in the debtor's financial circumstances.

Of all these factors, the need to accord a  degree of finality to the confirmation order is one of the most  weighty for some courts.

However, neither  can Chapter 13 debtors simply modify their plans willy nilly.\"); In  re Laye, 1994 WL 905759, *2 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1994)(following Witkowski, supra).  This approach is based on the clear language of  the statute. In re Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 746; In re Powers, 202 B.R.  at 622 (\"[W]e decline to hold that the change [under &#167; 1329] must be  substantial and unanticipated as suggested by various cases in [the  Ninth Circuit].

In re Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 745-46.  First,  \"modifications are only allowed in [the] three limited circumstances\"  provided by the statute. Id. at 745.

Section 1329(a)  was amended in 1984 to provide standing to the trustee and the  holders of unsecured claims to move to amend the confirmed bankruptcy  repayment plan. Consumer Credit Amendments, Section 319, Title III of  the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984  (\"BAFJA\"), Publ. L. No. 98-353;  8 Collier on Bankruptcy &#182; 1329.03  (Lawrence P. King, chief ed., 15th ed. 2000).  Prior to the  amendment, only the debtor was authorized to request a modification  of the plan. Id.; see also William L. Norton Jr., Bankruptcy Law and  Practice 2d, Bankruptcy Code 1270, eds.' comm. (1998-1999).  However,  Congress saw fit to allow the trustee and holders of unsecured claims  to seek an amendment to the confirmed plan in order to carry the  ability-to-pay standard forward in time, allowing upward or downward  adjustment of plan payments in response to changes in the debtor's  financial circumstances which affect his/her ability to make  payments. See Oversight Hearings on Personal Bankruptcy Before the  Subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the Committee on the  Judiciary, House of Representatives, 97th Cong., 1st and 2nd Sess. 22-23 (1981-1982).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was an indication at the Congressional Oversight  Hearings on Personal Bankruptcy that the standing conferred to the  trustee and the unsecured creditors would serve to accommodate any  changes in the financial circumstances of the debtor (either  adversely or favorably), which substantially affect his ability to  make future payments under the plan. Oversight Hearings, supra, at  215-216, 221-222 (1981-1982) (statement of the Hon. Conrad K. Cyr,  Bankruptcy Judge for the District of Maine, speaking on behalf of the  National Bankruptcy Conference and the National Conference of  Bankruptcy Judges); Arnold &amp; Porter, BANKR84, Hearings(21).  However,  the reference to a substantial change was never accompanied by the  requirement that the change be unanticipated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Moreover, the  legislative history indicates that the application of the doctrine of res judicata was never discussed, considered, or contemplated by  Congress. Oversight Hearings, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with this legislative intention, and the plain  language of the statute, we are compelled to concur with the district  court and the bankruptcy court that the Witkowski approach is the  more sensible one. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 547.  However, the  bankruptcy judge was careful to note that \"motions to modify cannot  be used to circumvent the appeals process for those creditors who  have failed to object confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan or whose  objections to confirmation have been overruled.\" Id.  Moreover, the  bankruptcy judge noted that \"&#167;&#167; 1327 and 1330 accord significant  finality to confirmation orders in Chapter 13 cases.\" Id. Accordingly, the court concluded that \"while Witkowski may be a  correct statement of the law, as a practical matter, parties  requesting modifications of Chapter 13 plans must advance a  legitimate reason for doing so, and they must strictly conform to the  three limited circumstances set forth in &#167; 1329.\" Id. at 548.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon a close analysis, the bankruptcy court's conclusions  of law do accord significant finality to confirmed plans without  requiring specific threshold tests not contemplated by the statute. Therefore, we adopt the Witkowski approach as modified by the  bankruptcy court and refrain from adopting the substantial and  unanticipated test for seeking a modification pursuant to &#167; 1329. Accordingly, we find that the Trustee and Mellon were not precluded  by res judicata from seeking an amendment to the plan.  In addition,  given the factual circumstances of this case -- where the Debtors  realized through the sale an appreciation in value of almost 215% of  the stipulated value of the property at confirmation -- we find that  the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in granting the  amendment. Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 746 (\"Because modification under &#167;  1329 is discretionary, our review is limited to a determination of  whether the district court abused its discretion in modifying the  plan.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as the bankruptcy judge said, it is antithetical  to the bankruptcy system to allow a debtor to \"strip down\" a  mortgage, underpay the unsecured creditors, and obtain a super  discharge under section 1328(a) of the Code, while selling the  property mortgaged for a price of two times its estimated value for  purposes of the \"strip down\", and keeping to himself the excess of  the proceeds. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 552.  In fact, to allow the  Debtors to keep the proceeds of the sale in such circumstances  effectively defeats Congress' intention to extend the application of  the \"ability-to-pay\" standard forward throughout the duration of the  plan.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The property sold in this particular case consists of a  two-family building retained by the debtors for investment purposes  (\"the Property\"), which was subject to a lien in the amount of  $114,000 held by Mellon Mortgage Company (\"Mellon\").  On May 5, 1997,  Mellon entered into a stipulation with the Debtors, Marcelino and  Mariana Barbosa (\"the Debtors\"), whereby they agreed that the market  value of the Property was $64,000 (\"the Stipulation\").  Therefore,  Mellon's secured claim was \"stripped down\" by $50,000, from $114,000  to $64,000.  The Stipulation also provided for payment in full of the  stripped-down secured claim plus interest.  The balance, now  unsecured, would be repaid \"at a rate of not less than 10%.\"  As a  guarantee, Mellon \"retain[ed] its lien in full until successful  completion of the repayment plan.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1998, the Debtors filed their repayment plan,  in consonance with the terms of the Stipulation.  It was confirmed by  the bankruptcy court on September 23, 1998.  The Plan provided, among  other things, the following: (1) full payment of Mellon's stipulated  secured claim plus interest at a 9% annual interest rate; (2)  prepayment of Mellon's stipulated secured claim at any time, without  premium or penalty; (3) payment of a dividend to unsecured creditorsequal to 10% of the amount of their claims; and (4) reduction of the  monthly plan payment, in the event that Mellon's secured claim was  prepaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court's Confirmation Order approved the  Debtors' Plan and summarized the disbursements to be made under it. In addition, it acknowledged the modification of Mellon's secured  claim as explained above.  Regarding the unsecured claims, it stated  that they \"shall be paid [at] a dividend of not less than 10%.\" Finally, in compliance with 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1327, the Confirmation Order  provided that: \"[T]he provisions of the confirmed Plan bind the  debtors and all creditors; the confirmation of the Plan vests all  property of the estate in the debtors; and all property vesting in  the debtors is free and clear of any claim or interest of any  creditor, except as provided in the Plan or this order.\" (Emphasis  added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the entry of the Confirmation Order, the Debtors  sought leave from the bankruptcy court to sell the Property free of  liens or encumbrances pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1303 and 363.  Leave  was obtained and accordingly, the property was sold for $137,500 to a  good faith purchaser.  The bankruptcy court's order approving the  sale (the \"Sale Order\") provided for payment in full of Mellon's  secured claim pursuant to the Plan and the Confirmation Order; while  the balance of the proceeds were to be held in escrow by the Debtors'  counsel \"until the earlier of (a) an agreement by and between the  Debtors and ... the Chapter 13 Trustee ... regarding disbursement of  such proceeds, and (b) disposition by the Court, by a final order,  adjudicating a motion filed by the Chapter 13 Trustee seeking an  amendment to the Plan....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtors and the Chapter 13 Trustee were unable to  reach an agreement for the distribution of the proceeds.  Therefore,  the Trustee moved to compel the Debtors to modify their Plan in order  to pay the excess of the proceeds to the Debtors' unsecured  creditors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The end result under the Trustee's proposed plan would  be that the dividend paid to unsecured creditors would increase from  10% to 100%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtors opposed the Trustee's motion.  On July 30,  1999, after a hearing, the bankruptcy court entered a Modification  Order granting the Trustee's motion and holding that the Debtors were  compelled to amend their Plan in order to distribute the proceeds to  the unsecured creditors. In re Barbosa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1531610\"><a href=\"/opinion/1531610/in-re-barbosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span> (Bankr.D.Mass.  1999).  The court reasoned that since the Debtors' bankruptcy plan  did not provide for prepayment of the unsecured claims, the Debtors,  through their Sale Motion, were \"implicitly seek[ing] to modify their  plan to reduce the time for satisfying the claims of unsecured  creditors.\" Id. at 545.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Accordingly, the court rejected Debtors'  implied amendments to reduce the time of payment to the unsecured  creditors and satisfy their claims by paying the 10% dividend,  without any regard to the change in circumstances. Id. at 548-49,  556.  In addition, the bankruptcy court found that the Debtors'  intention to keep the proceeds of the sale, while paying the 10%  dividend provided by the Plan to the unsecured creditors, failed to  meet both the good faith requirement and the best-interests-of-the-creditors test of 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1329<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and 1325(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> in order to modify  a confirmed plan, given the substantial and unanticipated change in  the Debtors' financial circumstances. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 552-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the bankruptcy court noted that although pursuant  to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1327(b), the Property sold vested in the Debtors free  and clear of any claim from the creditors (accord In re Rangel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022147\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022147/in-re-rangel/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span> (Bankr.D.Mass. 1999)), the result in this case by allocating  the appreciation of property, which the court characterized as  windfall profits, to the Debtors rather than to the unsecured  creditors \"is antithetical to the results that would be achieved in  the absence of a confirmed plan that vested the Property in the  Debtors.\" In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 551.  The court continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is something unsavory about  Chapter 13 Debtors 'stripping down' a mortgage  under &#167; 506(a) and (d) and receiving the  'super' discharge provided by &#167; 1328(a) while  walking away with substantial cash proceeds due  to the appreciation in value of their Property,  without amending their plan to satisfy the  claims of their unsecured creditors... Putting  aside the various inconsistent Code sections,  the problems created by the vesting language in  &#167; 1327(b) and the order of confirmation used in  this case, and hairsplitting arguments about  what constitutes property of the estate in  Chapter 13, the spectacle of the Debtors  profiting while in bankruptcy is disconcerting  and may be indicative of a bad faith  manipulation of the Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 551-52.  Accordingly, the bankruptcy court held that the  Debtors were required to amend their plan as requested by the Trustee  to provide for full compensation to the unsecured creditors. Id. at  556.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy  court's decision and order. Barbosa v. Solomon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1552450\"><a href=\"/opinion/1552450/barbosa-v-solomon/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span> (D.  Mass. 2000).  However, it used a different rationale.  It found that  the central issue was the meaning of the phrase \"property of the  estate\" as used in the various sections of the Bankruptcy Code. Id. at 565.  It then noted that a reading of the bankruptcy court's  memorandum opinion might give the impression that the Trustee \"admits  that ... [proceeds of the foreclosure sale are] no longer property of  the estate....\" Id.  However, in the district court's opinion, \"if  th[at] is what the bankruptcy court's Memorandum means, it is an  error of law.\" Id.  Rather, the district court's interpretation of  the concept \"property of the estate\" as used by section 1327 of the  Code, vested title to the realty in the Debtors at confirmation, but  not the proceeds of the sale. Id. at 567-68.  The district court  concurred with the bankruptcy court in all other aspects and  therefore, it affirmed the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtors appealed from that decision and raise various  issues.  In particular, they contend that the district court erred in  ruling that the proceeds were part of the bankruptcy estate, based on  11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1327 and 541(a)(6).  They rely on the vesting language  of section 1327 of the Code and the Confirmation Order for the  proposition that Mellon forfeited any claim to the excess proceeds  from the property when it entered into the Stipulation, and that such  forfeiture became effective when the Confirmation Order was entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Debtors argue that the bankruptcy and district  courts erred by improperly applying 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1329 by finding that  they had implicitly sought a modification of the Plan through the  motion for confirmation of sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.  ANALYSIS OF APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this case presents primarily questions of law, this  Court's review of the bankruptcy and district court's decisions is de  novo.

In addition, section 1327(c) adds that  such vesting \"is free and clear of any claim or interest of any  creditor provided for by the plan.\" Id.  The language used by the  bankruptcy court in its Confirmation Order was in consonance with  these Code provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtors argue that in defining the concept \"property  of the estate\" the district court ignored various sections of the  Bankruptcy Code; particularly section 541(a)(6) which establishes  that the concept \"property of the estate\" includes proceeds \"of or  from property of the estate.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(6).  Therefore, the  Debtors argue that section 1327 of the Code, combined with section  541, vested in them the Property along with its proceeds \"free and  clear of any claim or interest of any creditor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1327(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in direct contraposition with the Debtors'  intended interpretation is section 1306(a) of the Bankruptcy Code,  which defines the concept \"property of the estate\" within a Chapter  13 bankruptcy thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Property of the estate includes, in addition to  the property specified in section 541 of this  title:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) all property of the kind specified in  such section that the debtor acquires after the  commencement of the case but before the case is  closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under  chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title, whichever  occurs first; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) earnings from services performed by the  debtor after the commencement of the case but  before the case is closed, dismissed, or  converted to a case under chapter 7, 11, or 12  of this title, whichever occurs first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 1306(a).  While this section does extend the application  of section 541 to cases filed under Chapter 13, it does so within a  specific context.  In particular, the status of the property of the  estate after the confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan is a controversial  issue in itself. See Russell G.

The meaning of the \"vesting\" language  of section 1327(b) within this context has been explored far and wide  throughout the nation.  In fact, the bankruptcy court noted that  sections 1306(a) and 1327(b) of the Code \"are difficult to reconcile\"  in this regard. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 545, quoting In re Rangel,  233 B.R. at 193.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts have interpreted section 1306(a) as actually  providing for the continuation of the bankruptcy estate until the  earliest of any of the above-mentioned events. See Security Bank of  Marshall Town v. Neiman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627414\"><a href=\"/opinion/627414/the-security-bank-of-marshalltown-iowa-a-creditor-of-robert-v-brown-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span> (8th Cir. 1993).  Still others  have held that the confirmation order terminates the estate  altogether, re-vesting all property of the estate in the debtor. In  re Olivier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1933249\"><a href=\"/opinion/1933249/in-re-toth/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span> (Bankr.N.D.Ga. 1996); In re Petruccelli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1990217\"><a href=\"/opinion/1990217/in-re-petruccelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span> (Bankr.S.D.Cal. 1990).  A third approach, called \"the-middle-of-the-road approach\", stands for the proposition that the estate  continues to exist only with regard to property used to fund the  plan. In re Leavell, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span> (Bankr.E.D.Va. 1995); In re  Ziegler, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></span> (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1992).  All of these positions  have been criticized; the first two for overly emphasizing either  section 1306 or 1327, rendering the opposing section meaningless,  Wheeler, supra at 14, while the third approach is criticized for  involving a subjective analysis not contemplated, or provided for, by  the Code. Id.; see also Donaldson, supra, 126 ALR Fed. 665 &#167;&#167; 2-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, a fourth line of cases has held that by virtue of  sections 1327(b)-(c), property of the estate at the time of  confirmation vests in the debtors free of any claims from the  creditors.  The estate does not cease to exist however, and it  continues to be funded by the Debtors' regular income and post-petition assets as specified in section 1306(a). In re Reynard, 250  B.R. at 247; In re Trumbas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1926997\"><a href=\"/opinion/1926997/in-re-trumbas/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span>, 766 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2000); In re Holden, 236 B.R. at 162-63; In re Rangel, 233 B.R. at 198.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many commentators consider this approach to be the best,  since it gives meaning to both sections 1306 and 1327, without the  subjective analysis required by the middle-of-the-road approach. E.g. Wheeler, supra.  It was also the approach followed by the bankruptcy  court in this case.  Because we think that this approach has a  logical consistency that harmonizes two apparent inconsistent  sections, we hereby adopt it.  However, we note that this rule cannot  be applied in an inflexible manner, for in spite of the \"vesting\"  provided by section 1327 of the Code, until all payments due under  the plan are made, both the trustee and the unsecured creditors have  an interest in the preservation of the debtor's financial situation,  and in the extension of the ability-to-pay standard to future  situations under the plan.  In this particular case, \"receiving  proceeds has also altered the debtor's financial circumstances\",  which brings into play &#167; 1329 of the Code.

They argue that the Property's sale was contemplated  by the parties at the time of entering into the Stipulation and by  the Court when it confirmed the Plan.  Therefore, they aver that the  modification requested by the Trustee and Mellon is precluded by res  judicata.  For that purpose, they allege that the sale was not an  unanticipated event, and that the appreciation in value of the  property was foreseeable.

Section 1329(a)  was amended in 1984 to provide standing to the trustee and the  holders of unsecured claims to move to amend the confirmed bankruptcy  repayment plan. Consumer Credit Amendments, Section 319, Title III of  the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984  (\"BAFJA\"), Publ. L. No. 98-353;  8 Collier on Bankruptcy &#182; 1329.03  (Lawrence P. King, chief ed., 15th ed. 2000).  Prior to the  amendment, only the debtor was authorized to request a modification  of the plan. Id.; see also William L. Norton Jr., Bankruptcy Law and  Practice 2d, Bankruptcy Code 1270, eds.' comm. (1998-1999).  However,  Congress saw fit to allow the trustee and holders of unsecured claims  to seek an amendment to the confirmed plan in order to carry the  ability-to-pay standard forward in time, allowing upward or downward  adjustment of plan payments in response to changes in the debtor's  financial circumstances which affect his/her ability to make  payments. See Oversight Hearings on Personal Bankruptcy Before the  Subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the Committee on the  Judiciary, House of Representatives, 97th Cong., 1st and 2nd Sess. 22-23 (1981-1982).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was an indication at the Congressional Oversight  Hearings on Personal Bankruptcy that the standing conferred to the  trustee and the unsecured creditors would serve to accommodate any  changes in the financial circumstances of the debtor (either  adversely or favorably), which substantially affect his ability to  make future payments under the plan. Oversight Hearings, supra, at  215-216, 221-222 (1981-1982) (statement of the Hon. Conrad K. Cyr,  Bankruptcy Judge for the District of Maine, speaking on behalf of the  National Bankruptcy Conference and the National Conference of  Bankruptcy Judges); Arnold &amp; Porter, BANKR84, Hearings(21).  However,  the reference to a substantial change was never accompanied by the  requirement that the change be unanticipated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Moreover, the  legislative history indicates that the application of the doctrine of res judicata was never discussed, considered, or contemplated by  Congress. Oversight Hearings, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with this legislative intention, and the plain  language of the statute, we are compelled to concur with the district  court and the bankruptcy court that the Witkowski approach is the  more sensible one. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 547.  However, the  bankruptcy judge was careful to note that \"motions to modify cannot  be used to circumvent the appeals process for those creditors who  have failed to object confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan or whose  objections to confirmation have been overruled.\" Id.  Moreover, the  bankruptcy judge noted that \"&#167;&#167; 1327 and 1330 accord significant  finality to confirmation orders in Chapter 13 cases.\" Id. Accordingly, the court concluded that \"while Witkowski may be a  correct statement of the law, as a practical matter, parties  requesting modifications of Chapter 13 plans must advance a  legitimate reason for doing so, and they must strictly conform to the  three limited circumstances set forth in &#167; 1329.\" Id. at 548.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon a close analysis, the bankruptcy court's conclusions  of law do accord significant finality to confirmed plans without  requiring specific threshold tests not contemplated by the statute. Therefore, we adopt the Witkowski approach as modified by the  bankruptcy court and refrain from adopting the substantial and  unanticipated test for seeking a modification pursuant to &#167; 1329. Accordingly, we find that the Trustee and Mellon were not precluded  by res judicata from seeking an amendment to the plan.  In addition,  given the factual circumstances of this case -- where the Debtors  realized through the sale an appreciation in value of almost 215% of  the stipulated value of the property at confirmation -- we find that  the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in granting the  amendment. Witkowski, 16 F.3d at 746 (\"Because modification under &#167;  1329 is discretionary, our review is limited to a determination of  whether the district court abused its discretion in modifying the  plan.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as the bankruptcy judge said, it is antithetical  to the bankruptcy system to allow a debtor to \"strip down\" a  mortgage, underpay the unsecured creditors, and obtain a super  discharge under section 1328(a) of the Code, while selling the  property mortgaged for a price of two times its estimated value for  purposes of the \"strip down\", and keeping to himself the excess of  the proceeds. In re Barbosa, 236 B.R. at 552.  In fact, to allow the  Debtors to keep the proceeds of the sale in such circumstances  effectively defeats Congress' intention to extend the application of  the \"ability-to-pay\" standard forward throughout the duration of the  plan.

It then noted that \"the statutory framework of the  Bankruptcy Code plainly assumes the possibility of modifications of  bankruptcy plans after they are confirmed.\"  Id. at 745.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> See Statement of Professor Vern Countryman:</p>\n        <p>Since plans are confirmed on the basis of projections of  future income of the debtor, any subsequent change in the  debtor's income, either an increase or a reduction, during  the term of the plan will result in an excessive or an  inadequate commitment of his disposable income under the  plan.  Because we believe that, in exchange for the  advantages of Chapter 13 over Chapter 7, the debtor should  commit his disposable income for the term of the plan, we  propose a new section 1329(d) to deal with that problem. While this provision will permit the debtor to seek a  modification of the plan in the event of a reduction in  income, it will also permit an unsecured creditor, in the  event of an improvement in the debtor's income position at  any time during the period of the plan, to seek a  modification so that the full amount of the debtor's  disposable income remains committed to payments under the  plan.  This proposal ... seems to us to be a reasonable quid  pro quo for the benefits conferred on the debtor under  Chapter 13 which would not be available to him in a Chapter  7 case.
