At  issue in this  case are two\r                                       \r\n\ndifferent  appeals, which we  have consolidated, whose source\r\n\nis a  lawsuit over  unpaid bank  loans.   In one  appeal, the\r\n\nborrowers contest  the grant of summary judgment  in favor of\r\n\nthe  lending  bank;  in   the  other  appeal,  the  borrowers\r\n\nchallenge  the district  court's  approval of  a sale  by the\r\n\nreceiver  of borrower assets that secured the loans.  In both\r\n\ninstances, we affirm.\r\n\n     The  background facts are  largely undisputed.   Between\r\n\n1983 and 1988, Fleet National Bank (\"Fleet\") provided various\r\n\ninterrelated loans and lines  of credit to H&amp;D Entertainment,\r\n\nInc.,  and  other  associated corporations  and  partnerships\r\n\n(collectively, \"the borrowers\"); the borrowers were licensees\r\n\nor had other ownership interests in radio stations in various\r\n\ncities, and those assets  secured the loans.  In  early 1994,\r\n\nFleet  concluded  that  the  borrowers were  in  default  and\r\n\nbrought  suit in  two  different federal  district courts  to\r\n\ncollect  upon  different  notes  made or  guaranteed  by  the\r\n\nborrowers.\r\n\n     On  March 31, 1994, Fleet and the borrowers entered into\r\n\na  written settlement  agreement.   In  exchange for  Fleet's\r\n\nforbearance  on the loans and dismissal of its law suits, the\r\n\nborrowers agreed to a repayment plan based on the sale of the\r\n\nradio stations.   The  settlement agreement provided  that if\r\n\nthe borrowers failed  to comply with  the plan's terms,  this\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nfailure  would  end Fleet's  forbearance obligation  and also\r\n\nconstitute  the borrower's  consent to  the appointment  of a\r\n\nreceiver who would muster the assets and pay the debts.\r\n\n     Fleet claims  that on  November 30, 1994,  the borrowers\r\n\nmissed the  first deadline  established under the  settlement\r\n\nagreement.  As Fleet reads the agreement, the  borrowers were\r\n\nrequired by that  date either to have made  a down payment of\r\n\n$6.4  million or to  have in  force purchase  agreements with\r\n\nthird parties  obligating the latter to buy stations from the\r\n\nborrowers for that  amount or  more.   The borrowers  dispute\r\n\nthis  reading.  The precise terms of the settlement agreement\r\n\nand other pertinent facts are set forth below.\r\n\n     On December 2, 1994, Fleet brought the present action in\r\n\nthe  federal  district  court in  Massachusetts  against  the\r\n\nborrowers seeking  over $12.9 million plus  interest based on\r\n\nthe    notes   and    guarantees.   Later,    the   borrowers\r\n\ncounterclaimed.    In  the  meantime,  Fleet  moved  for  the\r\n\nappointment of Charles Giddens  as receiver for the stations.\r\n\nGiddens had an extensive background in appraising and selling\r\n\nradio stations and was  a partner in a brokerage  firm, Media\r\n\nVenture Partners,  experienced in this  field.  In  the past,\r\n\nGiddens had been appointed by courts to serve as receiver for\r\n\nradio  stations and  his firm  had acted  as broker  in their\r\n\nsale. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     The district court  designated Giddens  as receiver  and\r\n\nthereafter  approved his retention  of Media Venture Partners\r\n\nto act as broker in the sale of the stations, comprising four\r\n\nprincipal properties in Connecticut,  Illinois, Massachusetts\r\n\nand New  Jersey.  Giddens  also retained The  Zitelman Group,\r\n\nInc.,  to  prepare  monthly   financial  statements  for  the\r\n\nstations and certain tax filings.  The Zitelman Group was one\r\n\nof the few  firms known  to Giddens as  experienced in  radio\r\n\nstation  accounting  and  prepared  to  do  such  work  on  a\r\n\ntemporary basis.\r\n\n     In March  1995, Media  Venture  Partners solicited  bids\r\n\nfrom several hundred  possible purchasers, widely publicizing\r\n\nthe proposed sale.  The largest bid, offering to buy all four\r\n\nstation properties for approximately  $15.3 million, was made\r\n\nby   Spring  Broadcasting,   L.L.C.   (\"Spring\"),  which   is\r\n\nassociated in  ownership  and management  with  The  Zitelman\r\n\nGroup.  The  bid was  subject to further  examination by  the\r\n\nbidder and  further negotiations.   At Giddens'  request, The\r\n\nZitelman Group  resigned its bookkeeping tasks  in June 1995,\r\n\nso that Giddens could  freely negotiate a definitive purchase\r\n\nagreement with Spring.\r\n\n     Throughout  the  period,  the  borrowers  made  constant\r\n\nobjections to the receiver, the proposed sale, and many other\r\n\ndetails.   It appears that  the prospective sale  price being\r\n\nnegotiated would not  even cover in full the borrowers' debts\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nto  Fleet plus interest, let  alone leave any  equity for the\r\n\nborrowers.    Thus, the  borrowers  had  little incentive  to\r\n\ncooperate in the receiver sale.  Still, as the district court\r\n\npointed out, the prospective deficiency did give Fleet reason\r\n\nto obtain as much as possible for the stations.\r\n\n     During the spring of 1995, Fleet and the borrowers filed\r\n\ncross motions  for partial or complete  summary judgment, the\r\n\ncentral issue  being whether  the borrowers had  breached the\r\n\nsettlement agreement.   The  cross motions  were  heard by  a\r\n\nmagistrate  judge  in June  1995.   In  early July  1995, the\r\n\nmagistrate judge wrote  a lengthy report  and recommendation,\r\n\nconcluding  that Fleet's  motion  should be  granted and  the\r\n\nborrowers' motion should be denied.  Ultimately, the district\r\n\ncourt  approved   the  report  and  recommendations   of  the\r\n\nmagistrate  judge.   This resolution  would have  disposed of\r\n\nmost but not all of the claims on each side.\r\n\n     Giddens and Spring negotiated  a final purchase price of\r\n\njust under $14 million  during the summer of 1995,  the lower\r\n\nprice reflecting some deterioration of the stations and other\r\n\nadjustments.    The  magistrate judge  held  hearings,  heard\r\n\nobjections, and  ultimately approved Giddens' proposal  as to\r\n\nthe procedures  for completing  the  sale.   This involved  a\r\n\nsecond  round  of  bidding,  effectively  inviting others  to\r\n\nexceed  the  Spring  offer.   Information  was  furnished  to\r\n\nprospective bidders, but no such bids were made.  During this\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nperiod  the  borrowers conduct  discovery.    In October  and\r\n\nNovember  1995  the  district  court  held  hearings  on  the\r\n\nproposed sale.\r\n\n     During   the  fall,  Giddens  and  Spring  modified  the\r\n\nproposed sale in certain respects.   When the borrowers asked\r\n\nfor  a  new  round  of  competitive  bidding  because of  the\r\n\nchanges, Giddens conducted a third round of bidding ending in\r\n\nJanuary 1996.  No  better bids were made.   Further discovery\r\n\nwas allowed to the  borrowers.  In January 1996  the district\r\n\ncourt held  a further  evidentiary hearing and  then approved\r\n\nthe sale from  the bench.  In April 1996,  the district court\r\n\nissued a lengthy decision  explaining its decision to approve\r\n\nthe  sale   to  Spring.      Fleet  National   Bank  v.   H&amp;D\r                                                                         \r\n\nEntertainment, Inc., 926 F. Supp. 226 (D. Mass. 1996).\r                               \r\n\n     1.   The borrowers have now appealed both from the order\r\n\nresolving  the summary  judgment motions  and from  the order\r\n\napproving  the receiver's sale of the stations to Spring.  At\r\n\nthe  outset, the  borrowers argue  that the  summary judgment\r\n\norder is not properly  before us, because it did  not dispose\r\n\nfully of all of the claims or all of the counterclaims.1  For\r\n\nthis reason,  the district  court directed, on  approving the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1On Fleet's  claims, seven of the  eight counts involved\r\ncomputation of  damages and  at least the  interest component\r\nremained   to   be  resolved.      As   for  the   borrowers'\r\ncounterclaims, the  claims against Fleet were  fully resolved\r\nbut  two other claims  directed by the  borrowers against the\r\nreceiver were not.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nmagistrate  judge's  report and  recommendation,  \"that final\r\n\njudgment  be entered, pursuant to [Fed. R. Civ. P.] 54(b) and\r\n\n28 U.S.C.   1291.\"\r\n\n     The  borrowers  do not  argue  that  the district  court\r\n\nfailed  to make or support the finding required by Rule 54(b)\r\n\nfor a separate judgment  on less than all claims  or parties,\r\n\nnamely,  that there is \"no  just reason for  delay.\"  Rather,\r\n\nthey  simply assert that there is case law forbidding the use\r\n\nof Rule 54(b) as to any claim that has been adjudicated as to\r\n\nliability  but not damages.   E.g., Liberty Mut.  Ins. Co. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWetzel, 424 U.S. 737, 744 (1976).  This is the status of most\r                  \r\n\nof Fleet's claims against the borrowers, although Fleet says,\r\n\nciting Herzog  Contracting Corp.  v. McGowen Corp.,  976 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n1062,  1064 (7th  Cir. 1992),  that the  mere calculation  of\r\n\ninterest due is ministerial and should not impair finality as\r\n\nto those claims.\r\n\n     The borrowers' objection to their own appeal  is an ill-\r\n\nadvised  attempt to throw sand  in the wheels.   The district\r\n\ncourt's order approving the sale of the stations to Spring is\r                                                                         \r\n\nproperly before us--because by  judicial gloss, such an order\r\n\nis  treated  as a  final decision  under  28 U.S.C.,    1291,\r\n\nbecause of its importance and irrevocable character.2  And in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2SEC v.

E.g.,  Avery v.  Secretary  of Health  &amp; Human\r                                                                         \r\n\nServs., 762 F.2d 158, 161 (1st Cir. 1985); 16 Wright, Miller,\r                  \r\n\nCooper  &amp; Gressman,  Federal  Practice and  Procedure    3921\r                                                                 \r\n\n(1977).\r\n\n     Here,  the  decision  that the  borrowers  violated  the\r\n\nsettlement agreement does underpin  the sale.  The borrowers'\r\n\nviolation is the central  premise for the appointment of  the\r\n\nreceiver  and the  authorization  permitting the  receiver to\r\n\nsell  the security.   In  short, the  borrowers are  free, in\r\n\nchallenging the sale order, to  make their central claim that\r\n\nthey did not violate the settlement agreement.  This would be\r\n\nso  even if  Rule  54(b) had  never been  invoked  as to  the\r\n\nsummary  judgment order,  and  even if  the summary  judgment\r\n\norder  were not  before us  except as  a premise of  the sale\r\n\norder.  \r\n\n      Conversely, the borrowers are mistaken in thinking that\r\n\nif they successfully challenged  the Rule 54(a)  designation,\r\n\nthey could  undo or invalidate the  district court's decision\r\n\non  summary judgment.  At best, they might limit this court's\r                                                            \r\n\nreview to those aspects of the summary judgment decision that\r\n\ndirectly  underpin the order approving the sale.  But, so far\r\n\nas we can ascertain, the only attack made by the borrowers is\r                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nPractice and Procedure   3910 (2d ed. 1991 &amp; Supp. 1996).\r                                  \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\non  just  such an  aspect of  the summary  judgment decision,\r\n\nnamely, the ruling that the borrowers breached the settlement\r\n\nagreement.\r\n\n     Thus, we have jurisdiction both over the order approving\r\n\nthe sale and, incident to review of that order, over the only\r\n\nattack made  on the summary judgment  decision, regardless of\r\n\nHerzog  Contracting.   Further,  the  district court's  order\r                               \r\n\ndirected to  the summary judgment motions  is properly before\r\n\nus under Rule 54(b) at least insofar as that order completely\r\n\ndisposes of most of the borrowers' individual  counterclaims.\r\n\nSince we have plenary  jurisdiction over the summary judgment\r\n\norder at least as to those claims, we are free to review--and\r\n\naffirm--both orders against the only attack made upon them.\r\n\n       2.  We turn now to  the merits of that attack, namely,\r\n\nthe district  court's ruling that the  borrowers breached the\r\n\nsettlement agreement by failing either to make a $6.4 million\r\n\ninitial  payment by  November 30,  1994, or  alternatively to\r\n\nmake sales  agreements by that  time in a  comparable amount.\r\n\nSummary  judgment is proper if there are no genuine issues of\r\n\nmaterial fact and the law otherwise warrants judgment for the\r\n\nmoving party;  inferences and credibility are  taken in favor\r\n\nof the opposing party; and review on appeal is de  novo.

In  addition, the settlement agreement provided (in\r\n\nsection  5(e))  a  trio   of  corresponding  dates  by  which\r\n\ncontracted-for station  sales had to be completed.  Thus, the\r\n\nfirst sale--contracted for by November 30, 1994, for not less\r\n\nthan $6.4 million--had  to be consummated by March  31, 1995.\r\n\nThe  five-month lag  time  was set  to  permit the  necessary\r\n\napproval of  license transfers by the  Federal Communications\r\n\nCommission.   This provision  also required the  borrowers to\r\n\nuse  their  best  efforts  to  obtain  FCC  approval, but  it\r\n\nprovided for  reasonable extensions  of time if,  despite the\r\n\nborrowers'  diligence, FCC  approval were delayed  past March\r\n\n31,   1995   (or  comparable   dates   for   the  other   two\r\n\ninstallments).\r\n\n     In this  court, both  sides agree that  by November  30,\r\n\n1994,  the borrowers  had paid  only $1,050,000  toward their\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ndebt.  But, on summary judgment, the borrowers said that they\r\n\nsatisfied the  alternative  obligation under  section  5(a)--\r                                      \r\n\nquoted above--by entering into  an agreement to sell stations\r\n\nfor  enough money to generate the balance of the $6.4 million\r\n\nfirst payment.   The facts  as to what  happened are  largely\r\n\nundisputed;  the disagreement before us turns  on an issue of\r\n\ncontract interpretation.\r\n\n     On  June 23, 1994, well in advance of November 30, 1994,\r\n\ndeadline,  the  borrowers  contracted  to  sell  two  of  the\r\n\nstations to a  third party for  amounts that, taken  together\r\n\nwith the prior  $1 million payment, would have  satisfied the\r\n\nNovember 30, 1994, obligation.  This June 1994 sales contract\r\n\nconditioned  the  buyer's  obligation  on one  of  the  radio\r\n\nstations attaining a listenership ranking of number 1 or 2 in\r\n\nthe demographic  category of adults age  25-54, as determined\r\n\nby the  Arbitron  ratings  service.   In  July  1994,  before\r\n\nconsummation,  new Arbitron  ratings  placed the  station  in\r\n\nseventh place  and, in  September 1994, the  buyer terminated\r\n\nthe sales contract.\r\n\n     On  summary  judgment  and  on  appeal,  the  borrowers'\r\n\ncentral position has been that they complied with the literal\r\n\nterms of the  settlement agreement because,  in the words  of\r\n\nsection 5(a)  quoted above, they \"entered  into\" the required\r\n\n\"binding\" and  \"fully effective\" contract \"[o]n  or prior to\"\r\n\nNovember  30, 1994.  The borrowers say  that it is no part of\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\ntheir  problem  that their  June  1994 contract  to  sell the\r\n\nstations  lapsed well before  November 30, 1994,  and that no\r\n\nsuch sales contract was in effect  on that date.  We join the\r\n\nmagistrate  judge and  the  district court  in rejecting  the\r\n\nborrowers' reading of the settlement agreement.\r\n\n     By its own terms, the settlement agreement is to be read\r\n\nin accordance with Massachusetts  law.  Under the precedents,\r\n\nably  parsed by the magistrate judge in his report adopted by\r\n\nthe district court, a  contract governed by Massachusetts law\r\n\nmust be construed  in accord  with common  sense, the  likely\r\n\nintent of  the  parties  and  (in  commercial  cases)  \"as  a\r\n\nbusiness transaction  entered into  by practical [people]  to\r\n\naccomplish an  honest and  straightforward end.\"   Shapiro v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGrinspoon, 541 N.E.2d  359, 363  (Mass. App. Ct.  1989).   In\r                     \r\n\nshort, words matter; but the words are to be read as elements\r\n\nin a  practical  working  document and  not  as  a  crossword\r\n\npuzzle. \r\n\n     In all  likelihood, the phrase \"fully  effective\" in the\r\n\nsettlement agreement  refers to  the satisfaction of  certain\r\n\nconditions  precedent specified  in the  settlement agreement\r\n\nitself (e.g.,  the borrowers' filing of  FCC applications for\r                        \r\n\nlicense  transfer within  20 days).   The  magistrate judge--\r\n\nwhose  report the district  court adopted--reasoned  that the\r\n\nterm  \"binding,\"  to avoid  superfluity,  should  be read  to\r\n\nexclude  \"contingent purchase obligations which lapsed before\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\never ripening into absolute  ones.\"  Thus, he  concluded that\r\n\neven on  the most  literal reading, the  borrowers failed  to\r\n\nmeet the requirement.\r\n\n     In  our view, it is uncertain whether the parties to the\r\n\nsettlement agreement entertained any  very precise notion  of\r\n\nthe  meaning  of  \"binding.\"    The  term  is   often  used--\r\n\nredundantly  in most  contexts--to mean  legally enforceable,\r\n\nBlack's  Law Dictionary  168-69 (6th  ed. 1990),  and lawyers\r                                   \r\n\ntypically overwrite  documents in this fashion.   Further, at\r\n\nleast  one  condition subsequent--that  of  FCC approval--was\r\n\nlikely  to remain unresolved until after November 30.  But we\r\n\nthink that even  if the  term \"binding\" is  given no  special\r\n\nmeaning,  the result  is the same  based upon  a common-sense\r\n\nappraisal, elsewhere stressed by the magistrate judge.\r\n\n     A self-evident  aim of  the settlement agreement  was to\r\n\nmake certain, by  November 30, 1994,  that future payment  to\r\n\nFleet of  the $6.4  million was reasonably  assured, assuming\r\n\nthat  actual payment had not  already occurred.   By law, the\r\n\nintended  assurance would  still be  subject to  the specific\r\n\ncondition of FCC  approval of the license transfers;  and, of\r\n\ncourse, bankruptcy  of the buyer or  other intervening events\r\n\nmight  otherwise have  frustrated  the  sale.   But  a  sales\r\n\ncontract  that lapsed by its  own terms prior  to November 30\r\n\nsimply  does  not  satisfy  the obvious  basic  objective  of\r\n\nproviding reasonable assurance to Fleet.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\n     To adopt this view does not require that we suppose that\r\n\nthe  parties had  an exact  and identical  view of  how every\r\n\ncontingency  or  condition  might  satisfy  or  violate   the\r\n\nsettlement agreement.   It is enough  that reasonable parties\r\n\nwould not have believed  that this settlement agreement would\r\n\nbe  satisfied where the seller and buyer built into the sales\r\n\ncontract a significant condition subsequent that defeated the\r\n\nobligation  to buy  and led  to the  lapsing of  the contract\r\n\nprior to  November 30.  See  generally  Cooke v.  Lynn Sand &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nStone  Co., 70  F.3d  201, 204-05  (1st  Cir. 1995).    Other\r                      \r\n\nvariations might present more difficulties.\r\n\n     The  borrowers have  a fall-back  position.   They argue\r\n\nthat the settlement agreement is at worst ambiguous and that,\r\n\ngiven  the ambiguity, they are entitled to a trial to present\r\n\nevidence.   Further,  they  point to  the  affidavit of  Joel\r\n\nHartstone,  a  leading  figure   in  the  management  of  the\r\n\nborrowers, that  in the course of  negotiating the settlement\r\n\nagreement, \r\n\n     [T]here  were  specific  discussions regarding  the\r\n     understanding that, if the Borrower Group fulfilled\r\n     its good faith efforts obligations by entering into\r\n     purchase   and  sale   agreements,  and   if  those\r\n     agreements  then  terminated,  the  Borrower  Group\r\n     still  would  have  until  the   principal  payment\r\n     deadline  to  consummate   a  transaction  with   a\r\n     substitute purchaser.\r\n\n     Hartstone's gloss  is highly unlikely as  a statement of\r\n\nthe  parties' actual  intent in  section  5(a) but  not quite\r\n\nimpossible.  It is highly unlikely because it is so serious a\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\ndeparture  from the  words  and structure  of the  settlement\r\n\nagreement.    Nothing  in  section  5(a)  suggests  that  the\r\n\ncontract signing was merely a \"good faith efforts\" hurdle; if\r\n\nthat was the intention, it could easily have been  expressed.\r\n\nFurther, there  is a lucid  \"best efforts\" clause  in section\r\n\n5(e), pertaining to the borrowers' duty to seek FCC approval,\r\n\nbut none in section 5(a).\r\n\n     Still, this would be a more difficult case if there were\r\n\nsolid  extrinsic proof--that is,  evidence independent of the\r\n\nwords of the settlement agreement--that the parties  mutually\r\n\nintended  section  5(a)  to   have  the  meaning  claimed  by\r\n\nHartstone.   The contract could rationally  have been drafted\r\n\nas  Hartstone urges,  and sometimes  parties fail  to express\r\n\nthemselves clearly in  their drafting.  This  looks, at first\r\n\nglance, like a classic problem as to when  extrinsic evidence\r\n\nmay be offered to assist in contract interpretation, an issue\r\n\nlargely governed by the parol evidence rule.\r\n\n     Somewhat  simplified,  the  traditional version  of  the\r\n\nparol evidence rule  is that a  contract provision is  either\r\n\nclear  or ambiguous and  that, in the  former case, extrinsic\r\n\nevidence of  negotiations is prohibited (if  the contract was\r\n\nintended to be a complete integration).  The modern approach,\r\n\nembodied in  the  Restatement (Second)  of Contracts  (1981),\r                                                                \r\n\nallows  extrinsic evidence  to  \"interpret\" even  a seemingly\r\n\nunambiguous  contract,  but not  to  vary  or contradict  its\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nterms.

Thus, if the Hartstone affidavit were\r\n\nsufficient,  it  would  pose  nice questions  as  to  whether\r\n\nMassachusetts law  requires  an ambiguity  before  permitting\r\n\nextrinsic  evidence,  (if  so)   whether  the  agreement   is\r\n\nambiguous  on the point at issue, and (above all) whether the\r\n\nHartstone  gloss   can  be   said  to   explain--rather  than\r\n\ncontradict--the terms  of the agreement.   A factfinder might\r\n\nalso  have to decide  whether Hartstone's affidavit correctly\r\n\nand fully described what was said at the negotiations.\r\n\n     But Hartstone's  affidavit is not sufficient  to raise a\r\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.   The affidavit contains only\r\n\nthe conclusory assertion that  in the negotiations there were\r\n\n\"specific    discussions\"     adopting    his    best-efforts\r\n\ninterpretation.   No  dates, names  or actual  statements are\r\n\nsupplied;   not  a   single  \"specific\"   is  set   forth  to\r\n\ndemonstrate, or  even illustrate, the content  of the alleged\r\n\n\"specific  discussions.\"     There is  only some  lawyer-like\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nargument in a further  paragraph as to why  Hartstone's \"best\r\n\nefforts\"  gloss  conformed  to   the  general  tenor  of  the\r\n\nagreement.          \r\n\n     Thus,  the quoted  passage in Hartstone's  affidavit did\r\n\nnot create a genuine issue of fact as to what happened at the\r\n\nnegotiations.   Nor  did  it supply  specific facts  that, if\r\n\nuncontested,  might have  affected the  district court's  own\r\n\nreading  of  the  settlement   agreement.    Cf.

The  remaining issue is  whether the district  court\r\n\nerred  in  approving the  receiver's  agreement  to sell  the\r\n\nstations to Spring.   The district court has wide  discretion\r\n\nin judging whether  a receiver's  sale is fair  in terms  and\r\n\nresult  and serves the best  interests of the  estate.  E.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States v. Peters, 777  F.2d 1294, 1298  n.6 (7th Cir.\r                                    \r\n\n1985).  On  review, an abuse  of discretion standard  governs\r\n\nsuch judgments,  although  subsidiary findings  of  fact  are\r\n\nreviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and  propositions\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nof law are subject to de novo review.

The first attack,  and the one  most vigorously\r\n\nargued, arises  from the  fact that the  winning bidder-buyer\r\n\n(Spring)  was  closely  associated   with  the  company  (The\r\n\nZitelman  Group)  that until  June  1994  performed specified\r\n\naccounting  services for the  seller-receiver (Giddens).  For\r\n\npresent purposes, we omit the details  of the association and\r\n\n(arguendo) treat the case as if Spring and The Zitelman Group\r                     \r\n\nwere one entity.\r\n\n     Exceptions  aside, a  full-fledged  fiduciary,  such  as\r\n\ntrustees or a court-appointed  receiver like Giddens, may not\r\n\nnormally sell  estate property to  himself even if  the terms\r\n\nare fair.

The central  reason is\r\n\nobvious: despite  the safeguard of court  oversight, the main\r\n\nassurance  that the estate will  be maximized is  the zeal of\r\n\nthe seller to secure the best price, and that  zeal is likely\r\n\nto be  tempered if the seller is selling to himself.

While the label is not an\r\n\nexact  term, see SEC v.  Chenery, 318 U.S.  80, 85-86 (1943);\r                                            \r\n\nRestatement  (Second) Torts   874 comment  a (1979), we agree\r                                       \r\n\nwith the  district court  that the specific  accounting tasks\r\n\nallotted to  The Zitelman Group were  narrow, mechanical, and\r\n\nunrelated to the sale.  The district court's findings to this\r\n\neffect,  926 F. Supp. at 242-43, have not been impeached.  If\r\n\nThe  Zitelman  Group  had  been  engaged  as  the  receiver's\r\n\nfinancial advisor on the sale, our view might be different.\r\n\n     In the alternative, the  borrowers urge that the general\r\n\nban on trustee buying trust property ought to extend with the\r\n\nsame  force to  anyone  who is  employed  or engaged  by  the\r                                  \r\n\nfiduciary, as The Zitelman Group was in performing accounting\r\n\nservices.    This  is  an arguable  position  (we  ignore the\r\n\npossible significance of the June resignation), and there are\r\n\na few cases  that purport  to support such  a general ban  on\r\n\nthose  who assist a fiduciary.   E.g., Donovan  &amp; Schuenke v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSampsell, 226  F.2d 804,  811 (9th  Cir.), cert.  denied, 350\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 895 (1955); In re Q.P.S., Inc., 99 B.R. 843, 845 (Bankr.\r                                               \r\n\nW.D.

See Bogert, supra,   543, at 227-28.\r                                                      \r\n\nBut where the purchaser  is merely hired by the  fiduciary to\r\n\nperform a discrete and narrow function unrelated to the sale,\r\n\nthe fiduciary's guardian role is  not automatically impaired.\r\n\nOn  the  contrary,  the  fiduciary should  still  have  every\r\n\nincentive  to refuse to  sell unless the  purchaser is making\r\n\nthe most  attractive available offer.   Thus, there  is often\r\n\nlittle risk that the estate will be disserved by allowing the\r\n\nbid.\r\n\n     The general  rule, by  disqualifying the fiduciary  as a\r\n\nbidder, might in some rare case foreclose the highest bidder,\r\n\nbut only  one such bidder  is lost.   If  courts extend  that\r\n\ncircle  of  automatic   disqualification,  the  risk  becomes\r\n\ngreater of  harming the  estate by  limiting those who  might\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n\noffer  the highest  price.   This is  especially so  in cases\r\n\nwhere the universe of  serious buyers is likely to  be small,\r\n\nas may well be the case here.  And, of course, even without a\r\n\nrigid rule  disqualification, an  objecting party is  free to\r\n\nargue on particular facts against  a proposed sale to someone\r\n\nemployed by the fiduciary.\r\n\n     Here, the  borrowers do argue that  The Zitelman Group's\r\n\naccess to inside information did give Spring  an advantage in\r\n\nframing  its bid.   If Spring  had thereby  bid less  than it\r\n\notherwise would  have, interesting problems  of remedy  might\r\n\narise--for  it still might not  help the estate  to throw out\r\n\nthe highest  bid made to  it.   In all  events, the  district\r\n\ncourt specifically  found that  the information  available to\r\n\nThe Zitelman Group was  not \"confidential information or even\r\n\nraw financial data,\" 926 F. Supp. at 243, and was effectively\r\n\navailable to other bidders.  Id. at 233 n.22.\r                                            \r\n\n     On appeal, the borrowers make no effort to show that the\r\n\nmonthly  financial   statements  or  any   other  information\r\n\navailable  to  The  Zitelman  Group gave  Spring  any  unique\r\n\nadvantage  over the information available to all bidders.  On\r\n\nthe contrary, the prospective bidders were supplied with more\r\n\ndetailed  and  pertinent information  than  the  limited data\r\n\navailable to The Zitelman Group for accounting purposes.  926\r\n\nF. Supp. at  233 &amp; n.23.   The borrowers'  brief  gives us no\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                         -22-\r\r\n\nreason even to suspect error on this finding, let alone clear\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n     We  turn now  to a  quite different  attack made  by the\r\n\nborrowers  on  the  sale.    The  borrowers  assert  that the\r\n\nreceiver or his associated  brokerage company, Media  Venture\r\n\nPartners,  accepted a \"bribe\" from Spring  by agreeing to act\r\n\nas Spring's  broker  to  buy another  radio  station  in  the\r\n\nAtlantic City area.  Apparently, in April  1995, at virtually\r\n\nthe  same time that Spring  submitted the winning  bid in the\r\n\nfirst  round,   Spring  offered  Media   Venture  Partners  a\r\n\ncommission  to secure  Spring a  second  station in  the same\r\n\ncity.\r\n\n     To describe this offer  as a proven bribe is  a dramatic\r\n\noverstatement.   Zitelman  (who  headed  The Zitelman  Group)\r\n\nhimself testified at a hearing that the offer of a commission\r\n\nto Spring to procure a second station in Atlantic City was an\r\n\narm's length  agreement unrelated (except  by Spring's desire\r\n\nfor  a duopoly)  to  the receiver's  sale  of the  borrowers'\r\n\nstations.  The  district court did  not discuss the  episode,\r\n\nperhaps because the borrowers  developed very little evidence\r\n\nabout it in the district court.  The borrowers apparently did\r\n\nnot even cross-examine Zitelman on this issue.\r\n\n     In this court, the  borrowers simply repeat their charge\r\n\nthat the  commission was  a bribe.   If it  were, the  matter\r\n\nwould be very  serious.   But the borrowers  have adduced  no\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                         -23-\r\r\n\nevidence  that  the commission  was intended  by Spring  as a\r\n\nbribe,  regarded by Giddens or Media Venture Partners in that\r\n\nlight,  or  that  it  had  any effect  on  the  sale  of  the\r\n\nborrowers' station.  Out  of an abundance of caution  we have\r\n\nread what can be found  in the record on the subject,  and it\r\n\ndoes not alter our conclusion.\r\n\n     The borrowers might have  argued that, as a prophylactic\r\n\nmatter, a receiver who is  selling property should be  barred\r\n\nfrom any other dealing with the buyer in the same time frame.\r\n\nA federal judge,  for example,  could not  normally accept  a\r\n\ngift from  a lawyer litigating a  case before that judge.   5\r\n\nU.S.C.   7353(a)(1) (1994); Code of Conduct for United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nJudges Canon  5(4).  But the borrowers have made no effort to\r                  \r\n\noffer  citations or  arguments for  such a  prophylactic rule\r\n\nhere;  and it is certainly  not self-evident that  so broad a\r\n\nrule would  make sense  in the  context of ordinary  business\r\n\ntransactions.\r\n\n     Finally, the  borrowers offer a motley  of other attacks\r\n\non  the  sale.   These include    charges that  Media Venture\r\n\nPartners  helped Spring in \"crafting\" its bid by providing it\r\n\nhelp  not  afforded  to  other  bidders;  that  the  receiver\r\n\nconcealed information from the court regarding bids submitted\r\n\nby  other bidders;  that  adjustments in  the sales  contract\r\n\nbetween the  receiver and  Spring were unwarranted;  that the\r\n\nsecond and third rounds  of bidding were too hasty;  and that\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                         -24-\r\r\n\nthe  sale price ultimately fixed for the stations was too low\r\n\nin light of earlier appraisals.\r\n\n     These objections  are answered in  the district  court's\r\n\nlengthy opinion  approving the sale.  The  objections turn on\r\n\nthe  specific  facts  and  the district  court's  opinion  is\r\n\nreported.  In each  case, we think that the  district court's\r\n\ndiscussion  is sufficient and that no error occurred.  In our\r\n\nview, the district court and the magistrate judge have done a\r\n\nvery able job in handling this complex and contentious case.\r\n\n     Affirmed.    \r                          \r\n\n                             -25-\r                                         -25-\r\r\n",

In one appeal, the borrowers contest the grant of summary judgment in favor of the lending bank;  in the other appeal, the borrowers challenge the district court's approval of a sale by the receiver of borrower assets that secured the loans.  In both instances, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are largely undisputed.  Between 1983 and 1988, Fleet National Bank (\"Fleet\") provided various interrelated loans and lines of credit to H&amp;D Entertainment, Inc., and other associated corporations and partnerships (collectively, \"the borrowers\");  the borrowers were licensees or had other ownership interests in radio stations in various cities, and those assets secured the loans.  In early 1994, Fleet concluded that the borrowers were in default and brought suit in two different federal district courts to collect upon different notes made or guaranteed by the borrowers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 1994, Fleet and the borrowers entered into a written settlement agreement.  In exchange for Fleet's forbearance on the loans and dismissal of its law suits, the borrowers agreed to a repayment plan based on the sale of the radio stations.  The settlement agreement provided that if the borrowers failed to comply with the plan's terms, this failure would end Fleet's forbearance obligation and also constitute the borrower's consent to the appointment of a receiver who would muster the assets and pay the debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fleet claims that on November 30, 1994, the borrowers missed the first deadline established under the settlement agreement.  As Fleet reads the agreement, the borrowers were required by that date either to have made a down payment of $6.4 million or to have in force purchase agreements with third parties obligating the latter to buy stations from the borrowers for that amount or more.  The borrowers dispute this reading.  The precise terms of the settlement agreement and other pertinent facts are set forth below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 1994, Fleet brought the present action in the federal district court in Massachusetts against the borrowers seeking over $12.9 million plus interest based on the notes and guarantees.  Later, the borrowers counterclaimed.  In the meantime, Fleet moved for the appointment of Charles Giddens as receiver for the stations.  Giddens had an extensive background in appraising and selling radio stations and was a partner in a brokerage firm, Media Venture Partners, experienced in this field.  In the past, Giddens had been appointed by courts to serve as receiver for radio stations and his firm had acted as broker in their sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court designated Giddens as receiver and thereafter approved his retention of Media Venture Partners to act as broker in the sale of the stations, comprising four principal properties in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey.  Giddens also retained The Zitelman Group, Inc., to prepare monthly financial statements for the stations and certain tax filings.  The Zitelman Group was one of the few firms known to Giddens as experienced in radio station accounting and prepared to do such work on a temporary basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1995, Media Venture Partners solicited bids from several hundred possible purchasers, widely publicizing the proposed sale.  The largest bid, offering to buy all four station properties for approximately $15.3 million, was made by Spring Broadcasting, L.L.C.  (\"Spring\"), which is associated in ownership and management with The Zitelman Group.  The bid was subject to further examination by the bidder and further negotiations.  At Giddens' request, The Zitelman Group resigned its bookkeeping tasks in June 1995, so that Giddens could freely negotiate a definitive purchase agreement with Spring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the period, the borrowers made constant objections to the receiver, the proposed sale, and many other details.  It appears that the prospective sale price being negotiated would not even cover in full the borrowers' debts to Fleet plus interest, let alone leave any equity for the borrowers.  Thus, the borrowers had little incentive to cooperate in the receiver sale.  Still, as the district court pointed out, the prospective deficiency did give Fleet reason to obtain as much as possible for the stations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the spring of 1995, Fleet and the borrowers filed cross motions for partial or complete summary judgment, the central issue being whether the borrowers had breached the settlement agreement.  The cross motions were heard by a magistrate judge in June 1995.  In early July 1995, the magistrate judge wrote a lengthy report and recommendation, concluding that Fleet's motion should be granted and the borrowers' motion should be denied.  Ultimately, the district court approved the report and recommendations of the magistrate judge.  This resolution would have disposed of most but not all of the claims on each side.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giddens and Spring negotiated a final purchase price of just under $14 million during the summer of 1995, the lower price reflecting some deterioration of the stations and other adjustments.  The magistrate judge held hearings, heard objections, and ultimately approved Giddens' proposal as to the procedures for completing the sale.  This involved a second round of bidding, effectively inviting others to exceed the Spring offer.  Information was furnished to prospective bidders, but no such bids were made.  During this period the borrowers conducted discovery.  In October and November 1995 the district court held hearings on the proposed sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the fall, Giddens and Spring modified the proposed sale in certain respects.  When the borrowers asked for a new round of competitive bidding because of the changes, Giddens conducted a third round of bidding ending in January 1996.  No better bids were made.  Further discovery was allowed to the borrowers.  In January 1996 the district court held a further evidentiary hearing and then approved the sale from the bench.  In April 1996, the district court issued a lengthy decision explaining its decision to approve the sale to Spring.  Fleet National Bank v. H&amp;D Entertainment, Inc., 926 F.Supp. 226 (D.Mass.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The borrowers have now appealed both from the order resolving the summary judgment motions and from the order approving the receiver's sale of the stations to Spring.  At the outset, the borrowers argue that the summary judgment order is not properly before us, because it did not dispose fully of all of the claims or all of the counterclaims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For this reason, the district court directed, on approving the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, \"that final judgment be entered, pursuant to [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 54(b) and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers do not argue that the district court failed to make or support the finding required by Rule 54(b) for a separate judgment on less than all claims or parties, namely, that there is \"no just reason for delay.\"   Rather, they simply assert that there is case law forbidding the use of Rule 54(b) as to any claim that has been adjudicated as to liability but not damages.  E.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U.S. 737, 744, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 1206, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976).  This is the status of most of Fleet's claims against the borrowers, although Fleet says, citing Herzog Contracting Corp. v. McGowen Corp., 976 F.2d 1062, 1064 (7th Cir.1992), that the mere calculation of interest due is ministerial and should not impair finality as to those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers' objection to their own appeal is an ill-advised attempt to throw sand in the wheels.  The district court's order approving the sale of the stations to Spring is properly before us--because by judicial gloss, such an order is treated as a final decision under 28 U.S.C., &#167; 1291, because of its importance and irrevocable character.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  And in reviewing the sale order, the borrowers are free to challenge any other ruling of the district court that underpins the sale order.  E.g., Avery v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 762 F.2d 158, 161 (1st Cir.1985);  16 Wright, Miller, Cooper &amp; Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3921 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the decision that the borrowers violated the settlement agreement does underpin the sale.  The borrowers' violation is the central premise for the appointment of the receiver and the authorization permitting the receiver to sell the security.  In short, the borrowers are free, in challenging the sale order, to make their central claim that they did not violate the settlement agreement.  This would be so even if Rule 54(b) had never been invoked as to the summary judgment order, and even if the summary judgment order were not before us except as a premise of the sale order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, the borrowers are mistaken in thinking that if they successfully challenged the Rule 54(a) designation, they could undo or invalidate the district court's decision on summary judgment.  At best, they might limit this court's review to those aspects of the summary judgment decision that directly underpin the order approving the sale.  But, so far as we can ascertain, the only attack made by the borrowers is on just such an aspect of the summary judgment decision, namely, the ruling that the borrowers breached the settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we have jurisdiction both over the order approving the sale and, incident to review of that order, over the only attack made on the summary judgment decision, regardless of Herzog Contracting.   Further, the district court's order directed to the summary judgment motions is properly before us under Rule 54(b) at least insofar as that order completely disposes of most of the borrowers' individual counterclaims.  Since we have plenary jurisdiction over the summary judgment order at least as to those claims, we are free to review--and affirm--both orders against the only attack made upon them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. We turn now to the merits of that attack, namely, the district court's ruling that the borrowers breached the settlement agreement by failing either to make a $6.4 million initial payment by November 30, 1994, or alternatively to make sales agreements by that time in a comparable amount.  Summary judgment is proper if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the law otherwise warrants judgment for the moving party;  inferences and credibility are taken in favor of the opposing party;  and review on appeal is de novo.  Roy v. Inhabitants of the City of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691, 694 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement agreement (in section 5(a)) required the borrowers either to have paid Fleet $6.4 million by November 30, 1994--which did not occur--or to meet an alternative condition stated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>On or prior to November 30, 1994, members of the Borrower Group shall have ... entered into binding [purchase and sale] agreements ... which shall have become fully effective as contemplated below, providing for the sale, to one or more purchasers, of two or more Station Combinations providing for aggregate Net Sales Proceeds of not less that $6,400,000....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later dates were provided by which two further specified payments (or sales contracts in like amounts) were to be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the settlement agreement provided (in section 5(e)) a trio of corresponding dates by which contracted-for station sales had to be completed.  Thus, the first sale--contracted for by November 30, 1994, for not less than $6.4 million--had to be consummated by March 31, 1995.  The five-month lag time was set to permit the necessary approval of license transfers by the Federal Communications Commission.  This provision also required the borrowers to use their best efforts to obtain FCC approval, but it provided for reasonable extensions of time if, despite the borrowers' diligence, FCC approval were delayed past March 31, 1995 (or comparable dates for the other two installments).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, both sides agree that by November 30, 1994, the borrowers had paid only $1,050,000 toward their debt.  But, on summary judgment, the borrowers said that they satisfied the alternative obligation under section 5(a)--quoted above--by entering into an agreement to sell stations for enough money to generate the balance of the $6.4 million first payment.  The facts as to what happened are largely undisputed;  the disagreement before us turns on an issue of contract interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1994, well in advance of November 30, 1994, deadline, the borrowers contracted to sell two of the stations to a third party for amounts that, taken together with the prior $1 million payment, would have satisfied the November 30, 1994, obligation.  This June 1994 sales contract conditioned the buyer's obligation on one of the radio stations attaining a listenership ranking of number 1 or 2 in the demographic category of adults age 25-54, as determined by the Arbitron ratings service.  In July 1994, before consummation, new Arbitron ratings placed the station in seventh place and, in September 1994, the buyer terminated the sales contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment and on appeal, the borrowers' central position has been that they complied with the literal terms of the settlement agreement because, in the words of section 5(a) quoted above, they \"entered into\" the required \"binding\" and \"fully effective\" contract \"[o]n or prior to\" November 30, 1994.  The borrowers say that it is no part of their problem that their June 1994 contract to sell the stations lapsed well before November 30, 1994, and that no such sales contract was in effect on that date.  We join the magistrate judge and the district court in rejecting the borrowers' reading of the settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own terms, the settlement agreement is to be read in accordance with Massachusetts law.  Under the precedents, ably parsed by the magistrate judge in his report adopted by the district court, a contract governed by Massachusetts law must be construed in accord with common sense, the likely intent of the parties and (in commercial cases) \"as a business transaction entered into by practical [people] to accomplish an honest and straightforward end.\"  Shapiro v. Grinspoon, 27 Mass.App.Ct. 596, 541 N.E.2d 359, 363 (1989).  In short, words matter;  but the words are to be read as elements in a practical working document and not as a crossword puzzle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all likelihood, the phrase \"fully effective\" in the settlement agreement refers to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the settlement agreement itself (e.g., the borrowers' filing of FCC applications for license transfer within 20 days).  The magistrate judge--whose report the district court adopted--reasoned that the term \"binding,\" to avoid superfluity, should be read to exclude \"contingent purchase obligations which lapsed before ever ripening into absolute ones.\"   Thus, he concluded that even on the most literal reading, the borrowers failed to meet the requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, it is uncertain whether the parties to the settlement agreement entertained any very precise notion of the meaning of \"binding.\"   The term is often used--redundantly in most contexts--to mean legally enforceable, Black's Law Dictionary 168-69 (6th ed.1990), and lawyers typically overwrite documents in this fashion.  Further, at least one condition subsequent--that of FCC approval--was likely to remain unresolved until after November 30.  But we think that even if the term \"binding\" is given no special meaning, the result is the same based upon a common-sense appraisal, elsewhere stressed by the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A self-evident aim of the settlement agreement was to make certain, by November 30, 1994, that future payment to Fleet of the $6.4 million was reasonably assured, assuming that actual payment had not already occurred.  By law, the intended assurance would still be subject to the specific condition of FCC approval of the license transfers;  and, of course, bankruptcy of the buyer or other intervening events might otherwise have frustrated the sale.  But a sales contract that lapsed by its own terms prior to November 30 simply does not satisfy the obvious basic objective of providing reasonable assurance to Fleet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To adopt this view does not require that we suppose that the parties had an exact and identical view of how every contingency or condition might satisfy or violate the settlement agreement.  It is enough that reasonable parties would not have believed that this settlement agreement would be satisfied where the seller and buyer built into the sales contract a significant condition subsequent that defeated the obligation to buy and led to the lapsing of the contract prior to November 30.  See generally Cooke v. Lynn Sand &amp; Stone Co., 70 F.3d 201, 204-05 (1st Cir.1995).  Other variations might present more difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers have a fall-back position.  They argue that the settlement agreement is at worst ambiguous and that, given the ambiguity, they are entitled to a trial to present evidence.  Further, they point to the affidavit of Joel Hartstone, a leading figure in the management of the borrowers, that in the course of negotiating the settlement agreement,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>[T]here were specific discussions regarding the understanding that, if the Borrower Group fulfilled its good faith efforts obligations by entering into purchase and sale agreements, and if those agreements then terminated, the Borrower Group still would have until the principal payment deadline to consummate a transaction with a substitute purchaser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartstone's gloss is highly unlikely as a statement of the parties' actual intent in section 5(a) but not quite impossible.  It is highly unlikely because it is so serious a departure from the words and structure of the settlement agreement.  Nothing in section 5(a) suggests that the contract signing was merely a \"good faith efforts\" hurdle;  if that was the intention, it could easily have been expressed.  Further, there is a lucid \"best efforts\" clause in section 5(e), pertaining to the borrowers' duty to seek FCC approval, but none in section 5(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, this would be a more difficult case if there were solid extrinsic proof--that is, evidence independent of the words of the settlement agreement--that the parties mutually intended section 5(a) to have the meaning claimed by Hartstone.  The contract could rationally have been drafted as Hartstone urges, and sometimes parties fail to express themselves clearly in their drafting.  This looks, at first glance, like a classic problem as to when extrinsic evidence may be offered to assist in contract interpretation, an issue largely governed by the parol evidence rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Somewhat simplified, the traditional version of the parol evidence rule is that a contract provision is either clear or ambiguous and that, in the former case, extrinsic evidence of negotiations is prohibited (if the contract was intended to be a complete integration).  The modern approach, embodied in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1981), allows extrinsic evidence to \"interpret\" even a seemingly unambiguous contract, but not to vary or contradict its terms.  Id. &#167; 212(1) and comment b, and &#167; 214(c) (1981).  See Farnsworth, Contracts &#167; 7.12 (1990).  Massachusetts courts may tend toward the older view but not unequivocally so.  Compare ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp., 926 F.2d 1258, 1261-62 (1st Cir.1991), with Robert Indus. Inc. v. Spence, 362 Mass. 751, 291 N.E.2d 407 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the elaborate settlement agreement was plainly intended as a complete integration and contains a clause to this effect.  Thus, if the Hartstone affidavit were sufficient, it would pose nice questions as to whether Massachusetts law requires an ambiguity before permitting extrinsic evidence, (if so) whether the agreement is ambiguous on the point at issue, and (above all) whether the Hartstone gloss can be said to explain--rather than contradict--the terms of the agreement.  A factfinder might also have to decide whether Hartstone's affidavit correctly and fully described what was said at the negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Hartstone's affidavit is not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.  The affidavit contains only the conclusory assertion that in the negotiations there were \"specific discussions\" adopting his best-efforts interpretation.  No dates, names or actual statements are supplied;  not a single \"specific\" is set forth to demonstrate, or even illustrate, the content of the alleged \"specific discussions.\"   There is only some lawyer-like argument in a further paragraph as to why Hartstone's \"best efforts\" gloss conformed to the general tenor of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the quoted passage in Hartstone's affidavit did not create a genuine issue of fact as to what happened at the negotiations.  Nor did it supply specific facts that, if uncontested, might have affected the district court's own reading of the settlement agreement.  Cf. Lumpkin v. Envirodyne Indus., Inc., 933 F.2d 449, 456 (7th Cir.1991) (court may construe document if facts undisputed).  It is just the kind of conclusory affidavit statement that is regularly disregarded by courts.  Wynne v. Tufts Univ.  Sch. of Medicine, 932 F.2d 19, 27-28 (1st Cir.1991);  Posadas de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Radin, 856 F.2d 399, 401-02 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The remaining issue is whether the district court erred in approving the receiver's agreement to sell the stations to Spring.  The district court has wide discretion in judging whether a receiver's sale is fair in terms and result and serves the best interests of the estate.  E.g., United States v. Peters, 777 F.2d 1294, 1298 n. 6 (7th Cir.1985).  On review, an abuse of discretion standard governs such judgments, although subsidiary findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and propositions of law are subject to de novo review.  Pye v. Teamsters Local Union No. 122, 61 F.3d 1013, 1018 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the borrowers make almost a dozen different attacks on the sale, but only a few require discussion.  The first attack, and the one most vigorously argued, arises from the fact that the winning bidder-buyer (Spring) was closely associated with the company (The Zitelman Group) that until June 1994 performed specified accounting services for the seller-receiver (Giddens).  For present purposes, we omit the details of the association and (arguendo ) treat the case as if Spring and The Zitelman Group were one entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exceptions aside, a full-fledged fiduciary, such as trustee or a court-appointed receiver like Giddens, may not normally sell estate property to himself even if the terms are fair.  Restatement (Second) of Trusts &#167; 170 comment b (1959);  Bogert, The Law of Trusts and Trustees &#167; 543, at 248 (rev.2d ed.1993);  Scott &amp; Fratcher, The Law of Trusts &#167; 170.1 (4th ed.1987);  see, e.g., Attorney General v. Flynn, 331 Mass. 413, 120 N.E.2d 296, 302 (1954).  The central reason is obvious:  despite the safeguard of court oversight, the main assurance that the estate will be maximized is the zeal of the seller to secure the best price, and that zeal is likely to be tempered if the seller is selling to himself.  Bogert, supra.   The benefits of the general ban outweigh the risk that, in an individual case, the receiver might otherwise be the highest bidder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers in this case urge that The Zitelman Group ought to be viewed as a fiduciary.  While the label is not an exact term, see SEC v. Chenery, 318 U.S. 80, 85-86, 63 S.Ct. 454, 458-59, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943);  Restatement (Second) Torts &#167; 874 comment a (1979), we agree with the district court that the specific accounting tasks allotted to The Zitelman Group were narrow, mechanical, and unrelated to the sale.  The district court's findings to this effect, 926 F.Supp. at 242-43, have not been impeached.  If The Zitelman Group had been engaged as the receiver's financial advisor on the sale, our view might be different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, the borrowers urge that the general ban on trustees buying trust property ought to extend with the same force to anyone who is employed or engaged by the fiduciary, as The Zitelman Group was in performing accounting services.  This is an arguable position (we ignore the possible significance of the June resignation), and there are a few cases that purport to support such a general ban on those who assist a fiduciary.  E.g., Donovan &amp; Schuenke v. Sampsell, 226 F.2d 804, 811 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 895, 76 S.Ct. 152, 100 L.Ed. 787 (1955);  In re Q.P.S., Inc., 99 B.R. 843, 845 (Bankr.W.D.Tenn.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, as the district court showed, it is not clear that the ban is uniformly followed even in those few jurisdictions that purport to adopt it.  926 F.Supp. at 244 n. 64.   And the greater weight of authority is that any judgments as to disqualification of a non-fiduciary purchaser should be made on a case by case basis, taking account of all of the surrounding circumstances.  Id. at 244;  Restatement (Second) of Trusts &#167; 170 comment e;  Bogert, supra, &#167; 543, at 254;  Scott &amp; Fratcher, supra, &#167; 170.6;  see, e.g., Burlingham v. Worcester, 351 Mass. 198, 218 N.E.2d 123, 126 (1966);  Gunther v. Gove, 275 Mass. 235, 175 N.E. 464, 467 (1931).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central reason for disqualifying the fiduciary as a buyer is that there is no one else who can similarly protect the estate's interest.  See Bogert, supra, &#167; 543, at 227-28.  But where the purchaser is merely hired by the fiduciary to perform a discrete and narrow function unrelated to the sale, the fiduciary's guardian role is not automatically impaired.  On the contrary, the fiduciary should still have every incentive to refuse to sell unless the purchaser is making the most attractive available offer.  Thus, there is often little risk that the estate will be disserved by allowing the bid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule, by disqualifying the fiduciary as a bidder, might in some rare case foreclose the highest bidder, but only one such bidder is lost.  If courts extend that circle of automatic disqualification, the risk becomes greater of harming the estate by limiting those who might offer the highest price.  This is especially so in cases where the universe of serious buyers is likely to be small, as may well be the case here.  And, of course, even without a rigid rule disqualification, an objecting party is free to argue on particular facts against a proposed sale to someone employed by the fiduciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the borrowers do argue that The Zitelman Group's access to inside information did give Spring an advantage in framing its bid.  If Spring had thereby bid less than it otherwise would have, interesting problems of remedy might arise--for it still might not help the estate to throw out the highest bid made to it.  In all events, the district court specifically found that the information available to The Zitelman Group was not \"confidential information or even raw financial data,\" 926 F.Supp. at 243, and was effectively available to other bidders.  Id. at 233 n. 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the borrowers make no effort to show that the monthly financial statements or any other information available to The Zitelman Group gave Spring any unique advantage over the information available to all bidders.  On the contrary, the prospective bidders were supplied with more detailed and pertinent information than the limited data available to The Zitelman Group for accounting purposes.  926 F.Supp. at 233 &amp; n.23.  The borrowers' brief gives us no reason even to suspect error on this finding, let alone clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to a quite different attack made by the borrowers on the sale.  The borrowers assert that the receiver or his associated brokerage company, Media Venture Partners, accepted a \"bribe\" from Spring by agreeing to act as Spring's broker to buy another radio station in the Atlantic City area.  Apparently, in April 1995, at virtually the same time that Spring submitted the winning bid in the first round, Spring offered Media Venture Partners a commission to secure Spring a second station in the same city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To describe this offer as a proven bribe is a dramatic overstatement.  Zitelman (who headed The Zitelman Group) himself testified at a hearing that the offer of a commission to Spring to procure a second station in Atlantic City was an arm's length agreement unrelated (except by Spring's desire for a duopoly) to the receiver's sale of the borrowers' stations.  The district court did not discuss the episode, perhaps because the borrowers developed very little evidence about it in the district court.  The borrowers apparently did not even cross-examine Zitelman on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, the borrowers simply repeat their charge that the commission was a bribe.  If it were, the matter would be very serious.  But the borrowers have adduced no evidence that the commission was intended by Spring as a bribe, regarded by Giddens or Media Venture Partners in that light, or that it had any effect on the sale of the borrowers' station.  Out of an abundance of caution we have read what can be found in the record on the subject, and it does not alter our conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers might have argued that, as a prophylactic matter, a receiver who is selling property should be barred from any other dealing with the buyer in the same time frame.  A federal judge, for example, could not normally accept a gift from a lawyer litigating a case before that judge.  5 U.S.C. &#167; 7353(a)(1) (1994);  Code of Conduct for United States Judges Canon 5(4).  But the borrowers have made no effort to offer citations or arguments for such a prophylactic rule here;  and it is certainly not self-evident that so broad a rule would make sense in the context of ordinary business transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the borrowers offer a motley of other attacks on the sale.  These include charges that Media Venture Partners helped Spring in \"crafting\" its bid by providing it help not afforded to other bidders;  that the receiver concealed information from the court regarding bids submitted by other bidders;  that adjustments in the sales contract between the receiver and Spring were unwarranted;  that the second and third rounds of bidding were too hasty;  and that the sale price ultimately fixed for the stations was too low in light of earlier appraisals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These objections are answered in the district court's lengthy opinion approving the sale.  The objections turn on the specific facts and the district court's opinion is reported.  In each case, we think that the district court's discussion is sufficient and that no error occurred.  In our view, the district court and the magistrate judge have done a very able job in handling this complex and contentious case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On Fleet's claims, seven of the eight counts involved computation of damages and at least the interest component remained to be resolved.

In one appeal, the borrowers contest the grant of summary judgment in favor of the lending bank;  in the other appeal, the borrowers challenge the district court's approval of a sale by the receiver of borrower assets that secured the loans.  In both instances, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are largely undisputed.  Between 1983 and 1988, Fleet National Bank (\"Fleet\") provided various interrelated loans and lines of credit to H&amp;D Entertainment, Inc., and other associated corporations and partnerships (collectively, \"the borrowers\");  the borrowers were licensees or had other ownership interests in radio stations in various cities, and those assets secured the loans.  In early 1994, Fleet concluded that the borrowers were in default and brought suit in two different federal district courts to collect upon different notes made or guaranteed by the borrowers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 1994, Fleet and the borrowers entered into a written settlement agreement.  In exchange for Fleet's forbearance on the loans and dismissal of its law suits, the borrowers agreed to a repayment plan based on the sale of the radio stations.  The settlement agreement provided that if the borrowers failed to comply with the plan's terms, this failure would end Fleet's forbearance obligation and also constitute the borrower's consent to the appointment of a receiver who would muster the assets and pay the debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fleet claims that on November 30, 1994, the borrowers missed the first deadline established under the settlement agreement.  As Fleet reads the agreement, the borrowers were required by that date either to have made a down payment of $6.4 million or to have in force purchase agreements with third parties obligating the latter to buy stations from the borrowers for that amount or more.  The borrowers dispute this reading.  The precise terms of the settlement agreement and other pertinent facts are set forth below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 1994, Fleet brought the present action in the federal district court in Massachusetts against the borrowers seeking over $12.9 million plus interest based on the notes and guarantees.  Later, the borrowers counterclaimed.  In the meantime, Fleet moved for the appointment of Charles Giddens as receiver for the stations.  Giddens had an extensive background in appraising and selling radio stations and was a partner in a brokerage firm, Media Venture Partners, experienced in this field.  In the past, Giddens had been appointed by courts to serve as receiver for radio stations and his firm had acted as broker in their sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court designated Giddens as receiver and thereafter approved his retention of Media Venture Partners to act as broker in the sale of the stations, comprising four principal properties in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey.  Giddens also retained The Zitelman Group, Inc., to prepare monthly financial statements for the stations and certain tax filings.  The Zitelman Group was one of the few firms known to Giddens as experienced in radio station accounting and prepared to do such work on a temporary basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1995, Media Venture Partners solicited bids from several hundred possible purchasers, widely publicizing the proposed sale.  The largest bid, offering to buy all four station properties for approximately $15.3 million, was made by Spring Broadcasting, L.L.C.  (\"Spring\"), which is associated in ownership and management with The Zitelman Group.  The bid was subject to further examination by the bidder and further negotiations.  At Giddens' request, The Zitelman Group resigned its bookkeeping tasks in June 1995, so that Giddens could freely negotiate a definitive purchase agreement with Spring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the period, the borrowers made constant objections to the receiver, the proposed sale, and many other details.  It appears that the prospective sale price being negotiated would not even cover in full the borrowers' debts to Fleet plus interest, let alone leave any equity for the borrowers.  Thus, the borrowers had little incentive to cooperate in the receiver sale.  Still, as the district court pointed out, the prospective deficiency did give Fleet reason to obtain as much as possible for the stations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the spring of 1995, Fleet and the borrowers filed cross motions for partial or complete summary judgment, the central issue being whether the borrowers had breached the settlement agreement.  The cross motions were heard by a magistrate judge in June 1995.  In early July 1995, the magistrate judge wrote a lengthy report and recommendation, concluding that Fleet's motion should be granted and the borrowers' motion should be denied.  Ultimately, the district court approved the report and recommendations of the magistrate judge.  This resolution would have disposed of most but not all of the claims on each side.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giddens and Spring negotiated a final purchase price of just under $14 million during the summer of 1995, the lower price reflecting some deterioration of the stations and other adjustments.  The magistrate judge held hearings, heard objections, and ultimately approved Giddens' proposal as to the procedures for completing the sale.  This involved a second round of bidding, effectively inviting others to exceed the Spring offer.  Information was furnished to prospective bidders, but no such bids were made.  During this period the borrowers conducted discovery.  In October and November 1995 the district court held hearings on the proposed sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the fall, Giddens and Spring modified the proposed sale in certain respects.  When the borrowers asked for a new round of competitive bidding because of the changes, Giddens conducted a third round of bidding ending in January 1996.  No better bids were made.  Further discovery was allowed to the borrowers.  In January 1996 the district court held a further evidentiary hearing and then approved the sale from the bench.  In April 1996, the district court issued a lengthy decision explaining its decision to approve the sale to Spring.  Fleet National Bank v. H&amp;D Entertainment, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></span> (D.Mass.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The borrowers have now appealed both from the order resolving the summary judgment motions and from the order approving the receiver's sale of the stations to Spring.  At the outset, the borrowers argue that the summary judgment order is not properly before us, because it did not dispose fully of all of the claims or all of the counterclaims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For this reason, the district court directed, on approving the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, \"that final judgment be entered, pursuant to [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 54(b) and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers do not argue that the district court failed to make or support the finding required by Rule 54(b) for a separate judgment on less than all claims or parties, namely, that there is \"no just reason for delay.\"   Rather, they simply assert that there is case law forbidding the use of Rule 54(b) as to any claim that has been adjudicated as to liability but not damages.  E.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109403\"><a href=\"/opinion/109403/liberty-mut-ins-co-v-wetzel/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 744, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109403\"><a href=\"/opinion/109403/liberty-mut-ins-co-v-wetzel/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span>, 1206, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109403\"><a href=\"/opinion/109403/liberty-mut-ins-co-v-wetzel/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (1976).  This is the status of most of Fleet's claims against the borrowers, although Fleet says, citing Herzog Contracting Corp. v. McGowen Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592120\"><a href=\"/opinion/592120/herzog-contracting-corporation-v-mcgowen-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1062</span></a></span>, 1064 (7th Cir.1992), that the mere calculation of interest due is ministerial and should not impair finality as to those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers' objection to their own appeal is an ill-advised attempt to throw sand in the wheels.  The district court's order approving the sale of the stations to Spring is properly before us--because by judicial gloss, such an order is treated as a final decision under 28 U.S.C., &#167; 1291, because of its importance and irrevocable character.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  And in reviewing the sale order, the borrowers are free to challenge any other ruling of the district court that underpins the sale order.  E.g., Avery v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"452058\"><a href=\"/opinion/452058/ernest-e-avery-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">762</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 161 (1st Cir.1985);  16 Wright, Miller, Cooper &amp; Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3921 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the decision that the borrowers violated the settlement agreement does underpin the sale.  The borrowers' violation is the central premise for the appointment of the receiver and the authorization permitting the receiver to sell the security.  In short, the borrowers are free, in challenging the sale order, to make their central claim that they did not violate the settlement agreement.  This would be so even if Rule 54(b) had never been invoked as to the summary judgment order, and even if the summary judgment order were not before us except as a premise of the sale order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, the borrowers are mistaken in thinking that if they successfully challenged the Rule 54(a) designation, they could undo or invalidate the district court's decision on summary judgment.  At best, they might limit this court's review to those aspects of the summary judgment decision that directly underpin the order approving the sale.  But, so far as we can ascertain, the only attack made by the borrowers is on just such an aspect of the summary judgment decision, namely, the ruling that the borrowers breached the settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we have jurisdiction both over the order approving the sale and, incident to review of that order, over the only attack made on the summary judgment decision, regardless of Herzog Contracting.   Further, the district court's order directed to the summary judgment motions is properly before us under Rule 54(b) at least insofar as that order completely disposes of most of the borrowers' individual counterclaims.  Since we have plenary jurisdiction over the summary judgment order at least as to those claims, we are free to review--and affirm--both orders against the only attack made upon them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. We turn now to the merits of that attack, namely, the district court's ruling that the borrowers breached the settlement agreement by failing either to make a $6.4 million initial payment by November 30, 1994, or alternatively to make sales agreements by that time in a comparable amount.  Summary judgment is proper if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the law otherwise warrants judgment for the moving party;  inferences and credibility are taken in favor of the opposing party;  and review on appeal is de novo.  Roy v. Inhabitants of the City of Lewiston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195798\"><a href=\"/opinion/195798/roy-v-inhabitants/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span>, 694 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement agreement (in section 5(a)) required the borrowers either to have paid Fleet $6.4 million by November 30, 1994--which did not occur--or to meet an alternative condition stated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>On or prior to November 30, 1994, members of the Borrower Group shall have ... entered into binding [purchase and sale] agreements ... which shall have become fully effective as contemplated below, providing for the sale, to one or more purchasers, of two or more Station Combinations providing for aggregate Net Sales Proceeds of not less that $6,400,000....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later dates were provided by which two further specified payments (or sales contracts in like amounts) were to be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the settlement agreement provided (in section 5(e)) a trio of corresponding dates by which contracted-for station sales had to be completed.  Thus, the first sale--contracted for by November 30, 1994, for not less than $6.4 million--had to be consummated by March 31, 1995.  The five-month lag time was set to permit the necessary approval of license transfers by the Federal Communications Commission.  This provision also required the borrowers to use their best efforts to obtain FCC approval, but it provided for reasonable extensions of time if, despite the borrowers' diligence, FCC approval were delayed past March 31, 1995 (or comparable dates for the other two installments).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, both sides agree that by November 30, 1994, the borrowers had paid only $1,050,000 toward their debt.  But, on summary judgment, the borrowers said that they satisfied the alternative obligation under section 5(a)--quoted above--by entering into an agreement to sell stations for enough money to generate the balance of the $6.4 million first payment.  The facts as to what happened are largely undisputed;  the disagreement before us turns on an issue of contract interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1994, well in advance of November 30, 1994, deadline, the borrowers contracted to sell two of the stations to a third party for amounts that, taken together with the prior $1 million payment, would have satisfied the November 30, 1994, obligation.  This June 1994 sales contract conditioned the buyer's obligation on one of the radio stations attaining a listenership ranking of number 1 or 2 in the demographic category of adults age 25-54, as determined by the Arbitron ratings service.  In July 1994, before consummation, new Arbitron ratings placed the station in seventh place and, in September 1994, the buyer terminated the sales contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment and on appeal, the borrowers' central position has been that they complied with the literal terms of the settlement agreement because, in the words of section 5(a) quoted above, they \"entered into\" the required \"binding\" and \"fully effective\" contract \"[o]n or prior to\" November 30, 1994.  The borrowers say that it is no part of their problem that their June 1994 contract to sell the stations lapsed well before November 30, 1994, and that no such sales contract was in effect on that date.  We join the magistrate judge and the district court in rejecting the borrowers' reading of the settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own terms, the settlement agreement is to be read in accordance with Massachusetts law.  Under the precedents, ably parsed by the magistrate judge in his report adopted by the district court, a contract governed by Massachusetts law must be construed in accord with common sense, the likely intent of the parties and (in commercial cases) \"as a business transaction entered into by practical [people] to accomplish an honest and straightforward end.\"  Shapiro v. Grinspoon, 27 Mass.App.Ct. 596, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2057388\"><a href=\"/opinion/2057388/shapiro-v-grinspoon/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 363 (1989).  In short, words matter;  but the words are to be read as elements in a practical working document and not as a crossword puzzle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all likelihood, the phrase \"fully effective\" in the settlement agreement refers to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the settlement agreement itself (e.g., the borrowers' filing of FCC applications for license transfer within 20 days).  The magistrate judge--whose report the district court adopted--reasoned that the term \"binding,\" to avoid superfluity, should be read to exclude \"contingent purchase obligations which lapsed before ever ripening into absolute ones.\"   Thus, he concluded that even on the most literal reading, the borrowers failed to meet the requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, it is uncertain whether the parties to the settlement agreement entertained any very precise notion of the meaning of \"binding.\"   The term is often used--redundantly in most contexts--to mean legally enforceable, Black's Law Dictionary 168-69 (6th ed.1990), and lawyers typically overwrite documents in this fashion.  Further, at least one condition subsequent--that of FCC approval--was likely to remain unresolved until after November 30.  But we think that even if the term \"binding\" is given no special meaning, the result is the same based upon a common-sense appraisal, elsewhere stressed by the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A self-evident aim of the settlement agreement was to make certain, by November 30, 1994, that future payment to Fleet of the $6.4 million was reasonably assured, assuming that actual payment had not already occurred.  By law, the intended assurance would still be subject to the specific condition of FCC approval of the license transfers;  and, of course, bankruptcy of the buyer or other intervening events might otherwise have frustrated the sale.  But a sales contract that lapsed by its own terms prior to November 30 simply does not satisfy the obvious basic objective of providing reasonable assurance to Fleet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To adopt this view does not require that we suppose that the parties had an exact and identical view of how every contingency or condition might satisfy or violate the settlement agreement.  It is enough that reasonable parties would not have believed that this settlement agreement would be satisfied where the seller and buyer built into the sales contract a significant condition subsequent that defeated the obligation to buy and led to the lapsing of the contract prior to November 30.  See generally Cooke v. Lynn Sand &amp; Stone Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708051\"><a href=\"/opinion/708051/james-h-cooke-v-lynn-sand-stone-company-trimount-bituminous-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 204-05 (1st Cir.1995).  Other variations might present more difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers have a fall-back position.  They argue that the settlement agreement is at worst ambiguous and that, given the ambiguity, they are entitled to a trial to present evidence.  Further, they point to the affidavit of Joel Hartstone, a leading figure in the management of the borrowers, that in the course of negotiating the settlement agreement,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>[T]here were specific discussions regarding the understanding that, if the Borrower Group fulfilled its good faith efforts obligations by entering into purchase and sale agreements, and if those agreements then terminated, the Borrower Group still would have until the principal payment deadline to consummate a transaction with a substitute purchaser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartstone's gloss is highly unlikely as a statement of the parties' actual intent in section 5(a) but not quite impossible.  It is highly unlikely because it is so serious a departure from the words and structure of the settlement agreement.  Nothing in section 5(a) suggests that the contract signing was merely a \"good faith efforts\" hurdle;  if that was the intention, it could easily have been expressed.  Further, there is a lucid \"best efforts\" clause in section 5(e), pertaining to the borrowers' duty to seek FCC approval, but none in section 5(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, this would be a more difficult case if there were solid extrinsic proof--that is, evidence independent of the words of the settlement agreement--that the parties mutually intended section 5(a) to have the meaning claimed by Hartstone.  The contract could rationally have been drafted as Hartstone urges, and sometimes parties fail to express themselves clearly in their drafting.  This looks, at first glance, like a classic problem as to when extrinsic evidence may be offered to assist in contract interpretation, an issue largely governed by the parol evidence rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Somewhat simplified, the traditional version of the parol evidence rule is that a contract provision is either clear or ambiguous and that, in the former case, extrinsic evidence of negotiations is prohibited (if the contract was intended to be a complete integration).  The modern approach, embodied in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1981), allows extrinsic evidence to \"interpret\" even a seemingly unambiguous contract, but not to vary or contradict its terms.  Id. &#167; 212(1) and comment b, and &#167; 214(c) (1981).  See Farnsworth, Contracts &#167; 7.12 (1990).  Massachusetts courts may tend toward the older view but not unequivocally so.  Compare ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556606\"><a href=\"/opinion/556606/itt-corporation-v-ltx-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span>, 1261-62 (1st Cir.1991), with Robert Indus. Inc. v. Spence, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2215427\"><a href=\"/opinion/2215427/robert-industries-inc-v-spence/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2215427\"><a href=\"/opinion/2215427/robert-industries-inc-v-spence/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span> (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the elaborate settlement agreement was plainly intended as a complete integration and contains a clause to this effect.  Thus, if the Hartstone affidavit were sufficient, it would pose nice questions as to whether Massachusetts law requires an ambiguity before permitting extrinsic evidence, (if so) whether the agreement is ambiguous on the point at issue, and (above all) whether the Hartstone gloss can be said to explain--rather than contradict--the terms of the agreement.  A factfinder might also have to decide whether Hartstone's affidavit correctly and fully described what was said at the negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Hartstone's affidavit is not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.  The affidavit contains only the conclusory assertion that in the negotiations there were \"specific discussions\" adopting his best-efforts interpretation.  No dates, names or actual statements are supplied;  not a single \"specific\" is set forth to demonstrate, or even illustrate, the content of the alleged \"specific discussions.\"   There is only some lawyer-like argument in a further paragraph as to why Hartstone's \"best efforts\" gloss conformed to the general tenor of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the quoted passage in Hartstone's affidavit did not create a genuine issue of fact as to what happened at the negotiations.  Nor did it supply specific facts that, if uncontested, might have affected the district court's own reading of the settlement agreement.  Cf. Lumpkin v. Envirodyne Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561305\"><a href=\"/opinion/561305/frank-lumpkin-v-envirodyne-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 456 (7th Cir.1991) (court may construe document if facts undisputed).  It is just the kind of conclusory affidavit statement that is regularly disregarded by courts.  Wynne v. Tufts Univ.  Sch. of Medicine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560452\"><a href=\"/opinion/560452/steven-wynne-v-tufts-university-school-of-medicine/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 27-28 (1st Cir.1991);  Posadas de Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

The remaining issue is whether the district court erred in approving the receiver's agreement to sell the stations to Spring.  The district court has wide discretion in judging whether a receiver's sale is fair in terms and result and serves the best interests of the estate.  E.g., United States v. Peters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461286\"><a href=\"/opinion/461286/united-states-v-anthony-j-peters-appeal-of-walter-f-kelly-and-sandra-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span>, 1298 n. 6 (7th Cir.1985).  On review, an abuse of discretion standard governs such judgments, although subsidiary findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and propositions of law are subject to de novo review.  Pye v. Teamsters Local Union No. 122, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701263\"><a href=\"/opinion/701263/rosemary-pye-regional-director-etc-v-teamsters-local-union-no-122/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></a></span>, 1018 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the borrowers make almost a dozen different attacks on the sale, but only a few require discussion.  The first attack, and the one most vigorously argued, arises from the fact that the winning bidder-buyer (Spring) was closely associated with the company (The Zitelman Group) that until June 1994 performed specified accounting services for the seller-receiver (Giddens).  For present purposes, we omit the details of the association and (arguendo ) treat the case as if Spring and The Zitelman Group were one entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exceptions aside, a full-fledged fiduciary, such as trustee or a court-appointed receiver like Giddens, may not normally sell estate property to himself even if the terms are fair.  Restatement (Second) of Trusts &#167; 170 comment b (1959);  Bogert, The Law of Trusts and Trustees &#167; 543, at 248 (rev.2d ed.1993);  Scott &amp; Fratcher, The Law of Trusts &#167; 170.1 (4th ed.1987);  see, e.g., Attorney General v. Flynn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2173158\"><a href=\"/opinion/2173158/attorney-general-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2173158\"><a href=\"/opinion/2173158/attorney-general-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 302 (1954).  The central reason is obvious:  despite the safeguard of court oversight, the main assurance that the estate will be maximized is the zeal of the seller to secure the best price, and that zeal is likely to be tempered if the seller is selling to himself.  Bogert, supra.   The benefits of the general ban outweigh the risk that, in an individual case, the receiver might otherwise be the highest bidder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers in this case urge that The Zitelman Group ought to be viewed as a fiduciary.  While the label is not an exact term, see SEC v. Chenery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 85-86, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span> (1943);  Restatement (Second) Torts &#167; 874 comment a (1979), we agree with the district court that the specific accounting tasks allotted to The Zitelman Group were narrow, mechanical, and unrelated to the sale.  The district court's findings to this effect, 926 F.Supp. at 242-43, have not been impeached.  If The Zitelman Group had been engaged as the receiver's financial advisor on the sale, our view might be different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, the borrowers urge that the general ban on trustees buying trust property ought to extend with the same force to anyone who is employed or engaged by the fiduciary, as The Zitelman Group was in performing accounting services.  This is an arguable position (we ignore the possible significance of the June resignation), and there are a few cases that purport to support such a general ban on those who assist a fiduciary.  E.g., Donovan &amp; Schuenke v. Sampsell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"237737\"><a href=\"/opinion/237737/donovan-schuenke-horace-f-french-ralph-a-mcclure-and-a-e-french-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 811 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And the greater weight of authority is that any judgments as to disqualification of a non-fiduciary purchaser should be made on a case by case basis, taking account of all of the surrounding circumstances.  Id. at 244;  Restatement (Second) of Trusts &#167; 170 comment e;  Bogert, supra, &#167; 543, at 254;  Scott &amp; Fratcher, supra, &#167; 170.6;  see, e.g., Burlingham v.

See Bogert, supra, &#167; 543, at 227-28.  But where the purchaser is merely hired by the fiduciary to perform a discrete and narrow function unrelated to the sale, the fiduciary's guardian role is not automatically impaired.  On the contrary, the fiduciary should still have every incentive to refuse to sell unless the purchaser is making the most attractive available offer.  Thus, there is often little risk that the estate will be disserved by allowing the bid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule, by disqualifying the fiduciary as a bidder, might in some rare case foreclose the highest bidder, but only one such bidder is lost.  If courts extend that circle of automatic disqualification, the risk becomes greater of harming the estate by limiting those who might offer the highest price.  This is especially so in cases where the universe of serious buyers is likely to be small, as may well be the case here.  And, of course, even without a rigid rule disqualification, an objecting party is free to argue on particular facts against a proposed sale to someone employed by the fiduciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the borrowers do argue that The Zitelman Group's access to inside information did give Spring an advantage in framing its bid.  If Spring had thereby bid less than it otherwise would have, interesting problems of remedy might arise--for it still might not help the estate to throw out the highest bid made to it.  In all events, the district court specifically found that the information available to The Zitelman Group was not \"confidential information or even raw financial data,\" 926 F.Supp. at 243, and was effectively available to other bidders.  Id. at 233 n. 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the borrowers make no effort to show that the monthly financial statements or any other information available to The Zitelman Group gave Spring any unique advantage over the information available to all bidders.  On the contrary, the prospective bidders were supplied with more detailed and pertinent information than the limited data available to The Zitelman Group for accounting purposes.  926 F.Supp. at 233 &amp; n.23.  The borrowers' brief gives us no reason even to suspect error on this finding, let alone clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to a quite different attack made by the borrowers on the sale.  The borrowers assert that the receiver or his associated brokerage company, Media Venture Partners, accepted a \"bribe\" from Spring by agreeing to act as Spring's broker to buy another radio station in the Atlantic City area.  Apparently, in April 1995, at virtually the same time that Spring submitted the winning bid in the first round, Spring offered Media Venture Partners a commission to secure Spring a second station in the same city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To describe this offer as a proven bribe is a dramatic overstatement.  Zitelman (who headed The Zitelman Group) himself testified at a hearing that the offer of a commission to Spring to procure a second station in Atlantic City was an arm's length agreement unrelated (except by Spring's desire for a duopoly) to the receiver's sale of the borrowers' stations.  The district court did not discuss the episode, perhaps because the borrowers developed very little evidence about it in the district court.  The borrowers apparently did not even cross-examine Zitelman on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, the borrowers simply repeat their charge that the commission was a bribe.  If it were, the matter would be very serious.  But the borrowers have adduced no evidence that the commission was intended by Spring as a bribe, regarded by Giddens or Media Venture Partners in that light, or that it had any effect on the sale of the borrowers' station.  Out of an abundance of caution we have read what can be found in the record on the subject, and it does not alter our conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowers might have argued that, as a prophylactic matter, a receiver who is selling property should be barred from any other dealing with the buyer in the same time frame.  A federal judge, for example, could not normally accept a gift from a lawyer litigating a case before that judge.  5 U.S.C. &#167; 7353(a)(1) (1994);  Code of Conduct for United States Judges Canon 5(4).  But the borrowers have made no effort to offer citations or arguments for such a prophylactic rule here;  and it is certainly not self-evident that so broad a rule would make sense in the context of ordinary business transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the borrowers offer a motley of other attacks on the sale.  These include charges that Media Venture Partners helped Spring in \"crafting\" its bid by providing it help not afforded to other bidders;  that the receiver concealed information from the court regarding bids submitted by other bidders;  that adjustments in the sales contract between the receiver and Spring were unwarranted;  that the second and third rounds of bidding were too hasty;  and that the sale price ultimately fixed for the stations was too low in light of earlier appraisals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These objections are answered in the district court's lengthy opinion approving the sale.  The objections turn on the specific facts and the district court's opinion is reported.  In each case, we think that the district court's discussion is sufficient and that no error occurred.  In our view, the district court and the magistrate judge have done a very able job in handling this complex and contentious case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On Fleet's claims, seven of the eight counts involved computation of damages and at least the interest component remained to be resolved.
