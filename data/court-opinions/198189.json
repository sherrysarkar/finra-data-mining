CHAMBERLAIN,\r\n\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n      [Hon. Morton A. Brody, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n               Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge, \r\n\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge. \r\n\nJeffrey M. Silverstein, with whom Billings &amp; Silverstein was\r\non brief for appellant.\r\nMargaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and James L.\r\nMcCarthy, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nNovember 3, 1998\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Richard Chamberlain\r\nappeals from his conviction in the United States District Court for\r\nthe District of Maine on one count of possession of a firearm\r\npursuant to 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(4), which makes it unlawful for any\r\nperson who has been \"committed to a mental institution\" to possess\r\nany firearm in interstate commerce.  Under Maine law, Chamberlain\r\nhad earlier been involuntarily admitted for five days, on an\r\nemergency basis, to a Maine mental hospital.  Chamberlain moved to\r\ndismiss the federal information, contending that his involuntary\r\nemergency admission was not, as a matter of law, a \"commitment\" to\r\na mental institution as required for conviction under  922(g)(4). \r\nThe district court denied the motion.  Chamberlain entered a\r\nconditional guilty plea, reserving his right to challenge on appeal\r\nthe denial of his motion to dismiss.  He was sentenced to five\r\nyears probation and ordered to pay a $100 assessment.  This appeal\r\nfollowed.  We affirm.  \r\n                           I.\r\nOn June 25, 1996, Chamberlain was involuntarily admitted,\r\non an emergency basis, to the Acadia Hospital in Bangor, Maine\r\npursuant to an application filed under a Maine statute, 34-B\r\nM.R.S.A.  3863(1)-(3).  In the application seeking Chamberlain's\r\ninvoluntary admission, a clinician at Acadia stated that\r\n\"Chamberlain has a mental illness and, due to mental illness, poses\r\na likelihood of serious harm, on the basis that he put a loaded gun\r\nto his head and threatened his wife.\"  The application further\r\nstated that \"suitable resources for care and treatment are\r\nunavailable in the community.\"  Chamberlain was examined on June\r\n25, 1996, by a licensed physician, who certified pursuant to\r\nsection 3863 that Chamberlain posed a danger of serious harm due to\r\nmental illness because he \"held a gun to his head tonight\" and\r\nconstituted a \"[d]anger to [him]self and others.\"  A judge of the\r\nMaine district court reviewed and endorsed the application and\r\ncertification as being prepared in accordance with law, and ordered\r\nthat Chamberlain be transported and admitted to Acadia for no more\r\nthan five days, the maximum length of an emergency detention under\r\nsection 3863.  \r\nAfter Chamberlain had been admitted to Acadia, a second\r\nphysician examined him and completed a \"24-Hour Certification\r\nForm.\"  On the form, the physician certified that he had \"examined\r\n[Chamberlain] and in my opinion the patient is mentally ill, and,\r\ndue to his [] mental illness, poses a likelihood of serious harm to\r\nhimself [] or others if discharged at this time.\"  As grounds for\r\nthe certification, the physician stated that Chamberlain had \"put\r\na gun to his head last evening with suicidal ideation\" and \"remains\r\ndistraught today and constitutes a danger to [him]self.\"  \r\nA patient who has been detained for five days pursuant to\r\nsection 3863 may thereafter remain at the mental hospital if (1)\r\nthe patient voluntarily admits himself, see 34-B M.R.S.A.  3831,\r\nor (2) the chief administrative officer of the mental hospital\r\nobtains from the state district court an \"involuntary commitment\r\norder,\" see 34-B M.R.S.A.  3863 (5)(B), 3864.  After his initial\r\nfive-day emergency detention, Chamberlain voluntarily admitted\r\nhimself to Acadia on or about June 30, 1996, remaining there until\r\nhis release on July 8, 1996.  The chief administrative officer made \r\nno application in his case for an \"involuntary commitment order.\" \r\nOn May 19, 1997, a police officer received a\r\nsuicide/attempt to locate report from Chamberlain's brother. \r\nChamberlain's brother told the officer that Chamberlain was upset\r\nover the breakup of his marriage, had stated that he had nothing to\r\nlive for, and was suicidal.  The officer located Chamberlain's\r\npickup truck in an airport parking lot.  Inside the truck were a\r\nloaded Remington .270 caliber rifle, a box of .270 caliber\r\nammunition, and a Savage 30-30 caliber rifle.  These items, which\r\nwere manufactured outside the state of Maine, were seized and\r\nChamberlain was arrested and charged in the federal district court\r\nwith violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(4).  \r\nChamberlain filed a motion to dismiss the information on\r\nthe ground that he had not, as a matter of law, been \"committed to\r\na mental institution\" within the meaning of  922(g)(4).  The\r\nfederal district court denied the motion, and issued findings of\r\nfact and conclusions of law. \r\nChamberlain entered a conditional plea of guilty under\r\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2) to one count of unlawful possession of a\r\nfirearm, reserving his right to appeal from the district court's\r\ndenial of his motion to dismiss.  The court sentenced Chamberlain\r\nto five years' probation and a mandatory $100 assessment.\r\n                          II. \r\nThis appeal raises a single legal issue:  Whether\r\nChamberlain's involuntary admission pursuant to 34-B M.R.S.A. \r\n3863 constituted a \"commitment\" for purposes of conviction under\r\n18 U.S.C.  922(g)(4).  The federal district court held that\r\nChamberlain's five-day involuntary admission, which was followed by\r\nhis continued admission on a voluntary basis, constituted a\r\n\"commitment\" for purposes of the federal firearms ban.  Chamberlain\r\ncontends that his five-day emergency detention under Maine law fell\r\nshort of amounting to a \"commitment,\" and that only detention under\r\nan involuntary commitment order obtained pursuant to section 3864,\r\nnote 3, supra, would have constituted a \"commitment\" allowing\r\nconviction under the federal firearms statute.  We review de novothe district court's interpretation of the term \"commitment.\"  SeeUnited States v. Ortiz, 146 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 1998).  \r\nWe begin with the language of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(4), part\r\nof the federal Gun Control Act of 1968.  Section 922(g)(4) states\r\nthat it shall be unlawful for anyone\r\n(4) who has been adjudicated as a mental\r\ndefective or who has been committed to a\r\nmental institution; \r\n          . . .\r\nto ship or transport in interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce, or possess in or affecting commerce,\r\nany firearm or ammunition; or to receive any\r\nfirearm or ammunition which has been shipped\r\nor transported in interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce.\r\n\nThe Gun Control Act does not define the phrase \"committed to a\r\nmental institution.\"  See 18 U.S.C.  921, 922; see also United\r\nStates v. Waters, 23 F.3d 29, 31 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S.\r\n867 (1994).  \r\nDetermination of whether Chamberlain was so \"committed\"\r\nis a question of federal law.  See Waters, 23 F.3d at 31; United\r\nStates v. Giardina, 861 F.2d 1334, 1335 (5th Cir. 1988).  Cf.Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1983)\r\n(\"Whether one has been 'convicted' within the language of the gun\r\ncontrol statutes is . . . a question of federal . . . law, despite\r\nthe fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined\r\nby the law of the State.\") (citation omitted).  While we are\r\ndetermining a question of federal law, we \"may seek guidance from\r\nstate law,\" Giardina, 861 F.2d at 1335, since \"commitment\" occurs\r\npursuant to procedures required by state law.  See United States v.\r\nHansel, 474 F.2d 1120, 1122-23 (8th Cir. 1973).  After taking into\r\naccount whatever guidance state law may offer, our interpretation\r\nmust in any case be consistent with federal policy.  See Waters, 23\r\nF.3d at 31; Giardina, 861 F.2d at 1335.  Accordingly, we examine\r\nboth Maine's statutory involuntary hospitalization procedures and\r\nthe federal gun control policy embodied in  922(g)(4). \r\nA.  Maine's Involuntary Hospitalization Law\r\nUnder Maine law, a person may be \"admitted to a mental\r\nhospital, on an emergency basis,\" upon written application stating\r\nthe applicant's belief that the person is mentally ill and, because\r\nof his illness, \"poses a likelihood of serious harm.\"  34-B\r\nM.R.S.A.  3863(1).  The Maine statute elsewhere describes such an\r\nemergency admission as an \"involuntary admission\" and it is clear\r\nthat a person so admitted cannot leave the institution and is under\r\nits control.  The application must be accompanied by a certificate\r\nsigned by a health care professional who has examined the patient\r\nnot more than three days before the date of admission and\r\ndetermined that the patient \"poses a likelihood of serious harm.\" \r\nId.,  3863(2).  \r\nThe application and the accompanying certificate must be\r\nreviewed by a Justice of the Superior Court, Judge of the District\r\nCourt, Judge of Probate or a justice of the peace.  See id., \r\n3863(3).  If the judicial officer determines that the application\r\nand certificate are \"regular and in accordance with the law,\" id.,\r\nthe statute requires that he or she endorse them.  A patient\r\nadmitted on an emergency basis may not be detained for more than\r\nfive days.  See id.,  3863(5)(B)(2). \r\nOnce a patient is involuntarily admitted, section 3863\r\nrequires that the patient be examined \"as soon as practicable.\" \r\nSee id.,  3863(7).  If this post-admission examination is not held\r\nwithin twenty-four hours after the time of admission, or if a\r\nhealth care provider fails or refuses after the examination to\r\ncertify that the patient is mentally ill and, due to his mental\r\nillness, \"poses a likelihood of serious harm,\" the patient must be\r\nimmediately discharged.  See id.,  3863(7)(C).\r\nAfter the initial five-day involuntary hospitalization,\r\na patient may elect to be \"informally admitted\" for a longer\r\nperiod, provided the chief administrative officer of the hospital\r\ndetermines that admission of the patient on an informal basis is\r\nappropriate.  See id.,  3863(5)(A).  This informal, voluntary\r\nadmission may be indefinite.  If the patient does not choose to be\r\ninformally admitted, or the chief administrative officer determines\r\nthat admission of the patient on an informal basis is not\r\nappropriate, and the chief administrative officer believes that\r\nfurther hospitalization is warranted, the chief administrative\r\nofficer \"may seek involuntary commitment\" of the patient.  See id.,\r\n3863(5)(B).  \r\nTo secure a further judicial \"involuntary commitment\" at\r\nthis later stage, the chief administrative officer must file \"[a]n\r\napplication to the District Court to admit a person to a mental\r\nhospital.\"  See id.,  3864(1).  The patient is entitled to notice\r\nof the proceedings and of his or her right to retain counsel. \r\nId., 3864(4).  If neither the patient nor anyone else provides\r\ncounsel, the statute requires that the court appoint counsel for\r\nthe patient.  Id.,  3864(5)(D).  The patient must be examined by\r\ntwo examiners, each of whom must be a licensed physician or a\r\nlicensed clinical psychologist.  Id.  One of the examiners must be\r\na physician or psychologist chosen by the patient or the patient's\r\ncounsel.  Id.  If the report of the examiners is to the effect that\r\nthe person is mentally ill or poses a likelihood of serious harm,\r\nthe patient is entitled to a hearing before the district court, at\r\nwhich the patient, the applicant, and others are afforded an\r\nopportunity to appear and testify.  Id.,  3864(5)(C).  At the\r\nhearing, the court \"shall receive all relevant and material\r\nevidence which may be offered in accordance with accepted rules of\r\nevidence and accepted judicial dispositions.\"  Id. \r\nTo issue a commitment order at this stage, the district\r\ncourt must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person\r\nis \"mentally ill\" and \"poses a likelihood of serious harm.\"  Id., \r\n3864(6)(A)(1).  The court must also find that inpatient\r\nhospitalization is the best available means for treatment and that\r\nthe proposed individual treatment plan is satisfactory.  Id., \r\n3864(6)(A)(2)-(3).  Upon making these findings, the court may order\r\nthe patient committed for a period not to exceed four months in the\r\nfirst instance and not to exceed one year after the first and all\r\nsubsequent hearings.  Id.,  3864(7).  \r\nB.  Federal Policy Relating to the Possession of Firearms\r\nCongress' intent in enacting 18 U.S.C.  922 was \"to keep\r\nguns out of the hands of those who have demonstrated that they may\r\nnot be trusted to possess a firearm without becoming a threat to\r\nsociety.\"  Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 112 (quoting Lewis v. United\r\nStates, 445 U.S. 55, 63 (1980)).  In Huddleston v. United States,\r\n415 U.S. 814 (1974), the Supreme Court stated:\r\nThe principal purpose of the federal gun\r\ncontrol legislation . . . was to curb crime by\r\nkeeping 'firearms out of the hands of those\r\nnot legally entitled to possess them because\r\nof age, criminal background, or incompetency.'\r\n\n415 U.S. at 824 (citation omitted).  \r\nAccording to the Supreme Court, Congress in enacting the\r\nfirearms ban \"sought to rule broadly.\"  Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 112\r\n(quoting Scarborough v. United States, 431 U.S. 563, 572 (1977)). \r\nSee also id., at 116 (\"Congress was reaching far and was doing so\r\nintentionally.\"); Huddleston, 415 U.S. at 824(stating Congress was\r\nconcerned with general availability of firearms \"to those whose\r\npossession thereof was contrary to the public interest\"). \r\nConsistent with this broad purpose, Congress did not limit the\r\nfirearms prohibition only to those who had already committed\r\ndangerous or violent acts.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.  922(n)\r\n(prohibiting possession of firearms by any person under indictment\r\nfor crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\r\nwhether crime was violent or not); id.,  922(g)(1) (prohibiting\r\npossession of firearms by felons, whether or not convicted of a\r\ncrime of violence).  See also 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(3)(prohibiting\r\npossession of firearms by unlawful users of controlled substances);\r\nid.,  922(g)(5) (illegal aliens); id.,  922(g)(7)(citizens who\r\nhave renounced their citizenship).  \r\nThe legislative history indicates that Congress intended\r\nto apply the prohibition against the possession or ownership of\r\nfirearms by \"mentally unstable\" or \"irresponsible\" individuals. \r\nSee H.R. 17735, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968), 114 Cong. Rec. 21780,\r\n21791, 21832, and 22270 (1968).  Congress considered the mere risk\r\nor potential for violence or irresponsible use sufficient reason to\r\nprohibit certain categories of persons from possessing firearms. \r\nSee Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 112 n.6 (\"Congress' intent in enacting\r\n922(g) . . . was to keep firearms out of the hands of\r\npresumptively risky people.\"); Barrett v. United States, 423 U.S.\r\n212, 220 (1976) (legislative history reflects a concern with\r\n\"keeping firearms out of the hands of categories of potentially\r\nirresponsible persons\").  As for an individual adjudicated a mental\r\ndefective or committed to a mental institution, \"Congress obviously\r\nfelt that such a person, though unfortunate, was too much of a risk\r\nto be allowed firearms privileges.\"  Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 116.  \r\nIn enacting the federal firearms ban, Congress had a\r\nsecond purpose in mind   national uniformity in determinations of\r\nwhether a person is within a category covered by the firearms\r\nprohibition.  As the Supreme Court has stated, treating the scope\r\nof the ban as a matter of federal law \"makes for desirable national\r\nuniformity unaffected by varying state laws, procedures, and\r\ndefinitions . . .\"  Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 112.  The DickersonCourt noted that giving effect to the intricacies of varying state\r\nstatutes would \"seriously hamper effective enforcement of [the\r\nfirearms ban].\"  Id., at 121. \r\nC.  \"Commitment\" Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(4)\r\nChamberlain does not deny that Maine's procedural\r\nrequirements for an emergency involuntary hospitalization pursuant\r\nto 34-B M.R.S.A.  3863 were met in his case.  He contends,\r\nhowever, that his preliminary five-day involuntary hospitalization,\r\nwhich was followed by his voluntary admission to the same\r\ninstitution on an informal basis for an additional eight days, did\r\nnot amount to a \"commitment\" sufficient for conviction under 18\r\nU.S.C.  922(g)(4).  He argues that a person can be deemed\r\n\"committed\" under Maine law for purposes of the federal firearms\r\nban only after notice and issuance by a state judge of a formal\r\norder of commitment following a full hearing at which the person\r\nhas had the opportunity to be heard.  \r\nAs said, Congress itself has not defined the term\r\n\"commitment.\"  However, in ordinary usage, \"commitment\" means \"to\r\nplace in or send officially to confinement . . . to consign legally\r\nto a mental institution. . . .\"  See Webster's Third New\r\nInternational  Dictionary (1971).  In that sense, Chamberlain's\r\n\"involuntary admission\" under section 3863 would seem no different\r\nfrom a \"commitment.\"  In urging us to interpret \"commitment\" so as\r\nto exclude an initial five-day emergency detention, Chamberlain\r\nrelies upon the maxim that an \"ambiguity concerning the ambit of\r\ncriminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\"  Rewis v.\r\nUnited States, 401 U.S. 808, 812 (1971); United States v. Bass, 404\r\nU.S. 336, 347 (1971).  The rule of lenity serves important goals,\r\nincluding allowing fair warning as to what conduct is criminal and\r\npunishable, and is \"the product of an awareness that legislators\r\nand not the courts should define criminal activity.\"  Huddleston,\r\n415 U.S. at 814.  As the Huddleston Court noted, however, \"[z]eal\r\nin forwarding these laudable policies . . . must not be permitted\r\nto shadow the understanding that '[s]ound rules of statutory\r\ninterpretation exist to discover and not to direct the\r\nCongressional will.'\"  Id. (quoting United States ex rel. Marcus v.\r\nHess, 317 U.S. 537, 542 (1943)).  \"Although penal laws are to be\r\nconstrued strictly, they 'ought not to be construed so strictly as\r\nto defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.'\"  Huddleston,\r\n415 U.S. at 814 (quoting American Fur Co. v. United States, 2 Pet.\r\n358, 367 (1829)).  We believe that Congress's intent can reasonably\r\nbe ascertained in this case and that Chamberlain's restrictive \r\ninterpretation of \"commitment\" would defeat the \"broad prophylactic\r\npurpose,\" Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 118, of the federal firearms ban. \r\nChamberlain focuses first on the fact that section 3863\r\nof the Maine statute uses only the phrase \"involuntary admission\"\r\nwith respect to the five-day emergency detention in issue, whereas\r\nsection 3864 speaks expressly of \"commitment\" in regard to the\r\nlonger-term detention discussed there.  He argues that we owe this\r\ndifference in terminology \"great deference.\"  We find no evidence,\r\nhowever, that the Maine Legislature consciously used the\r\n\"involuntary admission\" language to distinguish between that and a\r\n\"commitment.\"  To the contrary,  the legislature has used the terms\r\n\"admission\" and \"commitment\" interchangeably.  Section\r\n3864(1)refers to the post-emergency application filed by the chief\r\nadministrative officer of the hospital under  3863(5)(B)   filed\r\npursuant to a procedure Chamberlain urges us to interpret as a\r\n\"commitment\"   as an application \"to admit\" a person to a mental\r\nhospital.  This legislative imprecision undermines Chamberlain's\r\nattempt to find an important meaning in the difference in\r\nterminology here.  Chamberlain's argument likewise finds no support\r\nin the opinions of the Maine courts concerning the involuntary\r\nhospitalization statutes and their predecessors.  The Maine Supreme\r\nCourt has at times characterized the initial involuntary\r\nhospitalization under  3863 as a \"commitment,\" see, e.g.,In re\r\nFaucher, 558 A.2d 705, 706 (Me. 1989), and at other times has\r\ncharacterized the same  procedure as one for \"emergency\r\nadmittance,\" Sukeforth v. Thegen, 256 A.2d 162 (Me. 1969).      \r\nMoreover, even if the Maine Legislature had been more\r\nprecise in its use of the two terms, we would be faced with the\r\nquestion of how far to rely upon the language chosen by the state\r\nlegislature in interpreting \"commitment\" for purposes of the\r\nfederal firearms ban.  We would hesitate to convert a question of\r\nfederal law into one solely of state law, as such an approach could\r\ndestroy the uniformity Congress sought in enacting section\r\n922(g)(4).  State statutes tend to vary widely as to the language\r\nchosen to describe the process of involuntary hospitalization. \r\nCompare, e.g., Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 123, \r\n12(e)(referring to a ten-day emergency involuntary hospitalization,\r\nsimilar to section 3863's five-day detention, as a \"commitment\")\r\nwith 34-B M.R.S.A.  3863(1)(characterizing emergency procedure as\r\n\"admission\").  Were we to focus solely on whether or not the term\r\n\"commitment\" is used, a patient in Massachusetts admitted on an\r\nemergency basis would be deemed \"committed\" for purposes of\r\nconviction under the federal firearms ban, while a patient\r\ninvoluntarily hospitalized in Maine in identical circumstances\r\nwould not.  This is precisely the sort of \"national patchwork,\"\r\nDickerson, 460 U.S. at 122, Congress sought to avoid in enacting\r\nthe firearms ban.  \r\nIn support of his narrow interpretation of \"commitment,\"\r\nChamberlain relies primarily upon Giardina and Hansel.  In those\r\ncases, the courts indeed relied upon the words chosen by the\r\nrespective state legislatures in concluding that no \"commitment\"\r\nhad occurred.  In Giardina, petitioner was involuntarily\r\nhospitalized for two weeks pursuant to a Louisiana statute allowing\r\ndetention of persons based upon a \"Physician's Emergency\r\nCertificate\" stating that the person is \"mentally ill.\"  The Eighth\r\nCircuit carefully examined the language used by the Louisiana\r\nLegislature in both the then-existing and superseded versions of\r\nthe involuntary hospitalization statutes, and concluded that since\r\nno \"commitment\"   as the process had been characterized by the\r\nstate legislature   had occurred, no \"commitment\" had taken place\r\nfor purposes of the federal firearms ban.  861 F.2d at 1336.  In\r\nHansel, the Fifth Circuit followed a similar course.  The court\r\nconcluded that since the Texas statute at issue did not\r\ncharacterize Hansel's involuntary detention as a \"commitment,\" no\r\n\"commitment\" had occurred pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  922.  474 F.2d at\r\n1122-23.   \r\nWith all respect, we believe that the proper\r\ninterpretation of the phrase, \"committed to a mental institution,\"\r\nshould not turn primarily on the label attached by the state\r\nlegislature to its procedures, but rather on the substance of those\r\nprocedures.  Thus, rather than focus on the nuances of state\r\nstatutory language in interpreting \"commitment,\" we look at the\r\nrealities of the state procedures and construe them in light of the\r\npurposes Congress sought to accomplish by prohibiting firearm\r\npossession by someone who has been \"committed to a mental\r\ninstitution.\"  We ask whether identifying the state's procedures\r\nfor involuntary hospitalization as a \"commitment\" is reasonable and\r\nconsistent with the federal policy underlying the firearms ban  \r\nnamely, to keep firearms out of the hands of those who, if\r\npermitted to possess them, would pose a risk or potential for harm. \r\nSee Waters, 23 F.3d at 34.  \r\nFor this reason, we respectfully decline to follow the\r\napproach of Giardina and Hansel, the cases on which Chamberlain\r\nprimarily relies.  Our approach is similar to the analysis of the\r\nSecond Circuit in Waters.  In Waters, petitioner was involuntarily\r\nhospitalized pursuant to a New York statute similar in many\r\nrespects to the Maine statute under consideration.  The statute\r\nallowed for the \"involuntary admission\" of an individual for sixty\r\ndays based upon an application of a relative or other qualified\r\nperson and a certificate, signed by two physicians, showing that\r\nthe physicians had examined the individual within ten days of\r\nadmission and determined that he was \"mentally ill.\"  Id., at 32. \r\nThe statute provided that during the sixty-day period, the\r\nindividual may request a hearing on the question of the need for\r\ninvoluntary treatment.  Id., at 30.  At the end of the sixty days,\r\nthe patient could be further detained if he voluntarily admitted\r\nhimself for an additional period or the director of the mental\r\nhealth facility obtained a court order authorizing the person's\r\n\"continued detention.\"  Id.  At the end of the initial sixty-day\r\nperiod, Waters voluntarily admitted himself for an additional seven\r\nmonths.  No formal court order of \"continued detention\" was ever\r\nobtained.  \r\nThe Second Circuit held that these procedures, \"whether\r\ntermed an 'admission' or a 'commitment' [by the legislature] . . .\r\nestablished 'commitment' procedures under New York state law, and\r\nWaters was 'committed' pursuant to those procedures.\"  Id., at 34. \r\nThe court noted that no formal judicial proceeding was required\r\nunder the state statute to detain a person beyond the initial sixty\r\ndays   a person could voluntarily admit himself to the institution\r\nfor an indefinite period.  Id., at 34.  The court went on to\r\nconclude that deeming the procedures at issue a \"commitment\" was\r\nconsistent with federal gun control policy, which seeks to prohibit\r\nthe possession of firearms by \"those with a potential for\r\nviolence.\"  Id., at 34-35.  \r\nThe procedures followed in this case, whether denominated\r\nas an \"involuntary admission\" or a \"commitment\" by the Maine\r\nLegislature, constituted in all functional respects a \"commitment\"\r\nfor purposes of  922(g)(4).  Chamberlain was involuntarily\r\nhospitalized based upon an application filed by a clinician at a\r\nmental hospital who stated that Chamberlain had put a loaded gun to\r\nhis head and threatened his wife.  Prior to admission, Chamberlain\r\nwas examined by a physician who certified, as required under Maine\r\nlaw in order to detain Chamberlain involuntarily, that Chamberlain\r\nsuffered from a mental illness and posed a danger to himself and\r\nothers.  A judicial officer reviewed the application and the\r\ncertification of the first physician, determined that they were\r\nprepared in accordance with law, and ordered that Chamberlain be\r\ndetained in a mental institution for five days.  A second physician\r\nexamined Chamberlain within twenty-four hours of admission and\r\ncertified that Chamberlain suffered from a mental illness and posed\r\na danger to himself and others.  During the five-day emergency\r\ndetention, Chamberlain was not free to go as he pleased.  In all\r\nrespects, then, we conclude that Chamberlain was formally\r\n\"committed\" to a mental institution.  See H.R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th\r\nCong., 2d Sess.(1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4410, 4421\r\n(noting that it would be unlawful to possess a firearm under the\r\nstatute if one has been formally committed, for example, pursuant\r\nto court order). \r\nWe reject Chamberlain's argument that a person is not\r\n\"committed\" for purposes of the federal firearms ban unless all of\r\nthe requirements set forth in section 3864   including provision of\r\ncounsel, a full-blown adversary hearing, a finding by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that the person suffers from a mental illness,\r\nand a judicial order of commitment   are satisfied.  Persons held\r\nunder section 3863 are involuntarily detained as surely as are\r\nthose held for longer periods under the more elaborate procedures\r\nof section 3864.  Moreover, to treat section 3864 detention as the\r\nonly \"real\" commitment would come close to limiting \"commitments\"\r\nto cases in which a person has actually been \"adjudicated a mental\r\ndefective\" after an adversary hearing.  18 U.S.C.  922(g)(4)\r\nseparately bans persons who have been \"adjudicated a mental\r\ndefective\" from owning firearms, in addition to those who have been\r\n\"committed to a mental institution.\"  In denying firearms to those\r\n\"committed to a mental institution,\" Congress appears to have cast\r\na wider net   to \"maximize the possibility of keeping firearms out\r\nof the hands of [,among others, persons suffering from mental\r\nillness].\"  See 114 Cong. Rec. 21784 (1968) (remarks of Congressman\r\nCeller).  Requiring an adversary hearing and a judicial finding of\r\nmental illness would conflate two of the categories Congress\r\nsingled out for the firearms prohibition. \r\nWe repeat that Congress deemed the potential for misuse\r\nof firearms or violence sufficient to bring various categories of\r\nindividuals within the firearms ban.  The legislative history\r\nnowhere suggests the need for showing \"clear and convincing\r\nevidence\" of dangerousness with regard to other categories of\r\nindividuals placed within the firearms ban   including those under\r\nindictment, convicted felons, drug abusers, illegal aliens, and\r\nthose who have renounced their citizenship.  To require a full-\r\nscale adversary proceeding and a finding, by clear and convincing\r\nevidence, that a person is mentally ill and poses a likelihood of\r\nharm to himself or others before giving effect to the firearms ban\r\nwould undermine Congress's judgment that risk or potential, not\r\nlikelihood, probability, or certainty, of violence is all that is\r\nrequired.\r\nNor does it appear that Congress intended that only\r\npersons conclusively found to be suffering from mental illnesses or\r\ndifficulties after having been afforded the fullest possible\r\npanoply of due process rights be deemed to have been \"committed to\r\na mental institution\" for purposes of the firearms ban.  That\r\nlevel of formality is not required for most of the categories\r\nCongress identified as within the firearms ban, including those who\r\nhave merely been indicted for a crime.  See 18 U.S.C.  922(n). \r\nWhen Congress has intended that a particular status triggering the\r\nfirearms ban be conditioned upon notice and the opportunity to be\r\nheard, along with other procedural rights, it has stated so\r\nexplicitly.  In 1994, for example, Congress amended the Gun Control\r\nAct to include within the firearms prohibition persons \r\nsubject to a court order that . . . restrains\r\nsuch person from harassing, stalking, or\r\nthreatening an intimate partner of such person\r\nor child of such intimate partner or person,\r\nor engaging in other conduct that would place\r\nan intimate partner in reasonable fear of\r\nbodily injury to the partner or child . . .\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  922(g)(8), Pub. L. 103-322,  110401(c).  Before the\r\nban can be applied against such persons, however, Congress required\r\nthat several procedural rights be provided, including a hearing at\r\nwhich the person has the opportunity to participate and a judicial\r\nfinding that such person \"represents a credible threat to the\r\nphysical safety of such intimate partner or child.\"  See \r\n922(g)(8)(A),(C).  See also 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1) (imposing the ban\r\nagainst those convicted of felony).  Congress imposed no such\r\nprocedural requirements with respect to determining those\r\n\"committed to a mental institution.\"  \r\nA further reason to find that the meaning Congress\r\nenvisioned for commitment encompasses Maine's five-day involuntary\r\nadmission procedure is that many patients of the type Congress\r\nwould not want to possess firearms may have undergone, like\r\nChamberlain, the five-day emergency detention under section 3863\r\nfollowed by a voluntary stay at the institution, rather than \r\nfollowed by a further involuntary detention there under section\r\n3864.  The initial five-day commitment requires, in both\r\nsituations, medical findings of dangerousness, although\r\nChamberlain's treatment at Acadia Hospital was thereafter prolonged\r\nbeyond the five days on a voluntary basis, permitting his continued\r\ntreatment without need for officials to request his additional\r\ninvoluntary commitment.  Were we to hold that the initial emergency\r\ncommitment was an insufficient basis for bringing him under the\r\nfederal weapons ban, Chamberlain and many like him would be\r\nexempted from the ban even though, in many instances, their mental\r\ncondition and potential for dangerousness might have been no\r\ndifferent from those whose additional hospitalization was under\r\nsection 3864 rather than being voluntary.\r\nWhile we conclude, therefore, that a five-day emergency\r\ndetention is a \"commitment\", and that it implicates the potential\r\nfor harm Congress sought to regulate under the firearms ban, we\r\nrealize the possibility of instances in which an initial commitment\r\nof this type may later be shown, in further state proceedings, to\r\nhave been mistaken.  This, however, is not such a case, hence we\r\nneed not decide to what extent subsequent proceedings before state\r\ntribunals may vitiate a five-day emergency detention for purposes\r\nof section 922(g)(4).  Here, Chamberlain voluntarily elected to\r\nremain at Acadia for more than a week after the initial five-day\r\nadmission period expired.  He does not contest the validity of his\r\nemergency admission, but only whether that admission constitutes a\r\nlegally sufficient \"commitment.\" \r\nWe also note that Chamberlain and others similarly\r\nsituated are provided by Congress with the administrative means to\r\ncontest and, in appropriate circumstances, to remove the firearms\r\nban Congress has imposed against those committed to a mental\r\ninstitution.  Department of Treasury v. Galioto, 477 U.S. 556, 559\r\n(1986).  See also Waters, 23 F.3d at 35.  Under 18 U.S.C.  925(c),\r\nsuch persons may apply to the Secretary of the Treasury for relief\r\nfrom the firearms ban.  The Secretary may grant relief\r\n     if it is established to his\r\n     satisfaction that the circumstances\r\n     regarding the disability, and the\r\n     applicant's record and reputation, are\r\n     such that the applicant will not be\r\n     likely to act in a manner dangerous to\r\n     public safety and that the granting of\r\n     the relief would not be contrary to the\r\n     public interest. \r\n\n18 U.S.C.  925(c).  See 27 C.F.R.  178.144 (describing procedures\r\nby which one may petition for relief).  These procedures allow a\r\nformerly committed person to challenge the continuing validity of\r\na determination that he suffers from a mental illness and is a\r\ndanger to himself or others.  Although he could have done so,\r\nChamberlain did not avail himself of this administrative remedy.  \r\nWe conclude that, under the circumstances presented here, \r\nChamberlain was \"committed\" to a mental institution for purposes of\r\nconviction under 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(4).   \r\nAffirmed.\r\n\n                        APPENDIX\r\n34-B M.R.S.A.  3863\r\n 3863 Emergency procedure \r\nA person may be admitted to a mental hospital on an\r\nemergency basis according to the following procedures.\r\n\n1. Application.  Any health officer, law enforcement\r\nofficer or other person may make a written application to admit a\r\nperson to a mental hospital . . . stating:\r\n\n  A. His belief that the person is mentally ill and,\r\nbecause of  his illness, poses a likelihood of serious harm; and\r\n\n  B. The grounds for this belief.\r\n\n2. Certifying Examination.  The written application shall\r\nbe accompanied by a dated certificate, signed by a licensed\r\nphysician or a licensed clinical psychologist, stating:\r\n\n A. The licensed physician or licensed clinical\r\npsychologist has examined the person on the date of the\r\ncertificate; and\r\n\n  B. He is of the opinion that the person is mentally ill\r\nand, because of his illness, poses a likelihood of serious harm.\r\n\n                      * * * * * *\r\n\n3. Judicial Review.  The application and accompanying\r\ncertificate must be reviewed by a Justice of the Superior Court,\r\nJudge of the District Court, Judge of Probate or a justice of the\r\npeace.\r\n\n  A. If the judge or justice finds the application and\r\naccompanying certificate to be regular and in accordance with the\r\nlaw, the judge or justice shall endorse them. \r\n\n  B. A person may not be held against the person's will\r\nin the hospital under this section, whether informally admitted \r\nunder section 3831 or sought to be involuntarily admitted under\r\nthis section, unless the application and certificate have been\r\nendorsed by a judge or justice, except that a person for whom an\r\nexaminer has executed the certificate under  subsection 2 may be\r\ndetained in a hospital for a reasonable period of time, not to\r\nexceed 18 hours, pending endorsement by a judge or justice, if:\r\n\n     (1) For a person informally admitted under section\r\n3831, the chief administrative officer of the hospital undertakes\r\nto secure the endorsement immediately upon execution of the\r\ncertificate by the examiner; and\r\n\n     (2) For a person sought to be involuntarily\r\nadmitted under this section, the person or persons transporting \r\nthe person sought to be involuntarily admitted to the hospital\r\nundertake to secure the endorsement immediately upon execution of\r\nthe certificate by the examiner.\r\n\n  C. Notwithstanding paragraph B, subparagraphs (1) and\r\n(2), a person sought to be admitted informally under section 3831\r\nor involuntarily under this section may be transported to a\r\nhospital and held for evaluation and treatment at a hospital\r\npending judicial endorsement of the application and certificate if\r\nthe endorsement is obtained between the soonest available hours of\r\n7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m.\r\n\n                     * * * * * *  \r\n\n5. Continuation of hospitalization.  If the chief\r\nadministrative officer of the hospital recommends further\r\nhospitalization of the person, the chief administrative officer\r\nshall determine the suitability of admission, care and treatment of\r\nthe patient as an informally admitted patient, as described in\r\nsection 3831.  \r\n\n  A. If the chief administrative officer of the hospital\r\ndetermines that admission of the person as an informally admitted\r\npatient is suitable, the chief administrative officer shall admit\r\nthe person on this basis, if the person so desires.\r\n\n  B. If the chief administrative officer of the hospital\r\ndetermines that admission of the person as an informally admitted\r\npatient is not suitable, or if the person declines admission as an\r\ninformally admitted patient, the chief administrative officer of\r\nthe hospital may seek involuntary commitment of the patient by\r\nfiling an application for the issuance of an order for\r\nhospitalization under section 3864, except that if the hospital is\r\na designated nonstate mental health institution and if the patient\r\nwas admitted under the contract between the hospital and the\r\ndepartment for receipt by the hospital of involuntary patients,\r\nthen the chief administrative officer may seek involuntary\r\ncommitment only by requesting the commissioner to file an\r\napplication for the issuance of an order for hospitalization under\r\nsection 3864.\r\n\n     (1) The application must be made to the District\r\nCourt having territorial jurisdiction over the hospital to which\r\nthe person was admitted on an emergency basis.\r\n\n     (2) The application must be filed within 5 days\r\nfrom the admission of the patient under this section, excluding the\r\nday of admission and any Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.\r\n\n  C. If neither readmission nor application to the\r\nDistrict Court is effected under this subsection, the chief\r\nadministrative officer of the hospital to which the person was\r\nadmitted on an emergency basis shall discharge the person\r\nimmediately.\r\n\n6. Notice.  Upon admission of a person under this\r\nsection, and after consultation with the person, the chief\r\nadministrative officer of the hospital shall notify, as soon as\r\npossible regarding the fact of admission, the person's:\r\n\n  A. Guardian, if known;\r\n\n  B. Spouse;\r\n\n  C. Parent;\r\n\n  D. Adult child; or\r\n\n  E. One of next of kin or a friend, if none of the other\r\npersons exist.\r\n\nIf the chief administrative officer has reason to believe that\r\nnotice to any individual in paragraphs A to E would pose risk of\r\nharm to the person admitted, then notice may not be given to that\r\nindividual.\r\n\n7. Post-admission examination.  Every patient admitted to\r\na hospital shall be examined as soon as practicable after his\r\nadmission.\r\n\n  A. The chief administrative officer of the hospital\r\nshall arrange for examination by a staff physician or licensed\r\nclinical psychologist of every patient hospitalized under this\r\nsection.\r\n\n  B. The examiner may not be the certifying examiner\r\nunder this section or under section 3864.\r\n\n  C. If the post-admission examination is not held within\r\n24 hours after the time of admission, or if a staff physician or\r\nlicensed clinical psychologist fails or refuses after the\r\nexamination to certify that, in his opinion, the person is mentally\r\nill and due to his mental illness poses a likelihood of serious\r\nharm, the person shall be immediately discharged.\r\n\n                      * * * * * *\r\n\n34-B M.R.S.A.  3864  \r\n\n 3864 Judicial procedure and commitment\r\n\n1.

A written statement, signed by the chief\r\nadministrative officer of the hospital, certifying that a copy of\r\nthe application and the accompanying documents have been given\r\npersonally to the patient and that the patient and the patient's\r\nguardian or next of kin have been notified of the patient's right\r\nto retain an attorney or to have an attorney appointed, of the\r\npatient's right to select or to have the patient's attorney select\r\nan independent examiner and regarding instructions on how to\r\ncontact the District Court; and\r\n\n  E. A copy of the notice and instructions given to the\r\npatient.\r\n\n2. Detention pending judicial determination. \r\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, a person,\r\nwith respect to whom an application for the issuance of an order of\r\nhospitalization has been filed,, may not be released or discharged\r\nduring the pendency of proceedings, unless:\r\n\n  A. The District Court orders release or discharge upon\r\nthe request of the patient, or the patient's guardian, parent,\r\nspouse or next of kin;\r\n\n  B. The District Court orders release or discharge upon\r\nthe report of the applicant that the person may be discharged with\r\nsafety;\r\n\n  C. A court orders release or discharge upon a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus under section 3804; or\r\n\n  D. Upon request of the commissioner, the District Court\r\norders the transfer of a patient in need of more specialized\r\ntreatment to another hospital.  In the event of a transfer, the\r\ncourt shall transfer its file to the District Court having\r\nterritorial jurisdiction over the receiving hospital.\r\n\n3. Notice of receipt of application.  The giving of\r\nnotice of receipt of application and date of hearing under this\r\nsection is governed as follows.\r\n\n  A.

A docket entry is sufficient evidence that notice\r\nunder this subsection has been given.\r\n\n4. Examination.  Examinations under this section are\r\ngoverned as follows.\r\n\n  A. Upon receipt by the District Court of the\r\napplication and the accompanying documents specified in subsection\r\n1 and at least 3 days after the person who is the subject of the\r\nexamination was notified by the hospital of the proceedings and of\r\nthat person's right to retain counsel or to select an examiner, the\r\ncourt shall cause the person to be examined by 2 examiners.\r\n\n     (1) Each examiner must be either a licensed\r\nphysician or a licensed clinical psychologist.\r\n\n     (2) One of the examiners must be a physician or\r\npsychologist chosen by the person or by that person's counsel, if\r\nthe chosen physician or psychologist is reasonably available.\r\n\n     (3) Neither examiner appointed by the court may \r\nbe the certifying examiner under section 3863, subsection 2 or 7.\r\n\n  B. The examination shall be held at the hospital or at\r\nany other suitable place not likely to have a harmful effect on the\r\nmental health of the person.\r\n\n  C. If the report of the examiners is to the effect that\r\nthe person is not mentally ill or does not pose a likelihood of\r\nserious harm, the application shall be ordered discharged\r\nforthwith.\r\n\n  D. If the report of the examiners is to the effect that\r\nthe person is mentally ill or poses a likelihood of serious harm,\r\nthe hearing shall be held on the date, or on the continued date,\r\nwhich the court has set for the hearing.\r\n\n5. Hearing.  Hearings under this section are governed as\r\nfollows.\r\n\n  A.

The hearing must be conducted in as informal a\r\nmanner as may be consistent with orderly procedure and in a\r\nphysical setting not likely to have harmful effect on the mental\r\nhealth of the person. \r\n\n                      * * * * * *\r\n\n  C. The court shall receive all relevant and material\r\nevidence which may be offered in accordance with accepted rules of\r\nevidence and accepted judicial dispositions.\r\n\n     (1) The person, the applicant and all other\r\npersons to whom notice is required to be sent shall be afforded an\r\nopportunity to appear at the hearing to testify and to present and\r\ncross-examine witnesses.\r\n\n     (2) The court may, in its discretion, receive the\r\ntestimony of any other person and may subpoena any witness.\r\n\n  D. The person shall be afforded an opportunity to be\r\nrepresented by counsel, and, if neither the person nor others\r\nprovide counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the person.\r\n\n  E. In addition to proving that the patient is a\r\nmentally ill individual, the applicant shall show:\r\n\n     (1) By evidence of the patient's actions and\r\nbehavior, that the patient poses a likelihood of serious harm; and\r\n\n     (2) That, after full consideration of less\r\nrestrictive treatment settings and modalities, inpatient\r\nhospitalization is the best available means for the treatment of\r\nthe person.\r\n\n  F.  In each case, the applicant shall submit to the\r\ncourt, at the time of the hearing, testimony, including expert\r\npsychiatric testimony, indicating the individual treatment plan to\r\nbe followed by the hospital staff, if the person is committed under\r\nthis section, and shall bear any expense for witnesses for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\n                      * * * * * *\r\n\n6. Court findings.  Procedures dealing with the District\r\nCourt's findings under this section are as follows.\r\n\n  A. The District Court shall so state in the record, if\r\nit finds upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the\r\nrecord:\r\n\n     (1) Clear and convincing evidence that the person\r\nis mentally ill and that the person's recent actions and behavior\r\ndemonstrate that the person's illness poses a likelihood of serious\r\nharm;\r\n\n     (2) That inpatient hospitalization is the best\r\navailable means for treatment of the patient; and\r\n\n     (3) That it is satisfied with the individual\r\ntreatment plan offered by the hospital to which the applicant seeks\r\nthe patient's involuntary commitment.\r\n\n                      * * * * * *\r\n\n7. Commitment.  Upon making the findings described in\r\nsubsection 6, the court may order a commitment to a hospital for a\r\nperiod not to exceed 4 months in the first instance and not to\r\nexceed one year after the first and all subsequent hearings.  \r\n\n  A. The court may issue an order of commitment\r\nimmediately after the completion of the hearing, or it may take the\r\nmatter under advisement and issue an order within 24 hours of the\r\nhearing.\r\n\n  B. If the court does not issue an order of commitment\r\nwithin 24 hours of the completion of the hearing, it shall dismiss\r\nthe application and order the patient discharged immediately.\r\n\n8. Continued involuntary hospitalization.  If the chief\r\nadministrative officer of the hospital to which a person has been\r\ncommitted involuntarily by the District Court recommends that\r\ncontinued involuntary hospitalization is necessary for that person,\r\nthe chief administrative officer shall notify the commissioner. \r\nThe commissioner may then, not later than 30 days prior to the\r\nexpiration of a period of commitment ordered by the court, make\r\napplication in accordance with this section to the District Court\r\nthat has territorial jurisdiction over the hospital designated for \r\ntreatment in the application by the commissioner for a hearing to\r\nbe held under this section.\r\n\n                      * * * * * * \r\n\n11.

Under Maine law, Chamberlain had earlier been involuntarily admitted for five days, on an emergency basis, to a Maine mental hospital.  Chamberlain moved to dismiss the federal information, contending that his involuntary emergency admission was not, as a matter of law, a \"commitment\" to a mental institution as required for conviction under &#167; 922(g)(4).  The district court denied the motion.  Chamberlain entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to challenge on appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss.

The federal district court held that Chamberlain's five-day involuntary admission, which was followed by his continued admission on a voluntary basis, constituted a \"commitment\" for purposes of the federal firearms ban.  Chamberlain contends that his five-day emergency detention under Maine law fell short of amounting to a \"commitment,\" and that only detention under an involuntary commitment order obtained pursuant to section 3864, note 3, supra, would have constituted a \"commitment\" allowing conviction under the federal firearms statute.

Consistent with this broad purpose, Congress did not limit the firearms prohibition only to those who had already committed dangerous or violent acts.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(n) (prohibiting possession of firearms by any person under indictment for crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether crime was violent or not);  id., &#167; 922(g)(1) (prohibiting possession of firearms by felons, whether or not convicted of a crime of violence).

Congress considered the mere risk or potential for violence or irresponsible use sufficient reason to prohibit certain categories of persons from possessing firearms.  See Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 112 n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 986 (\"Congress' intent in enacting &#167; 922(g) ... was to keep firearms out of the hands of presumptively risky people.\");  Barrett v.

As for an individual adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution, \"Congress obviously felt that such a person, though unfortunate, was too much of a risk to be allowed firearms privileges.\"  Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 116, 103 S.Ct. 986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In enacting the federal firearms ban, Congress had a second purpose in mind--national uniformity in determinations of whether a person is within a category covered by the firearms prohibition.

The Dickerson Court noted that giving effect to the intricacies of varying state statutes would \"seriously hamper effective enforcement of [the firearms ban].\"  Id. at 121, 103 S.Ct. 986.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>C. \"Commitment\" Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(4)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chamberlain does not deny that Maine's procedural requirements for an emergency involuntary hospitalization pursuant to 34-B M.R.S.A. &#167; 3863 were met in his case.  He contends, however, that his preliminary five-day involuntary hospitalization, which was followed by his voluntary admission to the same institution on an informal basis for an additional eight days, did not amount to a \"commitment\" sufficient for conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(4).  He argues that a person can be deemed \"committed\" under Maine law for purposes of the federal firearms ban only after notice and issuance by a state judge of a formal order of commitment following a full hearing at which the person has had the opportunity to be heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, Congress itself has not defined the term \"commitment.\"   However, in ordinary usage, \"commitment\" means \"to place in or send officially to confinement ... to consign legally to a mental institution....\"  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1971).  In that sense, Chamberlain's \"involuntary admission\" under section 3863 would seem no different from a \"commitment.\"   In urging us to interpret \"commitment\" so as to exclude an initial five-day emergency detention, Chamberlain relies upon the maxim that an \"ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\"  Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971);  United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971).  The rule of lenity serves important goals, including allowing fair warning as to what conduct is criminal and punishable, and is \"the product of an awareness that legislators and not the courts should define criminal activity.\"  Huddleston, 415 U.S. at 814, 94 S.Ct. 1262.   As the Huddleston Court noted, however, \"[z]eal in forwarding these laudable policies ... must not be permitted to shadow the understanding that '[s]ound rules of statutory interpretation exist to discover and not to direct the Congressional will.' \"  Id. (quoting United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 542, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443 (1943)).  \"Although penal laws are to be construed strictly, they 'ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.' \"  Huddleston, 415 U.S. at 814, 94 S.Ct. 1262 (quoting American Fur Co. v. United States, 27 U.S. 358, 2 Pet. 358, 367, 7 L.Ed. 450 (1829)).  We believe that Congress's intent can reasonably be ascertained in this case and that Chamberlain's restrictive interpretation of \"commitment\" would defeat the \"broad prophylactic purpose,\" Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 118, 103 S.Ct. 986, of the federal firearms ban.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chamberlain focuses first on the fact that section 3863 of the Maine statute uses only the phrase \"involuntary admission\" with respect to the five-day emergency detention in issue, whereas section 3864 speaks expressly of \"commitment\" in regard to the longer-term detention discussed there.  He argues that we owe this difference in terminology \"great deference.\"   We find no evidence, however, that the Maine Legislature consciously used the \"involuntary admission\" language to distinguish between that and a \"commitment.\"   To the contrary, the legislature has used the terms \"admission\" and \"commitment\" interchangeably.  Section 3864(1)refers to the post-emergency application filed by the chief administrative officer of the hospital under &#167; 3863(5)(B)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>--filed pursuant to a procedure Chamberlain urges us to interpret as a \"commitment\"--as an application \"to admit\" a person to a mental hospital.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  This legislative imprecision undermines Chamberlain's attempt to find an important meaning in the difference in terminology here.  Chamberlain's argument likewise finds no support in the opinions of the Maine courts concerning the involuntary hospitalization statutes and their predecessors.  The Maine Supreme Court has at times characterized the initial involuntary hospitalization under &#167; 3863 as a \"commitment,\" see, e.g., In re Faucher, 558 A.2d 705, 706 (Me.1989), and at other times has characterized the same procedure as one for \"emergency admittance,\" Sukeforth v. Thegen, 256 A.2d 162 (Me.1969).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the Maine Legislature had been more precise in its use of the two terms, we would be faced with the question of how far to rely upon the language chosen by the state legislature in interpreting \"commitment\" for purposes of the federal firearms ban.  We would hesitate to convert a question of federal law into one solely of state law, as such an approach could destroy the uniformity Congress sought in enacting section 922(g)(4).  State statutes tend to vary widely as to the language chosen to describe the process of involuntary hospitalization.  Compare, e.g., Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 123, &#167; 12(e)(referring to a ten-day emergency involuntary hospitalization, similar to section 3863's five-day detention, as a \"commitment\") with 34-B M.R.S.A. &#167; 3863(1)(characterizing emergency procedure as \"admission\").  Were we to focus solely on whether or not the term \"commitment\" is used, a patient in Massachusetts admitted on an emergency basis would be deemed \"committed\" for purposes of conviction under the federal firearms ban, while a patient involuntarily hospitalized in Maine in identical circumstances would not.  This is precisely the sort of \"national patchwork,\" Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 122, 103 S.Ct. 986, Congress sought to avoid in enacting the firearms ban.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his narrow interpretation of \"commitment,\" Chamberlain relies primarily upon Giardina and Hansel.   In those cases, the courts indeed relied upon the words chosen by the respective state legislatures in concluding that no \"commitment\" had occurred.  In Giardina, petitioner was involuntarily hospitalized for two weeks pursuant to a Louisiana statute allowing detention of persons based upon a \"Physician's Emergency Certificate\" stating that the person is \"mentally ill.\"   The Eighth Circuit carefully examined the language used by the Louisiana Legislature in both the then-existing and superseded versions of the involuntary hospitalization statutes, and concluded that since no \"commitment\"--as the process had been characterized by the state legislature--had occurred, no \"commitment\" had taken place for purposes of the federal firearms ban.  861 F.2d at 1336.   In Hansel, the Fifth Circuit followed a similar course.  The court concluded that since the Texas statute at issue did not characterize Hansel's involuntary detention as a \"commitment,\" no \"commitment\" had occurred pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922.  474 F.2d at 1122-23.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With all respect, we believe that the proper interpretation of the phrase, \"committed to a mental institution,\" should not turn primarily on the label attached by the state legislature to its procedures, but rather on the substance of those procedures.  Thus, rather than focus on the nuances of state statutory language in interpreting \"commitment,\" we look at the realities of the state procedures and construe them in light of the purposes Congress sought to accomplish by prohibiting firearm possession by someone who has been \"committed to a mental institution.\"   We ask whether identifying the state's procedures for involuntary hospitalization as a \"commitment\" is reasonable and consistent with the federal policy underlying the firearms ban--namely, to keep firearms out of the hands of those who, if permitted to possess them, would pose a risk or potential for harm.  See Waters, 23 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this reason, we respectfully decline to follow the approach of Giardina and Hansel, the cases on which Chamberlain primarily relies.  Our approach is similar to the analysis of the Second Circuit in Waters.   In Waters, petitioner was involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to a New York statute similar in many respects to the Maine statute under consideration.  The statute allowed for the \"involuntary admission\" of an individual for sixty days based upon an application of a relative or other qualified person and a certificate, signed by two physicians, showing that the physicians had examined the individual within ten days of admission and determined that he was \"mentally ill.\"  Id., at 32.   The statute provided that during the sixty-day period, the individual may request a hearing on the question of the need for involuntary treatment.  Id. at 30.   At the end of the sixty days, the patient could be further detained if he voluntarily admitted himself for an additional period or the director of the mental health facility obtained a court order authorizing the person's \"continued detention.\"  Id. At the end of the initial sixty-day period, Waters voluntarily admitted himself for an additional seven months.  No formal court order of \"continued detention\" was ever obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit held that these procedures, \"whether termed an 'admission' or a 'commitment' [by the legislature] ... established 'commitment' procedures under New York state law, and Waters was 'committed' pursuant to those procedures.\"  Id. at 34.   The court noted that no formal judicial proceeding was required under the state statute to detain a person beyond the initial sixty days--a person could voluntarily admit himself to the institution for an indefinite period.  Id. at 34.   The court went on to conclude that deeming the procedures at issue a \"commitment\" was consistent with federal gun control policy, which seeks to prohibit the possession of firearms by \"those with a potential for violence.\"  Id. at 34-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedures followed in this case, whether denominated as an \"involuntary admission\" or a \"commitment\" by the Maine Legislature, constituted in all functional respects a \"commitment\" for purposes of &#167; 922(g)(4).  Chamberlain was involuntarily hospitalized based upon an application filed by a clinician at a mental hospital who stated that Chamberlain had put a loaded gun to his head and threatened his wife.  Prior to admission, Chamberlain was examined by a physician who certified, as required under Maine law in order to detain Chamberlain involuntarily, that Chamberlain suffered from a mental illness and posed a danger to himself and others.  A judicial officer reviewed the application and the certification of the first physician, determined that they were prepared in accordance with law, and ordered that Chamberlain be detained in a mental institution for five days.  A second physician examined Chamberlain within twenty-four hours of admission and certified that Chamberlain suffered from a mental illness and posed a danger to himself and others.  During the five-day emergency detention, Chamberlain was not free to go as he pleased.  In all respects, then, we conclude that Chamberlain was formally \"committed\" to a mental institution.  See H.R.Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess.  (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4410, 4421 (noting that it would be unlawful to possess a firearm under the statute if one has been formally committed, for example, pursuant to court order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Chamberlain's argument that a person is not \"committed\" for purposes of the federal firearms ban unless all of the requirements set forth in section 3864--including provision of counsel, a full-blown adversary hearing, a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the person suffers from a mental illness, and a judicial order of commitment--are satisfied.  Persons held under section 3863 are involuntarily detained as surely as are those held for longer periods under the more elaborate procedures of section 3864.  Moreover, to treat section 3864 detention as the only \"real\" commitment would come close to limiting \"commitments\" to cases in which a person has actually been \"adjudicated a mental defective\" after an adversary hearing.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(4) separately bans persons who have been \"adjudicated a mental defective\" from owning firearms, in addition to those who have been \"committed to a mental institution.\"   In denying firearms to those \"committed to a mental institution,\" Congress appears to have cast a wider net--to \"maximize the possibility of keeping firearms out of the hands of [, among others, persons suffering from mental illness].\"  See 114 Cong. Rec. 21784 (1968) (remarks of Congressman Celler).  Requiring an adversary hearing and a judicial finding of mental illness would conflate two of the categories Congress singled out for the firearms prohibition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repeat that Congress deemed the potential for misuse of firearms or violence sufficient to bring various categories of individuals within the firearms ban.  The legislative history nowhere suggests the need for showing \"clear and convincing evidence\" of dangerousness with regard to other categories of individuals placed within the firearms ban--including those under indictment, convicted felons, drug abusers, illegal aliens, and those who have renounced their citizenship.  To require a full-scale adversary proceeding and a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that a person is mentally ill and poses a likelihood of harm to himself or others before giving effect to the firearms ban would undermine Congress's judgment that risk or potential, not likelihood, probability, or certainty, of violence is all that is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does it appear that Congress intended that only persons conclusively found to be suffering from mental illnesses or difficulties after having been afforded the fullest possible panoply of due process rights be deemed to have been \"committed to a mental institution\" for purposes of the firearms ban.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  That level of formality is not required for most of the categories Congress identified as within the firearms ban, including those who have merely been indicted for a crime.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(n).  When Congress has intended that a particular status triggering the firearms ban be conditioned upon notice and the opportunity to be heard, along with other procedural rights, it has stated so explicitly.  In 1994, for example, Congress amended the Gun Control Act to include within the firearms prohibition persons</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>subject to a court order that ... restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(8), Pub.L. 103-322, &#167; 110401(c).  Before the ban can be applied against such persons, however, Congress required that several procedural rights be provided, including a hearing at which the person has the opportunity to participate and a judicial finding that such person \"represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child.\"   See &#167;&#167; 922(g)(8)(A),(C).  See also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (imposing the ban against those convicted of felony).  Congress imposed no such procedural requirements with respect to determining those \"committed to a mental institution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further reason to find that the meaning Congress envisioned for commitment encompasses Maine's five-day involuntary admission procedure is that many patients of the type Congress would not want to possess firearms may have undergone, like Chamberlain, the five-day emergency detention under section 3863 followed by a voluntary stay at the institution, rather than followed by a further involuntary detention there under section 3864.  The initial five-day commitment requires, in both situations, medical findings of dangerousness, although Chamberlain's treatment at Acadia Hospital was thereafter prolonged beyond the five days on a voluntary basis, permitting his continued treatment without need for officials to request his additional involuntary commitment.  Were we to hold that the initial emergency commitment was an insufficient basis for bringing him under the federal weapons ban, Chamberlain and many like him would be exempted from the ban even though, in many instances, their mental condition and potential for dangerousness might have been no different from those whose additional hospitalization was under section 3864 rather than being voluntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we conclude, therefore, that a five-day emergency detention is a \"commitment\", and that it implicates the potential for harm Congress sought to regulate under the firearms ban, we realize the possibility of instances in which an initial commitment of this type may later be shown, in further state proceedings, to have been mistaken.  This, however, is not such a case, hence we need not decide to what extent subsequent proceedings before state tribunals may vitiate a five-day emergency detention for purposes of section 922(g)(4).  Here, Chamberlain voluntarily elected to remain at Acadia for more than a week after the initial five-day admission period expired.  He does not contest the validity of his emergency admission, but only whether that admission constitutes a legally sufficient \"commitment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that Chamberlain and others similarly situated are provided by Congress with the administrative means to contest and, in appropriate circumstances, to remove the firearms ban Congress has imposed against those committed to a mental institution.  Department of Treasury v. Galioto, 477 U.S. 556, 559, 106 S.Ct. 2683, 91 L.Ed.2d 459 (1986).  See also Waters, 23 F.3d at 35.   Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 925(c), such persons may apply to the Secretary of the Treasury for relief from the firearms ban.  The Secretary may grant relief</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>if it is established to his satisfaction that the circumstances regarding the disability, and the applicant's record and reputation, are such that the applicant will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 925(c).  See 27 C.F.R. &#167; 178.144 (describing procedures by which one may petition for relief).  These procedures allow a formerly committed person to challenge the continuing validity of a determination that he suffers from a mental illness and is a danger to himself or others.  Although he could have done so, Chamberlain did not avail himself of this administrative remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, under the circumstances presented here, Chamberlain was \"committed\" to a mental institution for purposes of conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.APPENDIX</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">34-B M.R.S.A. &#167; 3863</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 3863 Emergency procedure</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person may be admitted to a mental hospital on an emergency basis according to the following procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Three years later, Congress amended Chapter 44 of Title 18.  See Pub.L. No. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449 (1986).  Among the amendments was a revision of &#167; 921(a)(20), by which Congress required that \"conviction\" be defined under the law of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted and providing that a conviction which has been expunged is not a \"conviction\" for purposes of the firearms ban.  As we have noted, however, \"[t]hat congressional action ... reflects not a disagreement with the Court's reasoning, but merely that Congress determined that its legislative objectives would be better served by defining 'conviction' by reference to state law.\"  United States v. Cuevas, 75 F.3d 778, 782 (1st Cir.1996).  See also Yanez-Popp v. INS, 998 F.2d 231, 236 (4th Cir.1993)(\"[Dickerson ] still stands for the general proposition that federal law governs the application of Congressional statutes in the absence of plain language to the contrary.\").  Congress' decision to overrule the particular result reached in Dickerson reflects a \"deliberate choice,\" Cuevas, 75 F.3d at 782, to define \"conviction\" by reference to state law.  Congress has not made the same choice with respect to the term \"commitment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> As noted supra, Section 3863(5)(B) outlines the procedure whereby a chief administrative officer may seek the continued detention of a patient beyond the initial five-day emergency period, in cases in which the patient is not admitted informally on a voluntary basis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Section 3864(1) states, in relevant part:  \"An application to the District Court to admit a person to a mental hospital, filed under section 3863, subsection 5, paragraph B, shall be accompanied by ...\" (emphasis supplied)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> If the terminology points in any direction, it would be in favor of a conclusion that the emergency procedure with which we are concerned is a commitment.  The district court focused in part on the dictionary definitions of \"admit\" and \"commit.\"   It noted that \"admission\" implies a voluntary or permissive entry, whereas \"commitment\" denotes involuntary action of some kind.  Section 3863 specifically speaks of \"involuntary admission\" in several places.  The district court reasoned that it makes little sense to speak of an \"involuntary admission\" as a voluntary act.  Like the district court, we see little practical difference between a \"commitment\" and an \"involuntary admission.\"   A person involuntarily admitted under section 3863 is in the same posture as if he were committed pursuant to a formal court order following a hearing--he is not free to leave the institution</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> In Hansel, the defendant was found at the time of his admission to have no serious mental illness and was also found not to be in need of hospitalization.  474 F.2d at 1123.   Thus, although we disagree with the approach taken by the Eighth Circuit, the court's conclusion that no \"commitment\" had occurred seems consistent with federal policy.  According to hospital personnel, Hansel posed no risk or potential for harm due to mental illness or instability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Although he mounts no challenge to the constitutionality of Maine's involuntary commitment procedures, Chamberlain argues that since he, unlike Waters, was not able to secure a hearing to challenge his hospitalization during the five-day emergency detention period, he cannot be deemed to have been \"committed\" for purposes of &#167; 922(g)(4).  But while it is true that New York law, which allows emergency detentions for up to sixty days, provides for the right to request a hearing, Maine's law, which provides for a much shorter emergency detention, requires automatic judicial involvement in the process of involuntary hospitalization.  It also provides for examination and certification by two medical professionals.  In the instant case, moreover, Chamberlain voluntarily prolonged his own hospitalization following the five-day involuntary admission.  He did not claim then, nor does he now contend, that the stated grounds for his commitment were invalid</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Chamberlain contends that his five-day emergency detention under Maine law fell short of amounting to a \"commitment,\" and that only detention under an involuntary commitment order obtained pursuant to section 3864, note 3, supra, would have constituted a \"commitment\" allowing conviction under the federal firearms statute.

He argues that we owe this difference in terminology \"great deference.\"   We find no evidence, however, that the Maine Legislature consciously used the \"involuntary admission\" language to distinguish between that and a \"commitment.\"   To the contrary, the legislature has used the terms \"admission\" and \"commitment\" interchangeably.  Section 3864(1)refers to the post-emergency application filed by the chief administrative officer of the hospital under &#167; 3863(5)(B)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>--filed pursuant to a procedure Chamberlain urges us to interpret as a \"commitment\"--as an application \"to admit\" a person to a mental hospital.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  This legislative imprecision undermines Chamberlain's attempt to find an important meaning in the difference in terminology here.  Chamberlain's argument likewise finds no support in the opinions of the Maine courts concerning the involuntary hospitalization statutes and their predecessors.  The Maine Supreme Court has at times characterized the initial involuntary hospitalization under &#167; 3863 as a \"commitment,\" see, e.g., In re Faucher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277088\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277088/in-re-faucher/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 706 (Me.1989), and at other times has characterized the same procedure as one for \"emergency admittance,\" Sukeforth v. Thegen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1957992\"><a href=\"/opinion/1957992/sukeforth-v-thegen/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span> (Me.1969).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the Maine Legislature had been more precise in its use of the two terms, we would be faced with the question of how far to rely upon the language chosen by the state legislature in interpreting \"commitment\" for purposes of the federal firearms ban.  We would hesitate to convert a question of federal law into one solely of state law, as such an approach could destroy the uniformity Congress sought in enacting section 922(g)(4).  State statutes tend to vary widely as to the language chosen to describe the process of involuntary hospitalization.  Compare, e.g., Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 123, &#167; 12(e)(referring to a ten-day emergency involuntary hospitalization, similar to section 3863's five-day detention, as a \"commitment\") with 34-B M.R.S.A. &#167; 3863(1)(characterizing emergency procedure as \"admission\").  Were we to focus solely on whether or not the term \"commitment\" is used, a patient in Massachusetts admitted on an emergency basis would be deemed \"committed\" for purposes of conviction under the federal firearms ban, while a patient involuntarily hospitalized in Maine in identical circumstances would not.  This is precisely the sort of \"national patchwork,\" Dickerson, 460 U.S. at 122, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110876\"><a href=\"/opinion/110876/dickerson-v-new-banner-institute-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span>, Congress sought to avoid in enacting the firearms ban.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his narrow interpretation of \"commitment,\" Chamberlain relies primarily upon Giardina and Hansel.   In those cases, the courts indeed relied upon the words chosen by the respective state legislatures in concluding that no \"commitment\" had occurred.  In Giardina, petitioner was involuntarily hospitalized for two weeks pursuant to a Louisiana statute allowing detention of persons based upon a \"Physician's Emergency Certificate\" stating that the person is \"mentally ill.\"   The Eighth Circuit carefully examined the language used by the Louisiana Legislature in both the then-existing and superseded versions of the involuntary hospitalization statutes, and concluded that since no \"commitment\"--as the process had been characterized by the state legislature--had occurred, no \"commitment\" had taken place for purposes of the federal firearms ban.  861 F.2d at 1336.   In Hansel, the Fifth Circuit followed a similar course.  The court concluded that since the Texas statute at issue did not characterize Hansel's involuntary detention as a \"commitment,\" no \"commitment\" had occurred pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922.  474 F.2d at 1122-23.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With all respect, we believe that the proper interpretation of the phrase, \"committed to a mental institution,\" should not turn primarily on the label attached by the state legislature to its procedures, but rather on the substance of those procedures.  Thus, rather than focus on the nuances of state statutory language in interpreting \"commitment,\" we look at the realities of the state procedures and construe them in light of the purposes Congress sought to accomplish by prohibiting firearm possession by someone who has been \"committed to a mental institution.\"   We ask whether identifying the state's procedures for involuntary hospitalization as a \"commitment\" is reasonable and consistent with the federal policy underlying the firearms ban--namely, to keep firearms out of the hands of those who, if permitted to possess them, would pose a risk or potential for harm.  See Waters, 23 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this reason, we respectfully decline to follow the approach of Giardina and Hansel, the cases on which Chamberlain primarily relies.  Our approach is similar to the analysis of the Second Circuit in Waters.   In Waters, petitioner was involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to a New York statute similar in many respects to the Maine statute under consideration.  The statute allowed for the \"involuntary admission\" of an individual for sixty days based upon an application of a relative or other qualified person and a certificate, signed by two physicians, showing that the physicians had examined the individual within ten days of admission and determined that he was \"mentally ill.\"  Id., at 32.   The statute provided that during the sixty-day period, the individual may request a hearing on the question of the need for involuntary treatment.  Id. at 30.   At the end of the sixty days, the patient could be further detained if he voluntarily admitted himself for an additional period or the director of the mental health facility obtained a court order authorizing the person's \"continued detention.\"  Id. At the end of the initial sixty-day period, Waters voluntarily admitted himself for an additional seven months.  No formal court order of \"continued detention\" was ever obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit held that these procedures, \"whether termed an 'admission' or a 'commitment' [by the legislature] ... established 'commitment' procedures under New York state law, and Waters was 'committed' pursuant to those procedures.\"  Id. at 34.   The court noted that no formal judicial proceeding was required under the state statute to detain a person beyond the initial sixty days--a person could voluntarily admit himself to the institution for an indefinite period.  Id. at 34.   The court went on to conclude that deeming the procedures at issue a \"commitment\" was consistent with federal gun control policy, which seeks to prohibit the possession of firearms by \"those with a potential for violence.\"  Id. at 34-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedures followed in this case, whether denominated as an \"involuntary admission\" or a \"commitment\" by the Maine Legislature, constituted in all functional respects a \"commitment\" for purposes of &#167; 922(g)(4).  Chamberlain was involuntarily hospitalized based upon an application filed by a clinician at a mental hospital who stated that Chamberlain had put a loaded gun to his head and threatened his wife.  Prior to admission, Chamberlain was examined by a physician who certified, as required under Maine law in order to detain Chamberlain involuntarily, that Chamberlain suffered from a mental illness and posed a danger to himself and others.  A judicial officer reviewed the application and the certification of the first physician, determined that they were prepared in accordance with law, and ordered that Chamberlain be detained in a mental institution for five days.  A second physician examined Chamberlain within twenty-four hours of admission and certified that Chamberlain suffered from a mental illness and posed a danger to himself and others.  During the five-day emergency detention, Chamberlain was not free to go as he pleased.  In all respects, then, we conclude that Chamberlain was formally \"committed\" to a mental institution.  See H.R.Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess.  (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4410, 4421 (noting that it would be unlawful to possess a firearm under the statute if one has been formally committed, for example, pursuant to court order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Chamberlain's argument that a person is not \"committed\" for purposes of the federal firearms ban unless all of the requirements set forth in section 3864--including provision of counsel, a full-blown adversary hearing, a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the person suffers from a mental illness, and a judicial order of commitment--are satisfied.  Persons held under section 3863 are involuntarily detained as surely as are those held for longer periods under the more elaborate procedures of section 3864.  Moreover, to treat section 3864 detention as the only \"real\" commitment would come close to limiting \"commitments\" to cases in which a person has actually been \"adjudicated a mental defective\" after an adversary hearing.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(4) separately bans persons who have been \"adjudicated a mental defective\" from owning firearms, in addition to those who have been \"committed to a mental institution.\"   In denying firearms to those \"committed to a mental institution,\" Congress appears to have cast a wider net--to \"maximize the possibility of keeping firearms out of the hands of [, among others, persons suffering from mental illness].\"  See 114 Cong. Rec. 21784 (1968) (remarks of Congressman Celler).  Requiring an adversary hearing and a judicial finding of mental illness would conflate two of the categories Congress singled out for the firearms prohibition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repeat that Congress deemed the potential for misuse of firearms or violence sufficient to bring various categories of individuals within the firearms ban.  The legislative history nowhere suggests the need for showing \"clear and convincing evidence\" of dangerousness with regard to other categories of individuals placed within the firearms ban--including those under indictment, convicted felons, drug abusers, illegal aliens, and those who have renounced their citizenship.  To require a full-scale adversary proceeding and a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that a person is mentally ill and poses a likelihood of harm to himself or others before giving effect to the firearms ban would undermine Congress's judgment that risk or potential, not likelihood, probability, or certainty, of violence is all that is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does it appear that Congress intended that only persons conclusively found to be suffering from mental illnesses or difficulties after having been afforded the fullest possible panoply of due process rights be deemed to have been \"committed to a mental institution\" for purposes of the firearms ban.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  That level of formality is not required for most of the categories Congress identified as within the firearms ban, including those who have merely been indicted for a crime.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(n).  When Congress has intended that a particular status triggering the firearms ban be conditioned upon notice and the opportunity to be heard, along with other procedural rights, it has stated so explicitly.  In 1994, for example, Congress amended the Gun Control Act to include within the firearms prohibition persons</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>subject to a court order that ... restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(8), Pub.L. 103-322, &#167; 110401(c).  Before the ban can be applied against such persons, however, Congress required that several procedural rights be provided, including a hearing at which the person has the opportunity to participate and a judicial finding that such person \"represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child.\"   See &#167;&#167; 922(g)(8)(A),(C).  See also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (imposing the ban against those convicted of felony).  Congress imposed no such procedural requirements with respect to determining those \"committed to a mental institution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further reason to find that the meaning Congress envisioned for commitment encompasses Maine's five-day involuntary admission procedure is that many patients of the type Congress would not want to possess firearms may have undergone, like Chamberlain, the five-day emergency detention under section 3863 followed by a voluntary stay at the institution, rather than followed by a further involuntary detention there under section 3864.  The initial five-day commitment requires, in both situations, medical findings of dangerousness, although Chamberlain's treatment at Acadia Hospital was thereafter prolonged beyond the five days on a voluntary basis, permitting his continued treatment without need for officials to request his additional involuntary commitment.  Were we to hold that the initial emergency commitment was an insufficient basis for bringing him under the federal weapons ban, Chamberlain and many like him would be exempted from the ban even though, in many instances, their mental condition and potential for dangerousness might have been no different from those whose additional hospitalization was under section 3864 rather than being voluntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we conclude, therefore, that a five-day emergency detention is a \"commitment\", and that it implicates the potential for harm Congress sought to regulate under the firearms ban, we realize the possibility of instances in which an initial commitment of this type may later be shown, in further state proceedings, to have been mistaken.  This, however, is not such a case, hence we need not decide to what extent subsequent proceedings before state tribunals may vitiate a five-day emergency detention for purposes of section 922(g)(4).  Here, Chamberlain voluntarily elected to remain at Acadia for more than a week after the initial five-day admission period expired.  He does not contest the validity of his emergency admission, but only whether that admission constitutes a legally sufficient \"commitment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that Chamberlain and others similarly situated are provided by Congress with the administrative means to contest and, in appropriate circumstances, to remove the firearms ban Congress has imposed against those committed to a mental institution.

The district court focused in part on the dictionary definitions of \"admit\" and \"commit.\"   It noted that \"admission\" implies a voluntary or permissive entry, whereas \"commitment\" denotes involuntary action of some kind.  Section 3863 specifically speaks of \"involuntary admission\" in several places.  The district court reasoned that it makes little sense to speak of an \"involuntary admission\" as a voluntary act.  Like the district court, we see little practical difference between a \"commitment\" and an \"involuntary admission.\"   A person involuntarily admitted under section 3863 is in the same posture as if he were committed pursuant to a formal court order following a hearing--he is not free to leave the institution</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> In Hansel, the defendant was found at the time of his admission to have no serious mental illness and was also found not to be in need of hospitalization.  474 F.2d at 1123.   Thus, although we disagree with the approach taken by the Eighth Circuit, the court's conclusion that no \"commitment\" had occurred seems consistent with federal policy.  According to hospital personnel, Hansel posed no risk or potential for harm due to mental illness or instability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Although he mounts no challenge to the constitutionality of Maine's involuntary commitment procedures, Chamberlain argues that since he, unlike Waters, was not able to secure a hearing to challenge his hospitalization during the five-day emergency detention period, he cannot be deemed to have been \"committed\" for purposes of &#167; 922(g)(4).  But while it is true that New York law, which allows emergency detentions for up to sixty days, provides for the right to request a hearing, Maine's law, which provides for a much shorter emergency detention, requires automatic judicial involvement in the process of involuntary hospitalization.  It also provides for examination and certification by two medical professionals.  In the instant case, moreover, Chamberlain voluntarily prolonged his own hospitalization following the five-day involuntary admission.  He did not claim then, nor does he now contend, that the stated grounds for his commitment were invalid</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
