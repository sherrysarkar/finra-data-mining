Upon careful review  of the briefs and\r                                \r\n\nrecord,   we  conclude  that   the  district  court  properly\r\n\ndismissed appellant's complaint,  essentially for the reasons\r\n\nstated  by the magistrate judge  and the district  court.

Those claims  were inextricably\r\n\nintertwined with  review of the state  court proceedings, and\r\n\nso the  district court lacked subject  matter jurisdiction to\r\n\nconsider  them.
