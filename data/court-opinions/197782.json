Upon careful review of the  briefs and the\r                           \r\n\nrecord, we conclude  that our opinion in  petitioner's direct\r\n\nappeal, United States v.

Our\r\n\nprior opinion expressly  refrained from ruling on  any \"claim\r\n\nthat involves matters outside the trial record itself,\" which\r\n\nwould include the specific ineffective assistance  of counsel\r\n\nclaim  that  petitioner  now  raises,  and  particularly  the\r\n\nfactual  question   whether  petitioner   consented  to   the\r\n\nconcession of guilt.  Accordingly, that claim should not have\r\n\nbeen dismissed  as \"a matter  raised and  properly denied  on\r\n\ndirect  appeal.\"  Of course,  we intend no comment whatsoever\r\n\non the merit, if any, of the claim, but only conclude that it\r\n\nwas dismissed prematurely.\r\n\n     We note from the appellate record that there may be some\r\n\ndispute about  the signatures  on petitioner's  filings.   In\r\n\nthese  circumstances,  we  cannot  say  that  an  evidentiary\r\n\nhearing necessarily will be required.  We leave that question\r\n\nof procedure  to the district  court, upon its review  of the\r\n\npapers before it  and its determination whether  a sufficient\r\n\ndisputed factual issue has been  joined.
