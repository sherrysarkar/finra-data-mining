This appeal concerns the third phase\n\nof litigation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\n\nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq.,\n\nstemming from the disposal of hundreds of thousands of gallons of\n\nhazardous waste in the late 1970s at a site in Smithfield, Rhode Island\n\nowned by William and Eleanor Davis. This phase concerns an action by\n\nUnited Technologies Corporation (UTC) under CERCLA's contribution\n\nprovision, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f). In 1995, UTC was found jointly and\n\nseverally liable for costs incurred by the United States for the\n\ncleanup of the Davis site. Hoping to relieve itself of some of the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fburden of that judgment, UTC sued several dozen other potentially\n\nresponsible parties. Most of these parties, as well as UTC, signed\n\npartial consent decrees with the United States in which they agreed to\n\npay a share of the cleanup costs. Several parties, however, did not\n\nsettle, and in 1998 UTC took them to trial. One of the non-settlors,\n\nAshland, Inc., appeals the district court's entry of the partial\n\nconsent decrees. Ashland and four other non-settlors also appeal the\n\ncourt's entry following trial of a declaratory judgment holding them\n\nliable for disposing of hazardous waste at the Davis site and\n\nallocating to them shares of responsibility for cleanup costs.\n\nFinally, UTC appeals three aspects of the court's ruling.\n\n          We affirm, with one exception -- a remand for clarification\n\nof the district court's ruling that UTC may be solely responsible for\n\n$6 million in government enforcement costs.\n\n                           I. Background\n\n          We describe the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment.1 During the 1970s, William Davis operated a waste disposal\n\nsite on ten acres of land in Smithfield, Rhode Island.2 In 1982, the\n\n\n     1To assist the reader of this opinion, there are two appendices\nattached. The first identifies the roles of the multiple parties to\nthis appeal and the roles of the key principals and witnesses. The\nsecond breaks down the liability and settlement amounts referred to in\nthe case.\n     2Forest borders the Davis site to the east and west, and wetlands\nand swamp border it to the north and south. When the United States\nfiled suit in 1990, there were about 100 homes within one mile of the\n\n                                 -6-\n\fEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed the Davis site on its\n\nNational Priorities List of hazardous waste sites. After undertaking a\n\nremediation investigation and completing a feasibility study, the EPA\n\nissued a Record of Decision in 1987 describing the cleanup work that it\n\ndeemed necessary to mitigate the environmental damage caused by the\n\nhazardous waste disposal.     As described by the EPA, the cleanup\n\nrequired the government to \"(1) complete a water line to supply\n\ndrinking water to areas where the drinking water wells already are\n\ncontaminated and to areas where the contaminated groundwater plume\n\nthreatens additional wells; (2) clean contaminated groundwater; and (3)\n\nexcavate and clean contaminated soils that continue to contaminate the\n\ngroundwater and other environmental media at the Site.\"        The EPA\n\nestimated the cost of this work at about $3 million for the water line,\n\n$13 million for groundwater cleanup, and $14 million for soil\n\nremediation. The government began the work of constructing water lines\n\nto nearby residents, but took no action on the soil or groundwater\n\ncleanups. See United States v. Davis, 11 F. Supp. 2d 183, 192 (D.R.I.\n\n1998) (Davis II).\n\n          In 1990, the United States brought an action under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 9607 for recovery of past and future response costs at the Davis\n\nsite. This provision of CERCLA allows the government to bring a \"cost\n\n\n\nsite, and about 3,800 residents within three miles. The site lies\nwithin a 20-mile radius of Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n                                 -7-\n\frecovery action\" against an owner or operator of a facility at which\n\nhazardous substances were disposed, against a transporter of hazardous\n\nwaste, and against a party who arranged for the disposal or transport\n\nof hazardous waste. 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a).3 The government sued William\n\n\n     3   Section 9607(a) states:\n\n                       Notwithstanding any other provision or\n            rule of law, and subject only to the defenses set\n            forth in subsection (b) of this section--\n                       (1) the owner and operator of a vessel\n            or a facility,\n                       (2) any person who at the time of\n            disposal of any hazardous substance owned or\n            operated any facility at which such hazardous\n            substances were disposed of,\n                       (3) any person who by contract,\n            agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or\n            treatment, or arranged with a transporter for\n            transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous\n            substances owned or possessed by such person, by\n            any other party or entity, at any facility or\n            incineration vessel owned or operated by another\n            party or entity and containing such hazardous\n            substances, and\n                       (4) any person who accepts or accepted\n            any hazardous substances for transport to\n            disposal or treatment facilities, incineration\n            vessels or sites selected by such person, from\n            which there is a release, or a threatened release\n            which causes the incurrence of response costs, of\n            a hazardous substance, shall be liable for--\n                       (A) all costs of removal or remedial\n            action incurred by the United States Government\n            or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent\n            with the national contingency plan;\n                       (B) any other necessary costs of\n            response incurred by any other person consistent\n            with the national contingency plan;\n                       (C) damages for injury to, destruction\n            of, or loss of natural resources, including the\n            reasonable costs of assessing such injury,\n\n                                   -8-\n\fDavis as an owner-operator; Eleanor Davis as an owner; United\n\nSanitation, Inc. and A. Capuano Brothers Inc. as transporters and\n\narrangers; and Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Clairol Inc., Pfizer Inc., The\n\nProvidence Journal Company, and UTC as arrangers.4\n\n          The district court trifurcated the government's case. Phase\n\nI would determine whether the defendants were liable for response\n\ncosts. Phase II would establish the amount of response costs incurred\n\nby the United States. Phase III, which is at issue in these appeals,\n\nwould deal with all remaining claims, including claims for\n\ncontribution, indemnification, and allocation of responsibility.\n\n          In 1991, with the government's case against it pending, UTC\n\nsued some of its co-defendants and 88 other companies under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 9613(f), which allows one potentially responsible party (PRP) to\n\nbring an action for contribution against other PRPs.5 Some of these\n\n\n          destruction, or loss resulting from such a\n          release; and\n                     (D) the costs of any health assessment\n          or health effects study carried out under section\n          9604(i) of this title.\n\n     4The court at times referred to the arranger defendants as\n\"generators.\" United States v. Davis, 882 F. Supp. 1217, 1219 (D.R.I.\n1995) (Davis I).\n     5 In its original form, CERCLA did not expressly provide that a\nparty who was liable for cleanup costs under § 9607 could seek\ncontribution from other PRPs. See Keytronic Corp. v. United States,\n511 U.S. 809, 816 (1994). In 1986, Congress expressly created a\n\"contribution action\" by amending CERCLA with the Superfund Amendments\nand Reauthorization Act (SARA). 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f). Section 9613(f)\n\n                                - 9 -\n\fthird-party defendants impleaded additional fourth-party defendants,\n\nbringing a total of 138 defendants into the litigation. The United\n\nStates did not sue these parties directly.\n\n          In a 1994 partial consent decree, Clairol Inc., Ciba-Geigy\n\nCorporation, Pfizer Inc., and The Providence Journal Company agreed\n\ncollectively to pay the United States $5.625 million, plus interest\n\naccruing from the date of the settlement, toward the Davis site\n\ncleanup. UTC, however, did not settle, and the government took it to\n\ntrial in 1995.6 After a bench trial, the district court found that UTC\n\nhad dumped wax and solvent waste at the Davis site and held UTC jointly\n\nand severally liable for all past and future cleanup costs. See Davis\n\nI, 882 F. Supp. at 1225.\n\n          While preserving the right to appeal that judgment, UTC\n\n\nstates in relevant part:\n\n     (1) Contribution\n     Any person may seek contribution from any other person who\n     is liable or potentially liable under section 9607(a) of\n     this title, during or following any civil action under\n     section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this\n     title. Such claims shall be brought in accordance with this\n     section and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and shall\n     be governed by Federal law. In resolving contribution\n     claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable\n     parties using such equitable factors as the court determines\n     are appropriate.\n\n     6 The claims against William and Eleanor Davis, United Sanitation,\nand A. Capuano Brothers were not settled \"but for reasons that are not\nentirely clear . . . were held in abeyance.\" Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d\nat 186.\n\n                                - 10 -\n\fstipulated that the response costs incurred by the EPA before September\n\n30, 1987, and the enforcement costs incurred by the Department of\n\nJustice before September 30, 1994 -- the cut-off dates set by the court\n\nfor determining the government's costs -- totaled $9.1 million. See\n\nid. UTC and the United States also stipulated that the $5.8 million\n\n($5.625 million plus interest) paid by the four settlors would be\n\ndeducted from UTC's liability. These stipulations eliminated the need\n\nfor a Phase II trial.\n\n          The case next proceeded to the Phase III claims for\n\ncontribution, indemnification, and allocation of responsibility against\n\nthe third and fourth-party defendants.7 By April 1996, the government\n\nsaid that it had incurred $19 million in response costs for site study\n\nand partial construction of waterlines and $6 million in litigation\n\nenforcement costs. See id. at 192. It projected future costs of $3\n\nmillion to complete the water lines, $14 million for soil remediation,\n\nand $13 million for groundwater remediation, bringing the total\n\nresponse and enforcement costs at the site to $55 million.          See id.\n\n          In settlement negotiations, the government assigned PRPs to\n\ntwo groups according to their estimated share of liability, with\n\nsettlement amounts based on the strength of the evidentiary case\n\nagainst each party. Eighty PRPs settled claims by joining one of five\n\n     7 In August 1997, Judge Pettine took inactive senior status, and\nthe case was transferred to Judge Torres, who then presided over Phase\nIII of the litigation.\n\n                                - 11 -\n\fpartial consent decrees, which also afforded the parties contribution\n\nprotection against other PRPs. The first and largest of these consent\n\ndecrees involved the United States, UTC, and 49 third and fourth-party\n\ndefendants. See id. at 185. The parties agreed to pay $13.5 million\n\nplus $440,000 in oversight costs, of which UTC would pay $2.8 million.\n\nIn addition, UTC agreed to perform the soil cleanup for the Davis site.\n\nWhile the cost of the soil work was estimated at $14 million, UTC\n\nagreed to accept the risk that the work might in fact cost more. UTC's\n\nliability is reduced, however, by the other partial consent decrees,\n\nwhich provide for payments to UTC of up to $5.364 million.         The\n\ndistrict court approved the consent decrees in 1998 and 1999, finding\n\nthem fair, both procedurally and substantively, reasonable, and\n\nconsistent with CERCLA's objectives.8 Soil remediation efforts began\n\nin July 1997. United States v. Davis, 31 F. Supp. 2d 45, 52 (D.R.I.\n\n1998) (Davis IV). To avoid recontamination, the groundwater cleanup\n\nwill begin after the soil work is completed.\n\n          Several defendants chose not to participate in any of the\n\nconsent decrees. UTC prepared to try its claims for contribution\n\nagainst the non-settling defendants, including William Davis as owner\n\nand operator of the Davis site; Eleanor Davis as owner;\n\n\n\n\n     8The consent decrees are described in greater detail in Part II\nof this opinion.\n\n                                - 12 -\n\fChemical Waste Removal (CWR),9 Chemical Control Corporation (CCC),10 and\n\nMacera Brothers Container Service, Inc. (Macera) as transporters;11 and\n\nAcco Bristol Division of Babcock Industries (Acco), Ashland Chemical,\n\nInc. (Ashland), Gar Electroforming Division (Gar), a/k/a Black &\n\nDecker,12 Perkin-Elmer Corporation (PE), Thiokol, a/k/a/ Morton\n\nInternational Inc. (Morton), and the City of New Jersey as arrangers.13\n\nBefore trial began, the district court said that the trial would\n\nadjudicate UTC's \"request to determine the 'equitable contribution\n\nshare of liability' for past and future response costs at the Site.\"\n\nHowever, when UTC admitted at the start of trial that it had not begun\n\nto incur costs for soil remediation by the close of discovery, the\n\n\n\n     9\n     UTC also brought claims against CWR's principal, Emanuel Musillo,\nand against CWR's corporate predecessor and its principal, Drum\nAutomation and Michael Musillo. The district court found Emanuel\nMusillo liable with CWR. The court dismissed the claims against Drum\nAutomation and Michael Musillo. UTC did not appeal these rulings.\n     10UTC also brought claims against CCC's principal, William\nCarracino. The district court found Carracino liable with CCC.\n     11\n      UTC also brought claims against BFI Waste Systems of North\nAmerica as Macera's corporate successor.\n     12UTC brought claims against Black & Decker and Electroformers as\nGar's possible corporate successors. The district court found Black &\nDecker liable as Gar's successor and dismissed the claims against\nElectroformers. Black & Decker appeals that ruling, as we discuss\ninfra.\n     13UTC brought claims against several other defendants which the\ndistrict court dismissed. UTC did not appeal these rulings.\n\n                                - 13 -\n\fcourt narrowed the trial's focus to UTC's right to contribution for\n\nfuture rather than past costs. It defined future costs as those that\n\nUTC had incurred since the close of discovery and those that it would\n\nincur as it completed the soil remediation.\n\n          On September 28, 1998, following a 26-day bench trial, the\n\ncourt partially granted a motion for judgment made by some of the\n\ndefendants based on partial findings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 52(c). The court ruled that while Macera had transported\n\nhazardous waste to the Davis site, it was not liable as a matter of law\n\nbecause UTC failed to prove that Macera \"selected\" Davis as a disposal\n\nsite, as § 9607(a)(4) requires to hold a transporter of hazardous waste\n\nliable. See United States v. Davis, 20 F. Supp. 2d 326, 334 ( Davis\n\nIII). The court also dismissed UTC's case against the City of New\n\nJersey, finding that the city was immune from liability under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 9607(d)(2).    Id. at 335.\n\n          On December 15, 1998, the court issued a declaratory judgment\n\nholding appellants Ashland, Acco, Gar, Morton, and PE liable for\n\narranging for the disposal of their waste at the Davis site.14 With the\n\nexception of Morton, the court allocated to each defendant a share of\n\nresponsibility for UTC's future cleanup costs. Davis IV, 31 F. Supp.\n\n\n\n     14The court also found William Davis liable as an owner-operator,\nEleanor Davis liable as an owner, and CWR, CCC, and Capuano liable as\ntransporters. Those parties have not appealed the judgments against\nthem.\n\n                                - 14 -\n\f2d at 69.\n\n            The appeals currently before us result from the district\n\ncourt's entry of the Phase III consent decrees, its rulings for some of\n\nthe defendants pursuant to Rule 52(c), and its declaratory judgment in\n\nfavor of UTC. Ashland appeals the district court's approval of the\n\nconsent decrees. Ashland, Acco, Gar, Morton, and PE appeal several\n\naspects of the declaratory judgment. Specifically, four appellants\n\n(Ashland, Acco, Gar, and PE) argue that UTC failed to prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that they arranged for the disposal of\n\nwaste at the Davis site. These four appellants also argue that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by admitting and crediting the\n\ntestimony of CWR driver Wilbert Jones. Acco and Gar also argue that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion by excluding a \"Master Chart\"\n\nof the parties' claims compiled by UTC's lawyers to prepare the witness\n\ndesignated by UTC to testify on behalf of the corporation pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 30(b)(6). Three appellants (Ashland, Acco,\n\nand Gar) contend that UTC failed to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that their respective waste contained hazardous substances and\n\nso caused the incurrence of cleanup costs. These three appellants also\n\nargue that the court's entry of a declaratory judgment was improper.\n\nAppellant Gar, a/k/a Black & Decker, challenges the court's finding of\n\ncorporate successor liability. Finally, UTC contests the court's\n\ndismissal of the case against the City of New Jersey and Macera, and\n\n\n                                - 15 -\n\fits ruling that UTC was solely responsible for $6 million in government\n\nenforcement costs incurred during Phase I and II of the litigation. We\n\nwill discuss each of these challenges in turn.\n\n                      II. The Consent Decrees\n\nA.   Background\n\n          1. Consent Decree I\n\n          Ashland's appeal focuses on Consent Decree I, the primary\n\nsettlement between the United States and UTC, which began consent\n\ndecree negotiations with the United States as an alternative to\n\npursuing an appeal of the judgment in Davis I. In discussions with\n\nUTC, the EPA assigned possibly settling PRPs (generators and\n\ntransporters of waste) to two groups, \"carve-out\" and \"non-carve-out.\"\n\nThe carve-out entities were deemed primarily responsible for the waste\n\nat the Davis site, and so were compelled to negotiate individual\n\nsettlements with the United States. Non-carve-out third parties were\n\nencouraged to negotiate a possible global settlement among themselves,\n\nwith the assistance of liaison counsel.\n\n          On July 14, 1995, following the Phase I settlement with four\n\nparties, the United States offered to settle with all remaining parties\n\nfor about $16 million plus the performance of site soil cleanup using\n\nlow-temperature thermal desorption technology. UTC provisionally\n\nagreed to the United States's settlement offer and pursued its\n\ncontribution claims.    Ultimately, UTC, carve-outs Olin Hunt and\n\n\n                                - 16 -\n\fAmerican Cyanamid, and about fifty other parties joined this\n\nsettlement. The parties paid a total of $13.5 million to the United\n\nStates, plus $440,000 in oversight costs. Of that amount, Olin Hunt\n\nand American Cyanamid paid $2.75 million each (with some portion going\n\nto resolution of state claims), non-carve-out parties paid a total of\n\n$7.2 million, and UTC paid the remaining balance, about $2.8 million.15\n\n\n\n          Furthermore, UTC took responsibility for the entire expense\n\nof site soil remediation, an estimated cost of about $14 million.\n\nUnder the settlement, UTC and the United States each receive half of\n\nfuture contribution recoveries, with UTC's recovery capped at $5.364\n\nmillion after deducting 15 percent of contribution recoveries for\n\nattorneys' fees incurred in contribution litigation after March 1996.\n\nFinally, the settling parties received complete contribution protection\n\nfrom claims by other PRPs. Separate recoveries by the United States\n\nwould not be subject to contribution sharing.\n\n          While the predicted cost of cleaning up the Davis site has\n\nvaried over the years, the most recent estimate, from 1997, took into\n\naccount new remediation technology and set the total at $55 million.\n\nThis amount guided the United States in determining the settlement\n\namounts. In addition, the allocations to Clairol and the other parties\n\n\n\n     15The allocation among the non-carve-outs was initially\nconfidential, though the payment amounts have now been disclosed.\n\n                                - 17 -\n\fin the earlier Phase I, $5.625 million settlement provided a\n\n\"benchmark\" for the amounts requested from potential settlors in the\n\nlater consent decrees.     Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 191.\n\n          2. Consent Decrees II, III, IV and Capuano\n\n          The remaining consent decrees included 27 additional parties\n\nand involved UTC's settlement of claims for contribution from other\n\nPRPs, resulting in some additional payments to the United States\n\npursuant to UTC's agreement with the United States in Consent Decree I.\n\nIn Consent Decree II, 23 parties paid a total of $4.135 million, with\n\nindividual party liability detailed in briefs to the district court.\n\nConsent Decree III involved National Starch, which paid $5 million.\n\nConsent Decree IV involved a $150,000 payment by Swan Engraving and a\n\n$50,000 payment by Power Semiconductors.        All parties to these\n\nsettlements received complete contribution protection from future\n\nclaims. Finally, Capuano Brothers paid $200,000 to the government,\n\nplus a like amount for settlement of cleanup costs at another Superfund\n\nsite.\n\n          3. The District Court Approval\n\n          To assist in its assessment of Consent Decree I, t he district\n\ncourt held a two-day hearing to determine whether the proposed\n\nsettlement was fair, both procedurally and substantively, reasonable,\n\nand consistent with CERCLA's objectives. United States v. Cannons\n\nEng'g Corp., 899 F.2d 79, 84 (1st Cir. 1990). Procedurally, the court\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\ffound that \"[t]he negotiations were conducted openly and all parties\n\nwere given an opportunity to participate.\" Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n189. Substantively, the court concluded that the consent decree met\n\nall requirements because the \"proposed settlement reflects a rational\n\nmethod of allocating liability in a manner that reasonably approximates\n\neach party's share of responsibility; the method is applied\n\nevenhandedly with respect to all PRP's and sufficient information is\n\npresented to enable the Court to determine whether that has been done.\"\n\nId. at 192.\n\n          In assessing the reasonableness of the consent decree, the\n\ncourt's chief concern was \"whether the public can be adequately\n\ncompensated by a settlement in which the United States receives only a\n\nportion of the remediation cost from a party previously adjudged liable\n\nfor the entire cost,\" id. at 186, a reference to the release of UTC\n\nfrom the Phase I judgment. According to the district court, under the\n\nterms of the settlement the United States would receive $27.5 million,\n\nplus the $5.8 million from the original defendants, leaving a $21.7\n\nmillion shortfall in compensation for the projected cost of the\n\ncleanup. This issue distinguished the Davis case from others in which\n\nthe United States settled before judgment.          \"In those cases,\n\ncompromising for a fraction of the response costs with a PRP that is\n\npotentially liable for the entire cost usually is justifiable on the\n\nground that litigation might result in the United States recovering no\n\n\n                                - 19 -\n\fresponse costs at all.\"     Id. at 192.\n\n          The court thus framed the reasonableness question in terms\n\nof \"whether the amount by which the judgment has been discounted\n\nreasonably reflects the risk of reversal [on appeal],\" and called this\n\n\"a very close question.\" Id. at 193. The court acknowledged some\n\n\"remaining, albeit diminished, litigation risk associated with the\n\nclaim against UTC.\" Id. The court also suggested that concern about\n\nreleasing UTC from the judgment was mitigated by the fact that the\n\nUnited States could still sue the non-settlors for the $21.7 million\n\nshortfall, but recognized that this course of action seemed to involve\n\n\"much greater litigation risk\" than simply pursuing the judgment\n\nagainst UTC.   Id.\n\n          In resolving the issue, the court considered factors beyond\n\nan assessment of litigation risks. The court noted that \"the financial\n\nobligations imposed on UTC are considerably greater than the\n\nobligations assumed by the other 'carve-out' settlors,\" reinforcing\n\nUTC's substantial responsibility. Id. It also noted that \"given the\n\ndeference accorded to the EPA's judgment in such matters, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the proposed discount is unreasonable.\" Id. The court said\n\nthat the consent decree avoided an unduly harsh result for UTC, whereas\n\nthe judgment would have \"saddled [it], unfairly, with liability for\n\nremediation costs that far exceed its fair share.\" Id. Acknowledging\n\nthat UTC could pursue contribution actions against other PRPs, the\n\n\n                                - 20 -\n\fcourt still concluded that the consent decree was reasonable given the\n\ngreat \"difficulty of establishing entitlement to contribution.\" Id.\n\nFinally, the court found the consent decree to be consistent with the\n\nstatute because it advanced \"the overriding goal of promptly and\n\nefficiently cleaning up hazardous waste sites.\"        Id.\n\n          Pursuant to its thorough opinion, the district court approved\n\nConsent Decree I on February 13, 1998, and entered final judgment on\n\nDecember 9, 1999. Consent Decrees II, III, IV and the Capuano decree\n\nwere each summarily approved subsequently. Final judgment was also\n\nentered on these decrees in December 1999. On appeal, Ashland, a non-\n\nsettling PRP, lodges numerous objections to the approval of the consent\n\ndecrees, including a jurisdictional objection.        We assess these\n\narguments.\n\nB. Reviewing the Approval of the Consent Decrees\n\n          1. Standard of Review\n\n          Considerable deference is involved in the review of CERCLA\n\nconsent decrees. Indeed, appellate review is \"encased in a double\n\nlayer of swaddling.\"    Cannons, 899 F.2d at 84.      First, there is\n\ndeference to the administrative agency's construction of the\n\nsettlement. \"That so many affected parties, themselves knowledgeable\n\nand represented by experienced lawyers, have hammered out an agreement\n\nat arm's length and advocate its embodiment in a judicial decree,\n\nitself deserves weight in the ensuing balance.\" Id. at 84. Second, the\n\n\n                                - 21 -\n\fappellate court can only review a district court's approval of a\n\nconsent decree for abuse of discretion, characterized by \"a serious\n\nerror of law\" or a \"meaningful lapse of judgment.\" United States v.\n\nCharles George Trucking, 34 F.3d 1081, 1085 (1st Cir. 1994); United\n\nStates v. DiBiase, 45 F.3d 541, 544 (1st Cir. 1995).      \"Because an\n\nappellate court ordinarily cannot rival a district court's mastery of\n\na factually complex case -- a mastery often, as in this instance,\n\nacquired through painstaking involvement over many years -- the\n\ndistrict court's views must also be accorded considerable respect.\"\n\nCharles George, 34 F.3d at 1085. This double deference \"places a heavy\n\nburden on those who purpose to upset a trial judge's approval of a\n\nconsent decree.\"    Cannons, 899 F.2d at 84.\n\n          2. Case or Controversy\n\n          As a preliminary matter, Ashland contends that the district\n\ncourt had no jurisdiction under Article III to approve the consent\n\ndecrees because, \"with the exception of UTC, the U.S. never sued any of\n\nthe third or fourth-party defendants settling in Consent Decrees I-IV.\n\nMoreover, approximately 34 entities who were signatories to Consent\n\nDecree I were never sued by any party to this action.\" In Ashland's\n\nview, this circumstance means that there was no \"case or controversy\"\n\nto be resolved by the district court. We conclude that, even if there\n\nwere parties not sued by the United States involved in the consent\n\ndecrees, their inclusion would be permissible because the Supreme Court\n\n\n                                - 22 -\n\fhas allowed unpleaded claims to be part of consent decrees, and thus,\n\nthere is no \"case or controversy\" concern.\n\n            In Local 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters v. City of\n\nCleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 525 (1986), the Supreme Court ruled that a\n\nconsent decree must (1) spring from and serve to resolve a dispute\n\nwithin the court's subject matter jurisdiction; (2) come within the\n\ngeneral scope of the case based on the pleadings; and (3) further the\n\nobjectives of the law on which the claim is based.              Although\n\nFirefighters involved a challenge to the scope of a consent decree\n\nrather than an Article III case or controversy argument, satisfying the\n\ncriteria set forth in that case resolves any case or controversy claim.\n\nThe district court found that the criteria were satisfied by Consent\n\nDecree I:\n\n            The United States's claims against the settling\n            third and fourth-party defendants spring from and\n            fall well within the scope of the controversy\n            described in the pleading; . . . Furthermore, the\n            United States and all of the settling PRP's are\n            parties to the action16 and the consent decree\n            resolves the dispute among them. Finally, . . .\n            approval of the consent decree also furthers the\n            objectives of CERCLA by facilitating the prompt\n            and efficient remediation of a major hazardous\n            waste site.\n\nDavis II, 11 F.Supp. 2d at 188.\n\n\n\n     16We understand the court's reference to \"parties to the action\"\nto include those initially sued by the United States, defendants to the\nUTC contribution claims, as well as the numerous parties named in suits\namong the third and fourth-party defendants.\n\n                                 - 23 -\n\f          We have applied the Firefighters test in the CERCLA context\n\nbefore. In Charles George, we found that claims not expressly set out\n\nin the pleadings may be addressed in a consent decree as long as they\n\nfall within the pleadings' general scope.        34 F.3d at 1089-91.\n\nLikewise, unpleaded claims that could not be brought against third-\n\nparty defendants pursuant to a case management order (CMO) were\n\nappropriately included in the consent decree. Id. at 1091. Here, the\n\npurported failure to file complaints contemporaneous with the consent\n\ndecrees does not defeat the legitimacy of the settlements. As we wrote\n\nin Charles George:\n\n          [T]he Supreme Court has made clear that there is\n          no per se prohibition against consent decrees\n          that exceed the possible bounds of a decision\n          issued directly by the trial court. Because a\n          consent decree is animated not only by the\n          parties' legal claims but also by the parties'\n          consent, a court is 'not necessarily barred from\n          entering a consent decree merely because the\n          decree provides broader relief than the court\n          could have awarded after trial.'\n\nId. at 1091 (quoting Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525).\n\n          The district court allowed the inclusion of parties not sued\n\nby the United States in the consent decrees, finding that UTC's\n\ncontribution claims \"are based on the same body of evidence and raise\n\nthe same issues as the United States' claims against the settling third\n\nand fourth-party defendants.\" Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 188. Like\n\na settlement that is greater in scope than the originally pled claims,\n\nthe inclusion of various third and fourth-party defendants, as well as\n\n                                - 24 -\n\finterested non-parties, is permissible pursuant to Firefighters.17\n\nIndeed, any conclusion to the contrary would disrupt the goals of\n\nCERCLA, which seeks early settlement with as many PRPs as possible to\n\nfurther expeditious remediation.\n\n          3. Fairness\n\n                  a. Procedural\n\n          Assessing fairness in the CERCLA settlement context has both\n\nprocedural and substantive dimensions.       \"To measure procedural\n\nfairness, a court should ordinarily look to the negotiation process and\n\nattempt to gauge its candor, openness, and bargaining balance.\"\n\nCannons, 899 F.2d at 86. The EPA has ample authority to structure its\n\nsettlement negotiations, including \"broad discretion to structure\n\nclasses of PRPs.\" Id. A finding of procedural fairness may also be an\n\nacceptable proxy for substantive fairness, when other circumstantial\n\nindicia of fairness are present. See Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1089.\n\n          Ashland asserts that the consent decrees failed to meet the\n\ncriteria of procedural fairness because the establishment of party\n\ncategories inhibited the openness of negotiations; discovery relating\n\nto the settlement terms was inadequate; and the United States abdicated\n\nto UTC its responsibility to conduct the negotiations under CERCLA.\n\n\n\n     17 Ashland further contests the inclusion of \"successors in\ninterest\" and \"corporate affiliates\" within the scope of Consent Decree\nI. Given the potential liability of such entities, this inclusion is\nappropriate.\n\n                                - 25 -\n\fAshland also argues that information fundamental to evaluation of the\n\nconsent decrees was not disclosed by the United States, including: (1)\n\nthe United States' total past and estimated future costs of\n\nremediation; (2) the strength of the United States' case against each\n\nsettlor; (3) the type, volume and toxicity of the waste for which each\n\nsettlor was responsible and a correlation to site cleanup costs; (4)\n\nthe formula by which the settlement amounts were calculated, and\n\nevidentiary support for the formula.\n\n          These arguments are unpersuasive. All identified players in\n\nthe hazardous waste site were notified of early opportunities for\n\nsettlement with the United States, and later, with UTC. There is no\n\nreason to doubt that the consent decrees were the result of \"arm's\n\nlength, good faith bargaining\" between sophisticated parties. United\n\nStates v. Comunidades Unidas Contra la Contaminacion, 204 F.3d 275, 281\n\n(1st Cir. 2000). PRPs were offered the assistance of a magistrate\n\njudge and an alternative dispute resolution administrator in the\n\nnegotiation   of   their   settlements.    In   addition,   the   early\n\nclassification of carve-outs and non-carve-outs was an attempt at\n\nsettlement management within the discretion of the United States.\n\n          The district court also found no breach of the requirement\n\nfor public disclosure, concluding that the parties offered \"facts\n\nsufficient to enable one to determine whether\" the terms of the\n\nagreement were fair. Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 194. The proposed\n\n\n                                - 26 -\n\fdecrees lodged with the court \"set[] forth, at length, all of the terms\n\nof the settlement.\" Id. They were published in compliance with 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9622(d)(2)(A)-(B), making the decrees available to non-parties\n\nand the public for comment in a timely manner.       Furthermore, the\n\ndistrict court noted that \"there is no indication that the United\n\nStates misrepresented or withheld any material facts.\" Id. at 189.\n\nThere is no error in any of these findings. Ashland's argument that\n\nthe identified information had to be available is not supported by the\n\nlaw, which makes significant allowances for gaps in information, given\n\nthe sometimes impossible task of deriving this data.\n\n                  b. Substantive\n\n          Substantive fairness involves concepts of corrective justice\n\nand accountability, concentrating on \"the proposed allocation of\n\nresponsibility as between settling and non-settling PRPs.\" Charles\n\nGeorge, 34 F.3d at 1088. \"[T]he proper way to gauge the adequacy of\n\nsettlement amounts to be paid by settling PRPs is to compare the\n\nproportion of total projected costs to be paid by the settlors with the\n\nproportion of liability attributable to them.\" Id. at 1087. Ashland\n\nasserts that the formula used by the government to assess liability\n\namong the carve-out and non-carve-out parties, settling or not, was\n\narbitrary and capricious, unrelated to comparative fault and\n\ninconsistently applied across consent decrees.\n\n          The law on this issue is clear. The EPA formula should be\n\n\n                                - 27 -\n\fupheld \"so long as the agency supplies some plausible explanation for\n\nit, welding some reasonable linkage between factors it includes in its\n\nformula or scheme and the proportionate shares of the settling PRPs.\"\n\nCannons, 899 F.2d at 87. In assessing the formula applied, the quality\n\nof the information available to the government and settling parties\n\ninforms the fairness analysis because data on the total extent of harm\n\nand the respective liabilities of various PRPs are often unavailable.\n\nSee id. at 88.   Such difficulties will not preclude a court from\n\nentering a consent decree. See Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1089. The\n\ncalculation of liability and the allocation of that responsibility is\n\nspecially within the scope of the Agency's and parties' expertise. \"As\n\nlong as the data the EPA uses to apportion liability for purposes of a\n\nconsent decree falls along the broad spectrum of plausible\n\napproximations, judicial intrusion is unwarranted . . . . Having\n\nselected a reasonable method of weighing comparative fault, the agency\n\nneed not show that it is the best, or even the fairest, of all\n\nconceivable methods.\"     Cannons, 899 F.2d at 88.\n\n          In this case, the EPA assessed liability based on \"its\n\nestimate of the volume of waste attributable to each PRP.\" Davis II,\n\n11 F. Supp. at 190. The EPA also considered the strength of the cases\n\nagainst the respective PRPs, taking \"into account that there was direct\n\nand credible evidence linking some of the PRP's to the Site and that\n\nthe evidence with respect to other PRP's was almost entirely\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\fcircumstantial and varied in probative value.\" Id. The district court\n\nfound the interplay of these factors in this case to be \"rational\" and\n\n\"especially appropriate in cases like this where the wastes have been\n\nintermingled and it is virtually impossible to attribute discrete\n\nportions of the cleanup costs to particular wastes.\" Id. The court\n\nfurther observed that, in accord with the precedent, \"assessing\n\nrelative responsibility is an imperfect process because it requires\n\nsubjective judgments based on evidence that is not completely developed\n\nand may be disputed.     However, . . . the evidence need not be\n\nexhaustive or conclusive in order to determine whether a proposed\n\nsettlement is substantively fair.\"       Id. at 191.\n\n          We agree with the district court's analysis supporting the\n\nsubstantive fairness of the liability allocation among carve-outs and\n\nnon-carve-outs, settlors and non-settlors alike. In arguments before\n\nthe district court, the government attorney and others noted that the\n\nsettlements involved \"roughly half of the parties paying somewhat more\n\nthan half of the costs.\" In its decision, the district court stressed\n\nthe parity of the amounts paid by settling PRPs and non-settling PRPs,\n\nboth carve-outs and non-carve-outs. Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 191.\n\nThe court wrote:\n\n          Comparing the amounts paid by the settling\n          'carve-out' PRP's to the Clairol benchmark and\n          to the demands made upon the non-settling 'carve-\n          out' PRP's supports the conclusion that the\n          proposed settlement apportions liability in a\n          manner that roughly approximates a rational\n\n                                - 29 -\n\f           estimate of the relative responsibilities borne\n           by both the settling and non-settling PRP's.\n\nId. at 190.\n\n           The court proceeded to compare the settlement offered to\n\nAmerican Cyanamid and Olin Hunt with the settlements paid in the\n\nClairol agreement and demands made of eight non-settling carve-out\n\nPRPs, all of which fell between $2.75 million and $3 million. See id.\n\nat 191.   Interestingly, the court also noted that the government\n\ndemanded $8.25 million from the State of New Jersey, BFI and Ashland,\n\naveraging to a total of $2.75 million each, though Ashland \"was\n\nexpected to pay a larger share because EPA determined that Ashland\n\nproduced a high volume of hazardous waste and that a significant amount\n\nof evidence existed linking Ashland to the Davis site.\" Id. at 191\n\nn.7. Finally, the court noted \"an even closer correlation between the\n\namounts paid by settling 'non-carve-out' PRP's and the amounts demanded\n\nfrom non-settling 'non-carve-out' PRP's\" -- $13.5 million demanded of\n\neighty-five non-carve-out PRPs, averaging $158,800 apiece, compared\n\nwith the $7.2 million proposed settlement with forty-seven non-carve-\n\nout PRPs, amounting to $152,200 each. Id. at 191. The court also\n\npointed out that the allocation assessed to UTC was a considerably\n\ngreater financial obligation than that imposed on any non-settling\n\ncarve-out party.    See id.\n\n           In addition, the ultimate measure of accountability \"is the\n\nextent of the overall recovery, not the amount of money paid by any\n\n                                - 30 -\n\findividual defendant.\" Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1086. Accordingly,\n\na consent decree need not specify each generator's or transporter's\n\ndegree of culpability. It is appropriate for classes of PRPs to be\n\nassigned aggregate settlement amounts to allocate among themselves.\n\nSee id.   In Charles George we said: \"Realistically, a government\n\nagency, in the midst of negotiations, is in no position to put so fine\n\na point on accountability. We, therefore, endorse, in general, EPA's\n\npractice of negotiating with a representative group of PRPs and then\n\npermitting the group members to divide the burden of the settlement\n\namong themselves.\"    Id.\n\n          Ashland's challenge to the group allocations in these\n\nsettlements is meritless. Our prior observation remains pertinent:\n\n\"[A]s is true of consent decrees generally, they are built upon\n\ncompromise and compromise in turn is a product of judgment.\"\n\nComunidades Unidas, 204 F.3d at 282.      We agree with the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that a \"rational\" method of allocating liability was\n\n\"evenhandedly\" applied.     Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 192.\n\n          4. Reasonableness\n\n          In considering the reasonableness of Consent Decree I, the\n\ndistrict court addressed the novel issue of whether the public can be\n\nadequately compensated by a settlement in which the United States\n\nreceives only a portion of the remediation cost from a party previously\n\nadjudged liable for the entire cost. See Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n\n                                - 31 -\n\f186. Arguing that adequate compensation is not possible under such\n\ncircumstances, Ashland asserts that the consent decrees do not comport\n\nwith the objectives of CERCLA.\n\n          The assessment of reasonableness focuses on several elements:\n\nthe effectiveness of the decree as a vehicle for cleaning the\n\nenvironment; providing satisfactory public compensation for actual (and\n\nanticipated) costs of remediation; and accounting for the relative\n\nstrength of the parties' litigating positions and foreseeable risks of\n\nloss. See Cannons, 899 F.2d at 89-90. In making these assessments, a\n\ncourt must once again allow for the agency's lack of \"mathematical\n\nprecision,\" as long as the figures derive from a plausible\n\ninterpretation of the record. Id. at 90. Furthermore, effective\n\nremediation demands a more pragmatic meaning than whether the\n\nsettlement meets a scientific ideal or approximates the projected costs\n\nof cleanup. See Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1085; United States v.\n\nCharter Int'l Oil Co., 83 F.3d 510, 521 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A district\n\ncourt's reasonableness inquiry, like that of fairness, is a pragmatic\n\none.\"); Comunidades Unidas, 204 F.3d at 281.\n\n          Although the UTC allocation in Consent Decree I does not pay\n\nfor the entire expense of the cleanup, UTC assumed the full cost of\n\nsoil remediation (mitigated by contribution from later settlors), even\n\nif that estimated cost ultimately exceeds projections. Furthermore,\n\nthe consent decrees staved off litigation risks associated with the\n\n\n                                - 32 -\n\fsettling parties, including a possible appeal by UTC of the judgment\n\nagainst it. See Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 192. In addition, as the\n\ndistrict court observed, \"fundamental fairness prohibits the imposition\n\nof liability that is totally disproportionate to UTC's share of\n\nresponsibility.\"    Id. at 193.\n\n          Discounts on maximum potential liability as an incentive to\n\nsettle are considered fair and reasonable under Congress's statutory\n\nscheme.   See DiBiase, 45 F.3d at 546; see also Interim CERCLA\n\nSettlement Policy, Environmental Protection Agency, 50 F.R. 5034\n\n(February 5, 1985). A PRP's assumption of open-ended risks, such as\n\nthe full cost of a component of the cleanup, may merit a discount. See\n\nCannons, 899 F.2d at 88. Also, party-specific discounts may reflect\n\nthe chances of the United States's success in litigation against a\n\ngiven PRP. See id. It is appropriate \"to factor into the equation any\n\nreasonable discounts for litigation risks, time savings, and the like\n\nthat may be justified.\"     Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1087.\n\n          The United States received a significant sum from the initial\n\nsettlors, Consent Decree I settlors and contributions from settlors in\n\nConsent Decrees II-IV and Capuano. Indeed, the United States fulfilled\n\n60 percent of its $55 million claim through the consent decrees,\n\nincluding the earlier $5.625 million settlement with Clairol and other\n\nparties. The United States also retains the option of pursuing future\n\ncost-recovery actions against other non-settling PRPs. In light of the\n\n\n                                - 33 -\n\frole of the consent decrees in expediting the remediation work, the\n\nsubstantial cost recovery by the United States, and the strength of the\n\ncases against the various PRPs, we agree with the district court that\n\nthe consent decrees met the test of reasonableness.\n\n          5. Statutory Fidelity\n\n          The purposes of CERCLA include expeditious remediation at\n\nwaste sites, adequate compensation to the public fisc and the\n\nimposition of accountability. \"[I]t would disserve a principal end of\n\nthe statute -- achievement of prompt settlement and a concomitant head\n\nstart on response activities -- to leave matters in limbo until more\n\nprecise information [is] amassed.\" Cannons, 899 F.2d at 88; see also\n\nDiBiase, 45 F.3d at 545 (\"[S]ettlements reduce excessive litigation\n\nexpenses and transaction costs, thereby preserving scarce resources for\n\nCERCLA's real goal: the expeditious cleanup of hazardous waste\n\nsites.\"). Additionally, there is a \"strong public policy in favor of\n\nsettlements, particularly in very complex and technical regulatory\n\ncontexts.\" Comunidades Unidas, 204 F.3d at 280. Importantly, even\n\nthough it was not obligated to do so, UTC began the process of remedial\n\nsoil treatment in July 1997, well before the approval of Consent Decree\n\nI. This task included: excavation, removal and proper disposal of more\n\nthan 1,000 drums of waste and 10,000 small jars, containers and vials;\n\nremoval of more than 750,000 tires; and sampling and chemical analysis\n\nof over 65,000 cubic yards of soil. This head-start on repair of a\n\n\n                                - 34 -\n\fhazardous waste site is the sort of good-faith cooperation that CERCLA\n\nseeks to encourage via settlement. To find this progress inadequate\n\nwould frustrate the statute's purpose.\n\n          In asserting that the consent decrees are not faithful to the\n\npurposes of CERCLA, Ashland focuses on the contribution protection\n\nafforded the parties to the consent decrees, fearing that a handful of\n\nnon-settlors (i.e., Ashland and the other appellants), foreclosed from\n\ncontribution actions because they did not join the consent decrees,\n\ncould be held liable for a disproportionate share of the $21.7 million\n\nin as-yet unrecovered costs if the United States pursued them in cost\n\nrecovery actions. CERCLA provides that \"[a] person who has resolved\n\nits liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or\n\njudicially approved settlement shall not be liable for claims for\n\ncontribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement.\" 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 9613(f)(2); see also 42 U.S.C § 9622(f)(2). Despite this \"matters\n\naddressed in the settlement\" language of the statute, Ashland says that\n\nthe \"matters addressed\" language of the decrees here is overreaching\n\nbecause they include, quoting the consent decrees, \"response costs\n\nincurred and to be incurred by any person or entity other than the\n\nUnited States for response actions related to the site or identified in\n\nthe remedy.\" Ashland complains that, \"[a]s written, the 'matters\n\naddressed' provision of three partial consent decrees have been\n\nexpanded to include all costs, whether the costs are incurred by the\n\n\n                                - 35 -\n\fU.S. or by a private party.    This is clearly impermissible under\n\nCERCLA.\" Facing exposure to performance of the groundwater remedy,\n\nwhich may represent 40 percent of the total site costs, Ashland worries\n\nthat parties like itself will bear disproportionate liability because\n\nthey are unfairly barred from seeking contribution from earlier-\n\nsettling parties.\n\n          The practice of encouraging early settlements by providing\n\nbroad contribution protection is provided by statute. 42 U.S.C. §\n\n9613(f)(2); see also Charter, 83 F.3d at 522; UTC v. Browning-Ferris\n\nInd., Inc., 33 F.3d 96, 103 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"This paradigm is not a\n\nscrivener's accident.\"). CERCLA also seeks to induce settlements at\n\nhigher amounts by allowing settlors to seek contribution from those who\n\nhave not yet settled. See 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(3)(B); Charter, 83 F.3d\n\nat 522. Still, EPA policy encourages the court reviewing a consent\n\ndecree incorporating contribution protection to seek \"a demonstration\n\nthat this result is fair to potential contribution plaintiffs whose\n\nrights would be extinguished.\" DOJ/EPA Memorandum, Defining \"Matters\n\nAddressed\" in CERCLA Settlements, March 14, 1997. In a case such as\n\nthis, where UTC assumes an open-ended cost for soil remediation, and\n\ntakes the lead in coordinating settlements and beginning the cleanup\n\neffort, the benefit of contribution protection is appropriate. Also,\n\nas UTC points out in its brief, Ashland's preoccupation with the\n\npotential of disproportionate liability \"ignores the fact that UTC,\n\n\n                                - 36 -\n\fwhich was allocated responsibility for 1.54 percent of the liability by\n\nthe trial court, will perform the source control remedy, which will\n\namount to over one-fourth of the total costs of remediating the site.\"\n\nUTC draws from this fact an appropriate conclusion: \"This comparison\n\nshows that CERCLA can impose harsh results on PRPs; it also shows that\n\nthese contribution defendants [Ashland and other non-settlors] may bear\n\na burden roughly comparable to that of UTC.\"\n\n          The point we made in an earlier decision remains apt: \"As\n\nto the extinguished contribution claims of non-settlors or later round\n\nsettlors, protection against those claims was a reasonable benefit [the\n\nsettlor] acquired in exchange for settling before those others.\"\n\nCharter, 83 F.3d at 522. The result of non-settlors possibly bearing\n\ndisproportionate liability for the open-ended cost of remediation is\n\ntherefore consistent with the statute's paradigm, which encourages the\n\nfinality of early settlement.      See Browning-Ferris, 33 F.3d at 103.\n\n          6. Unconstitutional Taking\n\n          To the extent that CERCLA authorizes the contribution\n\nprotection to which Ashland objects, Ashland asserts that this\n\nprotection could result in an unconstitutional taking of the\n\nprotectable property interests of non-settling parties because they\n\nwill be prohibited from seeking contribution from earlier-settling\n\nparties. Indeed, Ashland points out, CERCLA recognizes that in a\n\nsettlement \"limiting any person's right to obtain contribution from any\n\n\n                                - 37 -\n\fparty,\" the result could be \"a taking without just compensation\" under\n\nthe Fifth Amendment.     42 U.S.C. § 9657.\n\n          Ashland's argument in support of this takings claim is so\n\nperfunctorily developed that we deem it unworthy of response. See\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\n\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). In support of its\n\ntakings argument, set forth in two-and-a-half pages at the end of an\n\n85-page brief, Ashland relies entirely on a brief description of the\n\nrecent Supreme Court decision in Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S.\n\n498 (1998), a case in which a deeply divided Supreme Court struck down\n\nretroactive application of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act\n\nof 1992. The takings analysis put forth by the plurality opinion in\n\nthat case did not command a majority of the court, a fact which, as the\n\ngovernment notes in its brief, severely limits the precedential value\n\nof that takings analysis. See Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 213-14\n\n(1910) (\"[T]he principles of law involved not having been agreed upon\n\nby a majority of the court sitting prevents the case from becoming an\n\nauthority for the determination of other cases, either in this or in\n\ninferior courts.\") As Justice Kennedy noted in his concurring opinion\n\nin Eastern Enterprises, where he disavowed the takings analysis of the\n\nplurality: \"Cases attempting to decide when a regulation becomes a\n\ntaking are among the most litigated and perplexing in current law.\"\n\n\n                                - 38 -\n\f524 U.S. at 541. We will not assay the takings issue on the basis of\n\nthe insubstantial argument put forth by Ashland.18\n\n                   III. The Declaratory Judgment\n\nA. Background on CERCLA Contribution Actions\n\n          When an innocent party, usually the government, brings a cost\n\nrecovery action under § 9607, CERCLA imposes strict liability for the\n\ncosts of cleanup on a party found to be an owner or operator, past\n\noperator, transporter, or arranger. See Acushnet Co. v. Mohasco Corp.,\n\n191 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 1999).19 A party found liable under § 9607\n\nmay in turn bring an action for contribution against other polluters\n\nunder § 9613(f). In other words, while CERCLA allows for full recovery\n\nof costs from a party sued successfully under § 9607, it also permits\n\nthat party to seek contribution from other parties that have helped\n\ncreate a hazardous waste problem. See Control Data Corp. v. S.C.S.C.\n\nCorp., 53 F.3d 930, 936 (8th Cir. 1995). The statute thus provides\n\nthat a court may, in its discretion, \"allocate response costs among\n\nliable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are\n\nappropriate.\" 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f). As the Ninth Circuit has said,\n\n\"[a] PRP's contribution liability will correspond to that party's\n\n\n     18We note that the Sixth Circuit recently rejected a takings\nargument addressed to CERCLA and premised on Eastern Enterprises in\nFranklin County Convention Facilities Auth. v. Am. Premier\nUnderwriters, Inc., 240 F.3d 534, 552 (6th Cir. 2001).\n     19 A few affirmative defenses are available, but they are\ndifficult to satisfy. See Acushnet, 191 F.3d at 74.\n\n                                - 39 -\n\fequitable share of the total liability and will not be joint and\n\nseveral.\" Pinal Creek Group v. Newmont Mining Corp., 188 F.3d 1298,\n\n1301 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n          The standard for contribution liability is the same as the\n\nstandard for cost recovery liability. See Acushnet, 191 F.3d at 75.\n\nA plaintiff seeking contribution under § 9613(f) must prove that (1)\n\nthe defendant falls within one of the four categories of covered\n\nentities (i.e. is a current or past owner or operator, a transporter,\n\nor an arranger); (2) a \"release or threatened release\" of hazardous\n\nwaste involving the defendant's facility occurred; (3) the release or\n\nthreatened release caused the incurrence of response costs by the\n\nplaintiff; and (4) the plaintiff's costs were \"necessary costs of\n\nresponse . . . consistent with the national contingency plan.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9607.20\n\nB. The District Court's Declaratory Judgment Ruling\n\n          The district court found that UTC had unquestionably proven\n\nthat the Davis site was a hazardous waste facility, that a release of\n\nhazardous waste had occurred, and that this release caused the\n\nincurrence of response costs because of the necessary cleanup. The\n\n\n\n     20 The National Contingency Plan promulgated by the EPA, 40 C.F.R.\npt. 300 (1988), \"establish[es] procedures and standards for responding\nto releases of hazardous substances.\" Because the district court\nreserved challenges to UTC's specific expenditures for later\nproceedings, the compliance of UTC's cleanup plan with the National\nContingency Plan is not at issue in this case.\n\n                                - 40 -\n\fcourt thus focused on the only remaining issue for CERCLA liability:\n\n\"[W]hether the defendants are liable for those response costs on the\n\ngrounds that they either operated the facility, transported the\n\nhazardous substances to the site, or arranged for the hazardous\n\nsubstances to be disposed of at the Site.\" Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n61. Since each of the appellants was found to be an arranger, we focus\n\non that aspect of the court's ruling.\n\n          The court began by considering the evidence that CWR, the\n\nBridgeport, Connecticut waste transport company used by Ashland, Acco,\n\nGar, and PE, disposed of waste at the Davis site. The court found that\n\nin 1977, \"all of CWR's waste was taken, initially, to Sanitary\n\nLandfill,\" another Rhode Island disposal site, but that sometime after\n\nMay 1977, Anthony and Jack Capuano, owners of Sanitary Landfill, began\n\ndiverting some of CWR's waste to the Davis site. Id. at 53. Based on\n\nreceipts kept by William Davis and offered into evidence by UTC, the\n\ncourt found that \"the Capuanos directed CWR drivers to the Davis Site\n\non fifteen separate occasions.\" Id. The Davis receipts show that\n\nthese CWR deliveries took place between May 13 and July 7.21\n\n          The court said that CWR had two drivers, Wilbert Jones and\n\nJohnny Granfield, who collected 55-gallon drums of waste from\n\n\n     21Davis testified that dumping occurred on his property between\n1976 and the first part of 1977. However, he was only able to locate\nreceipts for the period between January 10, 1977 and July 7, 1977. As\na result, that is the time period relevant to the district court's\nfindings.\n\n                               - 41 -\n\fcustomers. Both Jones and Granfield sometimes drove a 40-foot flatbed\n\ntruck that carried a full load of 79 drums and was \"used to haul drums\n\nto Rhode Island.\" Id. at 52-53. Based on the testimony of Jones and\n\nof Emanuel and Michael Musillo, the principals of CWR, the court made\n\nfindings about CWR's pickup and disposal practices:\n\n          If a full load was collected early in the day,\n          the drums, sometimes, would be taken directly to\n          Sanitary Landfill. Usually, however, the truck\n          would return to CWR, and the load of drums would\n          be taken to Sanitary Landfill on the following\n          day. If less than a full load was collected, the\n          drums would be kept at CWR until seventy-nine\n          drums had accumulated. Those drums then would be\n          loaded onto the flatbed and driven to Sanitary\n          Landfill.\n\n          Drums were collected with such regularity that\n          they never remained on CWR's premises for more\n          than three days.\n\nId. at 53.\n\n          Following the theory that CWR disposed of waste within three\n\ndays of collecting it from a customer, the district court matched the\n\ndates of CWR waste pickups from appellants Ashland, Acco, Gar, and PE\n\nto the dates of waste deliveries to the Davis site. CWR kept bills of\n\nlading that recorded the dates on which it picked up wastes from\n\ncustomers. Some of the appellants kept parallel invoices. William\n\nDavis's receipts included the dates of waste deliveries. Based on this\n\nevidence, the district court determined when an arranger's waste was\n\npicked up within three days of a delivery to the Davis site. The court\n\nthen concluded that it was \"reasonable to infer\" that this waste was in\n\n                                - 42 -\n\ffact disposed of at the Davis site. Id. at 56. For example, the court\n\nheld Ashland liable for a 79-drum load that CWR picked up from Ashland\n\non June 1, 1977 because a Davis receipt showed that CWR driver Wilbert\n\nJones delivered 79 drums to Davis on June 2.        Id.\n\n          The court next turned to allegations that transporter CCC,\n\nthe company used by Morton, disposed of waste at the Davis site. The\n\ncourt found that CCC made 47 trips to the Davis site between May 1977\n\nand the first week of July and that Morton's waste was included in some\n\nof those deliveries.     Id. at 55.\n\n          Finally, the district court allocated responsibility for\n\ncleanup costs that UTC had incurred or would incur in completing the\n\nsoil remediation. The chief factor in the court's determination was\n\nthe volume of waste disposed at the Davis site that could be attributed\n\nto each defendant based on the evidence about specific deliveries.\n\nDavis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 64. For example, the court found that CWR\n\nmade two 79-drum deliveries containing 8,690 gallons of Ashland's waste\n\nto the Davis site, and so allocated to Ashland a share of\n\nresponsibility for cleanup costs based on that volume. Id. at 67.\n\nBased on its calculations of waste volume, the court allocated 1.03\n\npercent of UTC's future cleanup costs to Ashland, .16 percent to Acco,\n\n.03 percent to Gar, and .57 percent to PE. Id. at 69. The court also\n\nallocated 1.54 percent of responsibility to UTC. Id. Because the\n\ncourt found no evidence of specific deliveries yielding data about the\n\n\n                                - 43 -\n\fvolume of Morton waste disposed, it did not allocate a share of future\n\ncleanup costs to Morton.     Id. at 65.\n\nC. The Parties' Challenges to the Declaratory Judgment\n\n          1. Proof that the Defendants Disposed of Hazardous Waste\n\n          We review the district court's factual findings pursuant to\n\na clear error standard. See Dedham Water Co., Inc. v. Cumberland Farms\n\nDairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992). Clear error review\n\nmeans that:\n\n          Findings of fact will be given effect unless,\n          after reading the record with care and making due\n          allowance for the trier's superior ability to\n          gauge credibility, the reviewing court form [sic]\n          a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has\n          been made . . . . The same high level of respect\n          attaches whether the conclusions of the trial\n          court depend on its election among conflicting\n          facts or its choice of which competing inferences\n          to draw from undisputed basic facts.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). Importantly for this case,\n\n\"[w]hen the evidence supports conflicting inferences, the district\n\ncourt's choice from among the several inferences cannot be clearly\n\nerroneous.\" Id. at 462. We also note that findings of fact, even if\n\nbrief, are sufficient as long as they permit a clear understanding of\n\nthe grounds for the decision below. See Applewood Landscape & Nursery\n\nCo., Inc. v. Hollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1503 (1st Cir. 1989). With\n\nthose standards in mind, we address each party's claims separately.\n\n                  a. Ashland\n\n          In 1977, Ashland operated a chemical manufacturing plant in\n\n                               - 44 -\n\fGreat Meadows, New Jersey, generating waste that contained nitrating\n\nacid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and solvents composed of isopropyl\n\nalcohol, methyl alcohol, toluene, benzene, and xylene.           It is\n\nundisputed that Ashland contracted with CWR to dispose of this waste,\n\nand the record supports the district court's finding that CWR\n\ntransported waste to the Davis site. While Michael Musillo of CWR\n\ntestified that between 1975 and 1977 the company took all of its waste\n\ninitially to the Sanitary Landfill owned by the Capuanos, Jack Capuano\n\ntestified that after April 1977, when the landfill began getting\n\ncomplaints about odor, his brother Anthony Capuano began diverting some\n\nof CWR's waste to the Davis site.\n\n          CWR's pickup slips and billing records, as well as Ashland's\n\ndisposal logs, show that during May and June of 1977, CWR picked up\n\nthirteen tanker loads and four flatbed loads from Ashland. Each of the\n\nflatbed loads contained 79 55-gallon drums. One of the flatbed pickups\n\ntook place on June 1 and another occurred on June 30. Davis receipts\n\nbearing the name \"Capuano,\" signed by Wilbert Jones, and recording 79-\n\ndrum loads, show that CWR deliveries were diverted from Sanitary\n\nLandfill to the Davis site on June 2 and July 5. Based on its theory\n\nthat CWR delivered its waste within three days of accumulating a full\n\nflatbed load, and the explanation that the intervening weekend and July\n\n4th holiday accounted for the five-day gap between June 30 and July 5,\n\nthe district court found Ashland liable for the waste that CWR\n\n\n                                - 45 -\n\fdelivered to the Davis site on June 2 and July 5.\n\n          There is evidence in the record to support the court's\n\nconclusion. Emanuel Musillo, principal of CWR, testified that when a\n\ndriver picked up a full 79-drum load early in the day, he would go\n\nstraight to Rhode Island to dispose of it. When a driver picked up a\n\nfull load late in the day or picked up only a partial load, he would\n\npark the load at CWR overnight. The next day the driver would either\n\ncontinue to Rhode Island if the truck was full, or collect waste from\n\nanother customer if it was not. While Musillo did not definitively\n\ntestify that CWR always delivered waste within three days of collecting\n\nit, he said that when a driver accumulated a full 79-drum load, the\n\ndrums would be taken to Rhode Island \"within a few days, I would\n\nimagine.\" CWR driver Wilbert Jones also testified that after picking\n\nup a complete load, he would leave it at CWR overnight and then leave\n\nfor Rhode Island early the next morning.\n\n          Ashland challenges the court's factual findings on several\n\ngrounds.22 Ashland begins by pointing out that UTC presented no direct\n\nevidence, such as drums or other containers bearing Ashland's name and\n\n\n\n     22Ashland titles the section of its brief challenging the district\ncourt's factual findings \"As a Matter of Law, Ashland Could not Be\nFound Liable.\"      This attempt to win de novo review fails.\n\"[A]ppellant's plaint boils down to little more than thinly veiled\ndissatisfaction with the district court's factual findings.\" Dedham\nWater, 972 F.2d at 460. Ashland's alternate theories about why the\ncourt should have made other findings and inferences are factual rather\nthan legal theories and so are subject to the clear error standard.\n\n                                - 46 -\n\ffound at the Davis site, to show that Ashland's waste was on the CWR\n\ndeliveries to the Davis site.     While Ashland is correct, direct\n\nevidence is not a prerequisite to proving the elements of liability in\n\na contribution action. See 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f) (setting forth elements\n\nof liability).\n\n          To attack the district court's finding that CWR disposed of\n\nwaste within three days of collecting it, Ashland offers alternative\n\nscenarios.   Ashland's most plausible theory is based on Jones's\n\ntestimony that the Musillos sometimes \"offloaded\" nonflammable liquid\n\nwaste by pouring it from drums into a tanker truck or underground\n\nstorage facility at CWR.23 Ashland argues that its waste thus was\n\nlikely unloaded at CWR's Bridgeport site after pickup and either mixed\n\nwith other waste or stored there for an indefinite period.\n\n          Additional testimony by Jones and the Musillos calls this\n\ntheory into question. Jones was asked this question: \"[L]et's suppose\n\nthat you brought back some drums from one or more customers to\n\nBridgeport, and that you offloaded those drums. Let's say it wasn't a\n\nfull load. Typically, how long would it take before those offloaded\n\n\n\n     23 Jones said in response to a question about whether CWR mixed\nwaste collected at different times: \"Things, anything that could be\nmixed and wouldn't explode, catch a fire, put it in the tanker. Then\nwhen the tanker is full take it to Rhode Island.\" Jones also said \"if\nthere was, let's say, an overflow of drums, there were more pickups to\nbe made, and we couldn't handle it because the truck was full, and they\nhad to be made, we would take them off, put them in the warehouse until\nwe get a trip to go up to Rhode Island.\"\n\n                                - 47 -\n\fdrums would find their way to Rhode Island to be dumped?\" Jones\n\nanswered: \"No more than three days.\"       Jones also said that the\n\nMusillos, not he, did most of the mixing work.        Emanuel Musillo\n\ntestified that offloading was not CWR's normal practice because of the\n\n\"double work\" involved. He said that when drums were offloaded, they\n\nusually contained waste oil that CWR could resell. Musillo also said\n\nthat occasionally other kinds of waste were stored at CWR, but only\n\nuntil the next delivery trip to Rhode Island.        Michael Musillo\n\ncorroborated aspects of his brother's account.\n\n          In light of this testimony, the district court did not err\n\nin finding that it was more likely than not that the waste CWR\n\ncollected from Ashland on June 1 and June 30 was the waste the\n\ntransporter delivered to the Davis site on June 2 and July 5. Since\n\nboth pickups from Ashland were full 79-drum loads, it seems\n\nparticularly unlikely that CWR drivers would have taken a full load off\n\nthe flatbed truck on one day, only to deliver a full load of different\n\ndrums to the Davis site on the next business day.           Ashland's\n\nalternative scenarios are simply \"competing inferences\" that the\n\ndistrict court chose not to draw. Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457. Such\n\na choice cannot be clear error.\n\n          Ashland's other alternative scenarios also run afoul of the\n\nclear error standard. First, Ashland argues that CWR often kept waste\n\nat its Bridgeport facility for unspecified periods, making it unlikely\n\n\n                                - 48 -\n\fthat the transporter delivered Ashland's waste to the Davis site within\n\nthree days of collecting it. Ashland cites evidence that 13,000 drums\n\nof waste were stockpiled at CWR in the fall of 1977. However, since\n\nEmanuel Musillo testified that stockpiling did not begin until CWR's\n\ndisposal sites were shut down after the summer of 1977, the evidence on\n\nthis point does not undermine the district court's findings. Second,\n\nAshland argues that the June 2 and July 5 disposals that CWR made at\n\nDavis likely contained waste generated by an unknown source that CWR\n\npicked up from an unidentified parking lot in the New Jersey\n\nMeadowlands. While Jones testified that he picked up drum loads of\n\nwaste from a parking lot somewhere in the Meadowlands not \"more than\n\neight or ten times\" during 1977, he did not remember the dates of those\n\npickups. His testimony thus lacks the specifics necessary to link the\n\nMeadowlands pickups to the June 2 and July 5 deliveries to the Davis\n\nsite. Finally, Ashland argues that the June 2 and July 5 disposals\n\ncontained waste that CWR picked up from CCC customers. There is no\n\nevidence to show that CWR picked up waste for CCC during the relevant\n\ntime period.24\n\n\n     24  Ashland and PE also argue that the district court's finding\nthat CWR had an established practice of delivering waste within three\ndays of collecting it conflicts with United States v. Newman, 982 F.2d\n665 (1st Cir. 1992). However, Newman is inapposite to the case at\nhand. In that case, we held that a trial judge did not abuse his\ndiscretion by excluding material habit evidence under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 406 when that evidence \"did not require the conclusion that\nthe putative practice was followed with the necessary regularity.\" Id.\nat 669 (emphasis added). Newman thus concerns the standards for the\n\n                                - 49 -\n\f          In short, while the testimony by Jones and the Musillos\n\ncontains some minor ambiguities, the district court did not err by\n\ninferring that CWR regularly disposed of waste within three days of\n\ncollecting it, or by inferring that CWR transported Ashland's waste to\n\nthe Davis site on June 2 and July 5.25\n\n                  b. Acco-Bristol\n\n\nadmission of habit or routine practice. Here, by contrast, the\ntestimony from the Musillos and Jones was admitted without objection by\nthe appellants, who now argue that this evidence is not sufficient to\nestablish CWR's pickup and delivery practices. This argument fails.\nOnce routine practice evidence has been admitted, Rule 406 does not\nlimit the district court's consideration of such evidence, or the\nweight that it may be given.\n\n     25Ashlandalso mounts a misnomer defense, arguing that UTC did not\nname the proper party in its pleadings when it sued \"Ashland Chemical\nInc.\" rather than \"Ashland Chemical Co.\" According to stipulations of\nfact by the parties, Ashland Chemical Inc. was incorporated in 1989 and\nmerged into Ashland Oil Inc. in 1993. In 1996, Ashland Oil Inc.\nchanged its name to Ashland Inc. Ashland Chemical Co., which operated\nthe Great Meadows, New Jersey facility from which CWR transported\nhazardous waste, was a division of Ashland Oil Inc. in 1977. While\nAshland Chemical Inc. may technically be an inaccurate reference to\nAshland Chemical Co., there is no question that Ashland received\nadequate notice that it was being sued, and that it owned the Great\nMeadows facility from which the liability at issue here stemmed. Cf.\nFed. R. Civ. Proc. 15(c)(3), Advisory Committee Notes 1991 Amendment\n(\"An intended defendant who is notified of an action within the period\nallowed . . . for service of a summons and complaint may not under the\nrevised rule defeat the action on account of a defect in the pleading\nwith respect to the defendant's name . . . . [A] complaint may be\namended at any time to correct a formal defect such as a misnomer or\nmisidentification.\"); Hill v. Shelander, 924 F.2d 1370, 1374 n.2 (7th\nCir. 1991) (\"Plainly, the new language [of Rule 15(c)(3)] comprehends\na situation where the original complaint sues the correct party but\nidentifies him by a technically incorrect name.\"). There is no\nquestion here that UTC sued the correct party and that judgment was\nentered against that party. As a result, we reject Ashland's misnomer\ndefense.\n\n                                - 50 -\n\f           Acco-Bristol Division of Babcock Industries maintained a\n\nmanufacturing facility in Waterbury, Connecticut in 1977.         This\n\nfacility produced controls for oil and gas lines through processes\n\ninvolving electroplating, soldering, welding, and degreasing machine\n\nparts. Wastes produced by Acco included 1,1,1-TCA, a soap and cyanide\n\nwaste stream, and acid sludge. Acco typically put the waste in 55-\n\ngallon drums for disposal.\n\n           CWR twice picked up waste from Acco during the spring and\n\nsummer of 1977, collecting 50 drums on April 6 26 and 24 drums on June\n\n28. On June 29, CWR received a check in the amount of $324 for these\n\npickups.   A \"Capuano Dumping Charge Slip,\" also dated June 29,\n\nindicates that CWR delivered a full load of 79 drums to the Davis site.\n\nThe evidence at trial indicated that drivers directed to the Davis site\n\nby the Capuanos at Sanitary Landfill sometimes presented Capuano\n\ndumping receipts to William Davis. Davis testified that he used these\n\nslips to verify the amount of waste dumped on his property and to help\n\nhim prepare invoices for Sanitary Landfill. In keeping with this\n\npractice, Davis sent a bill to Sanitary Landfill on June 29 for 79\n\ngallons of waste.\n\n           Based on this evidence, the district court inferred that the\n\n24 drums of Acco waste went to the Davis site in CWR's shipment on June\n\n\n     26 The district court declined to infer that the shipment picked\nup by CWR on April 6 went to the Davis site because there were no Davis\nslips within three days of that date.\n\n                                - 51 -\n\f29. We cannot conclude that this determination is clearly erroneous.\n\nAcco points out that on June 27 and 28, CWR picked up 99 drums of waste\n\nfrom various customers -- 20 drums more than were dumped at the Davis\n\nsite.   However, at least 17 of those drums were picked up from\n\ncustomers who frequently disposed of waste oils. Because CWR tended to\n\nsell waste oil to salvagers, as we have noted, the district court's\n\nconclusion that the 24 drums of Acco's waste were part of the 79 drums\n\nsent to the Davis site on June 29 was reasonable.\n\n          Acco argues that the district court erred in relying on the\n\nCapuano slip to infer the presence of Acco's waste at the Davis site\n\nbecause the slip does not specify a transporter. Specifically, Acco\n\nclaims that CCC or another waste company, rather than CWR, Acco's only\n\ntransporter, could have brought the waste delivered on June 29.\n\nHowever, testimony at trial makes clear that by June 1977, CCC was\n\ndumping waste directly at the Davis site without stopping at Sanitary\n\nLandfill first.   Thus, it is not likely that the June 29 Capuano\n\nDumping Charge Slip accounted for waste hauled by CCC. As a result, we\n\ncannot say that the district court's findings that the Capuano slip\n\nreferred to waste dumped by CWR, and that Acco's waste was part of that\n\ndelivery, was clearly erroneous.      See Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 463.\n\n                  c. Black & Decker a/k/a Gar\n\n          Gar operated an electroplating business in Danbury,\n\nConnecticut. Its waste contained nitric acid, copper, nickel, and\n\n\n                                - 52 -\n\fcyanide. According to CWR records, the transporter picked up five\n\nloads of waste from Gar on May 6 (13 drums), June 20 (5 drums), June 27\n\n(2 drums), September 2 (7 drums), and September 30 (11 drums). A Davis\n\nreceipt shows that on June 21, the day after the five-drum pickup, CWR\n\ndisposed of 60 drums of waste at the Davis site.       The five drums\n\ncollected on June 20 contained 275 gallons of waste. Based on this\n\nevidence, the district court found Gar liable for dumping 275 gallons\n\nof waste at the Davis site.\n\n          Gar poses two challenges to the court's factual findings.27\n\nIt notes that CWR picked up more than 300 drums28 from Connecticut and\n\nNew Jersey customers on the three business days before June 21, and\n\nconcludes that in light of those pickups it is not mathematically\n\nlikely that Gar's five drums were among the 60 drums that CWR delivered\n\nto Davis on June 21. Admittedly, the collection of more than 300 drums\n\nin the days leading up to the June 21 delivery to Davis means that it\n\nis less likely that Gar's five drums were among those delivered than it\n\nis, for example, that the 79 drums picked up from Ashland on June 1\n\nwere the 79 drums delivered to the Davis site on June 2.\n\n\n     27Gar also argues, like Ashland, that there was no direct evidence\nthat its waste ended up at Davis, and that CWR regularly offloaded its\ncustomers' waste at its property for unspecified periods of time and\nalso mixed different customers' waste at its Bridgeport facility.\nThese arguments fail for the same reasons discussed above.\n     28Gar says that CWR picked up 352 drums on the three business days\nbefore the June 21 delivery. UTC counts 326 drums and 13 smaller\ncontainers collected between June 17 and June 22.\n\n                                - 53 -\n\f          Nonetheless, the evidence that Gar emphasizes does not lead\n\nus to conclude that the district court's findings were clear error. As\n\nUTC points out, the Davis receipts show that CWR delivered a total of\n\n219 drums to the Davis site on June 21, June 22, and June 23,\n\nincreasing the likelihood that Gar's five drums were among those\n\ndelivered. In addition, 62 of the 300-plus drums collected on the\n\npreceding days came from customers that sent waste oil to CWR, and so,\n\naccording to Emanuel Musillo's testimony, would likely have been\n\noffloaded and stored for resale rather than being delivered to the\n\nDavis site.\n\n          To cast further doubt on the district court's findings, Gar\n\npoints out that the Davis slip from June 21 says \"SOLIDS\" for solid\n\nwaste, and that Gar produced liquid waste. Davis's testimony at trial\n\nundermines the significance of the solids designation. Davis said that\n\nhe distinguished between solid and liquid waste because he poured\n\nliquid waste out of the barrels and resold them. Because he could not\n\nresell the barrels containing solids, he charged more for solid waste\n\n(one dollar per barrel) than he did for liquid waste (50 cents per\n\nbarrel). Davis therefore had a financial incentive to classify drums\n\nof waste as solid rather than liquid. Davis also testified that he\n\nconsidered anything \"solid\" that did not pour easily, including any\n\nsludge or residue left in the drums. Also, there is no evidence that\n\nDavis examined each barrel before classifying a shipment.\n\n\n                               - 54 -\n\f             Finally, Gar notes that while the evidence shows that CWR\n\ndriver Johnny Granfield made the June 21 delivery to the Davis site,\n\nthere is no evidence concerning which CWR driver picked up Gar's waste\n\non June 20. This matters because each CWR driver only drove waste to\n\nthe Davis site that he himself collected. Thus Gar argues that the\n\npossibility that Wilbert Jones, the other CWR driver, picked up its\n\nwaste on June 20 lessens the likelihood that its waste was among the 60\n\ndrums delivered to the Davis site on June 21. However, since there is\n\nno evidence to show that Granfield was not the driver who collected\n\nGar's waste on June 20, and since the evidence did establish that the\n\ndriver who delivered waste to the Davis site had picked it up, the\n\ndistrict court could have inferred that Granfield collected the waste\n\nfrom Gar, and that this waste was on his truck when he made the June 21\n\ndelivery to Davis.\n\n                    d. Perkin-Elmer\n\n             PE operated four Connecticut facilities in 1977, at which it\n\ngenerated waste that included methylene chloride, 1,1,1-TCA, and\n\ntoluene.29    PE acknowledges that these hazardous substances were\n\nidentified at the Davis site.\n\n\n     29 PE operated facilities at four locations: (1) a primary\nmanufacturing facility in Norwalk; (2) a research facility at 50\nDanbury Road in Wilton; (3) a manufacturing and research facility at 77\nDanbury Road in Wilton; and (4) and Qualitron Corporation's\nmanufacturing facility in Danbury. Qualitron became a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of PE in May 1984. PE does not contest its responsibility\nfor Qualitron's environmental liability in this case.\n\n                                  - 55 -\n\f          PE's records show that CWR picked up waste from one of PE's\n\nfacilities seven times during the spring and early summer of 1977: on\n\nMay 26, June 20, June 22 (from three facilities), June 27, and July 1.\n\nDavis slips indicated that CWR delivered drums to the site on May 27,\n\nJune 21, June 23, June 29, and July 5, 6, and 7. Based on the theory\n\nthat CWR delivered waste within three days of collecting it, the\n\ndistrict court inferred that the PE pickup on May 26 was dumped at the\n\nDavis site on May 27; the pickup on June 20 was dumped on June 21; the\n\npickups on June 22 were dumped on June 23; the pickup on June 27 was\n\ndumped on June 29; and the pickup on July 1 was dumped on July 5, 6, or\n\n7.\n\n          PE objects to the district court's finding of liability on\n\nnumerous grounds.    First, it argues that the court erred in not\n\n\"locating and identifying\" PE's waste at the Davis site. As PE notes,\n\nthe district court said in articulating the proof required by CERCLA:\n\n\"In the context of this case, proof that a defendant generator's\n\nhazardous waste 'can be located and identified at the Davis Site' is a\n\nsina qua non in establishing arranger liability.\" Davis IV, 31 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 61 (quoting Davis I, 882 F. Supp. at 1221). PE argues\n\nunpersuasively that the district court intended with this language to\n\ncreate a new and higher standard of liability under CERCLA, requiring\n\nthat UTC establish waste deposits with direct evidence such as\n\ncontainers bearing PE's name and containing residue of a hazardous\n\n\n                                - 56 -\n\fwaste PE generated. We have already rejected an interpretation of\n\nCERCLA that \"would cast the plaintiff in the impossible role of tracing\n\nchemical waste to particular sources in particular amounts, a task that\n\nis often technologically infeasible due to the fluctuating quantity and\n\nvaried nature of the pollution at a site over the course of many\n\nyears.\"   Acushnet, 191 F.3d at 76.\n\n          PE also points out that the number of drums of waste picked\n\nup by CWR in any three-day period before PE's waste was allegedly\n\ndelivered to the Davis site is not the same as the number of drums\n\nnoted on the Davis slip for that day. However, as we have discussed\n\nabove, some of those drums from other customers contained waste oil\n\nwhich CWR often salvaged and so likely would not have delivered to the\n\nDavis site. Thus, the discrepancy between the number of barrels picked\n\nup and delivered by CWR does not undermine the court's conclusion that\n\nPE's waste went to the Davis site.\n\n          PE also argues that its waste was not dumped at the Davis\n\nsite because it produced only liquid waste, and all of the Davis slips\n\nlinking its waste to the site indicated that the barrels dumped by CWR\n\ncontained solid waste. PE's contention that it only produced liquid\n\nwaste is contradicted by evidence in the record. Joseph Rabideau,\n\ndesignated by PE to testify on behalf of the corporation, testified\n\nthat CWR disposed of waste for PE that included \"a solidified scrape\n\noff type material\" and that waste picked up by CWR in open-top five\n\n\n                                - 57 -\n\fgallon pails was \"solidified material.\" Rabideau also explained that\n\nPE's use of methylene chloride as a solvent produced \"still bottoms\"\n\nthat were disposed of \"in a fairly solidified form.\" PE also produced\n\na semi-solid paint residue sludge as part of its paint operation.\n\n           Moreover, as we have discussed, Davis's testimony at trial\n\ndemonstrated that his classification of waste as solid or liquid was\n\nnot an exact process. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in\n\nconcluding that waste classified as a liquid by PE might nonetheless be\n\nconsidered a solid by Davis if the barrel contained any residue that\n\ncould not be easily poured. Based on this evidence, it was not clear\n\nerror for the district court to conclude that Davis could have\n\ncharacterized a shipment of 79 barrels as \"solid\" even though some --\n\nor even most -- of the drums he did not examine actually contained\n\nliquids.\n\n           In sum, all of PE's objections to the district court's\n\nfinding of liability are essentially disputes about the court's finding\n\nof the facts and the inferences drawn from CWR's established waste\n\npractices. We must uphold these findings and inferences unless they\n\nare clearly erroneous. See Dedham, 972 F.2d at 457. For the reasons\n\nwe have explained, evidence in the record amply supports the district\n\ncourt's determinations.\n\n           2. Wilbert Jones's Testimony\n\n           Acco, Ashland, Gar, and Perkin-Elmer all argue that the\n\n\n                                - 58 -\n\fdistrict court erred in admitting and crediting the deposition\n\ntestimony of Wilbert Jones, one of the two drivers who hauled waste for\n\nCWR. At the time of his deposition in June 1996, Jones was unemployed\n\nand very ill. He died in May 1997. UTC paid Jones approximately $30\n\nper hour as compensation for the time he spent preparing and\n\ntestifying, for a total of between $700 and $800.30\n\n          At trial, the defendants argued that UTC's payments to Jones\n\nraise an inference that Jones's testimony was improperly influenced by\n\nUTC and should be excluded for that reason.       The district court\n\nrejected this argument in a ruling from the bench, finding that \"under\n\nthese circumstances it's a reasonable amount to have paid him.\" The\n\ndefendants appeal this ruling to admit the testimony.\n\n          Citing two grounds for disbelieving Jones's testimony, the\n\ndefendants argue further that the district court should not have\n\ncredited Jones's testimony. First, they state that the payments UTC\n\nmade to Jones -- if they do not render his testimony inadmissible --\n\nshould have caused the district court to reject his account of CWR's\n\npractices. Second, the defendants argue that Jones should not be\n\nbelieved because he signed affidavits prepared for other litigation\n\nthat they claim are inconsistent with his testimony in this case.\n\n\n     30The defendants claim that UTC did not timely or adequately\ndisclose the details of the payments it made to Jones. However, the\nissue of his compensation was raised during the June 1996 deposition\nand the defendants had the opportunity to cross-examine Jones on the\nissue of compensation at that time.\n\n                                - 59 -\n\f                  a. Grounds for Exclusion\n\n          We first consider whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in admitting Jones's deposition testimony.31 To the extent\n\nthat the defendants argue that the payments to Jones rendered him\n\nincompetent as a witness, their effort fails. Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n601 provides: \"Every person is competent to be a witness except as\n\notherwise provided in these rules.\"32 See also United States v. Devin,\n\n918 F.2d 280, 292 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is a well-established principle,\n\nembodied in Fed. R. Evid. 601, that witnesses are presumed competent to\n\ntestify.\"). A district court's determination to allow a witness to\n\ntestify is overturned only for abuse of discretion. See Devin, 918\n\nF.2d at 292; United States v. Hyson, 721 F.2d 856, 864 (1st Cir. 1983)\n\n\n     31The defendants cite Rule 3.4(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of\nProfessional Conduct for the proposition that a lawyer shall not \"offer\nan inducement to a witness that is prohibited by law.\" This ethical\nrule does not advance their argument. The rule only prohibits\ncompensation given to a witness in violation of law. For reasons we\nexplain here, reasonable compensation to witnesses is not prohibited by\nlaw and does not render their testimony inadmissible.\n     32 As the district court recognized, the defendants' challenge to\nJones's competency is not a challenge to his competency \"in the sense\nof whether he had all of his [mental] faculties.\" While \"competency\"\ngenerally refers to a witness's mental capacity to perceive events and\ncomprehend the obligation to tell the truth, see, e.g., United States\nv. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 292 (1st Cir. 1990) (affirming district court's\ndetermination that a witness with a history of psychiatric episodes was\ncompetent), the concept of competency has been used to challenge\ntestimony where it is alleged that a witness's credibility is so poor\nas to render his or her testimony inadmissible, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Bedonie, 913 F.2d 782, 799 (10th Cir. 1990) (rejecting the\nargument that prior inconsistent statements rendered a witness\nincompetent to testify under Rule 601).\n\n                                - 60 -\n\f(\"The competency of a witness to testify is for the trial judge.\").\n\n           We have been reluctant to exclude testimony based only on the\n\nfact that a witness was paid. For example, in United States v. Cresta,\n\nwhere an informant had been paid by the government, we said: \"Rather\n\nthan adopting an exclusionary rule for a particular factual situation,\n\nirrespective of the mode of payment, we prefer the rule that would\n\nleave the entire matter to the jury to consider in weighing the\n\ncredibility of the witness-informant.\" 825 F.2d 538, 547 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (quoting United States v. Grimes, 438 F.2d 391, 396 (6th Cir.\n\n1971)). See also Borges v. Our Lady of the Sea Corp., 935 F.2d 436,\n\n440 (1st Cir. 1991) (assuming without deciding that even if a witness's\n\nstatements were obtained improperly, \"such impropriety in the means of\n\nobtaining a statement would not automatically bar admission of the\n\nstatement at trial.\"). Since the witness in Cresta had received most\n\nof his compensation prior to trial, his payment was not contingent upon\n\nthe conviction of any of the defendants. See id. Because the witness\n\nhad been thoroughly cross-examined about the nature of his agreement\n\nwith the government and the jury had been told to consider his\n\ntestimony with care, the admission of the testimony was upheld on\n\nappeal.   While Cresta involved a payment to a government informer\n\nrather than to a witness deposed in a civil action, the reasoning of\n\nCresta applies here. The defendants have not claimed that the payment\n\nto Jones was contingent upon a finding that the defendants were liable.\n\n\n                                - 61 -\n\fAdditionally, the district court was fully informed about the payments\n\nmade to Jones -- as the jury was in Cresta -- and considered those\n\npayments as part of its assessment of Jones's credibility.           The\n\ndefendants have not attempted to distinguish Cresta from the instant\n\nmatter.33\n\n                   b. Grounds for Disbelieving\n\n            The defendants argue that even if the payments Jones received\n\ndid not render his testimony inadmissible, those payments should have\n\ncaused    the   district   court   to   discredit   Jones's   testimony.\n\nSpecifically, they say that Jones's total compensation is excessive in\n\nlight of the fact that he was elderly, ill, and unemployed at the time\n\nof the deposition. They claim that the time spent testifying did not\n\ndivert Jones from any other lucrative pursuits and that payments at a\n\nrate of $30 per hour constituted a windfall to him and raise an\n\ninference that the payments were intended to improperly influence his\n\ntestimony. The district court explicitly considered these arguments\n\nand rejected them. Reviewing the court's decision to credit Jones's\n\n\n\n     33 The case cited by the defendants for the proposition that\npayment to a fact witness to testify at depositions violated a state\nethics rule prohibiting lawyers from offering inducements to witnesses\nis Golden Door Jewelry Creations, Inc. v. Lloyds Underwriters Non-\nMarine Assoc., 865 F. Supp. 1516, 1526 (S.D. Fla. 1994). Golden Door\nis easily distinguished from the present case because the payments to\ntwo witnesses totaled over $400,000 and $100,000. See id. Indeed,\nGolden Door itself acknowledges that \"[p]ayments made to fact witnesses\nas actual expenses as permitted by law will not be disturbed or set\naside.\" Id. at 1526 n.11.\n\n                                   - 62 -\n\ftestimony for clear error, see United States v. Rostoff, 164 F.3d 63,\n\n71 (1st Cir. 1999), we find none.34      Although Jones was ill and\n\nunemployed when he gave his testimony, $30 per hour is not a payment so\n\noutrageously high as to raise an inference that his testimony was\n\ninfluenced. As the district court stated from the bench when it ruled\n\non this issue: \"Everybody's time is worth something.\"\n\n          The defendants also argue that the district court should have\n\ndiscredited Jones's deposition testimony because he allegedly made\n\nprior inconsistent statements in affidavits he signed for litigation\n\nknown as the Picillo Superfund case. See generally O'Neil v. Picillo,\n\n883 F.2d 176 (1st Cir. 1989). Jones signed these Picillo affidavits in\n\nSeptember 1995. Four of the affidavits were admitted into evidence at\n\nthe Davis trial. The affidavits all said in similar language that\n\nJones dumped waste at the site known as the \"Picillo Pig Farm\" in\n\nCoventry, Rhode Island during 1977.      For example, the affidavit\n\nrelating to PE states the following:\n\n          One of the Musillo customers I went to was Perkin\n          Elmer in Norwalk, Connecticut. Each week, during\n\n\n     34The defendants attempt to avoid this deferential standard of\nreview by arguing that the district court was not in a position to\nevaluate Jones's credibility firsthand because Jones's testimony at\ntrial was submitted by reading lengthy excerpts from his deposition.\nHowever, it is well-settled that the court's credibility findings\nregarding deposition testimony are still entitled to deference on\nappeal. See Amer. Foreign Ins. Ass'n v. Seatrain Lines of Puerto Rico,\nInc., 689 F.2d 295, 298 (1st Cir. 1982) (applying clearly erroneous\nstandard of review to factual findings of the trial court even where\nthe record consisted only of photographs and deposition testimony).\n\n                                - 63 -\n\f          the year 1977, I would haul 15 to 20 drums, 55\n          gallon size . . . . I would haul these same drums\n          of waste to the Chemical Waste Removal yard in\n          Bridgeport where they were stored until a full\n          flatbed trailer load of 79 drums was accumulated.\n          I would then dispose of these Perkin Elmer drums\n          of waste at Picillo Pig Farm.\n\nAttorneys for the defendants questioned Jones about these statements\n\nduring his deposition and asked him to reconcile the affidavits with\n\nhis testimony in the Davis litigation. He explained that he never\n\ndumped at the Davis site again after he began dumping at the Picillo\n\nsite in 1977. Therefore, Jones's deposition testimony in this case and\n\nthe Picillo affidavits may be interpreted to provide a consistent\n\naccount of his dumping practices during 1977: Jones dumped at the Davis\n\nsite until Davis stopped accepting waste in September, at which time he\n\nbegan dumping at the Picillo pig farm. Moreover, even without this\n\nexplanation, the affidavits are not facially inconsistent with Jones's\n\ntestimony because the affidavits do not mention the Davis site at all,\n\nleaving open the possibility that Jones dumped at both sites during\n\n1977, but at different times. In sum, the statements in the Picillo\n\naffidavits are not, as the defendants contend, flatly contradictory or\n\ninconsistent with Jones's testimony in the Davis litigation.\n\nParticularly in light of the documentary evidence offered at trial --\n\nconsisting of Davis slips, bills of lading, and other ledgers and\n\nreceipts -- and the testimony of the Musillo brothers that corroborated\n\nmuch of what Jones said, we cannot conclude that the district court\n\n\n                                - 64 -\n\fclearly erred in choosing to credit some of Jones's testimony.\n\n          3. Exclusion of Master Chart\n\n          Acco and Gar argue that the district court erred in excluding\n\na 120-page chart captioned \"Contentions of the Contribution Plaintiffs\"\n\nthat UTC's lawyers prepared for the Rule 30(b)(6)35 testimony of UTC's\n\ncorporate designee, Troy Charlton. The chart summarized information\n\nUTC obtained during discovery about the claims and theories of various\n\nparties to the litigation, most of whom were third or fourth-party\n\ndefendants. More specifically, the chart, organized by party name,\n\nlisted information about the dates of disposal at the Davis site, the\n\nvolume of waste, the hauler used by that party, and the hazardous\n\nsubstances contained in the waste. The chart also identified pertinent\n\ndocuments and testimony for each of the parties. Charlton referred to\n\nthe chart to answer questions throughout his deposition and\n\noccasionally read from it verbatim.\n\n\n\n     35 Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) provides:\n     A party may in the party's notice and in a subpoena name as\n     the deponent a public or private corporation or a\n     partnership or association or governmental agency and\n     describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which\n     examination is requested. In that event, the organization so\n     named shall designate one or more officers, directors, or\n     managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on\n     its behalf, and may set forth, for each person designated,\n     the matters on which the person will testify. A subpoena\n     shall advise a non-party organization of its duty to make\n     such a designation. The persons so designated shall testify\n     as to matters known or reasonably available to the\n     organization.\n\n                                - 65 -\n\f                  a. Procedural Posture\n\n          UTC claims that Acco and Gar cannot appeal the exclusion of\n\nthe chart from evidence because they did not move for its admission\n\nbelow. Only Sealed Air Corporation (SAC) and Morton moved to introduce\n\nthe chart at trial, arguing that it constituted an admission by UTC.\n\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) (defining admissions by a party-opponent as\n\n\"not hearsay\"). Neither SAC nor Morton appealed the district court's\n\ndenial of their motions, although Acco and Gar now argue that the\n\ndistrict court erred in excluding the chart. Acco and Gar are not\n\nprecluded from making this claim despite their failure to do so below.\n\nThe plain language of Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2), written in the passive\n\ntense, does not require a party to have made an offer of proof at trial\n\nin order to preserve the right to appeal. Rather, Rule 103(a)(2)\n\nstates that an offer of proof is adequate when: \"In case the ruling is\n\none excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to\n\nthe court by offer or was apparent from the context within which\n\nquestions were asked.\" Fed. R. Evid. R. 103(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n\nIn considering whether an adequate offer of proof was made at trial, we\n\nhave focused on whether the proof sufficed to notify the court of the\n\nsignificance of the evidence such that the record was developed\n\nadequately for appeal. See, e.g., Harrison v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.,\n\n981 F.2d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (Rule 103(a)(2) requires an offer of\n\nproof \"to ensure that the trial judge and the appellate court can\n\n\n                                - 66 -\n\fevaluate the matter fully\"). Morton and SAC made an adequate offer of\n\nproof in attempting to admit the master chart into evidence. They\n\nfiled motions to admit the chart, as well as lengthy memoranda of law,\n\nand argued orally before the district court that it was admissible as\n\nan admission by UTC. Accordingly, Acco and Gar may appeal the district\n\ncourt's decision to exclude the chart.36\n\n                  b. Admissibility of the Chart\n\n          In moving to introduce the chart at trial, SAC and Morton\n\nargued that it constituted a party admission by UTC. See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2). Ruling on this motion from the bench, the district court\n\nconcluded that the chart was UTC's statement but found that it did not\n\nqualify as an admission. Noting that there must be \"some indication of\n\nreliability\" for the statement to be an admission, the court found that\n\na party cannot be \"bound by statements that simply relate to hearsay\n\ninformation received regarding matters clearly outside the scope of the\n\ncorporations knowledge or statements that describe evidence compiled\n\nfrom third-party sources by the corporation in preparation for trial.\"\n\nThe district court then explained its view of the statements contained\n\nin the master chart, noting first that it appeared \"to contain a\n\n\n     36 UTC cites only one case to support its argument that Acco and\nGar may not appeal the ruling to exclude the chart. See United States\nv. Long, 706 F.2d 1044, 1052 (9th Cir. 1983) (finding that defendant\nwho did not move to admit an affidavit at trial had waived his right to\ndo so on appeal, although his co-defendant had moved for its\nadmission). In light of the plain language of Fed. R. Evid. 103 and\nour precedent on this issue, we do not find Long persuasive.\n\n                                - 67 -\n\fmixture of different things.\"      The court described the chart as\n\nfollows:\n\n           Information that UTC received from a variety of\n           third-party sources. For example, it consisted\n           primarily of things like what UTC has summarized\n           as being contained in documents obtained from Mr.\n           Davis and others; what Mr. Carracino and others\n           may have said according to UTC in their\n           depositions. They all - they also contain, in\n           addition to this . . . information, which seems\n           to be dominant, they also contain a significant -\n           significant number of unattributed statements\n           [or] inferences based on the first category of\n           information.\n\nAccordingly, the district court denied Morton and SAC's motions to\n\nadmit the master chart, concluding: \"it is impossible to determine\n\nexactly what all this information is and in a sense it clearly appears\n\nthat most of it is simply information obtained from third-party sources\n\nand compiled in preparation for trial.\"\n\n           \"[A] trial court enjoys considerable discretion in connection\n\nwith the admission or exclusion of evidence.\" Udemba v. Nicoli, 237\n\nF.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 2001). The decision not to admit the chart in\n\nthis case is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Udemba, 237 F.3d at\n\n15; Williams v. Drake, 146 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 1998). With respect\n\nto party admissions, we have noted the following:\n\n           For a statement to be an admission under Rule\n           801(d)(2), the statement must be made by a party,\n           or by a party's agent or servant within the scope\n           of the agency of employment. . . . Each link in\n           the chain must be admissible, either because it\n           is an admission and thus not hearsay or under\n           some other hearsay exception. . . . While there\n\n                                - 68 -\n\f          may be controversy over whether admissions must\n          be based on personal knowledge, . . .\n          unattributed statements repeated by party-\n          opponents cannot be admissible. As the original\n          declarant is unknown, it is impossible to\n          determine whether the original declarant also\n          fits within the party-opponent definition, and\n          thus the exclusion of [the challenged statements]\n          was proper.\n\nVazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 1998) (emphasis\n\nadded). Acco and Gar must establish that the chart prepared by UTC is\n\ngrounded in admissible evidence.37 They have not done so. The chart\n\nwas prepared by UTC's lawyers and contained information UTC had\n\ndeveloped from discovery, including inferences from third-party\n\ninformation.   The chart also contained a number of unattributed\n\nstatements. Acco and Gar have not attempted to identify the source of\n\nthese statements or specify which of the statements might be\n\nadmissible. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision to\n\nexclude the chart from evidence.\n\n          4. Proof that Defendants' Waste Caused or Contributed to\nCleanup Costs\n\n\n\n     37Summary charts offered pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 1006, governing\ncharts summarizing voluminous writings, must also be grounded in\nadmissible evidence. See United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1126\n(1st Cir. 1989); United States v. Sorrentino, 726 F.2d 876, 884 (1st\nCir. 1984) (\"[P]urported summaries containing assertions not otherwise\nsupported by the record are not admissible.\"). While Acco and Gar have\nnot identified the master chart as a summary chart under Rule 1006,\nseeking to admit it as an admission of UTC instead, the master chart --\nmore than 100 pages long -- summarizes a large quantity of information,\nand whether it is deemed a party admission or a summary chart, Acco and\nGar must prove that the statements in the chart are admissible.\n\n                                - 69 -\n\f                  Ashland and Acco argue that there is no evidence\n\nconcerning the quality or quantity of hazardous substances in the\n\nAshland and Acco drums found at the Davis site, and thus no evidence\n\nthat disposal of the drums can cause UTC to incur cleanup costs. Gar\n\nmakes two additional lack of causation arguments, contending that: (1)\n\nthere is no evidence that the company contributed more than background\n\nlevels of contamination since it was found liable for only five drums\n\nof waste; and (2) that its waste, which contained metals, has not\n\ncontributed to UTC's soil remediation costs because the remediation is\n\ndirected only at cleaning up volatile organic compounds. We review for\n\nclear error the court's factual finding that the appellants' waste\n\ntriggered cleanup costs.     See Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457.\n\n          In discussing the environmental damage at the Davis site, the\n\ndistrict court found that three categories of waste were present in the\n\nsoil and ground or surface water at greater than background levels:38\n\n\"volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds\n\n(SVOCs), and metals.\" See Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 51. The VOCs\n\nincluded \"benzene, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methylene chloride,\n\nperchloroethylene    a/k/a    tetrachloroethylene     (PCE),    1,1,1,\n\ntricloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), trichlorethylene (TCE), toluene, and\n\n\n\n     38The background level of a hazardous substance is measured in\nparts per million or parts per billion, and reflects the level that\npresents an acceptable degree of health risk, according to scientific\njudgments.\n\n                                - 70 -\n\fxylene.\" Id. The metals included \"cadmium, copper, cyanide, and\n\nnickel.\"   Id.\n\n           The court found that Acco, which manufactured controls for\n\noil and gasoline lines, produced waste containing 1,1,1,-TCA, cadmium,\n\ncopper, and nickel compounds, cyanide, and hydrochloric or sulfuric\n\nacid. See id. at 55. Ashland, a chemical manufacturer, generated\n\nwaste that contained nitrating acid, composed of sulfuric acid and\n\nnitric acid, as well as solvents composed of isopropyl alcohol, methyl\n\nalcohol, toluene, benzene, and xylene. See id. at 56. Gar, which \"was\n\nin the electroplating business,\" generated wastes containing nitric\n\nacid, copper, nickel, and cyanide.        Id.\n\n           The court found that \"[s]ince the hazardous waste deposited\n\nat the Davis site has been commingled into an essentially homogeneous\n\n'witches' brew,' it is impossible to allocate discrete portions of the\n\ncleanup cost to any particular type of waste or any particular party.\"\n\nId. at 64. As a result, the court made a general finding that \"the\n\nevidence does establish hazardous substances produced by Acco-Bristol,\n\nAshland, Gar, and Perkin-Elmer as well as Morton were deposited at the\n\nDavis Site, that each of them contracted for the disposal and that the\n\nrelease and threatened release of those kinds of substances triggered\n\nresponse costs.\"    Id. at 62.\n\n           In finding that the appellants' waste contributed to UTC's\n\ncleanup costs, the district court drew a reasonable inference based on\n\n\n                                 - 71 -\n\fthe evidence. Evidence about the defendants' manufacturing processes\n\nin 1976 and 1977 supports the finding that each defendant generated\n\nwaste that contained one or more of the hazardous substances identified\n\nat the Davis site at concentrations exceeding background levels. See\n\nid. at 51. Evidence about the commingling of these substances in the\n\nwater and soil at the site supports the finding that the harm caused by\n\neach individual substance could not be remediated separately. The court\n\nthus concluded that the defendants had caused or contributed to cleanup\n\ncosts at the site.\n\n          The appellants' arguments to the contrary rely on a highly\n\nselective reading of Acushnet Co. v. Mohasco Corp., 191 F.3d 69 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).       The passage they cite states:\n\n          It might, of course, make sense to say that a\n          defendant's release did not 'cause' the\n          incurrence of response costs when the monies were\n          expended for purposes wholly unrelated to\n          responding to environmental contamination. And\n          we suppose it may even be accurate to say that a\n          generator or transporter of waste did not cause\n          a plaintiff to incur remediation costs when that\n          person did not actually cause any alleged\n          contamination, or perhaps even where clean up\n          efforts were directed at cleaning up toxins other\n          than those attributed to the defendant.\n\n\nAcushnet, 191 F.3d at 77 n.7 (citation omitted).        Based on this\n\nlanguage, the appellants assert that CERCLA contribution plaintiffs\n\nmust prove that a defendant's waste contributed more than background\n\ncontamination levels and is the type of waste being cleaned up at the\n\n\n                                - 72 -\n\fsite.   Their attempt to somehow raise the threshold for proving\n\ncausation, however, misconstrues the holding of Acushnet.\n\n          In Acushnet, a settling defendant brought a contribution\n\naction against a non-settler. The non-settler admitted that it had\n\ndiscarded waste containing a substance called PAH at the site in\n\nquestion, but moved for summary judgment on the ground that the\n\nquantity of PAH it disposed was far less than the background level and\n\ntiny in comparison to the amount of PAH dumped by other parties. The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment because the plaintiff failed to\n\ncreate a triable issue of fact about whether the defendant's disposal\n\nof PAH caused cleanup costs to be incurred. We affirmed \"on somewhat\n\ndifferent grounds,\" saying that \"[t]o the extent that the court's\n\nruling may be interpreted to incorporate into CERCLA a causation\n\nstandard that would require a polluter's waste to meet a minimum\n\nquantitative threshold, we disagree.\"       Id. at 72.    We explained:\n\n          To read a quantitative threshold into the\n          language 'causes the incurrence of response\n          costs' would cast the plaintiff in the impossible\n          role of tracing chemical waste to particular\n          sources in particular amounts, a task that is\n          often technologically infeasible due to the\n          fluctuating quantity and varied nature of the\n          pollution at a site over the course of many\n          years.     Moreover, it would be extremely\n          difficult, if not impossible, to articulate a\n          workable numerical threshold in defining\n          causation. . . . Our own decisions provide no\n          basis for such an approach. . . . [W]e have never\n          discussed CERCLA causation in quantitative terms.\n\nId. at 76-77.\n\n                                - 73 -\n\f          To be sure, CERCLA allows a defendant to assert a defense\n\nthat the liability attributable to it is divisible from that borne by\n\nother parties.    See id. at 77 (\"[W]here environmental harms are\n\ndivisible, a defendant may be held responsible only for his\n\nproportional share of the response costs\").        However, once the\n\nplaintiff has established that a defendant disposed of hazardous waste,\n\nAcushnet put the burden of proof on the defendant to show that this\n\nwaste did not contribute to cleanup costs. See id. Other courts faced\n\nwith the commingling of chemicals that inevitably occurs at many\n\nhazardous waste sites have followed a similar approach. See Tosco\n\nCorp. v. Koch Indus., Inc., 216 F.3d 886, 891 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"The\n\nplaintiff in a CERCLA response cost recovery action involving multiple\n\npotentially responsible persons need not prove a specific causal link\n\nbetween costs incurred and an individual responsible person's waste.\");\n\nControl Data Corp. v. S.C.S.C. Corp., 53 F.3d 930, 936 (8th Cir. 1995)\n\n(\"[A] plain reading of [CERCLA] leads us to the conclusion that once a\n\nparty is liable, it is liable for its share, as determined by Section\n\n9613(f), of 'any' and all response costs, not just those costs 'caused'\n\nby its release.\"); United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., 964 F.2d 252,\n\n264-66 (3d Cir. 1992); Amoco Oil Co. v. Borden, Inc., 889 F.2d 664, 670\n\nn.8 (5th Cir. 1989) (\"[I]n cases involving multiple sources of\n\ncontamination, a plaintiff need not prove a specific causal link\n\nbetween costs incurred and an individual generator's waste.\").\n\n\n                                - 74 -\n\f          Neither Acco nor Ashland have any evidence to show that the\n\nmany hazardous substances contained in their waste \"constitute[] no\n\nmore than background amounts of such substances in the environment and\n\ncannot concentrate with other wastes to produce higher amounts.\"\n\nAcushnet, 191 F.3d at 77. Gar also has no evidence to show that the\n\ncopper, cadmium, and cyanide it generated are present below background\n\nlevels.\n\n          Acushnet also disposes of Gar's additional arguments that its\n\nwaste has not contributed to UTC's cleanup costs. Gar's contention\n\nthat its five drums of waste were insufficient to contribute more than\n\nbackground levels of waste presupposes a minimum quantitative threshold\n\nfor liability, which Acushnet rejected. See id. at 77.39 Gar also\n\nargues that it should not have to pay for a cleanup directed at VOCs\n\nwhen its waste contained only metals. The record shows that while the\n\nEPA plan for the Davis site, which drives UTC's cleanup efforts,\n\nfocuses primarily on VOCs, it also aims to mitigate the other\n\npollutants present at the site. According to testimony at trial, UTC\n\nwill have to take additional steps to reduce metal contaminants if\n\nthose contaminants are still present in the soil at greater than\n\n\n     39 The district court took Gar's relatively minor waste\ncontribution into account by allocating to the company only .03 percent\nof UTC's cleanup costs. Gar itself calls this allocation \"minuscule.\"\nAt oral argument, it became apparent that the real concern of Gar and\nthe other appellants is that the government will use the judgment\nagainst them here in a future § 9607 action for the costs of the\ngroundwater and well remedies which have not yet been recovered.\n\n                                - 75 -\n\fbackground levels after VOC levels have abated. Gar thus has failed to\n\nshow that the harm caused by its waste is divisible from the harm\n\ntreated in UTC's soil remediation.\n\n          5. The Entry of a Declaratory Judgment under § 9613(g)(2) and\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act\n\n          The appellants argue that the district court's entry of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment was improper because: (1) CERCLA does not provide\n\nfor declaratory relief in a contribution action for future cleanup\n\ncosts; and (2) the Declaratory Judgment Act does not provide for\n\ndeclaratory relief in this case because no case or controversy existed\n\nbetween the parties. To support the latter claim, the appellants argue\n\nthat UTC failed to prove that it was likely to incur more than its fair\n\nshare of future cleanup costs and that UTC's settlement with the\n\ngovernment did not extinguish the appellants' liability.40 We discuss\n\neach argument in turn.\n\n          The appellants argue that CERCLA's declaratory relief\n\nprovision, § 9613(g)(2), does not permit UTC to receive declaratory\n\n\n\n     40The appellants also argue that UTC failed to request declaratory\nrelief. This argument is easily disposed of. As the district court\npointed out, UTC need not have used the magic word \"declaratory\njudgment\" in its pleading to put the defendants on notice that its\nclaims could be resolved with a grant of declaratory relief. See Davis\nIV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 60. UTC's complaint asked the court to enter a\njudgment to \"determine . . . the equitable contribution share of\nliability . . . properly allocated to each [party.]\" The court's case\nmanagement order before trial used similar language. This language\ngave the defendants sufficient notice that declaratory relief might be\ngranted.\n\n                                - 76 -\n\frelief for cleanup costs that it incurred after the close of discovery\n\nand continues to incur as it completes the soil remediation. They\n\ncorrectly point out that the amount that UTC will ultimately pay for\n\nsoil remediation is unknown. While the EPA projected a cost of $14\n\nmillion for soil remediation, this estimate is several years old.\n\nRather than allowing into evidence more recent figures on the amount of\n\nongoing and future cleanup costs, the court relied on the EPA estimates\n\nfor purposes of the Phase III adjudication, saying that the defendants\n\ncould challenge specific expenditures in post-trial proceedings.41\n\n          The district court dismissed UTC's claims for past cleanup\n\ncosts on the ground that the company had not paid for any cleanup\n\nbefore the close of discovery.42 See Davis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 330.\n\nThe court expressed doubts about whether UTC was entitled to\n\ndeclaratory relief for future costs given the ongoing nature of the\n\npayments and their unknown total amount, but ultimately concluded that\n\n\"the evidence presented is sufficient to enable the Court to make a\n\nmeaningful allocation based upon the facts presently available.\" Davis\n\n\n     41The district court \"retain[ed] jurisdiction for the purpose of\nrevising this allocation if and when additional facts are discovered\nthat were not reasonably available to the parties at the time of trial\nand that clearly demonstrate a change in circumstances so significant\nthat the allocation would be rendered manifestly inequitable.\" Davis\nIV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 69.\n     42 UTC's indemnification claims were dismissed \"for the same\nreason\" and because the district court determined that UTC \"was not\nentitled to indemnification under Rhode Island law.\" Davis IV, 20 F.\nSupp. 2d at 330.\n\n                                - 77 -\n\fIV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 59. The court thus granted declaratory relief\n\npursuant to CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(g)(2), and the Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201.\n\n          To determine whether the court's grant of declaratory relief\n\nwas proper under § 9613(g)(2), we begin with the plain language of the\n\nstatute. See United States v. Rivera, 131 F.3d 222, 224 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).   Section 9613(g)(2) provides that \"[i]n any such action\n\ndescribed in this subsection, the court shall enter a declaratory\n\njudgment on liability for response costs or damages that will be\n\nbinding on any subsequent action or actions to recover further response\n\ncosts or damages.\"   42 U.S.C. § 9613(g)(2).     The statute does not\n\nexplicitly provide for declaratory relief for a contribution action for\n\nfuture or past response costs.      However, nothing in the statute\n\nprecludes an interpretation that declaratory relief is available in\n\nboth instances. See Boeing Co. v. Cascade Corp., 207 F.3d 1177, 1191\n\n(9th Cir. 2000). The statute suggests this interpretation by adopting\n\na flexible time line, providing that \"[a] person may seek contribution\n\n. . . during or following any civil action under . . . section 9607(a)\n\nof this title.\"    42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(1) (emphasis added).       This\n\nlanguage anticipates that a defendant in a § 9607 cost recovery action\n\nmay initiate a contribution action before its own liability is\n\nestablished. Consistent with this scheme, a § 9607 defendant whose\n\nliability has been established may be awarded declaratory relief before\n\n\n                                - 78 -\n\fthat liability has been fully discharged.\n\n          The district court acknowledged that a few courts have held\n\nthat § 9613(g)(2) applies to actions brought under § 9607, the vehicle\n\nfor an innocent party to recover cleanup costs, and not to actions\n\nbrought under § 9613(f), the vehicle for a non-innocent party to seek\n\ncontribution from other polluters. See Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 590\n\n(citing Reichhold Chems., Inc. v. Textron, Inc., 888 F. Supp. 1116,\n\n1123-24 (N.D. Fla. 1995) and Sun Co. v. Browning-Ferris, Inc., 919 F.\n\nSupp. 1523, 1532 (N.D. Okla. 1996), overruled in part by 124 F.3d 1187\n\n(10th Cir. 1997)). However, the Ninth and Tenth Circuits have taken\n\nthe position, as we do here, that § 9613(g)(2), the declaratory\n\njudgment provision of CERCLA, applies to § 9613(f) contribution actions\n\nfor both past and future response costs. In Boeing Co. v. Cascade\n\nCorp., the Ninth Circuit said:\n\n          CERCLA was intended to encourage quick response\n          and to place the costs on those responsible.\n          Declaratory relief serves these purposes because\n          parties, like those in this case, will know their\n          share of costs before they are incurred . . . .\n          The costs and time involved in relitigating\n          issues as complex as these where new costs are\n          incurred would be massive and wasteful.\n          Declaratory relief allocating future costs is\n          therefore consistent with the broader purposes of\n          CERCLA.\n\n207 F.3d at 1191; see also Tosco Corp., 216 F.3d at 897 (\"[W]here, as\n\nhere, a responsible party chooses to go to trial and future response\n\ncosts are likely to be incurred, but the exact amount remains unknown,\n\n\n                                - 79 -\n\fa judgment on proportional liability is an appropriate remedy.\").43 We\n\nagree with these rationales. As the district court said, in this case\n\n\"allocation helps to alleviate the hardship that would be visited upon\n\nthe [PRP] seeking contribution if that PRP was, in effect, required to\n\nfinance the entire cleanup operation before getting a determination\n\nregarding the shares attributable to the other PRP's.\" Davis IV, 31 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 58.\n\n          Since we find that § 9613(g)(2) applies to § 9613(f)\n\ncontribution actions for both past and future response costs, we need\n\nnot address in detail the appellants' arguments that the district\n\ncourt's entry of a declaratory judgment was improper under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act because there was no case or controversy\n\npermitting the court to act. We address the arguments only because\n\nthey apply, at least by implication, to the availability of declaratory\n\nrelief under § 9613(g)(2).\n\n          First, the appellants say that there was no controversy\n\nbetween the parties, as the Act requires, because UTC did not prove\n\nthat it would pay more than its fair share of cleanup costs. They\n\nargue that UTC cannot prove that it is likely to pay more than its fair\n\n\n     43Other courts have also reasoned that declaratory relief furthers\nCERCLA's goals in finding that the entry of such relief is mandatory in\n§ 9607 cost recovery actions. See Dent v. Beazer Materials & Servs.,\nInc., 156 F.3d 523, 532 (4th Cir. 1998); Kelley v. E.I. DuPont De\nNemours & Co., 17 F.3d 836, 844 (6th Cir. 1994) (\"The fact that future\ncosts are somewhat speculative is no bar to a present declaration of\nliability.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                - 80 -\n\fshare of cleanup costs because it began incurring those costs only\n\nshortly before trial and offered no evidence about the amount of those\n\ncosts.\n\n           The Declaratory Judgment Act provides: \"In a case of actual\n\ncontroversy within its jurisdiction . . . any court of the United\n\nStates, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the\n\nrights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such\n\ndeclaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\" 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2201.    Here, the district court observed:\n\n          the premise underlying UTC's request for a\n          judgment 'determining . . . the equitable\n          contribution share of liability for the site\n          properly allocated to each [party]' is that, at\n          some time in the future, it is likely that UTC\n          will be required to pay more than its fair share\n          of the alleged common liability; and, therefore,\n          that it will be entitled to contribution from the\n          defendants.\n\nDavis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 58 (alterations in original). For the\n\nprinciple that a PRP seeking contribution must prove that it has paid\n\nmore than its fair share, the court relied on United Tech. Corp. v.\n\nBrowning-Ferris Indus., Inc., 33 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding\n\nthat CERCLA allows a non-innocent party bringing a § 9613(f) action\n\n\"only to seek recoupment of that portion of his expenditures which\n\nexceeds his pro rata share of the overall liability--in other words, to\n\nseek contribution rather than complete indemnity\"). The district court\n\nset UTC's share as 1.54 percent of the total waste at the Davis site\n\n\n                                - 81 -\n\fbased on the volume of its waste established by the evidence. See\n\nDavis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 67. The court translated this 1.54 percent\n\nliability share into $754,600, using an estimate of $55 million for\n\ntotal cleanup and enforcement costs. See id. at 69. Reasoning that\n\nUTC was bound by the proposed consent decrees to pay at least $10.35\n\nmillion, the court found that UTC had necessarily incurred more than\n\nits fair share of cleanup costs.44       See id.\n\n          The appellants' argument to the contrary fails for the same\n\nreasons that led us to reject the argument that the district court had\n\nno authority to enter a consent decree. UTC's agreement in Consent\n\nDecree I to make a cash payment and perform the soil remediation\n\ncreated a fixed obligation subject only to the court's approval. UTC\n\ndid not have to actually make the payments to which it agreed to show\n\nthat it was liable for more than its fair share of the total costs of\n\ncleanup. The ongoing nature of the work and the fact that its ultimate\n\ncost was not known at trial did not affect the district court's ability\n\nto consider the evidence that other PRPs contributed to the waste in\n\nthe soil, and to determine whether some of UTC's costs should thus be\n\nallocated to them.\n\n          The appellants also argue that there is no case or\n\n\n     44The court reached this figure by deducting the amounts that UTC\ncan recoup from other PRPs pursuant to the other partial consent\ndecrees from the $16.8 million it agreed to pay pursuant to Consent\nDecree I. We note without resolving the issue that the government sets\nUTC's minimum payment at $9.3 million.\n\n                                - 82 -\n\fcontroversy between the parties because UTC has not extinguished their\n\nentire liability. As we have discussed, the partial consent decrees do\n\nnot cover an estimated $21.7 million of the government's projected\n\nresponse costs. Because the government can still seek to recover those\n\ncosts from them, the appellants argue that \"[p]ermitting UTC to recover\n\nfrom the defendants under these circumstances would expose the\n\ndefendants to the CERCLA equivalent of 'double jeopardy.'\" In support\n\nof their position, the appellants cite United Techs. Corp., which\n\ndefined the term \"contribution\" as \"a claim by and between jointly and\n\nseverally liable parties for an appropriate division of the payment one\n\nof them has been compelled to make.\" 33 F.3d at 99 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n          The appellants' argument that UTC is not entitled to\n\ncontribution because it has not extinguished the appellants' entire\n\nliability fails in light of the plain language of § 9613(f):\n\n          A person who has resolved its liability to the\n          United States or a State in an administrative or\n          judicially approved settlement shall not be\n          liable for claims for contribution regarding\n          matters addressed in the settlement. . . .\n          A person who has resolved its liability to the\n          United States or a State for some or all of a\n          response action or for some or all of the costs\n          of such action in an administrative or judicially\n          approved settlement may seek contribution from\n          any person who is not party to a settlement\n          referred to [above].\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(2) & (3)(B) (emphasis added). CERCLA clearly\n\nanticipated that some settlements, like the one in this case, would\n\n                                - 83 -\n\fcover only a portion of the total cleanup costs for a hazardous waste\n\nsite. The statute does not impose a requirement that a contribution\n\naction plaintiff must settle the entire cost of cleaning up a site\n\nbefore it can seek contribution.\n\n          The   appellants'    complaint   that   they   may   bear   a\n\ndisproportionate share of the total liability if the government chooses\n\nto bring further proceedings against them is part of the risk they\n\nassumed in choosing not to settle.       As we have said before:\n\n          CERCLA seeks to provide EPA with the necessary\n          tools to achieve prompt cleanups. One such tool\n          is the ability to foster incentives for timely\n          settlements. To this end, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(2)\n          provides that a party who settles with the\n          government 'shall not be liable for claims for\n          contribution regarding matters addressed in the\n          settlement.' Because only the amount of the\n          settlement, not the pro rata share attributable\n          to the settling party, is subtracted from the\n          aggregate liability of the nonsettling parties,\n          section 9613(f)(2) envisions that nonsettling\n          parties may bear disproportionate liability.\n          This paradigm is not a scrivener's accident. It\n          was designed to encourage settlements and provide\n          PRPs a measure of finality in return for their\n          willingness to settle.\n\nUnited Techs. Corp., 33 F.3d at 102-03 (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1086\n\n(\"non-settling defendants . . . are potentially liable for the full\n\ndifference between the costs of cleanup and the total amount paid by\n\nthe settling PRPs\"). While our precedents on CERCLA consent decrees\n\nare attentive to the fairness of the settlements for settling versus\n\n\n                                - 84 -\n\fnon-settling PRPs, they do not go so far as to protect PRPs who choose\n\nnot to settle from the consequences of non-settlement imposed by CERCLA\n\nitself. See Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1088. In sum, the district\n\ncourt's entry of a declaratory judgment was proper.\n\n          6. Morton's Liability\n\n          The district court found Morton International liable for\n\nhazardous waste dumped by Thiokol Corporation Chemical Division\n\n(Thiokol) at the Davis site. For purposes of this case, Morton has\n\nstipulated that it is a successor to Thiokol's liabilities.\n\n                  a. Claims of Clearly Erroneous Factual Findings\n\n          Morton's liability, unlike that of other parties whose waste\n\nwas hauled by CWR, depends on the court's findings about the waste\n\npractices of CCC. Thiokol was one of the approximately 130 companies\n\nfrom whom CCC collected waste during 1976 and 1977. Reasoning that\n\nsince CCC made 47 deliveries to Davis, and since \"there is no reason to\n\nbelieve that CCC handled Thiokol's waste any differently than the waste\n\nof its other 130 customers,\" the district court found that Thiokol's\n\nwaste went to the Davis site, and thus found Morton liable as an\n\narranger. Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 55. However, because there was\n\nno evidence regarding the volume of Thiokol's waste transported by CCC,\n\nor the volume of waste from other customers that CCC transported to the\n\nDavis site, the court concluded that it was unable to allocate to\n\n\n\n\n                                - 85 -\n\fMorton a share of the cleanup costs.45      See id.\n\n            We begin with the evidence about CCC's practices. CCC was\n\nlocated in Elizabeth, New Jersey and was owned and operated by William\n\nCarracino. Carracino testified that CCC began sending waste to Rhode\n\nIsland in 1977, initially to Sanitary Landfill. Beginning in May, the\n\nCapuanos began diverting the CCC waste to the Davis site, and the CCC\n\ndrivers proceeded straight there without stopping first at Sanitary\n\nLandfill.    CCC continued to bring waste to the Davis site until\n\nSeptember, when Davis refused to accept the waste and seized CCC's\n\ntruck because CCC was overdue in its payments. Based on the 47 trips\n\nCCC made to the Davis site between May and the first week of July, and\n\nthe volume of waste transported during those weeks, the district court\n\nestimated that CCC delivered a total of 441,450 gallons of waste to the\n\nDavis site. Testimony by Carracino and CCC driver John Mayo about\n\nthese trips to Rhode Island was corroborated by toll receipts and petty\n\ncash vouchers.\n\n            CCC began collecting Thiokol's waste in 1971. This waste,\n\ngenerated by three separate plants in New Jersey, averaged\n\napproximately 22,000 gallons per year.        Much of the waste was\n\nidentified on shipment forms prepared by Thiokol simply as\n\n\n\n     45As became clear at oral argument, Morton still appeals because\nof its concern that the government will use the judgment of liability\nin this case to pursue a § 9607 action for the cost of the groundwater\nand well remediation that remains unallocated.\n\n                                - 86 -\n\f\"miscellaneous chemical waste.\" Testimony by a former Thiokol employee\n\nindicated that Thiokol did not separate its waste. In particular,\n\nThiokol did not separate its chlorinated waste until 1979. The waste\n\nwas disposed of primarily in 55-gallon drums, but Thiokol used drums of\n\nsmaller sizes, as well as 5-gallon pails.        The waste contained\n\nflammable liquids and spent solvents, including methylene chloride,\n\nmethyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and 1,1,1-TCA, all of which were found at\n\nthe Davis site.    Other waste picked up on a more occasional basis\n\nincluded urethane, filter cakes used in producing plasticizers, and\n\nlubricating oil.\n\n          CCC handled waste it collected in a variety of ways. It sold\n\nsome liquid waste to salvagers, burned some of the flammable liquids in\n\nan incinerator on the Elizabeth site, transported waste to various dump\n\nsites, and stored some waste on the premises for future disposal.\n\nCarracino testified that solid waste, polymers, and sludges were sent\n\nstraight from CCC to disposal sites because of their tendency to clog\n\nthe incinerator.      CCC employee John Prahm, who operated the\n\nincinerator, corroborated that testimony. Waste shipment forms confirm\n\nthat CCC picked up polymers from Thiokol.\n\n          Evidence at trial indicated that CCC's incinerator did not\n\neffectively destroy many chemicals -- particularly chlorinated waste --\n\nbecause it did not operate at a sufficiently high temperature. An\n\nexpert witness testified that the incinerator produced a sludge or\n\n\n                                - 87 -\n\fresidue, which was itself a hazardous waste, because of this\n\ninefficient operation. Prahm testified that this residue from the\n\nincinerator was placed in drums for disposal. Evidence regarding\n\nThiokol's disposal practices supports an inference that some of its\n\nflammable waste likely went to the Davis site as residue from the\n\nincinerator. More specifically, Thiokol did not separate chlorinated\n\nwaste from unchlorinated waste, and chlorinated waste was not\n\neffectively destroyed in the incinerator because it required a higher\n\ntemperature. Thus, we cannot conclude that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that at least some of Thiokol's waste \"consisted of flammable\n\nsolvents that probably were incinerated,\" Davis IV, F. Supp. 2d at 55,\n\nand that because there is no basis for finding that Thiokol's waste was\n\ntreated differently from other waste at CCC, the hazardous residue\n\nproduced by the incineration of such waste was likely placed in drums\n\nand transported to the Davis site.\n\n          Thiokol's disposal of waste in 5-gallon pails further\n\nsupports the district court's finding of liability. UTC offered the\n\ndeposition testimony of a former Thiokol employee, Melvin Schulman,\n\nthat Thiokol disposed of some liquid waste in spring-top, 5-gallon\n\ncans. Waste shipment forms indicate that CCC picked up these cans for\n\ndisposal. A notation on at least one cancelled check drawn on CCC's\n\naccount reads \"5 gal. pails to RI, 6/8/77.\" Carracino confirmed in his\n\ndeposition testimony that the notation was in his writing and that the\n\n\n                                - 88 -\n\fcheck was payment for dumping waste. Davis also testified at trial\n\nthat he recalled receiving loads of waste in which 5-gallon pails,\n\ncontaining liquid waste, had been transported to his site on top of 55-\n\ngallon drums. Davis specifically recalled that these shipments came\n\nfrom New Jersey. While the testimony regarding these 5-gallon pails\n\ndoes not establish conclusively that Morton's waste was dumped at the\n\nDavis site, the district court was not clearly erroneous in crediting\n\nthis testimony and considering it part of the evidence tending to\n\nestablish that it was more probable than not that Morton's hazardous\n\nwaste was shipped by CCC to the site.\n\n          Morton argues that \"the mere presence of 1,1,1-TCA in\n\nMorton's waste and its presence at the Davis site does not, without\n\nmore, establish that Morton's waste was located at the Davis site.\"\n\nHowever, the district court did not base its finding that Morton was\n\nliable solely on the presence of that chemical at the site. Rather,\n\nthe district court inferred from other evidence that Thiokol's waste\n\nwas taken to the Davis site and noted that such an inference \"finds\n\nsome support\" in the fact that the chemical was found at the site.\n\nDavis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 55.\n\n                  b. Claims of Legal Error\n\n          Morton argues that the district court improperly shifted the\n\nburden of proof to Morton, requiring it to show that it had not dumped\n\nwaste at the Davis site, rather than requiring UTC to prove each\n\n\n                                - 89 -\n\felement of its claim for contribution.       Morton cites New Jersey\n\nTurnpike Auth. v. PPG Indus., Inc., 197 F.3d 96, 105 (3d Cir. 1999) for\n\nthe proposition that UTC \"must offer some proof that [the defendants]\n\ndeposited, or caused the disposal of, [the waste] at each of the sites\n\nat issue in this case.\" Morton seems to construe this requirement of\n\n\"some proof\" as a requirement for direct, not circumstantial proof.\n\nHowever, for reasons explained above, UTC introduced adequate\n\ncircumstantial evidence that Thiokol deposited waste at the Davis site.\n\nThat circumstantial evidence distinguishes this case from New Jersey\n\nTurnpike Authority, where the plaintiff introduced no evidence\n\nregarding the transporters the defendants may have used and relied only\n\non \"the conceded large scale production of [the waste] by the\n\nappellees, the need for its local disposal, the proximity of the\n\nappellees' production facilities to the sites at issue, and the use of\n\nthis material as fill over the years.\"        Id. at 109.   Here, UTC\n\nintroduced evidence of Thiokol's production of hazardous waste, CCC's\n\nrecords regarding pickups of waste and deliveries to the Davis site,\n\nand CCC's practices in handling different kinds of waste. We do not\n\nagree with Morton that the district court engaged in an improper\n\nburden-shifting analysis in finding, based on this evidence, that some\n\nof Thiokol's waste was dumped at the Davis site.\n\n          Finally, Morton argues that it was impermissible for the\n\ndistrict court to find it liable as an arranger because the court\n\n\n                                - 90 -\n\fdeclined to allocate to Morton a specific share of responsibility.\n\nHowever, Acushnet, 191 F.3d 69, precludes this argument. Acushnet\n\nemphasizes the broad discretion of a district court in allocating\n\nresponsibility: \"A court, in evaluating contribution claims under §\n\n9613(f), is 'free to allocate responsibility according to any\n\ncombination of equitable factors it deems appropriate.'\" Id. at 78\n\n(quoting O'Neil v. Picillo, 883 F.2d at 183). The district court here\n\nfound that \"the fairest, and most practical, measure of relative\n\nresponsibility is the quantity or volume of hazardous waste\n\nattributable to each party.\" Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 64. Because\n\nthere was no way to calculate the volume of waste Thiokol dumped at the\n\nDavis site, the court declined to allocate a share of responsibility to\n\nMorton. This determination was well within the district court's broad\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          Morton argues that the district court's decision not to\n\nallocate a share of responsibility to Morton should have compelled a\n\nfinding that Morton was not liable because Thiokol's waste could not be\n\nlocated and identified at the Davis site.46 However, as we have noted,\n\nwe said in Acushnet that there is no minimum quantity threshold for\n\nimposing liability on polluters, 191 F.3d at 76, adding that \"[i]n an\n\n\n     46Morton also claims that the district court erred in finding\nliability without applying a standard of \"locating and identifying\" its\nwaste at the Davis site. We have already rejected an interpretation of\n§ 9613(f) that would require an arranger's waste to be specifically\nlocated at the Davis site with direct evidence.\n\n                                - 91 -\n\fappropriate set of circumstances, a tortfeasor's fair share of the\n\nresponse costs may even be zero, id. at 78. The district court's\n\ndecision not to allocate responsibility to Morton is consistent with\n\nAcushnet, and Morton has not even attempted to explain why the\n\nprinciples of that opinion should not apply here.\n\n          7. Successor-in-Interest Liability for Gar\n\n          Black & Decker (\"B & D\") argues that the district court erred\n\nin finding that it, rather than Electroformers, Inc., is Gar's\n\ncorporate successor-in-interest and thus liable for Gar's disposal of\n\nwaste at the Davis site. Gar's corporate history is as follows. In\n\n1977, MITE Corporation owned Gar Electroforming Division, the\n\nmanufacturing facility in Danbury, Connecticut that generated the\n\nhazardous waste disposed of at the Davis site. In November 1978, MITE\n\nagreed to sell Gar's assets to Electroformers, Inc., which had\n\nincorporated a month earlier. The Asset Purchase Agreement signed by\n\nthe parties in January 1979 provided that Electroformers would buy\n\ncertain accounts receivable, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment,\n\ntrademarks and trade names, business records, inventory and customer\n\nlists. Electroformers used the name \"Gar Electroformers Division\" for\n\na time after the sale, subleased the Danbury facility from MITE, and\n\ncontinued to make the same product with the same manufacturing process\n\nand to use the same employee pension plan. MITE agreed not to compete\n\nwith Electroformers in its area of business for ten years. The Asset\n\n\n                                - 92 -\n\fPurchase Agreement provided that the \"[b]uyer will not assume any of\n\nthe liabilities of the Gar Electroforming Division existing on the date\n\nof the closing and MITE agrees to defend any claims relating thereto\n\npresented against Buyer and to save Buyer harmless from any such\n\nclaims.\" MITE also represented that, to its knowledge, it was not in\n\nviolation of any environmental or pollution-related law or ordinance.\n\nIn 1985, the Emhart Corporation bought MITE. In 1989, B & D acquired\n\nEmhart, which continues to exist as B & D's wholly owned subsidiary.\n\n            UTC sued both B & D and Electroformers for contribution as\n\nGar's successor-in-interest. Both defendants filed motions for summary\n\njudgment.    The district court referred to a magistrate judge the\n\nquestion of which entity, B & D or Electroformers, should be liable as\n\nGar's successor. The magistrate judge discussed the choice between the\n\nstate law and federal common law tests for determining corporate\n\nsuccessor liability, and found that B & D was liable under either\n\nanalysis because Electroformers bought Gar's assets from MITE through\n\na true assets purchase agreement. The district court adopted this\n\nrecommendation.\n\n            On appeal, B & D argues that the federal common law\n\n\"substantial continuation\" test should determine corporate successor\n\nliability under CERCLA, and that Electroformers should be found liable\n\nusing this test. Electroformers and UTC47 argue that Connecticut's\n\n\n     47   UTC took the opposite position before the district court.\n\n                                - 93 -\n\f\"mere continuation\" test should apply,48 and that Electroformers should\n\nnot be found liable using either the \"substantial continuation\" or the\n\n\"mere continuation\" tests. We begin with the choice of law question,\n\nwhich we review de novo. See Kukias v. Chandris Lines, Inc., 839 F.3d\n\n860, 861 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          The \"mere continuation\" test is an exception to the common\n\nlaw rule that the buyer of a corporation's assets (as opposed to its\n\nstock) does not incur liability for the divesting corporation's debts.\n\nSee Ed Peters Jewelry Co. v. C & J Jewelry Co., 124 F.3d 252, 266 (1st\n\nCir. 1997). The test is designed to protect creditors from sales that\n\nseek to evade valid claims.     See id.   Successor liability is an\n\nequitable doctrine, and courts traditionally consider five factors: (1)\n\nthe divesting corporation's transfer of assets; (2) payment by the\n\nbuyer of less than fair market value for the assets; (3) continuation\n\nby the buyer of the divesting corporation's business; (4) a common\n\nofficer of the buyer and divesting corporations who was instrumental in\n\nthe transfer; and (5) inability of the divesting corporation to pay its\n\ndebts after the assets transfer.      See id. at 268.\n\n          The federal \"substantial continuation\" test, which has been\n\nadopted in past cases by a few circuits, see B.F. Goodrich v. Betkoski,\n\n99 F.3d 505, 519 (2d Cir. 1996); United States v. Carolina Transformer\n\n\n     48The Asset Purchase Agreement calls for application of\nConnecticut law, and the parties do not argue that another state's law\nshould apply.\n\n                                - 94 -\n\fCo., 978 F.2d 832, 837 (4th Cir. 1992), requires courts to consider\n\neight factors: \"(1) retention of the same employees [by the buyer]; (2)\n\nretention of the same supervisory personnel; (3) retention of the same\n\nproduction facilities in the same location; (4) production of the same\n\nproduct; (5) retention of the same name; (6) continuity of assets; (7)\n\ncontinuity of general business operations; and (8) whether the buyer\n\nholds itself out as a continuation of the\" divesting corporation,\n\nCarolina Transformer Co., 978 F.2d at 838. In general, before creating\n\na federal rule courts must consider whether federal interests require\n\na nationally uniform body of law, whether applying state law would\n\nfrustrate or conflict with a specific federal objective, and the extent\n\nto which a federal rule would disrupt commercial relationships\n\npredicated on state law. See United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440\n\nU.S. 715, 728-29 (1979). In adopting the \"substantial continuation\"\n\ntest, courts have cited CERCLA's \"broad remedial purpose\" and the\n\n\"importance of national uniformity.\" See B.F. Goodrich, 99 F.3d at\n\n519; Carolina Transformer Co., 978 F.2d at 837.\n\n          Other courts, however, have rejected the need for a federal\n\ntest. See, e.g., Redwing Carriers, Inc. v. Saraland Apartments, 94\n\nF.3d 1489, 1501-02 (11th Cir. 1996); City Mgmt. Corp. v. U.S. Chem.\n\nCo., Inc., 43 F.3d 244, 253 n.12 (6th Cir. 1994). These cases heed the\n\nSupreme Court's warnings that courts should presume that matters left\n\nunaddressed are subject to state law when a \"comprehensive and\n\n\n                                - 95 -\n\fdetailed\" federal statutory regime is at issue, and that cases in which\n\nthe creation of a \"special federal rule would be justified\" generally\n\nare \"few and restricted.\" See O'Melveny & Meyers v. Fed. Deposit Ins.\n\nCorp., 512 U.S. 79, 85 & 87 (1994).\n\n          We have concluded that the majority rule is to apply state\n\nlaw \"so long as it is not hostile to the federal interests animating\n\nCERCLA,\" and have applied Massachusetts contracts law to determine an\n\nissue of successor liability. John S. Boyd Co., Inc. v. Boston Gas\n\nCo., 992 F.2d 401, 406 (1st Cir. 1993). Recent Supreme Court precedent\n\nconfirms that Boyd's approach is correct. The Court applied state\n\ncorporation law in a recent CERCLA case involving the potential\n\nliability of a parent corporation for its subsidiary and left little\n\nroom for the creation of a federal rule of liability under the statute.\n\nSee United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 63 (1998) (\"CERCLA is . .\n\n. like many another congressional enactment in giving no indication\n\nthat the entire corpus of state corporation law is to be replaced\n\nsimply because a plaintiff's cause of action is based upon a federal\n\nstatute.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court's statements\n\nin Bestfoods and O'Melveny demonstrate that to justify the creation of\n\na federal rule, \"there must be a specific, concrete federal policy or\n\ninterest that is compromised by the application of state law.\"\n\nAtkison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Brown & Bryant, Inc., 159\n\nF.3d 358, 363-64 (9th Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                - 96 -\n\fWe see no evidence that application of state law to the facts of this\n\ncase would frustrate any federal objective.       Connecticut's \"mere\n\ncontinuation\" test thus is the correct test for determining successor\n\nliability for the hazardous waste disposed by Gar.\n\n          In applying the \"mere continuation\" test, the magistrate\n\njudge recommended successor liability for B & D rather than\n\nElectroformers   based   on   the   following   facts:   (1)   MITE   and\n\nElectroformers did not share a common officer or director who was\n\ninvolved in the transfer; (2) MITE received fair compensation for Gar;\n\n(3) MITE continued to operate its other businesses; (4) MITE remained\n\nfinancially viable.49 B & D did not challenge these factual findings,\n\nbut objects to the magistrate's conclusion that Electroformers\n\npurchased Gar's assets through a true asset purchase agreement on the\n\ngrounds that Electroformers shared certain commonalities with Gar and\n\nessentially continued its business. In support of this position, B &\n\nD notes that Electroformers made the same product that Gar made when\n\nMITE owned it, employed the same supervisory employees, used the same\n\nproduction facility and the same customer base, and initially operated\n\nunder Gar's name.\n\n          The facts emphasized by B & D do not outweigh those cited by\n\nthe magistrate judge to support the finding that Electroformers merely\n\n\n     49The magistrate judge also found B & D liable under the federal\nlaw \"substantial continuation\" test. Because we apply the state law\ntest, we do not reach this issue.\n\n                                - 97 -\n\fbought Gar's assets from MITE. MITE's receipt of fair compensation for\n\nthe Gar division and the lack of common officers and directors between\n\nthe two entities indicate that its sale of Gar's assets to\n\nElectroformers was an arms-length deal. Moreover, MITE continued as a\n\nfinancially viable business following the sale, leaving little reason\n\nto except it from the rule that successor liability does not transfer\n\nwhen one company buys another's assets. See Ricciardello v. J.W. Gant\n\n& Co., 717 F. Supp. 56, 59 (D. Conn. 1989) (\"A sale of assets by one\n\ncorporation to another, in good faith and for valuable consideration,\n\ndoes not impose any liability on the buyer for the debts of another.\")\n\n(citing Davis v. Hemming, 127 A. 514, 518 (Conn. 1925)). The district\n\ncourt did not err in adopting the magistrate judge's recommendation\n\nimposing successor liability on B & D rather than Electroformers.50\n\n          8. UTC's Appeal\n\n                  a. The Judgment in Favor of Macera\n\n          After UTC rested its case, the district court rendered a\n\nbench decision granting judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 52(c) in favor of BFI and Macera. Macera Brothers Container\n\n\n\n\n     50B & D also argues that the magistrate judge's recommendation of\nsuccessor liability for B & D rather than for Electrofomers conflicts\nwith the magistrate judge's recommendation of successor liability for\nBFI, the purchaser of Macera. Since the district court did not adopt\nthe magistrate judge's recommendation of liability for BFI, any\ndisparity between the two recommendations, if there is one, lacks legal\nsignificance.\n\n                                - 98 -\n\fService, Inc.51 hauled waste to various facilities for disposal.\n\nMichael Macera and Robert Cece were two principals in the corporation.\n\nBFI Waste Systems of North America, Inc. is in this action only as\n\nsuccessor to Macera.52\n\n          The court explained its reasons for the judgment in a written\n\nmemorandum and order after the trial concluded. See Davis III, 20 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 329.53 UTC appeals this ruling on two grounds. First, UTC\n\nclaims that it proved Macera was liable as a transporter under CERCLA.\n\nSecond, UTC argues that it proved Macera was liable as an arranger of\n\nhazardous waste, and that its claim of liability on this theory was\n\ntimely asserted. Finally, BFI argues that if this Court finds that the\n\ndistrict court erred in granting the judgment in favor of BFI and\n\nMacera, BFI is still not liable because it is not Macera's corporate\n\nsuccessor. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's\n\njudgment on partial findings in favor of BFI and do not reach BFI's\n\n\n     51Macera Brothers Container Service, Inc. changed its name to\nMacera Disposal, Inc. in 1984. In 1987, Macera Disposal was merged\ninto M & C Enterprises, Inc. BFI purchased the assets of M & C\nEnterprises in July 1987.\n     52We will refer collectively to Macera Brothers Container Service,\nMichael Macera, Robert Cece, and BFI as \"Macera\" when discussing the\nclaims regarding transporter and arranger liability.\n     53We review for clear error the factual findings made as part of\nthe district court's judgment on partial findings. \"Findings of fact,\nwhether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside\nunless clearly erroneous.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (emphasis added).\nSee also Touch v. Master Unit Die Prods., Inc., 43 F.3d 754, 757 (1st\nCir. 1995).\n\n                                - 99 -\n\fclaim regarding successor liability.\n\n                  1. Transporter Liability\n\n          CERCLA imposes transporter liability on \"any person who\n\naccepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal\n\nor treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such\n\nperson\" from which there is a release of hazardous substances. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9607(a)(4) (emphasis added). Noting that the statute itself\n\ndoes not define the term \"selected,\" the district court in this case\n\nstated: \"a person 'selecting' a site is a person who chooses that site\n\nfrom a group of possible sites.\" Davis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 333.\n\nAdopting a standard of \"[a]ctive and substantial participation,\" the\n\ncourt ruled that \"determining whether, or to what extent, a transporter\n\nmade or actively participated in the site selection decision turns on\n\nthe nature of the dealings between the transporter and the generator.\"\n\nDavis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 333-34. The court found that UTC had\n\nfailed to present sufficient evidence regarding the negotiations\n\nbetween Macera and the generators for whom it hauled waste. Moreover,\n\nbecause there was evidence that some of the waste hauled by Macera came\n\nfrom UTC, the court found that UTC should have presented evidence\n\nregarding its own dealings with Macera in order to prove that Macera\n\nactively participated in the selection of the Davis site for UTC's\n\nwaste.   See Davis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 334.\n\n          The district court applied the correct legal standard in\n\n\n                               - 100 -\n\fdetermining whether Macera is a transporter under CERCLA. See Tippins\n\nInc. v. USX Corp., 37 F.3d 87, 94 (3d Cir. 1994).     In Tippins, the\n\ncourt stated:\n\n          [W]e believe that a person is liable as a\n          transporter not only if it ultimately selects the\n          disposal facility, but also when it actively\n          participates in the disposal decision to the\n          extent of having had substantial input into which\n          facility was ultimately chosen. . . The\n          substantiality of the input will be a function,\n          in part, of whether the decisionmaker relied upon\n          the transporter's special expertise in reaching\n          its final decision.\n\n37 F.3d at 94-95 (citation omitted). See also B.F. Goodrich, 99 F.3d\n\nat 520; United States v. USX Corp., 68 F.3d 811, 820 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\nIn contrast to a transporter who actively participated in the selection\n\nof a site, Tippins described circumstances where a transporter that\n\nmerely followed the orders of a generator would not be liable:\n\n          We emphasize that for liability to attach, a\n          transporter must be so involved in the selection\n          process that it has substantial input into the\n          disposal decision. A transporter clearly does\n          not select the disposal site merely by following\n          the directions of the party with which it\n          contracts. . . . In such cases, the transporter\n          is no more than a conduit of the waste and its\n          connection with the material is the most\n          attenuated among potentially responsible parties.\n          . . . Congress intended such transporters to\n          avoid liability.\n\n37 F.3d at 95 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). See\n\nalso Interstate Power Co. v. Kansas City Power & Light Co., 909 F.\n\nSupp. 1284, 1289 (N.D. Iowa 1994) (granting summary judgment to party\n\n\n                               - 101 -\n\falleged to be a transporter where evidence showed the party had no\n\ndiscretion in hauling waste to the site but merely followed the orders\n\nof a waste generator).      Thus,   Tippins distinguishes between\n\ntransporters that actively participate in the selection decision or\n\nhave substantial input in that decision, and transporters that merely\n\nfollow the directives of the generator. UTC has not explained why we\n\nshould not follow the approach in Tippins. Accordingly, we examine the\n\nfacts to determine whether the district court was clearly erroneous in\n\nconcluding that Macera did not actively participate in the decision to\n\ntransport waste to the Davis site.\n\n          The only evidence of Macera's participation in selecting the\n\nDavis site was the testimony of William Davis regarding his dealings\n\nwith Robert Cece. Davis testified that he had known Cece for a long\n\ntime, and that Cece visited the site on one occasion to discuss the\n\npossibility of dumping waste there. Davis also stated that he was paid\n\nby Macera for this dumping. The following excerpt from the district\n\ncourt's opinion summarizes its reasoning regarding the inferences that\n\ncould be drawn from this evidence:\n\n          The fact that Cece approached Davis and made\n          arrangements to dump at the Site could support a\n          reasonable inference that Cece actively and\n          substantially participated in the selection of\n          the Site. On the other hand, it also would be\n          reasonable to infer that Cece was acting at the\n          direction of UTC, the generator of the waste.\n          Ordinarily, the former inference might be more\n          plausible. However, under these circumstances,\n          its plausibility is eroded by the dearth of\n\n                               - 102 -\n\f          evidence regarding the dealings between the\n          Macera defendants and UTC.\n\nDavis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 334. The district court's determination\n\non this matter is essentially a refusal to choose between two equally\n\nplausible inferences where there is no reason to support one inference\n\nover the other. Because rulings under Rule 52(c) are reviewed for\n\nclear error, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a), we defer to the district\n\ncourt's decision not to draw any inference.\n\n          In an attempt to evade the clear error standard of review for\n\nfactual findings of the district court, UTC claims that the district\n\ncourt made an error of law by impermissibly drawing an adverse\n\ninference regarding UTC's failure to present evidence of its\n\nnegotiations with Macera about the hauling of its waste. UTC quotes\n\nthe following language from the court's written opinion in support of\n\nthis claim:\n\n          Since evidence of the dealings between UTC and\n          the Macera defendants was readily available to\n          and under the control of UTC, UTC's failure to\n          present that evidence or to explain why it was\n          unable to do so, gives rise to an inference that\n          the evidence would have been unfavorable to UTC.\n          . . . In short, the absence of evidence regarding\n          the Macera defendants' dealings with UTC and the\n          fact that such evidence was within UTC's control\n          cause this Court to find that UTC has failed to\n          establish that Macera Brothers 'selected' the\n          Davis Site.\n\nDavis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 334 (citation omitted). The case cited by\n\nthe district court in support of this inference provides that two\n\n\n                               - 103 -\n\fconditions must be satisfied before an adverse inference about the non-\n\nproduction of evidence may be drawn.      See Commercial Ins. Co. v.\n\nGonzalez, 512 F.2d 1307, 1314 (1st Cir. 1975). The evidence must be\n\n\"specially available\" to the non-producing party, and that party must\n\nhave \"had some reason to suppose that non-production would justify the\n\ninference.\" Id. UTC argues that \"specially available\" means evidence\n\nwithin its control but not within the control of Macera. Thus, UTC\n\nclaims that the inference cannot apply in this case because Macera also\n\nhas knowledge of any negotiations between Macera and UTC regarding the\n\ndisposal of UTC's waste. Cf. Kean v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 469\n\nF.2d 1183, 1187 (9th Cir. 1972) (\"Where a potential witness is equally\n\navailable to both parties, no inference should be drawn from the\n\nfailure of a party to call such witness.\").\n\n          We conclude that UTC, with its reliance on the \"adverse\n\ninference\" argument, misses the essential point of the district court's\n\nanalysis. The district court expressed its concern over UTC's overall\n\nfailure to present any evidence whatsoever about Macera's relationship\n\nwith generators -- both UTC and other unidentified parties -- for whom\n\nit hauled waste. Several paragraphs before discussing the inference\n\ndrawn against UTC, the court stated: \"UTC has failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence regarding those dealings [between Macera and\n\ngenerator defendants] to sustain its burden of proving that Macera\n\nBrothers 'selected' the Davis Site.\" Davis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 334.\n\n\n                               - 104 -\n\fThe district court's conclusion about the insufficiency of the evidence\n\nat this point in its analysis makes the propriety of the adverse\n\ninference irrelevant. The court found against UTC simply because UTC\n\nfailed to meet its burden of proof. In light of that finding, any\n\nadverse inference that might be drawn from UTC's failure to produce\n\nevidence of its own negotiations with Macera was not necessary to the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion. We conclude, therefore, that the district\n\ncourt did not rely improperly on an adverse inference and affirm its\n\nfinding that UTC did not present sufficient proof that Macera selected\n\nthe Davis site.\n\n                  2. Arranger Liability\n\n          UTC also argues that it proved that Macera was liable as an\n\narranger of waste under CERCLA. Macera claims that UTC's assertion of\n\nan arranger claim is untimely. In the 1991 third-party complaint\n\noriginally naming Macera as a defendant, UTC alleged only that Macera\n\nwas liable as a transporter of waste. The district court entered a\n\ncase management and scheduling order in December 1995 providing that\n\n\"[a]ll cross-claims and counterclaims are deemed made and denied,\n\nexcept that contractual claims for indemnity must be specifically\n\nplead.\"   The order also specified that amendments to third-party\n\ncomplaints had to be filed before January 2, 1996.\n\n          After the case was transferred to Chief Judge Torres, he\n\nentered an order in January 1998 providing:\n\n\n                               - 105 -\n\f           On December 14, 1995, an order was entered\n           providing that all parties were deemed to have\n           asserted claims, cross-claims and counterclaims\n           against all other parties for contribution and/or\n           indemnity without the need for specifically\n           pleading such claims.\n\n           Whereas it is impossible to determine what\n           parties, in fact, are asserting such claims, the\n           nature of any such claims or the basis for any\n           such claims . . .\n\n           it is hereby ORDERED that on or before February\n           15, 1998, each party asserting a claim, cross-\n           claim or counterclaim for contribution and/or\n           indemnity shall, if such party has not already\n           done so, file and serve pleadings setting forth\n           such claim. Such pleadings shall specify the\n           precise nature and basis of each claim asserted.\n\n\nRelying on that order, UTC filed an amended third-party complaint\n\nagainst Macera, alleging for the first time that Macera was also liable\n\nas an arranger. In its answer, Macera objected to this amendment as\n\nuntimely. For reasons that are unclear, the issue of whether UTC\n\ntimely pled an arranger claim against Macera was not resolved before\n\ntrial. However, the district court addressed this dispute during oral\n\nargument on Macera's Rule 52 motion for judgment after UTC rested its\n\ncase.   When UTC's lawyer first mentioned arranger liability, the\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n           THE COURT: Arranger didn't come into this until\n           much later. There is nothing about, there is no\n           arranger liability theory pled in the original\n           complaint against Cece, was there?\n\n           UTC'S COUNSEL: There was no arranger liability\n           pled in our original complaint. We did take\n\n                               - 106 -\n\f          advantage of Your Honor's invitation to correct\n          the pleadings in [January].\n\n          THE COURT: Not correct the pleadings, not to\n          correct the pleadings. Make it clear who was\n          asserting claims against whom, that was the -\n\nAfter additional discussion on the issue, the district court stated:\n\n          And I certainly don't think that the attempt to\n          include the arranger theory in the specific\n          claims that the Court required parties to assert\n          just before the case went to trial, I don't think\n          that that invitation or requirement that the\n          parties plead their - let the Court know who they\n          were asserting claims against constituted a\n          license to amend the pleadings and raise new\n          theories, and there is no question that arranger\n          liability is significantly different from hauler\n          liability.\n\nThus, the district court ruled that its order of January 1998 did not\n\nauthorize UTC to assert a belated claim of arranger liability. We\n\ndefer to this interpretation because the district court was uniquely\n\npositioned to explain the meaning of its own pretrial order. See\n\nMartha's Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. v. Unidentified, Wrecked &\n\nAbandoned Steam Vessel, 833 F.2d 1059, 1066-67 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"We\n\nhave noted before the special role played by the writing judge in\n\nelucidating the meaning and intendment of an order which he\n\nauthored.\"); Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(\"[U]ncertainty as to the meaning and intendment of a district court\n\norder can sometimes best be dispelled by deference to the views of the\n\nwriting judge.\"). We reject UTC's argument that the order authorized\n\nit to amend its complaint.\n\n                               - 107 -\n\f          Next, UTC argues that the district court erred in denying UTC\n\npermission to amend its complaint to conform to the evidence offered at\n\ntrial. \"When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express\n\nor implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all\n\nrespects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\" Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n15(b). \"Such late pleading amendments may be allowed under Rule 15(b)\n\nat the discretion of the court, but only to the extent that the party\n\nopposing the amendment will not be unduly prejudiced.\" Campana v.\n\nEller, 755 F.2d 212, 215 (1st Cir. 1985) (emphasis added). Where the\n\nparty seeking amendment of the pleadings has shown no justification for\n\nits delay in doing so, we have affirmed the trial court's ruling to\n\ndeny the amendment. See id. at 216. UTC has not even attempted to\n\nexplain its failure to amend the pleadings at an earlier date.\n\n          Still, UTC argues that we should reverse the district court's\n\ndetermination on this issue because Macera did not suffer prejudice as\n\na result of UTC's untimely pleading of the arranger claim. UTC insists\n\nthat \"the evidence admitted to prove 'transporter' liability was no\n\ndifferent than the proof that established 'arranger' liability.\"\n\nHowever, any lack of prejudice to Macera is irrelevant because the\n\ndistrict court gave other reasons for its ruling.         We consider\n\nprejudice to the non-moving party as one factor to be weighed in\n\npermitting an untimely amendment to the pleadings. See, e.g., Campana,\n\n755 F.2d at 215. In other words, a finding that the non-moving party\n\n\n                               - 108 -\n\fwould not be prejudiced by an untimely amendment does not compel a\n\ndetermination that the amendment is appropriate.\n\n          UTC also argues that Macera consented to being tried as an\n\narranger by failing to object to evidence tending to establish arranger\n\nliability at trial. The district court rejected this claim, citing its\n\nrecollection that Macera had objected to the use of the term\n\n\"arranger.\" We affirm this determination. \"Consent to the trial of an\n\nissue may be implied if, during the trial, a party acquiesces in the\n\nintroduction of evidence which is relevant only to that issue.\" DCPB,\n\nInc. v. City of Lebanon, 957 F.2d 913, 917 (1st Cir. 1992) (emphasis\n\nadded).   As just noted, UTC asserted that Macera would not be\n\nprejudiced by a ruling that it consented to being tried as an arranger\n\nbecause the evidence proving Macera's liability as an arranger of\n\nhazardous substances was the same evidence proving Macera's liability\n\nas a transporter. This argument about lack of prejudice forecloses\n\nUTC's claim regarding trial by consent: \"The introduction of evidence\n\ndirectly relevant to a pleaded issue cannot be the basis for a founded\n\nclaim that the opposing party should have realized that a new issue was\n\ninfiltrating the case.\" Id. Where, as here, the evidence regarding\n\nMacera's transport of waste to the Davis site was directly relevant to\n\ntransporter liability, and, according to UTC, arranger liability, we\n\nfind no error in the court's conclusion that Macera did not consent to\n\nbeing tried on an arranger theory by not objecting to the admission of\n\n\n                               - 109 -\n\fthat evidence.54\n\n                   b. The Judgment in Favor of the City of New Jersey\n\n            UTC brought a contribution claim against the City of New\n\nJersey (Jersey City) for disposing of approximately 2,000 drums\n\nabandoned on a city pier and containing corrosive, toxic and flammable\n\nsubstances found at the Davis site. The district court found Jersey\n\nCity immune from liability under § 9607(d)(2) of CERCLA, which provides\n\nimmunity for local governments from costs and damages resulting from\n\ntheir emergency response to the potential release of hazardous\n\nsubstances.55 See Davis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 335. On appeal, UTC\n\nargues that the district court erred in applying § 9607(d)(2) by\n\nfailing to consider whether Jersey City voluntarily removed the 2,000\n\n\n     54Even if we concluded that UTC introduced evidence that was\nrelevant only to prove that Macera was liable as an arranger, we agree\nwith the district court's determination that Macera did not acquiesce\nto being tried on that theory. As the district court noted in its\nruling from the bench, Macera objected to the use of the word\n\"arranger\" at least twice during the trial.\n     55   Section 9607(d)(2) provides:\n\n     No state or local government shall be liable under this\n     Title for costs or damages as a result of actions taken in\n     response to an emergency created by the release or\n     threatened release of a hazardous substance generated by or\n     from a facility owned by another person. This paragraph\n     shall not preclude liability for costs or damages as a\n     result of gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the\n     State or local government.       For the purposes of the\n     proceeding sentence, reckless, willful, or wanton misconduct\n     shall constitute gross negligence.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9607(d)(2).\n\n                               - 110 -\n\fdrums.\n\n          The facts relating to Jersey City's waste disposal are not\n\ndisputed. On a night in February 1977, Jersey City police caught Perk\n\nChemical Company dumping waste at an abandoned city warehouse at a pier\n\non the Hudson River. After police discovered approximately 2,000 drums\n\nof waste, the city secured the warehouse. City officials quickly\n\ncontacted the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP),\n\nwhich determined that the drums contained potentially explosive\n\nhazardous chemicals that could cause serious environmental harm. Both\n\nJersey City and the New Jersey DEP agreed that the waste required\n\nprompt disposal, but disputed who should finance the cleanup.\n\n          Two weeks later, the DEP obtained a judgment ordering Jersey\n\nCity to fund the cleanup.      After contacting state-recommended\n\ncontractors and expediting the normal bidding process, the city quickly\n\nhired a contractor to remove the waste. Within a few weeks all of the\n\nwaste was successfully removed from the warehouse. The contractor hired\n\nby the city subcontracted with CCC to transport the waste for disposal.\n\n          UTC argues that the statute contains a requirement of\n\nvoluntary action that Jersey City did not satisfy because it only acted\n\nto dispose of the drums after the state obtained a judgment ordering\n\nthe city to pay for the cleanup.56 We review the district court's\n\n\n     56UTC also argues that Jersey City is not exempt because it owned\nthe pier warehouse in which the waste was dumped, meaning that the\nwaste cannot be \"from a facility owned by another person,\" as the\n\n                               - 110 -\n\fapplication of § 9607(d)(2) de novo. See Rivera, 131 F.3d at 224. To\n\nconstrue the statute, we look at its plain language. See id. If the\n\nmeaning of the language is clear, our inquiry need go no further.\n\nSee id. We construe the statutory language within the context of\n\nCERCLA as a whole. See id. at 225; Conroy v. Aniskoff, 507 U.S. 511,\n\n515 (1993) (\"[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends\n\non context.\").\n\n          According to the plain language of § 9607(d)(2), state and\n\nlocal governments are immune except in cases where their handling of\n\nthe waste amounts to \"gross negligence or intentional misconduct.\"\n\nAlthough UTC concedes that Jersey City was not grossly negligent and\n\ndid not engage in intentional misconduct, it argues that CERCLA's broad\n\nremedial purpose requires us to read a voluntariness requirement into\n\nthe statute.\n\n          There is nothing in the plain language of § 9607(d)(2) that\n\nsupports UTC's argument. Indeed, UTC seeks to add to the statutory\n\nlanguage on policy grounds. There is no basis for doing so. This is\n\nnot the rare case in which applying the plain language of the statute\n\nwill produce an absurd or irrational result, Conservation Law Found. v.\n\nBusey, 79 F.3d 1250, 1267 (1st Cir. 1996), or one that is \"demonstrably\n\nat odds with the intention of its drafters,\" United States v. Ron Pair\n\n\nstatute requires. 42 U.S.C. § 9607(d)(2). However, the statute also\noffers immunity if the hazardous waste at issue was \"generated by . .\n. another person,\" as was the case here. Id.\n\n                               - 110 -\n\fEnters., 489 U.S. 235, 242 (1989).57     We thus affirm the district\n\ncourt's ruling that Jersey City is immune from liability under §\n\n9607(d)(2).\n\n                  c. The Government's $6 Million Enforcement Costs\n\n          UTC appeals the district court's apparent ruling that it is\n\nsolely responsible for $6 million in government enforcement costs,\n\narguing that the ruling is \"insufficiently clear for purposes of the\n\napplication of estoppel and res judicata,\" and that there is no\n\ncompetent evidence to support the conclusion that UTC caused all of the\n\ngovernment's enforcement costs. The appellants respond that the court\n\n\"properly exercised its discretion in allocating $6 million in\n\ngovernment enforcement costs to UTC,\" either based on equitable\n\ncontribution or divisibility principles, and that there is evidence in\n\nthe record to support this ruling.\n\n          The \"enforcement costs\" at issue are the government's\n\nexpenditures for litigating the cost recovery action against UTC and\n\nthe other original eight defendants through the Phase I trial against\n\n\n\n\n     57 Our application of the statute is consistent with the 6th\nCircuit's opinion in United States v. Cordova Chem. Co., 113 F.3d 572\n(6th Cir. 1997), vacated on other grounds sub nom United States v.\nBestfoods, 524 U.S. 51 (1998). In Cordova, the 6th Circuit found the\nMichigan Department of Natural Resources immune from liability under §\n9607(d)(2) for the costs of a hazardous waste site cleanup. See id. at\n582. We note that the facts of Cordova indicate that the Michigan\ndepartment received immunity for an emergency response that was\nconsiderably less efficient and effective then Jersey City's here.\n\n                               - 110 -\n\fUTC.58    The district court made two statements about UTC's\n\nresponsibility for these costs. In its September 28, 1998 judgment\n\nbased on partial findings, the court said:\n\n           In this case, calculating UTC's pro rata share of\n           the total response costs requires that the\n           enforcement cost component and the cleanup cost\n           component be considered separately. The $6\n           million in enforcement costs is attributable,\n           almost entirely, to the Phase I litigation\n           between the government and UTC. The defendants\n           did not participate in that phase of the\n           litigation and it was necessitated because UTC\n           denied that any of its waste was deposited at the\n           Davis site. Accordingly, UTC bears 100% of the\n           responsibility for those enforcement costs.\n\nDavis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 338. The court also discussed the issue\n\nof enforcement costs in its December 15, 1998 declaratory judgment,\n\nsaying:\n\n           It appears that the [$6 million] enforcement\n           costs are attributable almost entirely to\n           expenses incurred by the government in the Phase\n           I litigation against UTC, and that, therefore,\n           they should be borne entirely by UTC. However,\n           that issue need not be decided in order to\n           determine the likelihood that UTC will be\n           required to pay more than its fair share.\n\n\n\n     58The parties do not contest that $6 million is an accurate\nestimate of the amount of the government's costs to that point.\nHowever, UTC argues that the precise figure for the costs --\n$5,855,812.01, according to the government's written submission in\nsupport of entry of its consent decree with UTC and other settling\nparties -- as well as other evidence about who bears responsibility for\nthese costs comes from the consent decree proceedings, and so is not\npart of the record in the declaratory judgment appeals. Because we\nremand to the district court for clarification, we do not reach this\nissue.\n\n                               - 110 -\n\fDavis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 69. The court denied UTC's motion seeking\n\namendment or clarification of these statements.\n\n            UTC argues that the \"the equivocal language that the district\n\ncourt used and the context of the issue it was deciding indicate it was\n\nonly engaging in a presumption, based on extra-record evidence, to test\n\nwhether it should issue declaratory relief.\" It asks us to construe the\n\ncourt's statements as \"argumentative presumptions without preclusive\n\neffect.\"\n\n            We agree that the intended effect of the court's statements\n\nis insufficiently clear. The court discussed UTC's responsibility for\n\nthe government's enforcement costs only in terms of its assessment of\n\nwhether UTC paid more than its fair share of the total response costs\n\nfor the Davis site. On the one hand, the court's initial statement\n\nthat \"UTC bears 100% of the responsibility for those enforcement costs\"\n\nsuggests that the court may have intended a ruling that obligates UTC\n\nto pay the government $6 million on top of the payments agreed to in\n\nthe settlement. On the other hand, the court's later statement that\n\nthe issue of UTC's responsibility for the costs \"need not be decided\"\n\nsuggests that the court ultimately refrained from reaching this\n\nquestion.\n\n            Moreover, it is not clear how the court's statements fit with\n\nits other Phase I and Phase III rulings. Did the court intend merely\n\nto restate the joint and several liability findings against UTC\n\n\n                                 - 110 -\n\ffollowing the Phase I trial, which indisputably included liability for\n\nan estimated $49 million in cleanup costs and $6 million in enforcement\n\ncosts?59 Or did the court intend to allocate the enforcement costs to\n\nUTC, irrespective of the consent decree settlement and the finding that\n\nUTC should bear 1.54 percent share of the total liability?\n\n          The appellants argue that an equitable allocation to UTC of\n\nthe government's enforcement costs would lie within the district\n\ncourt's broad discretionary authority under CERCLA. See Acushnet, 191\n\nF.3d at 77. However, we are not willing to assume that the court made\n\nsuch a finding of causation or equitable allocation without a more\n\ncomplete explication. As a result, we instruct the district court on\n\nremand to explain the intended effect of its statements about UTC's\n\nresponsibility for the government's enforcement costs.60 In remanding\n\nfor clarification of this issue, we do not retain jurisdiction of the\n\ncase. See Clauson v. New England Ins. Co., 254 F.3d 331, 342 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n     59By order of May 5, 1995, UTC was adjudged liable for \"all\nunreimbursed costs that have been incurred by the United States of\nAmerica related to the Davis Liquid Waste Site.\"\n     60This remand does not disturb the district court's finding that\nUTC paid more than its fair share of the total enforcement costs. As\nwe have noted, the court translated UTC's 1.54 percent share of\nliability into $754,600 and said that UTC will pay the government at\nleast $10.35 million after contribution is received from the settling\nthird and fourth-party defendants. Thus \"even if the $6 million in\nenforcement costs is viewed as an additional part of UTC's contribution\nthreshold, the threshold clearly is exceeded by UTC's settlement\nobligation of at least $10.35 million.\" Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at\n69.\n\n                               - 110 -\n\f2001).\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n\n          As a final note, we wish to acknowledge the district court's\n\ncareful attention to this unusually complex case.       Its skillful\n\nmanagement of the case and its cogent decisions over many years\n\nconsiderably aided our disposition of this ganglion of appeals.\n\n          For all of the reasons discussed herein, we affirm the\n\ndeterminations of the district court, with the exception of that\n\nconcerning the issue of whether UTC is solely responsible for $6\n\nmillion in government enforcement costs. On that issue, we remand for\n\na clarification of the district court's position. Each party is to\n\nbear its own costs.\n\n\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 110 -\n\f                             APPENDIX I\n\n           A Roster of Parties, Principals, and Witnesses\n\nAcco-Bristol:               defendant found liable for dumping\n\nAshland:                    defendant found liable for dumping; also\n                            appeals the consent decrees\n\nBFI:                        alleged to be corporate successor of\n                            Macera Brothers; won judgment on partial\n                            findings at the close of UTC's evidence\n\nBlack & Decker:             found to be corporate successor of Gar\n\nAnthony Capuano:            principal of Sanitary Landfill\n\nJack Capuano:               principal of Sanitary Landfill\n\nWilliam Carracino:          principal of CCC\n\nRobert Cece:                principal of Macera Brothers\n\nChemical Control\nCorporation (CCC):          waste hauler located in New Jersey\n\nChemical Waste\nRemoval (CWR):              waste hauler located in Connecticut\n\nWilliam Davis:              owner of the Davis site\n\nElectroformers:             found not to be corporate successor of\n                            Gar\n\nJohnny Granfield:      driver for CWR\n\nWilbert Jones:              driver for CWR\n\nMacera Brothers:            waste hauler that dumped at the Davis\n                            site; won judgment on partial findings\n                            at the close of UTC's evidence\n\nJohn Mayo:                  driver for CCC\n\nMorton:                     defendant found liable for the dumping\n                            of Thiokol; acknowledges successor\n\n                              - 110 -\n\f                      liability for Thiokol\n\nEmanuel Musillo:      principal of CWR\n\nMichael Musillo:      principal of Drum Automation, CWR's\n                      corporate successor\n\nCity of New Jersey:   won judgment on partial findings at the\n                      close of UTC's evidence\n\nPerkin-Elmer (PE):    defendant found liable for dumping\n\nJohn Prahm:           employee of CCC\n\nQualitron:            corporation that dumped at the Davis\n                      site; PE acknowledges successor\n                      liability for Qualitron\n\nSanitary Landfill:    landfill where CWR and CCC dumped waste\n                      before dumping at the Davis site\n\nUnited Technologies\nCorporation (UTC):    found liable in Phase I; sued third and\n                      fourth-party defendants in Phase III\n\n\n\n\n                        - 111 -\n\f                           APPENDIX II\n\n             A Summary of Relevant Monetary Sums\n\nEstimated Total Cost: $55 million\n\nInitial EPA response costs: $19 million\nInitial DOJ enforcement costs: $6 million\nSoil remediation: $14 million\nGroundwater cleanup: $13 million\nWater line extension: $3 million\n\nPhase I\n\nPartial Consent Decree: approximately $5.625 million\n\nClairol: $3 million, plus interest\nPfizer: $1.5 million, plus interest\nProvidence Journal: $650,000, plus interest\nCiba-Geigy: $475,000, plus interest\n\nPhase II\n\nConsent Decree I: $13.5 million, plus $440,000 for government\noversight costs and the expense of soil remediation\n\nAmerican Cyanamid: $2.75 million (portion to settle state claims)\nOlin Hunt: $2.75 million (portion to settle state claims)\nForty-seven non-carve-out parties: $7.2 million\nUTC:      Remainder of settlement, approximately $2.8 million\n          Soil remediation, estimated at $14 million\n          (UTC contribution action recoveries to be split with the\n          United States after deduction of attorneys' fees; UTC\n          recovery capped at $5.364 million)\n\nConsent Decree II: $4.135 million (part to U.S. and part to UTC)\n\nTwenty-three non-carve-out parties: $4.135 million\n\nConsent Decree III: $5 million (part to U.S. and part to UTC)\n\nNational Starch: $5 million\n\nConsent Decree IV: $200,000 (part to U.S. and part to UTC)\n\nSwan Engraving: $150,000\n\n                              - 112 -\n\fPower Semiconductors: $50,000\n\nCapuano Consent Decree: $200,000\n\nCapuano Brothers: $200,000\n\nTotal from Partial Consent Decrees, Phase I and II: approximately $33\nmillion (not including interest on escrowed amounts)\n\n\n\n\n                             - 113 -\n\f",

This appeal concerns the third phase\n\nof litigation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\n\nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq.,\n\nstemming from the disposal of hundreds of thousands of gallons of\n\nhazardous waste in the late 1970s at a site in Smithfield, Rhode Island\n\nowned by William and Eleanor Davis. This phase concerns an action by\n\nUnited Technologies Corporation (UTC) under CERCLA's contribution\n\nprovision, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f). In 1995, UTC was found jointly and\n\nseverally liable for costs incurred by the United States for the\n\ncleanup of the Davis site. Hoping to relieve itself of some of the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fburden of that judgment, UTC sued several dozen other potentially\n\nresponsible parties. Most of these parties, as well as UTC, signed\n\npartial consent decrees with the United States in which they agreed to\n\npay a share of the cleanup costs. Several parties, however, did not\n\nsettle, and in 1998 UTC took them to trial. One of the non-settlors,\n\nAshland, Inc., appeals the district court's entry of the partial\n\nconsent decrees. Ashland and four other non-settlors also appeal the\n\ncourt's entry following trial of a declaratory judgment holding them\n\nliable for disposing of hazardous waste at the Davis site and\n\nallocating to them shares of responsibility for cleanup costs.\n\nFinally, UTC appeals three aspects of the court's ruling.\n\n          We affirm, with one exception -- a remand for clarification\n\nof the district court's ruling that UTC may be solely responsible for\n\n$6 million in government enforcement costs.\n\n                           I. Background\n\n          We describe the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment.1 During the 1970s, William Davis operated a waste disposal\n\nsite on ten acres of land in Smithfield, Rhode Island.2 In 1982, the\n\n\n     1To assist the reader of this opinion, there are two appendices\nattached. The first identifies the roles of the multiple parties to\nthis appeal and the roles of the key principals and witnesses. The\nsecond breaks down the liability and settlement amounts referred to in\nthe case.\n     2Forest borders the Davis site to the east and west, and wetlands\nand swamp border it to the north and south. When the United States\nfiled suit in 1990, there were about 100 homes within one mile of the\n\n                                 -6-\n\fEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed the Davis site on its\n\nNational Priorities List of hazardous waste sites. After undertaking a\n\nremediation investigation and completing a feasibility study, the EPA\n\nissued a Record of Decision in 1987 describing the cleanup work that it\n\ndeemed necessary to mitigate the environmental damage caused by the\n\nhazardous waste disposal.     As described by the EPA, the cleanup\n\nrequired the government to \"(1) complete a water line to supply\n\ndrinking water to areas where the drinking water wells already are\n\ncontaminated and to areas where the contaminated groundwater plume\n\nthreatens additional wells; (2) clean contaminated groundwater; and (3)\n\nexcavate and clean contaminated soils that continue to contaminate the\n\ngroundwater and other environmental media at the Site.\"        The EPA\n\nestimated the cost of this work at about $3 million for the water line,\n\n$13 million for groundwater cleanup, and $14 million for soil\n\nremediation. The government began the work of constructing water lines\n\nto nearby residents, but took no action on the soil or groundwater\n\ncleanups. See United States v.

The United\n\nStates did not sue these parties directly.\n\n          In a 1994 partial consent decree, Clairol Inc., Ciba-Geigy\n\nCorporation, Pfizer Inc., and The Providence Journal Company agreed\n\ncollectively to pay the United States $5.625 million, plus interest\n\naccruing from the date of the settlement, toward the Davis site\n\ncleanup. UTC, however, did not settle, and the government took it to\n\ntrial in 1995.6 After a bench trial, the district court found that UTC\n\nhad dumped wax and solvent waste at the Davis site and held UTC jointly\n\nand severally liable for all past and future cleanup costs.

The district court found Carracino liable with CCC.\n     11\n      UTC also brought claims against BFI Waste Systems of North\nAmerica as Macera's corporate successor.\n     12UTC brought claims against Black & Decker and Electroformers as\nGar's possible corporate successors. The district court found Black &\nDecker liable as Gar's successor and dismissed the claims against\nElectroformers. Black & Decker appeals that ruling, as we discuss\ninfra.\n     13UTC brought claims against several other defendants which the\ndistrict court dismissed.

Ashland appeals the district court's approval of the\n\nconsent decrees. Ashland, Acco, Gar, Morton, and PE appeal several\n\naspects of the declaratory judgment. Specifically, four appellants\n\n(Ashland, Acco, Gar, and PE) argue that UTC failed to prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that they arranged for the disposal of\n\nwaste at the Davis site. These four appellants also argue that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by admitting and crediting the\n\ntestimony of CWR driver Wilbert Jones. Acco and Gar also argue that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion by excluding a \"Master Chart\"\n\nof the parties' claims compiled by UTC's lawyers to prepare the witness\n\ndesignated by UTC to testify on behalf of the corporation pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 30(b)(6). Three appellants (Ashland, Acco,\n\nand Gar) contend that UTC failed to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that their respective waste contained hazardous substances and\n\nso caused the incurrence of cleanup costs. These three appellants also\n\nargue that the court's entry of a declaratory judgment was improper.\n\nAppellant Gar, a/k/a Black & Decker, challenges the court's finding of\n\ncorporate successor liability. Finally, UTC contests the court's\n\ndismissal of the case against the City of New Jersey and Macera, and\n\n\n                                - 15 -\n\fits ruling that UTC was solely responsible for $6 million in government\n\nenforcement costs incurred during Phase I and II of the litigation. We\n\nwill discuss each of these challenges in turn.\n\n                      II. The Consent Decrees\n\nA.   Background\n\n          1. Consent Decree I\n\n          Ashland's appeal focuses on Consent Decree I, the primary\n\nsettlement between the United States and UTC, which began consent\n\ndecree negotiations with the United States as an alternative to\n\npursuing an appeal of the judgment in Davis I. In discussions with\n\nUTC, the EPA assigned possibly settling PRPs (generators and\n\ntransporters of waste) to two groups, \"carve-out\" and \"non-carve-out.\"\n\nThe carve-out entities were deemed primarily responsible for the waste\n\nat the Davis site, and so were compelled to negotiate individual\n\nsettlements with the United States. Non-carve-out third parties were\n\nencouraged to negotiate a possible global settlement among themselves,\n\nwith the assistance of liaison counsel.\n\n          On July 14, 1995, following the Phase I settlement with four\n\nparties, the United States offered to settle with all remaining parties\n\nfor about $16 million plus the performance of site soil cleanup using\n\nlow-temperature thermal desorption technology. UTC provisionally\n\nagreed to the United States's settlement offer and pursued its\n\ncontribution claims.    Ultimately, UTC, carve-outs Olin Hunt and\n\n\n                                - 16 -\n\fAmerican Cyanamid, and about fifty other parties joined this\n\nsettlement. The parties paid a total of $13.5 million to the United\n\nStates, plus $440,000 in oversight costs. Of that amount, Olin Hunt\n\nand American Cyanamid paid $2.75 million each (with some portion going\n\nto resolution of state claims), non-carve-out parties paid a total of\n\n$7.2 million, and UTC paid the remaining balance, about $2.8 million.15\n\n\n\n          Furthermore, UTC took responsibility for the entire expense\n\nof site soil remediation, an estimated cost of about $14 million.\n\nUnder the settlement, UTC and the United States each receive half of\n\nfuture contribution recoveries, with UTC's recovery capped at $5.364\n\nmillion after deducting 15 percent of contribution recoveries for\n\nattorneys' fees incurred in contribution litigation after March 1996.\n\nFinally, the settling parties received complete contribution protection\n\nfrom claims by other PRPs. Separate recoveries by the United States\n\nwould not be subject to contribution sharing.\n\n          While the predicted cost of cleaning up the Davis site has\n\nvaried over the years, the most recent estimate, from 1997, took into\n\naccount new remediation technology and set the total at $55 million.\n\nThis amount guided the United States in determining the settlement\n\namounts. In addition, the allocations to Clairol and the other parties\n\n\n\n     15The allocation among the non-carve-outs was initially\nconfidential, though the payment amounts have now been disclosed.\n\n                                - 17 -\n\fin the earlier Phase I, $5.625 million settlement provided a\n\n\"benchmark\" for the amounts requested from potential settlors in the\n\nlater consent decrees.     Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 191.\n\n          2. Consent Decrees II, III, IV and Capuano\n\n          The remaining consent decrees included 27 additional parties\n\nand involved UTC's settlement of claims for contribution from other\n\nPRPs, resulting in some additional payments to the United States\n\npursuant to UTC's agreement with the United States in Consent Decree I.\n\nIn Consent Decree II, 23 parties paid a total of $4.135 million, with\n\nindividual party liability detailed in briefs to the district court.\n\nConsent Decree III involved National Starch, which paid $5 million.\n\nConsent Decree IV involved a $150,000 payment by Swan Engraving and a\n\n$50,000 payment by Power Semiconductors.        All parties to these\n\nsettlements received complete contribution protection from future\n\nclaims. Finally, Capuano Brothers paid $200,000 to the government,\n\nplus a like amount for settlement of cleanup costs at another Superfund\n\nsite.\n\n          3. The District Court Approval\n\n          To assist in its assessment of Consent Decree I, t he district\n\ncourt held a two-day hearing to determine whether the proposed\n\nsettlement was fair, both procedurally and substantively, reasonable,\n\nand consistent with CERCLA's objectives. United States v. Cannons\n\nEng'g Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538792\"><a href=\"/opinion/538792/united-states-of-america-v-cannons-engineering-corp-appeal-of-olin-hunt/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (1st Cir. 1990). Procedurally, the court\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\ffound that \"[t]he negotiations were conducted openly and all parties\n\nwere given an opportunity to participate.\" Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n189. Substantively, the court concluded that the consent decree met\n\nall requirements because the \"proposed settlement reflects a rational\n\nmethod of allocating liability in a manner that reasonably approximates\n\neach party's share of responsibility; the method is applied\n\nevenhandedly with respect to all PRP's and sufficient information is\n\npresented to enable the Court to determine whether that has been done.\"\n\nId. at 192.\n\n          In assessing the reasonableness of the consent decree, the\n\ncourt's chief concern was \"whether the public can be adequately\n\ncompensated by a settlement in which the United States receives only a\n\nportion of the remediation cost from a party previously adjudged liable\n\nfor the entire cost,\" id. at 186, a reference to the release of UTC\n\nfrom the Phase I judgment. According to the district court, under the\n\nterms of the settlement the United States would receive $27.5 million,\n\nplus the $5.8 million from the original defendants, leaving a $21.7\n\nmillion shortfall in compensation for the projected cost of the\n\ncleanup. This issue distinguished the Davis case from others in which\n\nthe United States settled before judgment.          \"In those cases,\n\ncompromising for a fraction of the response costs with a PRP that is\n\npotentially liable for the entire cost usually is justifiable on the\n\nground that litigation might result in the United States recovering no\n\n\n                                - 19 -\n\fresponse costs at all.\"     Id. at 192.\n\n          The court thus framed the reasonableness question in terms\n\nof \"whether the amount by which the judgment has been discounted\n\nreasonably reflects the risk of reversal [on appeal],\" and called this\n\n\"a very close question.\" Id. at 193. The court acknowledged some\n\n\"remaining, albeit diminished, litigation risk associated with the\n\nclaim against UTC.\" Id. The court also suggested that concern about\n\nreleasing UTC from the judgment was mitigated by the fact that the\n\nUnited States could still sue the non-settlors for the $21.7 million\n\nshortfall, but recognized that this course of action seemed to involve\n\n\"much greater litigation risk\" than simply pursuing the judgment\n\nagainst UTC.   Id.\n\n          In resolving the issue, the court considered factors beyond\n\nan assessment of litigation risks. The court noted that \"the financial\n\nobligations imposed on UTC are considerably greater than the\n\nobligations assumed by the other 'carve-out' settlors,\" reinforcing\n\nUTC's substantial responsibility. Id. It also noted that \"given the\n\ndeference accorded to the EPA's judgment in such matters, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the proposed discount is unreasonable.\" Id. The court said\n\nthat the consent decree avoided an unduly harsh result for UTC, whereas\n\nthe judgment would have \"saddled [it], unfairly, with liability for\n\nremediation costs that far exceed its fair share.\" Id. Acknowledging\n\nthat UTC could pursue contribution actions against other PRPs, the\n\n\n                                - 20 -\n\fcourt still concluded that the consent decree was reasonable given the\n\ngreat \"difficulty of establishing entitlement to contribution.\" Id.\n\nFinally, the court found the consent decree to be consistent with the\n\nstatute because it advanced \"the overriding goal of promptly and\n\nefficiently cleaning up hazardous waste sites.\"        Id.\n\n          Pursuant to its thorough opinion, the district court approved\n\nConsent Decree I on February 13, 1998, and entered final judgment on\n\nDecember 9, 1999. Consent Decrees II, III, IV and the Capuano decree\n\nwere each summarily approved subsequently. Final judgment was also\n\nentered on these decrees in December 1999. On appeal, Ashland, a non-\n\nsettling PRP, lodges numerous objections to the approval of the consent\n\ndecrees, including a jurisdictional objection.        We assess these\n\narguments.\n\nB. Reviewing the Approval of the Consent Decrees\n\n          1. Standard of Review\n\n          Considerable deference is involved in the review of CERCLA\n\nconsent decrees. Indeed, appellate review is \"encased in a double\n\nlayer of swaddling.\"    Cannons, 899 F.2d at 84.      First, there is\n\ndeference to the administrative agency's construction of the\n\nsettlement. \"That so many affected parties, themselves knowledgeable\n\nand represented by experienced lawyers, have hammered out an agreement\n\nat arm's length and advocate its embodiment in a judicial decree,\n\nitself deserves weight in the ensuing balance.\" Id. at 84. Second, the\n\n\n                                - 21 -\n\fappellate court can only review a district court's approval of a\n\nconsent decree for abuse of discretion, characterized by \"a serious\n\nerror of law\" or a \"meaningful lapse of judgment.\" United States v.\n\nCharles George Trucking, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677789\"><a href=\"/opinion/677789/united-states-of-america-v-charles-george-trucking-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1085 (1st Cir. 1994); United\n\nStates v.

This double deference \"places a heavy\n\nburden on those who purpose to upset a trial judge's approval of a\n\nconsent decree.\"    Cannons, 899 F.2d at 84.\n\n          2. Case or Controversy\n\n          As a preliminary matter, Ashland contends that the district\n\ncourt had no jurisdiction under Article III to approve the consent\n\ndecrees because, \"with the exception of UTC, the U.S. never sued any of\n\nthe third or fourth-party defendants settling in Consent Decrees I-IV.\n\nMoreover, approximately 34 entities who were signatories to Consent\n\nDecree I were never sued by any party to this action.\" In Ashland's\n\nview, this circumstance means that there was no \"case or controversy\"\n\nto be resolved by the district court. We conclude that, even if there\n\nwere parties not sued by the United States involved in the consent\n\ndecrees, their inclusion would be permissible because the Supreme Court\n\n\n                                - 22 -\n\fhas allowed unpleaded claims to be part of consent decrees, and thus,\n\nthere is no \"case or controversy\" concern.\n\n            In Local 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters v.

Although\n\nFirefighters involved a challenge to the scope of a consent decree\n\nrather than an Article III case or controversy argument, satisfying the\n\ncriteria set forth in that case resolves any case or controversy claim.\n\nThe district court found that the criteria were satisfied by Consent\n\nDecree I:\n\n            The United States's claims against the settling\n            third and fourth-party defendants spring from and\n            fall well within the scope of the controversy\n            described in the pleading; . . . Furthermore, the\n            United States and all of the settling PRP's are\n            parties to the action16 and the consent decree\n            resolves the dispute among them. Finally, . . .\n            approval of the consent decree also furthers the\n            objectives of CERCLA by facilitating the prompt\n            and efficient remediation of a major hazardous\n            waste site.\n\nDavis II, 11 F.Supp. 2d at 188.\n\n\n\n     16We understand the court's reference to \"parties to the action\"\nto include those initially sued by the United States, defendants to the\nUTC contribution claims, as well as the numerous parties named in suits\namong the third and fourth-party defendants.\n\n                                 - 23 -\n\f          We have applied the Firefighters test in the CERCLA context\n\nbefore. In Charles George, we found that claims not expressly set out\n\nin the pleadings may be addressed in a consent decree as long as they\n\nfall within the pleadings' general scope.        34 F.3d at 1089-91.\n\nLikewise, unpleaded claims that could not be brought against third-\n\nparty defendants pursuant to a case management order (CMO) were\n\nappropriately included in the consent decree. Id. at 1091. Here, the\n\npurported failure to file complaints contemporaneous with the consent\n\ndecrees does not defeat the legitimacy of the settlements. As we wrote\n\nin Charles George:\n\n          [T]he Supreme Court has made clear that there is\n          no per se prohibition against consent decrees\n          that exceed the possible bounds of a decision\n          issued directly by the trial court. Because a\n          consent decree is animated not only by the\n          parties' legal claims but also by the parties'\n          consent, a court is 'not necessarily barred from\n          entering a consent decree merely because the\n          decree provides broader relief than the court\n          could have awarded after trial.'\n\nId. at 1091 (quoting Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525).\n\n          The district court allowed the inclusion of parties not sued\n\nby the United States in the consent decrees, finding that UTC's\n\ncontribution claims \"are based on the same body of evidence and raise\n\nthe same issues as the United States' claims against the settling third\n\nand fourth-party defendants.\" Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 188. Like\n\na settlement that is greater in scope than the originally pled claims,\n\nthe inclusion of various third and fourth-party defendants, as well as\n\n                                - 24 -\n\finterested non-parties, is permissible pursuant to Firefighters.17\n\nIndeed, any conclusion to the contrary would disrupt the goals of\n\nCERCLA, which seeks early settlement with as many PRPs as possible to\n\nfurther expeditious remediation.\n\n          3. Fairness\n\n                  a. Procedural\n\n          Assessing fairness in the CERCLA settlement context has both\n\nprocedural and substantive dimensions.       \"To measure procedural\n\nfairness, a court should ordinarily look to the negotiation process and\n\nattempt to gauge its candor, openness, and bargaining balance.\"\n\nCannons, 899 F.2d at 86. The EPA has ample authority to structure its\n\nsettlement negotiations, including \"broad discretion to structure\n\nclasses of PRPs.\" Id. A finding of procedural fairness may also be an\n\nacceptable proxy for substantive fairness, when other circumstantial\n\nindicia of fairness are present. See Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1089.\n\n          Ashland asserts that the consent decrees failed to meet the\n\ncriteria of procedural fairness because the establishment of party\n\ncategories inhibited the openness of negotiations; discovery relating\n\nto the settlement terms was inadequate; and the United States abdicated\n\nto UTC its responsibility to conduct the negotiations under CERCLA.\n\n\n\n     17 Ashland further contests the inclusion of \"successors in\ninterest\" and \"corporate affiliates\" within the scope of Consent Decree\nI. Given the potential liability of such entities, this inclusion is\nappropriate.\n\n                                - 25 -\n\fAshland also argues that information fundamental to evaluation of the\n\nconsent decrees was not disclosed by the United States, including: (1)\n\nthe United States' total past and estimated future costs of\n\nremediation; (2) the strength of the United States' case against each\n\nsettlor; (3) the type, volume and toxicity of the waste for which each\n\nsettlor was responsible and a correlation to site cleanup costs; (4)\n\nthe formula by which the settlement amounts were calculated, and\n\nevidentiary support for the formula.\n\n          These arguments are unpersuasive. All identified players in\n\nthe hazardous waste site were notified of early opportunities for\n\nsettlement with the United States, and later, with UTC. There is no\n\nreason to doubt that the consent decrees were the result of \"arm's\n\nlength, good faith bargaining\" between sophisticated parties. United\n\nStates v. Comunidades Unidas Contra la Contaminacion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198840\"><a href=\"/opinion/198840/united-states-v-comunidades/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281\n\n(1st Cir. 2000). PRPs were offered the assistance of a magistrate\n\njudge and an alternative dispute resolution administrator in the\n\nnegotiation   of   their   settlements.    In   addition,   the   early\n\nclassification of carve-outs and non-carve-outs was an attempt at\n\nsettlement management within the discretion of the United States.\n\n          The district court also found no breach of the requirement\n\nfor public disclosure, concluding that the parties offered \"facts\n\nsufficient to enable one to determine whether\" the terms of the\n\nagreement were fair. Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 194. The proposed\n\n\n                                - 26 -\n\fdecrees lodged with the court \"set[] forth, at length, all of the terms\n\nof the settlement.\" Id. They were published in compliance with 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9622(d)(2)(A)-(B), making the decrees available to non-parties\n\nand the public for comment in a timely manner.       Furthermore, the\n\ndistrict court noted that \"there is no indication that the United\n\nStates misrepresented or withheld any material facts.\" Id. at 189.\n\nThere is no error in any of these findings. Ashland's argument that\n\nthe identified information had to be available is not supported by the\n\nlaw, which makes significant allowances for gaps in information, given\n\nthe sometimes impossible task of deriving this data.\n\n                  b. Substantive\n\n          Substantive fairness involves concepts of corrective justice\n\nand accountability, concentrating on \"the proposed allocation of\n\nresponsibility as between settling and non-settling PRPs.\" Charles\n\nGeorge, 34 F.3d at 1088. \"[T]he proper way to gauge the adequacy of\n\nsettlement amounts to be paid by settling PRPs is to compare the\n\nproportion of total projected costs to be paid by the settlors with the\n\nproportion of liability attributable to them.\" Id. at 1087. Ashland\n\nasserts that the formula used by the government to assess liability\n\namong the carve-out and non-carve-out parties, settling or not, was\n\narbitrary and capricious, unrelated to comparative fault and\n\ninconsistently applied across consent decrees.\n\n          The law on this issue is clear. The EPA formula should be\n\n\n                                - 27 -\n\fupheld \"so long as the agency supplies some plausible explanation for\n\nit, welding some reasonable linkage between factors it includes in its\n\nformula or scheme and the proportionate shares of the settling PRPs.\"\n\nCannons, 899 F.2d at 87. In assessing the formula applied, the quality\n\nof the information available to the government and settling parties\n\ninforms the fairness analysis because data on the total extent of harm\n\nand the respective liabilities of various PRPs are often unavailable.\n\nSee id. at 88.   Such difficulties will not preclude a court from\n\nentering a consent decree. See Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1089. The\n\ncalculation of liability and the allocation of that responsibility is\n\nspecially within the scope of the Agency's and parties' expertise. \"As\n\nlong as the data the EPA uses to apportion liability for purposes of a\n\nconsent decree falls along the broad spectrum of plausible\n\napproximations, judicial intrusion is unwarranted . . . . Having\n\nselected a reasonable method of weighing comparative fault, the agency\n\nneed not show that it is the best, or even the fairest, of all\n\nconceivable methods.\"     Cannons, 899 F.2d at 88.\n\n          In this case, the EPA assessed liability based on \"its\n\nestimate of the volume of waste attributable to each PRP.\" Davis II,\n\n11 F. Supp. at 190. The EPA also considered the strength of the cases\n\nagainst the respective PRPs, taking \"into account that there was direct\n\nand credible evidence linking some of the PRP's to the Site and that\n\nthe evidence with respect to other PRP's was almost entirely\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\fcircumstantial and varied in probative value.\" Id. The district court\n\nfound the interplay of these factors in this case to be \"rational\" and\n\n\"especially appropriate in cases like this where the wastes have been\n\nintermingled and it is virtually impossible to attribute discrete\n\nportions of the cleanup costs to particular wastes.\" Id. The court\n\nfurther observed that, in accord with the precedent, \"assessing\n\nrelative responsibility is an imperfect process because it requires\n\nsubjective judgments based on evidence that is not completely developed\n\nand may be disputed.     However, . . . the evidence need not be\n\nexhaustive or conclusive in order to determine whether a proposed\n\nsettlement is substantively fair.\"       Id. at 191.\n\n          We agree with the district court's analysis supporting the\n\nsubstantive fairness of the liability allocation among carve-outs and\n\nnon-carve-outs, settlors and non-settlors alike. In arguments before\n\nthe district court, the government attorney and others noted that the\n\nsettlements involved \"roughly half of the parties paying somewhat more\n\nthan half of the costs.\" In its decision, the district court stressed\n\nthe parity of the amounts paid by settling PRPs and non-settling PRPs,\n\nboth carve-outs and non-carve-outs. Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 191.\n\nThe court wrote:\n\n          Comparing the amounts paid by the settling\n          'carve-out' PRP's to the Clairol benchmark and\n          to the demands made upon the non-settling 'carve-\n          out' PRP's supports the conclusion that the\n          proposed settlement apportions liability in a\n          manner that roughly approximates a rational\n\n                                - 29 -\n\f           estimate of the relative responsibilities borne\n           by both the settling and non-settling PRP's.\n\nId. at 190.\n\n           The court proceeded to compare the settlement offered to\n\nAmerican Cyanamid and Olin Hunt with the settlements paid in the\n\nClairol agreement and demands made of eight non-settling carve-out\n\nPRPs, all of which fell between $2.75 million and $3 million. See id.\n\nat 191.   Interestingly, the court also noted that the government\n\ndemanded $8.25 million from the State of New Jersey, BFI and Ashland,\n\naveraging to a total of $2.75 million each, though Ashland \"was\n\nexpected to pay a larger share because EPA determined that Ashland\n\nproduced a high volume of hazardous waste and that a significant amount\n\nof evidence existed linking Ashland to the Davis site.\" Id. at 191\n\nn.7. Finally, the court noted \"an even closer correlation between the\n\namounts paid by settling 'non-carve-out' PRP's and the amounts demanded\n\nfrom non-settling 'non-carve-out' PRP's\" -- $13.5 million demanded of\n\neighty-five non-carve-out PRPs, averaging $158,800 apiece, compared\n\nwith the $7.2 million proposed settlement with forty-seven non-carve-\n\nout PRPs, amounting to $152,200 each. Id. at 191. The court also\n\npointed out that the allocation assessed to UTC was a considerably\n\ngreater financial obligation than that imposed on any non-settling\n\ncarve-out party.    See id.\n\n           In addition, the ultimate measure of accountability \"is the\n\nextent of the overall recovery, not the amount of money paid by any\n\n                                - 30 -\n\findividual defendant.\" Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1086. Accordingly,\n\na consent decree need not specify each generator's or transporter's\n\ndegree of culpability. It is appropriate for classes of PRPs to be\n\nassigned aggregate settlement amounts to allocate among themselves.\n\nSee id.   In Charles George we said: \"Realistically, a government\n\nagency, in the midst of negotiations, is in no position to put so fine\n\na point on accountability. We, therefore, endorse, in general, EPA's\n\npractice of negotiating with a representative group of PRPs and then\n\npermitting the group members to divide the burden of the settlement\n\namong themselves.\"    Id.\n\n          Ashland's challenge to the group allocations in these\n\nsettlements is meritless. Our prior observation remains pertinent:\n\n\"[A]s is true of consent decrees generally, they are built upon\n\ncompromise and compromise in turn is a product of judgment.\"\n\nComunidades Unidas, 204 F.3d at 282.      We agree with the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that a \"rational\" method of allocating liability was\n\n\"evenhandedly\" applied.     Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 192.\n\n          4. Reasonableness\n\n          In considering the reasonableness of Consent Decree I, the\n\ndistrict court addressed the novel issue of whether the public can be\n\nadequately compensated by a settlement in which the United States\n\nreceives only a portion of the remediation cost from a party previously\n\nadjudged liable for the entire cost. See Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n\n                                - 31 -\n\f186. Arguing that adequate compensation is not possible under such\n\ncircumstances, Ashland asserts that the consent decrees do not comport\n\nwith the objectives of CERCLA.\n\n          The assessment of reasonableness focuses on several elements:\n\nthe effectiveness of the decree as a vehicle for cleaning the\n\nenvironment; providing satisfactory public compensation for actual (and\n\nanticipated) costs of remediation; and accounting for the relative\n\nstrength of the parties' litigating positions and foreseeable risks of\n\nloss. See Cannons, 899 F.2d at 89-90. In making these assessments, a\n\ncourt must once again allow for the agency's lack of \"mathematical\n\nprecision,\" as long as the figures derive from a plausible\n\ninterpretation of the record. Id. at 90. Furthermore, effective\n\nremediation demands a more pragmatic meaning than whether the\n\nsettlement meets a scientific ideal or approximates the projected costs\n\nof cleanup. See Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1085; United States v.\n\nCharter Int'l Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718190\"><a href=\"/opinion/718190/united-states-v-charter-international-oil-company-acushnet-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 521 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A district\n\ncourt's reasonableness inquiry, like that of fairness, is a pragmatic\n\none.\"); Comunidades Unidas, 204 F.3d at 281.\n\n          Although the UTC allocation in Consent Decree I does not pay\n\nfor the entire expense of the cleanup, UTC assumed the full cost of\n\nsoil remediation (mitigated by contribution from later settlors), even\n\nif that estimated cost ultimately exceeds projections. Furthermore,\n\nthe consent decrees staved off litigation risks associated with the\n\n\n                                - 32 -\n\fsettling parties, including a possible appeal by UTC of the judgment\n\nagainst it. See Davis II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 192. In addition, as the\n\ndistrict court observed, \"fundamental fairness prohibits the imposition\n\nof liability that is totally disproportionate to UTC's share of\n\nresponsibility.\"    Id. at 193.\n\n          Discounts on maximum potential liability as an incentive to\n\nsettle are considered fair and reasonable under Congress's statutory\n\nscheme.   See DiBiase, 45 F.3d at 546; see also Interim CERCLA\n\nSettlement Policy, Environmental Protection Agency, 50 F.R. 5034\n\n(February 5, 1985). A PRP's assumption of open-ended risks, such as\n\nthe full cost of a component of the cleanup, may merit a discount. See\n\nCannons, 899 F.2d at 88. Also, party-specific discounts may reflect\n\nthe chances of the United States's success in litigation against a\n\ngiven PRP. See id. It is appropriate \"to factor into the equation any\n\nreasonable discounts for litigation risks, time savings, and the like\n\nthat may be justified.\"     Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1087.\n\n          The United States received a significant sum from the initial\n\nsettlors, Consent Decree I settlors and contributions from settlors in\n\nConsent Decrees II-IV and Capuano. Indeed, the United States fulfilled\n\n60 percent of its $55 million claim through the consent decrees,\n\nincluding the earlier $5.625 million settlement with Clairol and other\n\nparties. The United States also retains the option of pursuing future\n\ncost-recovery actions against other non-settling PRPs. In light of the\n\n\n                                - 33 -\n\frole of the consent decrees in expediting the remediation work, the\n\nsubstantial cost recovery by the United States, and the strength of the\n\ncases against the various PRPs, we agree with the district court that\n\nthe consent decrees met the test of reasonableness.\n\n          5. Statutory Fidelity\n\n          The purposes of CERCLA include expeditious remediation at\n\nwaste sites, adequate compensation to the public fisc and the\n\nimposition of accountability. \"[I]t would disserve a principal end of\n\nthe statute -- achievement of prompt settlement and a concomitant head\n\nstart on response activities -- to leave matters in limbo until more\n\nprecise information [is] amassed.\" Cannons, 899 F.2d at 88; see also\n\nDiBiase, 45 F.3d at 545 (\"[S]ettlements reduce excessive litigation\n\nexpenses and transaction costs, thereby preserving scarce resources for\n\nCERCLA's real goal: the expeditious cleanup of hazardous waste\n\nsites.\"). Additionally, there is a \"strong public policy in favor of\n\nsettlements, particularly in very complex and technical regulatory\n\ncontexts.\" Comunidades Unidas, 204 F.3d at 280. Importantly, even\n\nthough it was not obligated to do so, UTC began the process of remedial\n\nsoil treatment in July 1997, well before the approval of Consent Decree\n\nI. This task included: excavation, removal and proper disposal of more\n\nthan 1,000 drums of waste and 10,000 small jars, containers and vials;\n\nremoval of more than 750,000 tires; and sampling and chemical analysis\n\nof over 65,000 cubic yards of soil. This head-start on repair of a\n\n\n                                - 34 -\n\fhazardous waste site is the sort of good-faith cooperation that CERCLA\n\nseeks to encourage via settlement. To find this progress inadequate\n\nwould frustrate the statute's purpose.\n\n          In asserting that the consent decrees are not faithful to the\n\npurposes of CERCLA, Ashland focuses on the contribution protection\n\nafforded the parties to the consent decrees, fearing that a handful of\n\nnon-settlors (i.e., Ashland and the other appellants), foreclosed from\n\ncontribution actions because they did not join the consent decrees,\n\ncould be held liable for a disproportionate share of the $21.7 million\n\nin as-yet unrecovered costs if the United States pursued them in cost\n\nrecovery actions. CERCLA provides that \"[a] person who has resolved\n\nits liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or\n\njudicially approved settlement shall not be liable for claims for\n\ncontribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement.\" 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 9613(f)(2); see also 42 U.S.C § 9622(f)(2). Despite this \"matters\n\naddressed in the settlement\" language of the statute, Ashland says that\n\nthe \"matters addressed\" language of the decrees here is overreaching\n\nbecause they include, quoting the consent decrees, \"response costs\n\nincurred and to be incurred by any person or entity other than the\n\nUnited States for response actions related to the site or identified in\n\nthe remedy.\" Ashland complains that, \"[a]s written, the 'matters\n\naddressed' provision of three partial consent decrees have been\n\nexpanded to include all costs, whether the costs are incurred by the\n\n\n                                - 35 -\n\fU.S. or by a private party.    This is clearly impermissible under\n\nCERCLA.\" Facing exposure to performance of the groundwater remedy,\n\nwhich may represent 40 percent of the total site costs, Ashland worries\n\nthat parties like itself will bear disproportionate liability because\n\nthey are unfairly barred from seeking contribution from earlier-\n\nsettling parties.\n\n          The practice of encouraging early settlements by providing\n\nbroad contribution protection is provided by statute. 42 U.S.C. §\n\n9613(f)(2); see also Charter, 83 F.3d at 522; UTC v. Browning-Ferris\n\nInd., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676987\"><a href=\"/opinion/676987/united-technologies-corporation-v-browning-ferris-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"This paradigm is not a\n\nscrivener's accident.\"). CERCLA also seeks to induce settlements at\n\nhigher amounts by allowing settlors to seek contribution from those who\n\nhave not yet settled. See 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(3)(B); Charter, 83 F.3d\n\nat 522. Still, EPA policy encourages the court reviewing a consent\n\ndecree incorporating contribution protection to seek \"a demonstration\n\nthat this result is fair to potential contribution plaintiffs whose\n\nrights would be extinguished.\" DOJ/EPA Memorandum, Defining \"Matters\n\nAddressed\" in CERCLA Settlements, March 14, 1997. In a case such as\n\nthis, where UTC assumes an open-ended cost for soil remediation, and\n\ntakes the lead in coordinating settlements and beginning the cleanup\n\neffort, the benefit of contribution protection is appropriate. Also,\n\nas UTC points out in its brief, Ashland's preoccupation with the\n\npotential of disproportionate liability \"ignores the fact that UTC,\n\n\n                                - 36 -\n\fwhich was allocated responsibility for 1.54 percent of the liability by\n\nthe trial court, will perform the source control remedy, which will\n\namount to over one-fourth of the total costs of remediating the site.\"\n\nUTC draws from this fact an appropriate conclusion: \"This comparison\n\nshows that CERCLA can impose harsh results on PRPs; it also shows that\n\nthese contribution defendants [Ashland and other non-settlors] may bear\n\na burden roughly comparable to that of UTC.\"\n\n          The point we made in an earlier decision remains apt: \"As\n\nto the extinguished contribution claims of non-settlors or later round\n\nsettlors, protection against those claims was a reasonable benefit [the\n\nsettlor] acquired in exchange for settling before those others.\"\n\nCharter, 83 F.3d at 522. The result of non-settlors possibly bearing\n\ndisproportionate liability for the open-ended cost of remediation is\n\ntherefore consistent with the statute's paradigm, which encourages the\n\nfinality of early settlement.      See Browning-Ferris, 33 F.3d at 103.\n\n          6. Unconstitutional Taking\n\n          To the extent that CERCLA authorizes the contribution\n\nprotection to which Ashland objects, Ashland asserts that this\n\nprotection could result in an unconstitutional taking of the\n\nprotectable property interests of non-settling parties because they\n\nwill be prohibited from seeking contribution from earlier-settling\n\nparties. Indeed, Ashland points out, CERCLA recognizes that in a\n\nsettlement \"limiting any person's right to obtain contribution from any\n\n\n                                - 37 -\n\fparty,\" the result could be \"a taking without just compensation\" under\n\nthe Fifth Amendment.     42 U.S.C. § 9657.\n\n          Ashland's argument in support of this takings claim is so\n\nperfunctorily developed that we deem it unworthy of response.

The District Court's Declaratory Judgment Ruling\n\n          The district court found that UTC had unquestionably proven\n\nthat the Davis site was a hazardous waste facility, that a release of\n\nhazardous waste had occurred, and that this release caused the\n\nincurrence of response costs because of the necessary cleanup. The\n\n\n\n     20 The National Contingency Plan promulgated by the EPA, 40 C.F.R.\npt. 300 (1988), \"establish[es] procedures and standards for responding\nto releases of hazardous substances.\" Because the district court\nreserved challenges to UTC's specific expenditures for later\nproceedings, the compliance of UTC's cleanup plan with the National\nContingency Plan is not at issue in this case.\n\n                                - 40 -\n\fcourt thus focused on the only remaining issue for CERCLA liability:\n\n\"[W]hether the defendants are liable for those response costs on the\n\ngrounds that they either operated the facility, transported the\n\nhazardous substances to the site, or arranged for the hazardous\n\nsubstances to be disposed of at the Site.\" Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n61. Since each of the appellants was found to be an arranger, we focus\n\non that aspect of the court's ruling.\n\n          The court began by considering the evidence that CWR, the\n\nBridgeport, Connecticut waste transport company used by Ashland, Acco,\n\nGar, and PE, disposed of waste at the Davis site. The court found that\n\nin 1977, \"all of CWR's waste was taken, initially, to Sanitary\n\nLandfill,\" another Rhode Island disposal site, but that sometime after\n\nMay 1977, Anthony and Jack Capuano, owners of Sanitary Landfill, began\n\ndiverting some of CWR's waste to the Davis site. Id. at 53. Based on\n\nreceipts kept by William Davis and offered into evidence by UTC, the\n\ncourt found that \"the Capuanos directed CWR drivers to the Davis Site\n\non fifteen separate occasions.\" Id. The Davis receipts show that\n\nthese CWR deliveries took place between May 13 and July 7.21\n\n          The court said that CWR had two drivers, Wilbert Jones and\n\nJohnny Granfield, who collected 55-gallon drums of waste from\n\n\n     21Davis testified that dumping occurred on his property between\n1976 and the first part of 1977. However, he was only able to locate\nreceipts for the period between January 10, 1977 and July 7, 1977. As\na result, that is the time period relevant to the district court's\nfindings.\n\n                               - 41 -\n\fcustomers. Both Jones and Granfield sometimes drove a 40-foot flatbed\n\ntruck that carried a full load of 79 drums and was \"used to haul drums\n\nto Rhode Island.\" Id. at 52-53. Based on the testimony of Jones and\n\nof Emanuel and Michael Musillo, the principals of CWR, the court made\n\nfindings about CWR's pickup and disposal practices:\n\n          If a full load was collected early in the day,\n          the drums, sometimes, would be taken directly to\n          Sanitary Landfill. Usually, however, the truck\n          would return to CWR, and the load of drums would\n          be taken to Sanitary Landfill on the following\n          day. If less than a full load was collected, the\n          drums would be kept at CWR until seventy-nine\n          drums had accumulated. Those drums then would be\n          loaded onto the flatbed and driven to Sanitary\n          Landfill.\n\n          Drums were collected with such regularity that\n          they never remained on CWR's premises for more\n          than three days.\n\nId. at 53.\n\n          Following the theory that CWR disposed of waste within three\n\ndays of collecting it from a customer, the district court matched the\n\ndates of CWR waste pickups from appellants Ashland, Acco, Gar, and PE\n\nto the dates of waste deliveries to the Davis site. CWR kept bills of\n\nlading that recorded the dates on which it picked up wastes from\n\ncustomers. Some of the appellants kept parallel invoices. William\n\nDavis's receipts included the dates of waste deliveries. Based on this\n\nevidence, the district court determined when an arranger's waste was\n\npicked up within three days of a delivery to the Davis site. The court\n\nthen concluded that it was \"reasonable to infer\" that this waste was in\n\n                                - 42 -\n\ffact disposed of at the Davis site. Id. at 56. For example, the court\n\nheld Ashland liable for a 79-drum load that CWR picked up from Ashland\n\non June 1, 1977 because a Davis receipt showed that CWR driver Wilbert\n\nJones delivered 79 drums to Davis on June 2.        Id.\n\n          The court next turned to allegations that transporter CCC,\n\nthe company used by Morton, disposed of waste at the Davis site. The\n\ncourt found that CCC made 47 trips to the Davis site between May 1977\n\nand the first week of July and that Morton's waste was included in some\n\nof those deliveries.     Id. at 55.\n\n          Finally, the district court allocated responsibility for\n\ncleanup costs that UTC had incurred or would incur in completing the\n\nsoil remediation. The chief factor in the court's determination was\n\nthe volume of waste disposed at the Davis site that could be attributed\n\nto each defendant based on the evidence about specific deliveries.\n\nDavis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 64. For example, the court found that CWR\n\nmade two 79-drum deliveries containing 8,690 gallons of Ashland's waste\n\nto the Davis site, and so allocated to Ashland a share of\n\nresponsibility for cleanup costs based on that volume. Id. at 67.\n\nBased on its calculations of waste volume, the court allocated 1.03\n\npercent of UTC's future cleanup costs to Ashland, .16 percent to Acco,\n\n.03 percent to Gar, and .57 percent to PE. Id. at 69. The court also\n\nallocated 1.54 percent of responsibility to UTC. Id. Because the\n\ncourt found no evidence of specific deliveries yielding data about the\n\n\n                                - 43 -\n\fvolume of Morton waste disposed, it did not allocate a share of future\n\ncleanup costs to Morton.     Id. at 65.\n\nC. The Parties' Challenges to the Declaratory Judgment\n\n          1.

Hollingsworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529277\"><a href=\"/opinion/529277/applewood-landscape-nursery-co-inc-v-wayne-b-hollingsworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1503 (1st Cir. 1989). With\n\nthose standards in mind, we address each party's claims separately.\n\n                  a. Ashland\n\n          In 1977, Ashland operated a chemical manufacturing plant in\n\n                               - 44 -\n\fGreat Meadows, New Jersey, generating waste that contained nitrating\n\nacid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and solvents composed of isopropyl\n\nalcohol, methyl alcohol, toluene, benzene, and xylene.           It is\n\nundisputed that Ashland contracted with CWR to dispose of this waste,\n\nand the record supports the district court's finding that CWR\n\ntransported waste to the Davis site. While Michael Musillo of CWR\n\ntestified that between 1975 and 1977 the company took all of its waste\n\ninitially to the Sanitary Landfill owned by the Capuanos, Jack Capuano\n\ntestified that after April 1977, when the landfill began getting\n\ncomplaints about odor, his brother Anthony Capuano began diverting some\n\nof CWR's waste to the Davis site.\n\n          CWR's pickup slips and billing records, as well as Ashland's\n\ndisposal logs, show that during May and June of 1977, CWR picked up\n\nthirteen tanker loads and four flatbed loads from Ashland. Each of the\n\nflatbed loads contained 79 55-gallon drums. One of the flatbed pickups\n\ntook place on June 1 and another occurred on June 30. Davis receipts\n\nbearing the name \"Capuano,\" signed by Wilbert Jones, and recording 79-\n\ndrum loads, show that CWR deliveries were diverted from Sanitary\n\nLandfill to the Davis site on June 2 and July 5. Based on its theory\n\nthat CWR delivered its waste within three days of accumulating a full\n\nflatbed load, and the explanation that the intervening weekend and July\n\n4th holiday accounted for the five-day gap between June 30 and July 5,\n\nthe district court found Ashland liable for the waste that CWR\n\n\n                                - 45 -\n\fdelivered to the Davis site on June 2 and July 5.\n\n          There is evidence in the record to support the court's\n\nconclusion. Emanuel Musillo, principal of CWR, testified that when a\n\ndriver picked up a full 79-drum load early in the day, he would go\n\nstraight to Rhode Island to dispose of it. When a driver picked up a\n\nfull load late in the day or picked up only a partial load, he would\n\npark the load at CWR overnight. The next day the driver would either\n\ncontinue to Rhode Island if the truck was full, or collect waste from\n\nanother customer if it was not. While Musillo did not definitively\n\ntestify that CWR always delivered waste within three days of collecting\n\nit, he said that when a driver accumulated a full 79-drum load, the\n\ndrums would be taken to Rhode Island \"within a few days, I would\n\nimagine.\" CWR driver Wilbert Jones also testified that after picking\n\nup a complete load, he would leave it at CWR overnight and then leave\n\nfor Rhode Island early the next morning.\n\n          Ashland challenges the court's factual findings on several\n\ngrounds.22 Ashland begins by pointing out that UTC presented no direct\n\nevidence, such as drums or other containers bearing Ashland's name and\n\n\n\n     22Ashland titles the section of its brief challenging the district\ncourt's factual findings \"As a Matter of Law, Ashland Could not Be\nFound Liable.\"      This attempt to win de novo review fails.\n\"[A]ppellant's plaint boils down to little more than thinly veiled\ndissatisfaction with the district court's factual findings.\" Dedham\nWater, 972 F.2d at 460. Ashland's alternate theories about why the\ncourt should have made other findings and inferences are factual rather\nthan legal theories and so are subject to the clear error standard.\n\n                                - 46 -\n\ffound at the Davis site, to show that Ashland's waste was on the CWR\n\ndeliveries to the Davis site.     While Ashland is correct, direct\n\nevidence is not a prerequisite to proving the elements of liability in\n\na contribution action. See 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f) (setting forth elements\n\nof liability).\n\n          To attack the district court's finding that CWR disposed of\n\nwaste within three days of collecting it, Ashland offers alternative\n\nscenarios.   Ashland's most plausible theory is based on Jones's\n\ntestimony that the Musillos sometimes \"offloaded\" nonflammable liquid\n\nwaste by pouring it from drums into a tanker truck or underground\n\nstorage facility at CWR.23 Ashland argues that its waste thus was\n\nlikely unloaded at CWR's Bridgeport site after pickup and either mixed\n\nwith other waste or stored there for an indefinite period.\n\n          Additional testimony by Jones and the Musillos calls this\n\ntheory into question. Jones was asked this question: \"[L]et's suppose\n\nthat you brought back some drums from one or more customers to\n\nBridgeport, and that you offloaded those drums. Let's say it wasn't a\n\nfull load. Typically, how long would it take before those offloaded\n\n\n\n     23 Jones said in response to a question about whether CWR mixed\nwaste collected at different times: \"Things, anything that could be\nmixed and wouldn't explode, catch a fire, put it in the tanker. Then\nwhen the tanker is full take it to Rhode Island.\" Jones also said \"if\nthere was, let's say, an overflow of drums, there were more pickups to\nbe made, and we couldn't handle it because the truck was full, and they\nhad to be made, we would take them off, put them in the warehouse until\nwe get a trip to go up to Rhode Island.\"\n\n                                - 47 -\n\fdrums would find their way to Rhode Island to be dumped?\" Jones\n\nanswered: \"No more than three days.\"       Jones also said that the\n\nMusillos, not he, did most of the mixing work.        Emanuel Musillo\n\ntestified that offloading was not CWR's normal practice because of the\n\n\"double work\" involved. He said that when drums were offloaded, they\n\nusually contained waste oil that CWR could resell. Musillo also said\n\nthat occasionally other kinds of waste were stored at CWR, but only\n\nuntil the next delivery trip to Rhode Island.        Michael Musillo\n\ncorroborated aspects of his brother's account.\n\n          In light of this testimony, the district court did not err\n\nin finding that it was more likely than not that the waste CWR\n\ncollected from Ashland on June 1 and June 30 was the waste the\n\ntransporter delivered to the Davis site on June 2 and July 5. Since\n\nboth pickups from Ashland were full 79-drum loads, it seems\n\nparticularly unlikely that CWR drivers would have taken a full load off\n\nthe flatbed truck on one day, only to deliver a full load of different\n\ndrums to the Davis site on the next business day.           Ashland's\n\nalternative scenarios are simply \"competing inferences\" that the\n\ndistrict court chose not to draw. Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457. Such\n\na choice cannot be clear error.\n\n          Ashland's other alternative scenarios also run afoul of the\n\nclear error standard. First, Ashland argues that CWR often kept waste\n\nat its Bridgeport facility for unspecified periods, making it unlikely\n\n\n                                - 48 -\n\fthat the transporter delivered Ashland's waste to the Davis site within\n\nthree days of collecting it. Ashland cites evidence that 13,000 drums\n\nof waste were stockpiled at CWR in the fall of 1977. However, since\n\nEmanuel Musillo testified that stockpiling did not begin until CWR's\n\ndisposal sites were shut down after the summer of 1977, the evidence on\n\nthis point does not undermine the district court's findings. Second,\n\nAshland argues that the June 2 and July 5 disposals that CWR made at\n\nDavis likely contained waste generated by an unknown source that CWR\n\npicked up from an unidentified parking lot in the New Jersey\n\nMeadowlands. While Jones testified that he picked up drum loads of\n\nwaste from a parking lot somewhere in the Meadowlands not \"more than\n\neight or ten times\" during 1977, he did not remember the dates of those\n\npickups. His testimony thus lacks the specifics necessary to link the\n\nMeadowlands pickups to the June 2 and July 5 deliveries to the Davis\n\nsite. Finally, Ashland argues that the June 2 and July 5 disposals\n\ncontained waste that CWR picked up from CCC customers. There is no\n\nevidence to show that CWR picked up waste for CCC during the relevant\n\ntime period.24\n\n\n     24  Ashland and PE also argue that the district court's finding\nthat CWR had an established practice of delivering waste within three\ndays of collecting it conflicts with United States v. Newman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597414\"><a href=\"/opinion/597414/united-states-v-michael-j-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1992). However, Newman is inapposite to the case at\nhand. In that case, we held that a trial judge did not abuse his\ndiscretion by excluding material habit evidence under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 406 when that evidence \"did not require the conclusion that\nthe putative practice was followed with the necessary regularity.\" Id.\nat 669 (emphasis added). Newman thus concerns the standards for the\n\n                                - 49 -\n\f          In short, while the testimony by Jones and the Musillos\n\ncontains some minor ambiguities, the district court did not err by\n\ninferring that CWR regularly disposed of waste within three days of\n\ncollecting it, or by inferring that CWR transported Ashland's waste to\n\nthe Davis site on June 2 and July 5.25\n\n                  b. Acco-Bristol\n\n\nadmission of habit or routine practice. Here, by contrast, the\ntestimony from the Musillos and Jones was admitted without objection by\nthe appellants, who now argue that this evidence is not sufficient to\nestablish CWR's pickup and delivery practices. This argument fails.\nOnce routine practice evidence has been admitted, Rule 406 does not\nlimit the district court's consideration of such evidence, or the\nweight that it may be given.\n\n     25Ashlandalso mounts a misnomer defense, arguing that UTC did not\nname the proper party in its pleadings when it sued \"Ashland Chemical\nInc.\" rather than \"Ashland Chemical Co.\" According to stipulations of\nfact by the parties, Ashland Chemical Inc. was incorporated in 1989 and\nmerged into Ashland Oil Inc. in 1993. In 1996, Ashland Oil Inc.\nchanged its name to Ashland Inc. Ashland Chemical Co., which operated\nthe Great Meadows, New Jersey facility from which CWR transported\nhazardous waste, was a division of Ashland Oil Inc. in 1977. While\nAshland Chemical Inc. may technically be an inaccurate reference to\nAshland Chemical Co., there is no question that Ashland received\nadequate notice that it was being sued, and that it owned the Great\nMeadows facility from which the liability at issue here stemmed.

As a result, we reject Ashland's misnomer\ndefense.\n\n                                - 50 -\n\f           Acco-Bristol Division of Babcock Industries maintained a\n\nmanufacturing facility in Waterbury, Connecticut in 1977.         This\n\nfacility produced controls for oil and gas lines through processes\n\ninvolving electroplating, soldering, welding, and degreasing machine\n\nparts. Wastes produced by Acco included 1,1,1-TCA, a soap and cyanide\n\nwaste stream, and acid sludge. Acco typically put the waste in 55-\n\ngallon drums for disposal.\n\n           CWR twice picked up waste from Acco during the spring and\n\nsummer of 1977, collecting 50 drums on April 6 26 and 24 drums on June\n\n28. On June 29, CWR received a check in the amount of $324 for these\n\npickups.   A \"Capuano Dumping Charge Slip,\" also dated June 29,\n\nindicates that CWR delivered a full load of 79 drums to the Davis site.\n\nThe evidence at trial indicated that drivers directed to the Davis site\n\nby the Capuanos at Sanitary Landfill sometimes presented Capuano\n\ndumping receipts to William Davis. Davis testified that he used these\n\nslips to verify the amount of waste dumped on his property and to help\n\nhim prepare invoices for Sanitary Landfill. In keeping with this\n\npractice, Davis sent a bill to Sanitary Landfill on June 29 for 79\n\ngallons of waste.\n\n           Based on this evidence, the district court inferred that the\n\n24 drums of Acco waste went to the Davis site in CWR's shipment on June\n\n\n     26 The district court declined to infer that the shipment picked\nup by CWR on April 6 went to the Davis site because there were no Davis\nslips within three days of that date.\n\n                                - 51 -\n\f29. We cannot conclude that this determination is clearly erroneous.\n\nAcco points out that on June 27 and 28, CWR picked up 99 drums of waste\n\nfrom various customers -- 20 drums more than were dumped at the Davis\n\nsite.   However, at least 17 of those drums were picked up from\n\ncustomers who frequently disposed of waste oils. Because CWR tended to\n\nsell waste oil to salvagers, as we have noted, the district court's\n\nconclusion that the 24 drums of Acco's waste were part of the 79 drums\n\nsent to the Davis site on June 29 was reasonable.\n\n          Acco argues that the district court erred in relying on the\n\nCapuano slip to infer the presence of Acco's waste at the Davis site\n\nbecause the slip does not specify a transporter. Specifically, Acco\n\nclaims that CCC or another waste company, rather than CWR, Acco's only\n\ntransporter, could have brought the waste delivered on June 29.\n\nHowever, testimony at trial makes clear that by June 1977, CCC was\n\ndumping waste directly at the Davis site without stopping at Sanitary\n\nLandfill first.   Thus, it is not likely that the June 29 Capuano\n\nDumping Charge Slip accounted for waste hauled by CCC. As a result, we\n\ncannot say that the district court's findings that the Capuano slip\n\nreferred to waste dumped by CWR, and that Acco's waste was part of that\n\ndelivery, was clearly erroneous.      See Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 463.\n\n                  c. Black & Decker a/k/a Gar\n\n          Gar operated an electroplating business in Danbury,\n\nConnecticut. Its waste contained nitric acid, copper, nickel, and\n\n\n                                - 52 -\n\fcyanide. According to CWR records, the transporter picked up five\n\nloads of waste from Gar on May 6 (13 drums), June 20 (5 drums), June 27\n\n(2 drums), September 2 (7 drums), and September 30 (11 drums). A Davis\n\nreceipt shows that on June 21, the day after the five-drum pickup, CWR\n\ndisposed of 60 drums of waste at the Davis site.       The five drums\n\ncollected on June 20 contained 275 gallons of waste. Based on this\n\nevidence, the district court found Gar liable for dumping 275 gallons\n\nof waste at the Davis site.\n\n          Gar poses two challenges to the court's factual findings.27\n\nIt notes that CWR picked up more than 300 drums28 from Connecticut and\n\nNew Jersey customers on the three business days before June 21, and\n\nconcludes that in light of those pickups it is not mathematically\n\nlikely that Gar's five drums were among the 60 drums that CWR delivered\n\nto Davis on June 21. Admittedly, the collection of more than 300 drums\n\nin the days leading up to the June 21 delivery to Davis means that it\n\nis less likely that Gar's five drums were among those delivered than it\n\nis, for example, that the 79 drums picked up from Ashland on June 1\n\nwere the 79 drums delivered to the Davis site on June 2.\n\n\n     27Gar also argues, like Ashland, that there was no direct evidence\nthat its waste ended up at Davis, and that CWR regularly offloaded its\ncustomers' waste at its property for unspecified periods of time and\nalso mixed different customers' waste at its Bridgeport facility.\nThese arguments fail for the same reasons discussed above.\n     28Gar says that CWR picked up 352 drums on the three business days\nbefore the June 21 delivery. UTC counts 326 drums and 13 smaller\ncontainers collected between June 17 and June 22.\n\n                                - 53 -\n\f          Nonetheless, the evidence that Gar emphasizes does not lead\n\nus to conclude that the district court's findings were clear error. As\n\nUTC points out, the Davis receipts show that CWR delivered a total of\n\n219 drums to the Davis site on June 21, June 22, and June 23,\n\nincreasing the likelihood that Gar's five drums were among those\n\ndelivered. In addition, 62 of the 300-plus drums collected on the\n\npreceding days came from customers that sent waste oil to CWR, and so,\n\naccording to Emanuel Musillo's testimony, would likely have been\n\noffloaded and stored for resale rather than being delivered to the\n\nDavis site.\n\n          To cast further doubt on the district court's findings, Gar\n\npoints out that the Davis slip from June 21 says \"SOLIDS\" for solid\n\nwaste, and that Gar produced liquid waste. Davis's testimony at trial\n\nundermines the significance of the solids designation. Davis said that\n\nhe distinguished between solid and liquid waste because he poured\n\nliquid waste out of the barrels and resold them. Because he could not\n\nresell the barrels containing solids, he charged more for solid waste\n\n(one dollar per barrel) than he did for liquid waste (50 cents per\n\nbarrel). Davis therefore had a financial incentive to classify drums\n\nof waste as solid rather than liquid. Davis also testified that he\n\nconsidered anything \"solid\" that did not pour easily, including any\n\nsludge or residue left in the drums. Also, there is no evidence that\n\nDavis examined each barrel before classifying a shipment.\n\n\n                               - 54 -\n\f             Finally, Gar notes that while the evidence shows that CWR\n\ndriver Johnny Granfield made the June 21 delivery to the Davis site,\n\nthere is no evidence concerning which CWR driver picked up Gar's waste\n\non June 20. This matters because each CWR driver only drove waste to\n\nthe Davis site that he himself collected. Thus Gar argues that the\n\npossibility that Wilbert Jones, the other CWR driver, picked up its\n\nwaste on June 20 lessens the likelihood that its waste was among the 60\n\ndrums delivered to the Davis site on June 21. However, since there is\n\nno evidence to show that Granfield was not the driver who collected\n\nGar's waste on June 20, and since the evidence did establish that the\n\ndriver who delivered waste to the Davis site had picked it up, the\n\ndistrict court could have inferred that Granfield collected the waste\n\nfrom Gar, and that this waste was on his truck when he made the June 21\n\ndelivery to Davis.\n\n                    d. Perkin-Elmer\n\n             PE operated four Connecticut facilities in 1977, at which it\n\ngenerated waste that included methylene chloride, 1,1,1-TCA, and\n\ntoluene.29    PE acknowledges that these hazardous substances were\n\nidentified at the Davis site.\n\n\n     29 PE operated facilities at four locations: (1) a primary\nmanufacturing facility in Norwalk; (2) a research facility at 50\nDanbury Road in Wilton; (3) a manufacturing and research facility at 77\nDanbury Road in Wilton; and (4) and Qualitron Corporation's\nmanufacturing facility in Danbury. Qualitron became a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of PE in May 1984. PE does not contest its responsibility\nfor Qualitron's environmental liability in this case.\n\n                                  - 55 -\n\f          PE's records show that CWR picked up waste from one of PE's\n\nfacilities seven times during the spring and early summer of 1977: on\n\nMay 26, June 20, June 22 (from three facilities), June 27, and July 1.\n\nDavis slips indicated that CWR delivered drums to the site on May 27,\n\nJune 21, June 23, June 29, and July 5, 6, and 7. Based on the theory\n\nthat CWR delivered waste within three days of collecting it, the\n\ndistrict court inferred that the PE pickup on May 26 was dumped at the\n\nDavis site on May 27; the pickup on June 20 was dumped on June 21; the\n\npickups on June 22 were dumped on June 23; the pickup on June 27 was\n\ndumped on June 29; and the pickup on July 1 was dumped on July 5, 6, or\n\n7.\n\n          PE objects to the district court's finding of liability on\n\nnumerous grounds.    First, it argues that the court erred in not\n\n\"locating and identifying\" PE's waste at the Davis site. As PE notes,\n\nthe district court said in articulating the proof required by CERCLA:\n\n\"In the context of this case, proof that a defendant generator's\n\nhazardous waste 'can be located and identified at the Davis Site' is a\n\nsina qua non in establishing arranger liability.\" Davis IV, 31 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 61 (quoting Davis I, 882 F. Supp. at 1221). PE argues\n\nunpersuasively that the district court intended with this language to\n\ncreate a new and higher standard of liability under CERCLA, requiring\n\nthat UTC establish waste deposits with direct evidence such as\n\ncontainers bearing PE's name and containing residue of a hazardous\n\n\n                                - 56 -\n\fwaste PE generated. We have already rejected an interpretation of\n\nCERCLA that \"would cast the plaintiff in the impossible role of tracing\n\nchemical waste to particular sources in particular amounts, a task that\n\nis often technologically infeasible due to the fluctuating quantity and\n\nvaried nature of the pollution at a site over the course of many\n\nyears.\"   Acushnet, 191 F.3d at 76.\n\n          PE also points out that the number of drums of waste picked\n\nup by CWR in any three-day period before PE's waste was allegedly\n\ndelivered to the Davis site is not the same as the number of drums\n\nnoted on the Davis slip for that day. However, as we have discussed\n\nabove, some of those drums from other customers contained waste oil\n\nwhich CWR often salvaged and so likely would not have delivered to the\n\nDavis site. Thus, the discrepancy between the number of barrels picked\n\nup and delivered by CWR does not undermine the court's conclusion that\n\nPE's waste went to the Davis site.\n\n          PE also argues that its waste was not dumped at the Davis\n\nsite because it produced only liquid waste, and all of the Davis slips\n\nlinking its waste to the site indicated that the barrels dumped by CWR\n\ncontained solid waste. PE's contention that it only produced liquid\n\nwaste is contradicted by evidence in the record. Joseph Rabideau,\n\ndesignated by PE to testify on behalf of the corporation, testified\n\nthat CWR disposed of waste for PE that included \"a solidified scrape\n\noff type material\" and that waste picked up by CWR in open-top five\n\n\n                                - 57 -\n\fgallon pails was \"solidified material.\" Rabideau also explained that\n\nPE's use of methylene chloride as a solvent produced \"still bottoms\"\n\nthat were disposed of \"in a fairly solidified form.\" PE also produced\n\na semi-solid paint residue sludge as part of its paint operation.\n\n           Moreover, as we have discussed, Davis's testimony at trial\n\ndemonstrated that his classification of waste as solid or liquid was\n\nnot an exact process. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in\n\nconcluding that waste classified as a liquid by PE might nonetheless be\n\nconsidered a solid by Davis if the barrel contained any residue that\n\ncould not be easily poured. Based on this evidence, it was not clear\n\nerror for the district court to conclude that Davis could have\n\ncharacterized a shipment of 79 barrels as \"solid\" even though some --\n\nor even most -- of the drums he did not examine actually contained\n\nliquids.\n\n           In sum, all of PE's objections to the district court's\n\nfinding of liability are essentially disputes about the court's finding\n\nof the facts and the inferences drawn from CWR's established waste\n\npractices. We must uphold these findings and inferences unless they\n\nare clearly erroneous. See Dedham, 972 F.2d at 457. For the reasons\n\nwe have explained, evidence in the record amply supports the district\n\ncourt's determinations.\n\n           2. Wilbert Jones's Testimony\n\n           Acco, Ashland, Gar, and Perkin-Elmer all argue that the\n\n\n                                - 58 -\n\fdistrict court erred in admitting and crediting the deposition\n\ntestimony of Wilbert Jones, one of the two drivers who hauled waste for\n\nCWR. At the time of his deposition in June 1996, Jones was unemployed\n\nand very ill. He died in May 1997. UTC paid Jones approximately $30\n\nper hour as compensation for the time he spent preparing and\n\ntestifying, for a total of between $700 and $800.30\n\n          At trial, the defendants argued that UTC's payments to Jones\n\nraise an inference that Jones's testimony was improperly influenced by\n\nUTC and should be excluded for that reason.       The district court\n\nrejected this argument in a ruling from the bench, finding that \"under\n\nthese circumstances it's a reasonable amount to have paid him.\" The\n\ndefendants appeal this ruling to admit the testimony.\n\n          Citing two grounds for disbelieving Jones's testimony, the\n\ndefendants argue further that the district court should not have\n\ncredited Jones's testimony. First, they state that the payments UTC\n\nmade to Jones -- if they do not render his testimony inadmissible --\n\nshould have caused the district court to reject his account of CWR's\n\npractices. Second, the defendants argue that Jones should not be\n\nbelieved because he signed affidavits prepared for other litigation\n\nthat they claim are inconsistent with his testimony in this case.\n\n\n     30The defendants claim that UTC did not timely or adequately\ndisclose the details of the payments it made to Jones. However, the\nissue of his compensation was raised during the June 1996 deposition\nand the defendants had the opportunity to cross-examine Jones on the\nissue of compensation at that time.\n\n                                - 59 -\n\f                  a. Grounds for Exclusion\n\n          We first consider whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in admitting Jones's deposition testimony.31 To the extent\n\nthat the defendants argue that the payments to Jones rendered him\n\nincompetent as a witness, their effort fails. Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n601 provides: \"Every person is competent to be a witness except as\n\notherwise provided in these rules.\"32 See also United States v.

Each week, during\n\n\n     34The defendants attempt to avoid this deferential standard of\nreview by arguing that the district court was not in a position to\nevaluate Jones's credibility firsthand because Jones's testimony at\ntrial was submitted by reading lengthy excerpts from his deposition.\nHowever, it is well-settled that the court's credibility findings\nregarding deposition testimony are still entitled to deference on\nappeal.

I would haul these same drums\n          of waste to the Chemical Waste Removal yard in\n          Bridgeport where they were stored until a full\n          flatbed trailer load of 79 drums was accumulated.\n          I would then dispose of these Perkin Elmer drums\n          of waste at Picillo Pig Farm.\n\nAttorneys for the defendants questioned Jones about these statements\n\nduring his deposition and asked him to reconcile the affidavits with\n\nhis testimony in the Davis litigation. He explained that he never\n\ndumped at the Davis site again after he began dumping at the Picillo\n\nsite in 1977. Therefore, Jones's deposition testimony in this case and\n\nthe Picillo affidavits may be interpreted to provide a consistent\n\naccount of his dumping practices during 1977: Jones dumped at the Davis\n\nsite until Davis stopped accepting waste in September, at which time he\n\nbegan dumping at the Picillo pig farm. Moreover, even without this\n\nexplanation, the affidavits are not facially inconsistent with Jones's\n\ntestimony because the affidavits do not mention the Davis site at all,\n\nleaving open the possibility that Jones dumped at both sites during\n\n1977, but at different times. In sum, the statements in the Picillo\n\naffidavits are not, as the defendants contend, flatly contradictory or\n\ninconsistent with Jones's testimony in the Davis litigation.\n\nParticularly in light of the documentary evidence offered at trial --\n\nconsisting of Davis slips, bills of lading, and other ledgers and\n\nreceipts -- and the testimony of the Musillo brothers that corroborated\n\nmuch of what Jones said, we cannot conclude that the district court\n\n\n                                - 64 -\n\fclearly erred in choosing to credit some of Jones's testimony.\n\n          3. Exclusion of Master Chart\n\n          Acco and Gar argue that the district court erred in excluding\n\na 120-page chart captioned \"Contentions of the Contribution Plaintiffs\"\n\nthat UTC's lawyers prepared for the Rule 30(b)(6)35 testimony of UTC's\n\ncorporate designee, Troy Charlton. The chart summarized information\n\nUTC obtained during discovery about the claims and theories of various\n\nparties to the litigation, most of whom were third or fourth-party\n\ndefendants. More specifically, the chart, organized by party name,\n\nlisted information about the dates of disposal at the Davis site, the\n\nvolume of waste, the hauler used by that party, and the hazardous\n\nsubstances contained in the waste. The chart also identified pertinent\n\ndocuments and testimony for each of the parties.

Procedural Posture\n\n          UTC claims that Acco and Gar cannot appeal the exclusion of\n\nthe chart from evidence because they did not move for its admission\n\nbelow. Only Sealed Air Corporation (SAC) and Morton moved to introduce\n\nthe chart at trial, arguing that it constituted an admission by UTC.\n\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) (defining admissions by a party-opponent as\n\n\"not hearsay\"). Neither SAC nor Morton appealed the district court's\n\ndenial of their motions, although Acco and Gar now argue that the\n\ndistrict court erred in excluding the chart. Acco and Gar are not\n\nprecluded from making this claim despite their failure to do so below.\n\nThe plain language of Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(2), written in the passive\n\ntense, does not require a party to have made an offer of proof at trial\n\nin order to preserve the right to appeal. Rather, Rule 103(a)(2)\n\nstates that an offer of proof is adequate when: \"In case the ruling is\n\none excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to\n\nthe court by offer or was apparent from the context within which\n\nquestions were asked.\" Fed. R. Evid. R. 103(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n\nIn considering whether an adequate offer of proof was made at trial, we\n\nhave focused on whether the proof sufficed to notify the court of the\n\nsignificance of the evidence such that the record was developed\n\nadequately for appeal.

Morton and SAC made an adequate offer of\n\nproof in attempting to admit the master chart into evidence. They\n\nfiled motions to admit the chart, as well as lengthy memoranda of law,\n\nand argued orally before the district court that it was admissible as\n\nan admission by UTC. Accordingly, Acco and Gar may appeal the district\n\ncourt's decision to exclude the chart.36\n\n                  b.

Ruling on this motion from the bench, the district court\n\nconcluded that the chart was UTC's statement but found that it did not\n\nqualify as an admission. Noting that there must be \"some indication of\n\nreliability\" for the statement to be an admission, the court found that\n\na party cannot be \"bound by statements that simply relate to hearsay\n\ninformation received regarding matters clearly outside the scope of the\n\ncorporations knowledge or statements that describe evidence compiled\n\nfrom third-party sources by the corporation in preparation for trial.\"\n\nThe district court then explained its view of the statements contained\n\nin the master chart, noting first that it appeared \"to contain a\n\n\n     36 UTC cites only one case to support its argument that Acco and\nGar may not appeal the ruling to exclude the chart.

While Acco and Gar have\nnot identified the master chart as a summary chart under Rule 1006,\nseeking to admit it as an admission of UTC instead, the master chart --\nmore than 100 pages long -- summarizes a large quantity of information,\nand whether it is deemed a party admission or a summary chart, Acco and\nGar must prove that the statements in the chart are admissible.\n\n                                - 69 -\n\f                  Ashland and Acco argue that there is no evidence\n\nconcerning the quality or quantity of hazardous substances in the\n\nAshland and Acco drums found at the Davis site, and thus no evidence\n\nthat disposal of the drums can cause UTC to incur cleanup costs. Gar\n\nmakes two additional lack of causation arguments, contending that: (1)\n\nthere is no evidence that the company contributed more than background\n\nlevels of contamination since it was found liable for only five drums\n\nof waste; and (2) that its waste, which contained metals, has not\n\ncontributed to UTC's soil remediation costs because the remediation is\n\ndirected only at cleaning up volatile organic compounds. We review for\n\nclear error the court's factual finding that the appellants' waste\n\ntriggered cleanup costs.     See Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457.\n\n          In discussing the environmental damage at the Davis site, the\n\ndistrict court found that three categories of waste were present in the\n\nsoil and ground or surface water at greater than background levels:38\n\n\"volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds\n\n(SVOCs), and metals.\" See Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 51. The VOCs\n\nincluded \"benzene, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methylene chloride,\n\nperchloroethylene    a/k/a    tetrachloroethylene     (PCE),    1,1,1,\n\ntricloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), trichlorethylene (TCE), toluene, and\n\n\n\n     38The background level of a hazardous substance is measured in\nparts per million or parts per billion, and reflects the level that\npresents an acceptable degree of health risk, according to scientific\njudgments.\n\n                                - 70 -\n\fxylene.\" Id. The metals included \"cadmium, copper, cyanide, and\n\nnickel.\"   Id.\n\n           The court found that Acco, which manufactured controls for\n\noil and gasoline lines, produced waste containing 1,1,1,-TCA, cadmium,\n\ncopper, and nickel compounds, cyanide, and hydrochloric or sulfuric\n\nacid. See id. at 55. Ashland, a chemical manufacturer, generated\n\nwaste that contained nitrating acid, composed of sulfuric acid and\n\nnitric acid, as well as solvents composed of isopropyl alcohol, methyl\n\nalcohol, toluene, benzene, and xylene. See id. at 56. Gar, which \"was\n\nin the electroplating business,\" generated wastes containing nitric\n\nacid, copper, nickel, and cyanide.        Id.\n\n           The court found that \"[s]ince the hazardous waste deposited\n\nat the Davis site has been commingled into an essentially homogeneous\n\n'witches' brew,' it is impossible to allocate discrete portions of the\n\ncleanup cost to any particular type of waste or any particular party.\"\n\nId. at 64. As a result, the court made a general finding that \"the\n\nevidence does establish hazardous substances produced by Acco-Bristol,\n\nAshland, Gar, and Perkin-Elmer as well as Morton were deposited at the\n\nDavis Site, that each of them contracted for the disposal and that the\n\nrelease and threatened release of those kinds of substances triggered\n\nresponse costs.\"    Id. at 62.\n\n           In finding that the appellants' waste contributed to UTC's\n\ncleanup costs, the district court drew a reasonable inference based on\n\n\n                                 - 71 -\n\fthe evidence. Evidence about the defendants' manufacturing processes\n\nin 1976 and 1977 supports the finding that each defendant generated\n\nwaste that contained one or more of the hazardous substances identified\n\nat the Davis site at concentrations exceeding background levels. See\n\nid. at 51. Evidence about the commingling of these substances in the\n\nwater and soil at the site supports the finding that the harm caused by\n\neach individual substance could not be remediated separately. The court\n\nthus concluded that the defendants had caused or contributed to cleanup\n\ncosts at the site.\n\n          The appellants' arguments to the contrary rely on a highly\n\nselective reading of Acushnet Co. v. Mohasco Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198635\"><a href=\"/opinion/198635/acushnet-v-coaters/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\n\nCir. 1999).       The passage they cite states:\n\n          It might, of course, make sense to say that a\n          defendant's release did not 'cause' the\n          incurrence of response costs when the monies were\n          expended for purposes wholly unrelated to\n          responding to environmental contamination. And\n          we suppose it may even be accurate to say that a\n          generator or transporter of waste did not cause\n          a plaintiff to incur remediation costs when that\n          person did not actually cause any alleged\n          contamination, or perhaps even where clean up\n          efforts were directed at cleaning up toxins other\n          than those attributed to the defendant.\n\n\nAcushnet, 191 F.3d at 77 n.7 (citation omitted).        Based on this\n\nlanguage, the appellants assert that CERCLA contribution plaintiffs\n\nmust prove that a defendant's waste contributed more than background\n\ncontamination levels and is the type of waste being cleaned up at the\n\n\n                                - 72 -\n\fsite.   Their attempt to somehow raise the threshold for proving\n\ncausation, however, misconstrues the holding of Acushnet.\n\n          In Acushnet, a settling defendant brought a contribution\n\naction against a non-settler. The non-settler admitted that it had\n\ndiscarded waste containing a substance called PAH at the site in\n\nquestion, but moved for summary judgment on the ground that the\n\nquantity of PAH it disposed was far less than the background level and\n\ntiny in comparison to the amount of PAH dumped by other parties. The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment because the plaintiff failed to\n\ncreate a triable issue of fact about whether the defendant's disposal\n\nof PAH caused cleanup costs to be incurred. We affirmed \"on somewhat\n\ndifferent grounds,\" saying that \"[t]o the extent that the court's\n\nruling may be interpreted to incorporate into CERCLA a causation\n\nstandard that would require a polluter's waste to meet a minimum\n\nquantitative threshold, we disagree.\"       Id. at 72.    We explained:\n\n          To read a quantitative threshold into the\n          language 'causes the incurrence of response\n          costs' would cast the plaintiff in the impossible\n          role of tracing chemical waste to particular\n          sources in particular amounts, a task that is\n          often technologically infeasible due to the\n          fluctuating quantity and varied nature of the\n          pollution at a site over the course of many\n          years.     Moreover, it would be extremely\n          difficult, if not impossible, to articulate a\n          workable numerical threshold in defining\n          causation. . . . Our own decisions provide no\n          basis for such an approach. . . . [W]e have never\n          discussed CERCLA causation in quantitative terms.\n\nId. at 76-77.\n\n                                - 73 -\n\f          To be sure, CERCLA allows a defendant to assert a defense\n\nthat the liability attributable to it is divisible from that borne by\n\nother parties.    See id. at 77 (\"[W]here environmental harms are\n\ndivisible, a defendant may be held responsible only for his\n\nproportional share of the response costs\").        However, once the\n\nplaintiff has established that a defendant disposed of hazardous waste,\n\nAcushnet put the burden of proof on the defendant to show that this\n\nwaste did not contribute to cleanup costs.

According to testimony at trial, UTC\n\nwill have to take additional steps to reduce metal contaminants if\n\nthose contaminants are still present in the soil at greater than\n\n\n     39 The district court took Gar's relatively minor waste\ncontribution into account by allocating to the company only .03 percent\nof UTC's cleanup costs. Gar itself calls this allocation \"minuscule.\"\nAt oral argument, it became apparent that the real concern of Gar and\nthe other appellants is that the government will use the judgment\nagainst them here in a future § 9607 action for the costs of the\ngroundwater and well remedies which have not yet been recovered.\n\n                                - 75 -\n\fbackground levels after VOC levels have abated. Gar thus has failed to\n\nshow that the harm caused by its waste is divisible from the harm\n\ntreated in UTC's soil remediation.\n\n          5. The Entry of a Declaratory Judgment under § 9613(g)(2) and\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act\n\n          The appellants argue that the district court's entry of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment was improper because: (1) CERCLA does not provide\n\nfor declaratory relief in a contribution action for future cleanup\n\ncosts; and (2) the Declaratory Judgment Act does not provide for\n\ndeclaratory relief in this case because no case or controversy existed\n\nbetween the parties. To support the latter claim, the appellants argue\n\nthat UTC failed to prove that it was likely to incur more than its fair\n\nshare of future cleanup costs and that UTC's settlement with the\n\ngovernment did not extinguish the appellants' liability.40 We discuss\n\neach argument in turn.\n\n          The appellants argue that CERCLA's declaratory relief\n\nprovision, § 9613(g)(2), does not permit UTC to receive declaratory\n\n\n\n     40The appellants also argue that UTC failed to request declaratory\nrelief. This argument is easily disposed of. As the district court\npointed out, UTC need not have used the magic word \"declaratory\njudgment\" in its pleading to put the defendants on notice that its\nclaims could be resolved with a grant of declaratory relief. See Davis\nIV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 60. UTC's complaint asked the court to enter a\njudgment to \"determine . . . the equitable contribution share of\nliability . . . properly allocated to each [party.]\" The court's case\nmanagement order before trial used similar language. This language\ngave the defendants sufficient notice that declaratory relief might be\ngranted.\n\n                                - 76 -\n\frelief for cleanup costs that it incurred after the close of discovery\n\nand continues to incur as it completes the soil remediation. They\n\ncorrectly point out that the amount that UTC will ultimately pay for\n\nsoil remediation is unknown. While the EPA projected a cost of $14\n\nmillion for soil remediation, this estimate is several years old.\n\nRather than allowing into evidence more recent figures on the amount of\n\nongoing and future cleanup costs, the court relied on the EPA estimates\n\nfor purposes of the Phase III adjudication, saying that the defendants\n\ncould challenge specific expenditures in post-trial proceedings.41\n\n          The district court dismissed UTC's claims for past cleanup\n\ncosts on the ground that the company had not paid for any cleanup\n\nbefore the close of discovery.42 See Davis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 330.\n\nThe court expressed doubts about whether UTC was entitled to\n\ndeclaratory relief for future costs given the ongoing nature of the\n\npayments and their unknown total amount, but ultimately concluded that\n\n\"the evidence presented is sufficient to enable the Court to make a\n\nmeaningful allocation based upon the facts presently available.\" Davis\n\n\n     41The district court \"retain[ed] jurisdiction for the purpose of\nrevising this allocation if and when additional facts are discovered\nthat were not reasonably available to the parties at the time of trial\nand that clearly demonstrate a change in circumstances so significant\nthat the allocation would be rendered manifestly inequitable.\" Davis\nIV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 69.\n     42 UTC's indemnification claims were dismissed \"for the same\nreason\" and because the district court determined that UTC \"was not\nentitled to indemnification under Rhode Island law.\" Davis IV, 20 F.\nSupp. 2d at 330.\n\n                                - 77 -\n\fIV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 59. The court thus granted declaratory relief\n\npursuant to CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(g)(2), and the Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201.\n\n          To determine whether the court's grant of declaratory relief\n\nwas proper under § 9613(g)(2), we begin with the plain language of the\n\nstatute. See United States v. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749301\"><a href=\"/opinion/749301/united-states-v-pedro-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).   Section 9613(g)(2) provides that \"[i]n any such action\n\ndescribed in this subsection, the court shall enter a declaratory\n\njudgment on liability for response costs or damages that will be\n\nbinding on any subsequent action or actions to recover further response\n\ncosts or damages.\"   42 U.S.C. § 9613(g)(2).     The statute does not\n\nexplicitly provide for declaratory relief for a contribution action for\n\nfuture or past response costs.      However, nothing in the statute\n\nprecludes an interpretation that declaratory relief is available in\n\nboth instances. See Boeing Co. v. Cascade Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768186\"><a href=\"/opinion/768186/boeing-company-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-cascade-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1191\n\n(9th Cir. 2000). The statute suggests this interpretation by adopting\n\na flexible time line, providing that \"[a] person may seek contribution\n\n. . . during or following any civil action under . . . section 9607(a)\n\nof this title.\"    42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(1) (emphasis added).       This\n\nlanguage anticipates that a defendant in a § 9607 cost recovery action\n\nmay initiate a contribution action before its own liability is\n\nestablished. Consistent with this scheme, a § 9607 defendant whose\n\nliability has been established may be awarded declaratory relief before\n\n\n                                - 78 -\n\fthat liability has been fully discharged.\n\n          The district court acknowledged that a few courts have held\n\nthat § 9613(g)(2) applies to actions brought under § 9607, the vehicle\n\nfor an innocent party to recover cleanup costs, and not to actions\n\nbrought under § 9613(f), the vehicle for a non-innocent party to seek\n\ncontribution from other polluters.

However, the Ninth and Tenth Circuits have taken\n\nthe position, as we do here, that § 9613(g)(2), the declaratory\n\njudgment provision of CERCLA, applies to § 9613(f) contribution actions\n\nfor both past and future response costs. In Boeing Co. v. Cascade\n\nCorp., the Ninth Circuit said:\n\n          CERCLA was intended to encourage quick response\n          and to place the costs on those responsible.\n          Declaratory relief serves these purposes because\n          parties, like those in this case, will know their\n          share of costs before they are incurred . . . .\n          The costs and time involved in relitigating\n          issues as complex as these where new costs are\n          incurred would be massive and wasteful.\n          Declaratory relief allocating future costs is\n          therefore consistent with the broader purposes of\n          CERCLA.\n\n207 F.3d at 1191; see also Tosco Corp., 216 F.3d at 897 (\"[W]here, as\n\nhere, a responsible party chooses to go to trial and future response\n\ncosts are likely to be incurred, but the exact amount remains unknown,\n\n\n                                - 79 -\n\fa judgment on proportional liability is an appropriate remedy.\").43 We\n\nagree with these rationales. As the district court said, in this case\n\n\"allocation helps to alleviate the hardship that would be visited upon\n\nthe [PRP] seeking contribution if that PRP was, in effect, required to\n\nfinance the entire cleanup operation before getting a determination\n\nregarding the shares attributable to the other PRP's.\" Davis IV, 31 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 58.\n\n          Since we find that § 9613(g)(2) applies to § 9613(f)\n\ncontribution actions for both past and future response costs, we need\n\nnot address in detail the appellants' arguments that the district\n\ncourt's entry of a declaratory judgment was improper under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act because there was no case or controversy\n\npermitting the court to act. We address the arguments only because\n\nthey apply, at least by implication, to the availability of declaratory\n\nrelief under § 9613(g)(2).\n\n          First, the appellants say that there was no controversy\n\nbetween the parties, as the Act requires, because UTC did not prove\n\nthat it would pay more than its fair share of cleanup costs. They\n\nargue that UTC cannot prove that it is likely to pay more than its fair\n\n\n     43Other courts have also reasoned that declaratory relief furthers\nCERCLA's goals in finding that the entry of such relief is mandatory in\n§ 9607 cost recovery actions.

The district court\n\nset UTC's share as 1.54 percent of the total waste at the Davis site\n\n\n                                - 81 -\n\fbased on the volume of its waste established by the evidence.

See id. at 69. Reasoning that\n\nUTC was bound by the proposed consent decrees to pay at least $10.35\n\nmillion, the court found that UTC had necessarily incurred more than\n\nits fair share of cleanup costs.44       See id.\n\n          The appellants' argument to the contrary fails for the same\n\nreasons that led us to reject the argument that the district court had\n\nno authority to enter a consent decree. UTC's agreement in Consent\n\nDecree I to make a cash payment and perform the soil remediation\n\ncreated a fixed obligation subject only to the court's approval. UTC\n\ndid not have to actually make the payments to which it agreed to show\n\nthat it was liable for more than its fair share of the total costs of\n\ncleanup. The ongoing nature of the work and the fact that its ultimate\n\ncost was not known at trial did not affect the district court's ability\n\nto consider the evidence that other PRPs contributed to the waste in\n\nthe soil, and to determine whether some of UTC's costs should thus be\n\nallocated to them.\n\n          The appellants also argue that there is no case or\n\n\n     44The court reached this figure by deducting the amounts that UTC\ncan recoup from other PRPs pursuant to the other partial consent\ndecrees from the $16.8 million it agreed to pay pursuant to Consent\nDecree I. We note without resolving the issue that the government sets\nUTC's minimum payment at $9.3 million.\n\n                                - 82 -\n\fcontroversy between the parties because UTC has not extinguished their\n\nentire liability. As we have discussed, the partial consent decrees do\n\nnot cover an estimated $21.7 million of the government's projected\n\nresponse costs. Because the government can still seek to recover those\n\ncosts from them, the appellants argue that \"[p]ermitting UTC to recover\n\nfrom the defendants under these circumstances would expose the\n\ndefendants to the CERCLA equivalent of 'double jeopardy.'\" In support\n\nof their position, the appellants cite United Techs. Corp., which\n\ndefined the term \"contribution\" as \"a claim by and between jointly and\n\nseverally liable parties for an appropriate division of the payment one\n\nof them has been compelled to make.\" 33 F.3d at 99 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n          The appellants' argument that UTC is not entitled to\n\ncontribution because it has not extinguished the appellants' entire\n\nliability fails in light of the plain language of § 9613(f):\n\n          A person who has resolved its liability to the\n          United States or a State in an administrative or\n          judicially approved settlement shall not be\n          liable for claims for contribution regarding\n          matters addressed in the settlement. . . .\n          A person who has resolved its liability to the\n          United States or a State for some or all of a\n          response action or for some or all of the costs\n          of such action in an administrative or judicially\n          approved settlement may seek contribution from\n          any person who is not party to a settlement\n          referred to [above].\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(2) & (3)(B) (emphasis added). CERCLA clearly\n\nanticipated that some settlements, like the one in this case, would\n\n                                - 83 -\n\fcover only a portion of the total cleanup costs for a hazardous waste\n\nsite. The statute does not impose a requirement that a contribution\n\naction plaintiff must settle the entire cost of cleaning up a site\n\nbefore it can seek contribution.\n\n          The   appellants'    complaint   that   they   may   bear   a\n\ndisproportionate share of the total liability if the government chooses\n\nto bring further proceedings against them is part of the risk they\n\nassumed in choosing not to settle.       As we have said before:\n\n          CERCLA seeks to provide EPA with the necessary\n          tools to achieve prompt cleanups. One such tool\n          is the ability to foster incentives for timely\n          settlements. To this end, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(2)\n          provides that a party who settles with the\n          government 'shall not be liable for claims for\n          contribution regarding matters addressed in the\n          settlement.' Because only the amount of the\n          settlement, not the pro rata share attributable\n          to the settling party, is subtracted from the\n          aggregate liability of the nonsettling parties,\n          section 9613(f)(2) envisions that nonsettling\n          parties may bear disproportionate liability.\n          This paradigm is not a scrivener's accident. It\n          was designed to encourage settlements and provide\n          PRPs a measure of finality in return for their\n          willingness to settle.\n\nUnited Techs. Corp., 33 F.3d at 102-03 (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1086\n\n(\"non-settling defendants . . . are potentially liable for the full\n\ndifference between the costs of cleanup and the total amount paid by\n\nthe settling PRPs\"). While our precedents on CERCLA consent decrees\n\nare attentive to the fairness of the settlements for settling versus\n\n\n                                - 84 -\n\fnon-settling PRPs, they do not go so far as to protect PRPs who choose\n\nnot to settle from the consequences of non-settlement imposed by CERCLA\n\nitself. See Charles George, 34 F.3d at 1088. In sum, the district\n\ncourt's entry of a declaratory judgment was proper.\n\n          6. Morton's Liability\n\n          The district court found Morton International liable for\n\nhazardous waste dumped by Thiokol Corporation Chemical Division\n\n(Thiokol) at the Davis site. For purposes of this case, Morton has\n\nstipulated that it is a successor to Thiokol's liabilities.\n\n                  a. Claims of Clearly Erroneous Factual Findings\n\n          Morton's liability, unlike that of other parties whose waste\n\nwas hauled by CWR, depends on the court's findings about the waste\n\npractices of CCC. Thiokol was one of the approximately 130 companies\n\nfrom whom CCC collected waste during 1976 and 1977. Reasoning that\n\nsince CCC made 47 deliveries to Davis, and since \"there is no reason to\n\nbelieve that CCC handled Thiokol's waste any differently than the waste\n\nof its other 130 customers,\" the district court found that Thiokol's\n\nwaste went to the Davis site, and thus found Morton liable as an\n\narranger. Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 55. However, because there was\n\nno evidence regarding the volume of Thiokol's waste transported by CCC,\n\nor the volume of waste from other customers that CCC transported to the\n\nDavis site, the court concluded that it was unable to allocate to\n\n\n\n\n                                - 85 -\n\fMorton a share of the cleanup costs.45      See id.\n\n            We begin with the evidence about CCC's practices. CCC was\n\nlocated in Elizabeth, New Jersey and was owned and operated by William\n\nCarracino. Carracino testified that CCC began sending waste to Rhode\n\nIsland in 1977, initially to Sanitary Landfill. Beginning in May, the\n\nCapuanos began diverting the CCC waste to the Davis site, and the CCC\n\ndrivers proceeded straight there without stopping first at Sanitary\n\nLandfill.    CCC continued to bring waste to the Davis site until\n\nSeptember, when Davis refused to accept the waste and seized CCC's\n\ntruck because CCC was overdue in its payments. Based on the 47 trips\n\nCCC made to the Davis site between May and the first week of July, and\n\nthe volume of waste transported during those weeks, the district court\n\nestimated that CCC delivered a total of 441,450 gallons of waste to the\n\nDavis site. Testimony by Carracino and CCC driver John Mayo about\n\nthese trips to Rhode Island was corroborated by toll receipts and petty\n\ncash vouchers.\n\n            CCC began collecting Thiokol's waste in 1971. This waste,\n\ngenerated by three separate plants in New Jersey, averaged\n\napproximately 22,000 gallons per year.        Much of the waste was\n\nidentified on shipment forms prepared by Thiokol simply as\n\n\n\n     45As became clear at oral argument, Morton still appeals because\nof its concern that the government will use the judgment of liability\nin this case to pursue a § 9607 action for the cost of the groundwater\nand well remediation that remains unallocated.\n\n                                - 86 -\n\f\"miscellaneous chemical waste.\" Testimony by a former Thiokol employee\n\nindicated that Thiokol did not separate its waste. In particular,\n\nThiokol did not separate its chlorinated waste until 1979. The waste\n\nwas disposed of primarily in 55-gallon drums, but Thiokol used drums of\n\nsmaller sizes, as well as 5-gallon pails.        The waste contained\n\nflammable liquids and spent solvents, including methylene chloride,\n\nmethyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and 1,1,1-TCA, all of which were found at\n\nthe Davis site.    Other waste picked up on a more occasional basis\n\nincluded urethane, filter cakes used in producing plasticizers, and\n\nlubricating oil.\n\n          CCC handled waste it collected in a variety of ways. It sold\n\nsome liquid waste to salvagers, burned some of the flammable liquids in\n\nan incinerator on the Elizabeth site, transported waste to various dump\n\nsites, and stored some waste on the premises for future disposal.\n\nCarracino testified that solid waste, polymers, and sludges were sent\n\nstraight from CCC to disposal sites because of their tendency to clog\n\nthe incinerator.      CCC employee John Prahm, who operated the\n\nincinerator, corroborated that testimony. Waste shipment forms confirm\n\nthat CCC picked up polymers from Thiokol.\n\n          Evidence at trial indicated that CCC's incinerator did not\n\neffectively destroy many chemicals -- particularly chlorinated waste --\n\nbecause it did not operate at a sufficiently high temperature. An\n\nexpert witness testified that the incinerator produced a sludge or\n\n\n                                - 87 -\n\fresidue, which was itself a hazardous waste, because of this\n\ninefficient operation. Prahm testified that this residue from the\n\nincinerator was placed in drums for disposal. Evidence regarding\n\nThiokol's disposal practices supports an inference that some of its\n\nflammable waste likely went to the Davis site as residue from the\n\nincinerator. More specifically, Thiokol did not separate chlorinated\n\nwaste from unchlorinated waste, and chlorinated waste was not\n\neffectively destroyed in the incinerator because it required a higher\n\ntemperature. Thus, we cannot conclude that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that at least some of Thiokol's waste \"consisted of flammable\n\nsolvents that probably were incinerated,\" Davis IV, F. Supp. 2d at 55,\n\nand that because there is no basis for finding that Thiokol's waste was\n\ntreated differently from other waste at CCC, the hazardous residue\n\nproduced by the incineration of such waste was likely placed in drums\n\nand transported to the Davis site.\n\n          Thiokol's disposal of waste in 5-gallon pails further\n\nsupports the district court's finding of liability. UTC offered the\n\ndeposition testimony of a former Thiokol employee, Melvin Schulman,\n\nthat Thiokol disposed of some liquid waste in spring-top, 5-gallon\n\ncans. Waste shipment forms indicate that CCC picked up these cans for\n\ndisposal. A notation on at least one cancelled check drawn on CCC's\n\naccount reads \"5 gal. pails to RI, 6/8/77.\" Carracino confirmed in his\n\ndeposition testimony that the notation was in his writing and that the\n\n\n                                - 88 -\n\fcheck was payment for dumping waste. Davis also testified at trial\n\nthat he recalled receiving loads of waste in which 5-gallon pails,\n\ncontaining liquid waste, had been transported to his site on top of 55-\n\ngallon drums. Davis specifically recalled that these shipments came\n\nfrom New Jersey. While the testimony regarding these 5-gallon pails\n\ndoes not establish conclusively that Morton's waste was dumped at the\n\nDavis site, the district court was not clearly erroneous in crediting\n\nthis testimony and considering it part of the evidence tending to\n\nestablish that it was more probable than not that Morton's hazardous\n\nwaste was shipped by CCC to the site.\n\n          Morton argues that \"the mere presence of 1,1,1-TCA in\n\nMorton's waste and its presence at the Davis site does not, without\n\nmore, establish that Morton's waste was located at the Davis site.\"\n\nHowever, the district court did not base its finding that Morton was\n\nliable solely on the presence of that chemical at the site. Rather,\n\nthe district court inferred from other evidence that Thiokol's waste\n\nwas taken to the Davis site and noted that such an inference \"finds\n\nsome support\" in the fact that the chemical was found at the site.\n\nDavis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 55.\n\n                  b. Claims of Legal Error\n\n          Morton argues that the district court improperly shifted the\n\nburden of proof to Morton, requiring it to show that it had not dumped\n\nwaste at the Davis site, rather than requiring UTC to prove each\n\n\n                                - 89 -\n\felement of its claim for contribution.

Here, UTC\n\nintroduced evidence of Thiokol's production of hazardous waste, CCC's\n\nrecords regarding pickups of waste and deliveries to the Davis site,\n\nand CCC's practices in handling different kinds of waste. We do not\n\nagree with Morton that the district court engaged in an improper\n\nburden-shifting analysis in finding, based on this evidence, that some\n\nof Thiokol's waste was dumped at the Davis site.\n\n          Finally, Morton argues that it was impermissible for the\n\ndistrict court to find it liable as an arranger because the court\n\n\n                                - 90 -\n\fdeclined to allocate to Morton a specific share of responsibility.\n\nHowever, Acushnet, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198635\"><a href=\"/opinion/198635/acushnet-v-coaters/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, precludes this argument. Acushnet\n\nemphasizes the broad discretion of a district court in allocating\n\nresponsibility: \"A court, in evaluating contribution claims under §\n\n9613(f), is 'free to allocate responsibility according to any\n\ncombination of equitable factors it deems appropriate.'\" Id. at 78\n\n(quoting O'Neil v. Picillo, 883 F.2d at 183). The district court here\n\nfound that \"the fairest, and most practical, measure of relative\n\nresponsibility is the quantity or volume of hazardous waste\n\nattributable to each party.\" Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 64. Because\n\nthere was no way to calculate the volume of waste Thiokol dumped at the\n\nDavis site, the court declined to allocate a share of responsibility to\n\nMorton. This determination was well within the district court's broad\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          Morton argues that the district court's decision not to\n\nallocate a share of responsibility to Morton should have compelled a\n\nfinding that Morton was not liable because Thiokol's waste could not be\n\nlocated and identified at the Davis site.46 However, as we have noted,\n\nwe said in Acushnet that there is no minimum quantity threshold for\n\nimposing liability on polluters, 191 F.3d at 76, adding that \"[i]n an\n\n\n     46Morton also claims that the district court erred in finding\nliability without applying a standard of \"locating and identifying\" its\nwaste at the Davis site. We have already rejected an interpretation of\n§ 9613(f) that would require an arranger's waste to be specifically\nlocated at the Davis site with direct evidence.\n\n                                - 91 -\n\fappropriate set of circumstances, a tortfeasor's fair share of the\n\nresponse costs may even be zero, id. at 78. The district court's\n\ndecision not to allocate responsibility to Morton is consistent with\n\nAcushnet, and Morton has not even attempted to explain why the\n\nprinciples of that opinion should not apply here.\n\n          7. Successor-in-Interest Liability for Gar\n\n          Black & Decker (\"B & D\") argues that the district court erred\n\nin finding that it, rather than Electroformers, Inc., is Gar's\n\ncorporate successor-in-interest and thus liable for Gar's disposal of\n\nwaste at the Davis site. Gar's corporate history is as follows. In\n\n1977, MITE Corporation owned Gar Electroforming Division, the\n\nmanufacturing facility in Danbury, Connecticut that generated the\n\nhazardous waste disposed of at the Davis site. In November 1978, MITE\n\nagreed to sell Gar's assets to Electroformers, Inc., which had\n\nincorporated a month earlier. The Asset Purchase Agreement signed by\n\nthe parties in January 1979 provided that Electroformers would buy\n\ncertain accounts receivable, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment,\n\ntrademarks and trade names, business records, inventory and customer\n\nlists. Electroformers used the name \"Gar Electroformers Division\" for\n\na time after the sale, subleased the Danbury facility from MITE, and\n\ncontinued to make the same product with the same manufacturing process\n\nand to use the same employee pension plan. MITE agreed not to compete\n\nwith Electroformers in its area of business for ten years. The Asset\n\n\n                                - 92 -\n\fPurchase Agreement provided that the \"[b]uyer will not assume any of\n\nthe liabilities of the Gar Electroforming Division existing on the date\n\nof the closing and MITE agrees to defend any claims relating thereto\n\npresented against Buyer and to save Buyer harmless from any such\n\nclaims.\" MITE also represented that, to its knowledge, it was not in\n\nviolation of any environmental or pollution-related law or ordinance.\n\nIn 1985, the Emhart Corporation bought MITE. In 1989, B & D acquired\n\nEmhart, which continues to exist as B & D's wholly owned subsidiary.\n\n            UTC sued both B & D and Electroformers for contribution as\n\nGar's successor-in-interest. Both defendants filed motions for summary\n\njudgment.    The district court referred to a magistrate judge the\n\nquestion of which entity, B & D or Electroformers, should be liable as\n\nGar's successor. The magistrate judge discussed the choice between the\n\nstate law and federal common law tests for determining corporate\n\nsuccessor liability, and found that B & D was liable under either\n\nanalysis because Electroformers bought Gar's assets from MITE through\n\na true assets purchase agreement. The district court adopted this\n\nrecommendation.\n\n            On appeal, B & D argues that the federal common law\n\n\"substantial continuation\" test should determine corporate successor\n\nliability under CERCLA, and that Electroformers should be found liable\n\nusing this test. Electroformers and UTC47 argue that Connecticut's\n\n\n     47   UTC took the opposite position before the district court.\n\n                                - 93 -\n\f\"mere continuation\" test should apply,48 and that Electroformers should\n\nnot be found liable using either the \"substantial continuation\" or the\n\n\"mere continuation\" tests.

A transporter clearly does\n          not select the disposal site merely by following\n          the directions of the party with which it\n          contracts. . . . In such cases, the transporter\n          is no more than a conduit of the waste and its\n          connection with the material is the most\n          attenuated among potentially responsible parties.\n          . . . Congress intended such transporters to\n          avoid liability.\n\n37 F.3d at 95 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). See\n\nalso Interstate Power Co. v. Kansas City Power & Light Co., 909 F.\n\nSupp. 1284, 1289 (N.D. Iowa 1994) (granting summary judgment to party\n\n\n                               - 101 -\n\falleged to be a transporter where evidence showed the party had no\n\ndiscretion in hauling waste to the site but merely followed the orders\n\nof a waste generator).      Thus,   Tippins distinguishes between\n\ntransporters that actively participate in the selection decision or\n\nhave substantial input in that decision, and transporters that merely\n\nfollow the directives of the generator. UTC has not explained why we\n\nshould not follow the approach in Tippins. Accordingly, we examine the\n\nfacts to determine whether the district court was clearly erroneous in\n\nconcluding that Macera did not actively participate in the decision to\n\ntransport waste to the Davis site.\n\n          The only evidence of Macera's participation in selecting the\n\nDavis site was the testimony of William Davis regarding his dealings\n\nwith Robert Cece. Davis testified that he had known Cece for a long\n\ntime, and that Cece visited the site on one occasion to discuss the\n\npossibility of dumping waste there. Davis also stated that he was paid\n\nby Macera for this dumping. The following excerpt from the district\n\ncourt's opinion summarizes its reasoning regarding the inferences that\n\ncould be drawn from this evidence:\n\n          The fact that Cece approached Davis and made\n          arrangements to dump at the Site could support a\n          reasonable inference that Cece actively and\n          substantially participated in the selection of\n          the Site. On the other hand, it also would be\n          reasonable to infer that Cece was acting at the\n          direction of UTC, the generator of the waste.\n          Ordinarily, the former inference might be more\n          plausible. However, under these circumstances,\n          its plausibility is eroded by the dearth of\n\n                               - 102 -\n\f          evidence regarding the dealings between the\n          Macera defendants and UTC.\n\nDavis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 334. The district court's determination\n\non this matter is essentially a refusal to choose between two equally\n\nplausible inferences where there is no reason to support one inference\n\nover the other. Because rulings under Rule 52(c) are reviewed for\n\nclear error, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a), we defer to the district\n\ncourt's decision not to draw any inference.\n\n          In an attempt to evade the clear error standard of review for\n\nfactual findings of the district court, UTC claims that the district\n\ncourt made an error of law by impermissibly drawing an adverse\n\ninference regarding UTC's failure to present evidence of its\n\nnegotiations with Macera about the hauling of its waste. UTC quotes\n\nthe following language from the court's written opinion in support of\n\nthis claim:\n\n          Since evidence of the dealings between UTC and\n          the Macera defendants was readily available to\n          and under the control of UTC, UTC's failure to\n          present that evidence or to explain why it was\n          unable to do so, gives rise to an inference that\n          the evidence would have been unfavorable to UTC.\n          . . . In short, the absence of evidence regarding\n          the Macera defendants' dealings with UTC and the\n          fact that such evidence was within UTC's control\n          cause this Court to find that UTC has failed to\n          establish that Macera Brothers 'selected' the\n          Davis Site.\n\nDavis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 334 (citation omitted). The case cited by\n\nthe district court in support of this inference provides that two\n\n\n                               - 103 -\n\fconditions must be satisfied before an adverse inference about the non-\n\nproduction of evidence may be drawn.

Co. v.\n\nGonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326264\"><a href=\"/opinion/326264/commercial-insurance-company-of-newark-new-jersey-v-hector-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1314 (1st Cir. 1975). The evidence must be\n\n\"specially available\" to the non-producing party, and that party must\n\nhave \"had some reason to suppose that non-production would justify the\n\ninference.\" Id. UTC argues that \"specially available\" means evidence\n\nwithin its control but not within the control of Macera. Thus, UTC\n\nclaims that the inference cannot apply in this case because Macera also\n\nhas knowledge of any negotiations between Macera and UTC regarding the\n\ndisposal of UTC's waste. Cf. Kean v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"306788\"><a href=\"/opinion/306788/harold-c-margaret-i-kean-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue-inga-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187 (9th Cir. 1972) (\"Where a potential witness is equally\n\navailable to both parties, no inference should be drawn from the\n\nfailure of a party to call such witness.\").\n\n          We conclude that UTC, with its reliance on the \"adverse\n\ninference\" argument, misses the essential point of the district court's\n\nanalysis. The district court expressed its concern over UTC's overall\n\nfailure to present any evidence whatsoever about Macera's relationship\n\nwith generators -- both UTC and other unidentified parties -- for whom\n\nit hauled waste. Several paragraphs before discussing the inference\n\ndrawn against UTC, the court stated: \"UTC has failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence regarding those dealings [between Macera and\n\ngenerator defendants] to sustain its burden of proving that Macera\n\nBrothers 'selected' the Davis Site.\" Davis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 334.\n\n\n                               - 104 -\n\fThe district court's conclusion about the insufficiency of the evidence\n\nat this point in its analysis makes the propriety of the adverse\n\ninference irrelevant. The court found against UTC simply because UTC\n\nfailed to meet its burden of proof. In light of that finding, any\n\nadverse inference that might be drawn from UTC's failure to produce\n\nevidence of its own negotiations with Macera was not necessary to the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion. We conclude, therefore, that the district\n\ncourt did not rely improperly on an adverse inference and affirm its\n\nfinding that UTC did not present sufficient proof that Macera selected\n\nthe Davis site.\n\n                  2. Arranger Liability\n\n          UTC also argues that it proved that Macera was liable as an\n\narranger of waste under CERCLA. Macera claims that UTC's assertion of\n\nan arranger claim is untimely. In the 1991 third-party complaint\n\noriginally naming Macera as a defendant, UTC alleged only that Macera\n\nwas liable as a transporter of waste. The district court entered a\n\ncase management and scheduling order in December 1995 providing that\n\n\"[a]ll cross-claims and counterclaims are deemed made and denied,\n\nexcept that contractual claims for indemnity must be specifically\n\nplead.\"   The order also specified that amendments to third-party\n\ncomplaints had to be filed before January 2, 1996.\n\n          After the case was transferred to Chief Judge Torres, he\n\nentered an order in January 1998 providing:\n\n\n                               - 105 -\n\f           On December 14, 1995, an order was entered\n           providing that all parties were deemed to have\n           asserted claims, cross-claims and counterclaims\n           against all other parties for contribution and/or\n           indemnity without the need for specifically\n           pleading such claims.\n\n           Whereas it is impossible to determine what\n           parties, in fact, are asserting such claims, the\n           nature of any such claims or the basis for any\n           such claims . . .\n\n           it is hereby ORDERED that on or before February\n           15, 1998, each party asserting a claim, cross-\n           claim or counterclaim for contribution and/or\n           indemnity shall, if such party has not already\n           done so, file and serve pleadings setting forth\n           such claim. Such pleadings shall specify the\n           precise nature and basis of each claim asserted.\n\n\nRelying on that order, UTC filed an amended third-party complaint\n\nagainst Macera, alleging for the first time that Macera was also liable\n\nas an arranger. In its answer, Macera objected to this amendment as\n\nuntimely. For reasons that are unclear, the issue of whether UTC\n\ntimely pled an arranger claim against Macera was not resolved before\n\ntrial. However, the district court addressed this dispute during oral\n\nargument on Macera's Rule 52 motion for judgment after UTC rested its\n\ncase.   When UTC's lawyer first mentioned arranger liability, the\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n           THE COURT: Arranger didn't come into this until\n           much later. There is nothing about, there is no\n           arranger liability theory pled in the original\n           complaint against Cece, was there?\n\n           UTC'S COUNSEL: There was no arranger liability\n           pled in our original complaint. We did take\n\n                               - 106 -\n\f          advantage of Your Honor's invitation to correct\n          the pleadings in [January].\n\n          THE COURT: Not correct the pleadings, not to\n          correct the pleadings. Make it clear who was\n          asserting claims against whom, that was the -\n\nAfter additional discussion on the issue, the district court stated:\n\n          And I certainly don't think that the attempt to\n          include the arranger theory in the specific\n          claims that the Court required parties to assert\n          just before the case went to trial, I don't think\n          that that invitation or requirement that the\n          parties plead their - let the Court know who they\n          were asserting claims against constituted a\n          license to amend the pleadings and raise new\n          theories, and there is no question that arranger\n          liability is significantly different from hauler\n          liability.\n\nThus, the district court ruled that its order of January 1998 did not\n\nauthorize UTC to assert a belated claim of arranger liability. We\n\ndefer to this interpretation because the district court was uniquely\n\npositioned to explain the meaning of its own pretrial order. See\n\nMartha's Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. v.

Where the\n\nparty seeking amendment of the pleadings has shown no justification for\n\nits delay in doing so, we have affirmed the trial court's ruling to\n\ndeny the amendment. See id. at 216. UTC has not even attempted to\n\nexplain its failure to amend the pleadings at an earlier date.\n\n          Still, UTC argues that we should reverse the district court's\n\ndetermination on this issue because Macera did not suffer prejudice as\n\na result of UTC's untimely pleading of the arranger claim. UTC insists\n\nthat \"the evidence admitted to prove 'transporter' liability was no\n\ndifferent than the proof that established 'arranger' liability.\"\n\nHowever, any lack of prejudice to Macera is irrelevant because the\n\ndistrict court gave other reasons for its ruling.         We consider\n\nprejudice to the non-moving party as one factor to be weighed in\n\npermitting an untimely amendment to the pleadings. See, e.g., Campana,\n\n755 F.2d at 215. In other words, a finding that the non-moving party\n\n\n                               - 108 -\n\fwould not be prejudiced by an untimely amendment does not compel a\n\ndetermination that the amendment is appropriate.\n\n          UTC also argues that Macera consented to being tried as an\n\narranger by failing to object to evidence tending to establish arranger\n\nliability at trial. The district court rejected this claim, citing its\n\nrecollection that Macera had objected to the use of the term\n\n\"arranger.\" We affirm this determination. \"Consent to the trial of an\n\nissue may be implied if, during the trial, a party acquiesces in the\n\nintroduction of evidence which is relevant only to that issue.\" DCPB,\n\nInc. v. City of Lebanon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578604\"><a href=\"/opinion/578604/dcpb-inc-v-city-of-lebanon-dcpb-inc-v-city-of-lebanon/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 917 (1st Cir. 1992) (emphasis\n\nadded).   As just noted, UTC asserted that Macera would not be\n\nprejudiced by a ruling that it consented to being tried as an arranger\n\nbecause the evidence proving Macera's liability as an arranger of\n\nhazardous substances was the same evidence proving Macera's liability\n\nas a transporter. This argument about lack of prejudice forecloses\n\nUTC's claim regarding trial by consent: \"The introduction of evidence\n\ndirectly relevant to a pleaded issue cannot be the basis for a founded\n\nclaim that the opposing party should have realized that a new issue was\n\ninfiltrating the case.\" Id. Where, as here, the evidence regarding\n\nMacera's transport of waste to the Davis site was directly relevant to\n\ntransporter liability, and, according to UTC, arranger liability, we\n\nfind no error in the court's conclusion that Macera did not consent to\n\nbeing tried on an arranger theory by not objecting to the admission of\n\n\n                               - 109 -\n\fthat evidence.54\n\n                   b. The Judgment in Favor of the City of New Jersey\n\n            UTC brought a contribution claim against the City of New\n\nJersey (Jersey City) for disposing of approximately 2,000 drums\n\nabandoned on a city pier and containing corrosive, toxic and flammable\n\nsubstances found at the Davis site. The district court found Jersey\n\nCity immune from liability under § 9607(d)(2) of CERCLA, which provides\n\nimmunity for local governments from costs and damages resulting from\n\ntheir emergency response to the potential release of hazardous\n\nsubstances.55 See Davis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 335. On appeal, UTC\n\nargues that the district court erred in applying § 9607(d)(2) by\n\nfailing to consider whether Jersey City voluntarily removed the 2,000\n\n\n     54Even if we concluded that UTC introduced evidence that was\nrelevant only to prove that Macera was liable as an arranger, we agree\nwith the district court's determination that Macera did not acquiesce\nto being tried on that theory. As the district court noted in its\nruling from the bench, Macera objected to the use of the word\n\"arranger\" at least twice during the trial.\n     55   Section 9607(d)(2) provides:\n\n     No state or local government shall be liable under this\n     Title for costs or damages as a result of actions taken in\n     response to an emergency created by the release or\n     threatened release of a hazardous substance generated by or\n     from a facility owned by another person. This paragraph\n     shall not preclude liability for costs or damages as a\n     result of gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the\n     State or local government.

On a night in February 1977, Jersey City police caught Perk\n\nChemical Company dumping waste at an abandoned city warehouse at a pier\n\non the Hudson River. After police discovered approximately 2,000 drums\n\nof waste, the city secured the warehouse. City officials quickly\n\ncontacted the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP),\n\nwhich determined that the drums contained potentially explosive\n\nhazardous chemicals that could cause serious environmental harm. Both\n\nJersey City and the New Jersey DEP agreed that the waste required\n\nprompt disposal, but disputed who should finance the cleanup.\n\n          Two weeks later, the DEP obtained a judgment ordering Jersey\n\nCity to fund the cleanup.      After contacting state-recommended\n\ncontractors and expediting the normal bidding process, the city quickly\n\nhired a contractor to remove the waste. Within a few weeks all of the\n\nwaste was successfully removed from the warehouse. The contractor hired\n\nby the city subcontracted with CCC to transport the waste for disposal.\n\n          UTC argues that the statute contains a requirement of\n\nvoluntary action that Jersey City did not satisfy because it only acted\n\nto dispose of the drums after the state obtained a judgment ordering\n\nthe city to pay for the cleanup.56 We review the district court's\n\n\n     56UTC also argues that Jersey City is not exempt because it owned\nthe pier warehouse in which the waste was dumped, meaning that the\nwaste cannot be \"from a facility owned by another person,\" as the\n\n                               - 110 -\n\fapplication of § 9607(d)(2) de novo.

We note that the facts of Cordova indicate that the Michigan\ndepartment received immunity for an emergency response that was\nconsiderably less efficient and effective then Jersey City's here.\n\n                               - 110 -\n\fUTC.58    The district court made two statements about UTC's\n\nresponsibility for these costs. In its September 28, 1998 judgment\n\nbased on partial findings, the court said:\n\n           In this case, calculating UTC's pro rata share of\n           the total response costs requires that the\n           enforcement cost component and the cleanup cost\n           component be considered separately. The $6\n           million in enforcement costs is attributable,\n           almost entirely, to the Phase I litigation\n           between the government and UTC. The defendants\n           did not participate in that phase of the\n           litigation and it was necessitated because UTC\n           denied that any of its waste was deposited at the\n           Davis site. Accordingly, UTC bears 100% of the\n           responsibility for those enforcement costs.\n\nDavis III, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 338. The court also discussed the issue\n\nof enforcement costs in its December 15, 1998 declaratory judgment,\n\nsaying:\n\n           It appears that the [$6 million] enforcement\n           costs are attributable almost entirely to\n           expenses incurred by the government in the Phase\n           I litigation against UTC, and that, therefore,\n           they should be borne entirely by UTC. However,\n           that issue need not be decided in order to\n           determine the likelihood that UTC will be\n           required to pay more than its fair share.\n\n\n\n     58The parties do not contest that $6 million is an accurate\nestimate of the amount of the government's costs to that point.\nHowever, UTC argues that the precise figure for the costs --\n$5,855,812.01, according to the government's written submission in\nsupport of entry of its consent decree with UTC and other settling\nparties -- as well as other evidence about who bears responsibility for\nthese costs comes from the consent decree proceedings, and so is not\npart of the record in the declaratory judgment appeals. Because we\nremand to the district court for clarification, we do not reach this\nissue.\n\n                               - 110 -\n\fDavis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 69. The court denied UTC's motion seeking\n\namendment or clarification of these statements.\n\n            UTC argues that the \"the equivocal language that the district\n\ncourt used and the context of the issue it was deciding indicate it was\n\nonly engaging in a presumption, based on extra-record evidence, to test\n\nwhether it should issue declaratory relief.\" It asks us to construe the\n\ncourt's statements as \"argumentative presumptions without preclusive\n\neffect.\"\n\n            We agree that the intended effect of the court's statements\n\nis insufficiently clear. The court discussed UTC's responsibility for\n\nthe government's enforcement costs only in terms of its assessment of\n\nwhether UTC paid more than its fair share of the total response costs\n\nfor the Davis site. On the one hand, the court's initial statement\n\nthat \"UTC bears 100% of the responsibility for those enforcement costs\"\n\nsuggests that the court may have intended a ruling that obligates UTC\n\nto pay the government $6 million on top of the payments agreed to in\n\nthe settlement. On the other hand, the court's later statement that\n\nthe issue of UTC's responsibility for the costs \"need not be decided\"\n\nsuggests that the court ultimately refrained from reaching this\n\nquestion.\n\n            Moreover, it is not clear how the court's statements fit with\n\nits other Phase I and Phase III rulings. Did the court intend merely\n\nto restate the joint and several liability findings against UTC\n\n\n                                 - 110 -\n\ffollowing the Phase I trial, which indisputably included liability for\n\nan estimated $49 million in cleanup costs and $6 million in enforcement\n\ncosts?59 Or did the court intend to allocate the enforcement costs to\n\nUTC, irrespective of the consent decree settlement and the finding that\n\nUTC should bear 1.54 percent share of the total liability?\n\n          The appellants argue that an equitable allocation to UTC of\n\nthe government's enforcement costs would lie within the district\n\ncourt's broad discretionary authority under CERCLA. See Acushnet, 191\n\nF.3d at 77. However, we are not willing to assume that the court made\n\nsuch a finding of causation or equitable allocation without a more\n\ncomplete explication. As a result, we instruct the district court on\n\nremand to explain the intended effect of its statements about UTC's\n\nresponsibility for the government's enforcement costs.60 In remanding\n\nfor clarification of this issue, we do not retain jurisdiction of the\n\ncase. See Clauson v. New England Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n     59By order of May 5, 1995, UTC was adjudged liable for \"all\nunreimbursed costs that have been incurred by the United States of\nAmerica related to the Davis Liquid Waste Site.\"\n     60This remand does not disturb the district court's finding that\nUTC paid more than its fair share of the total enforcement costs. As\nwe have noted, the court translated UTC's 1.54 percent share of\nliability into $754,600 and said that UTC will pay the government at\nleast $10.35 million after contribution is received from the settling\nthird and fourth-party defendants. Thus \"even if the $6 million in\nenforcement costs is viewed as an additional part of UTC's contribution\nthreshold, the threshold clearly is exceeded by UTC's settlement\nobligation of at least $10.35 million.\" Davis IV, 31 F. Supp. 2d at\n69.\n\n                               - 110 -\n\f2001).\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n\n          As a final note, we wish to acknowledge the district court's\n\ncareful attention to this unusually complex case.       Its skillful\n\nmanagement of the case and its cogent decisions over many years\n\nconsiderably aided our disposition of this ganglion of appeals.\n\n          For all of the reasons discussed herein, we affirm the\n\ndeterminations of the district court, with the exception of that\n\nconcerning the issue of whether UTC is solely responsible for $6\n\nmillion in government enforcement costs. On that issue, we remand for\n\na clarification of the district court's position. Each party is to\n\nbear its own costs.\n\n\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 110 -\n\f                             APPENDIX I\n\n           A Roster of Parties, Principals, and Witnesses\n\nAcco-Bristol:               defendant found liable for dumping\n\nAshland:                    defendant found liable for dumping; also\n                            appeals the consent decrees\n\nBFI:                        alleged to be corporate successor of\n                            Macera Brothers; won judgment on partial\n                            findings at the close of UTC's evidence\n\nBlack & Decker:             found to be corporate successor of Gar\n\nAnthony Capuano:            principal of Sanitary Landfill\n\nJack Capuano:               principal of Sanitary Landfill\n\nWilliam Carracino:          principal of CCC\n\nRobert Cece:                principal of Macera Brothers\n\nChemical Control\nCorporation (CCC):          waste hauler located in New Jersey\n\nChemical Waste\nRemoval (CWR):              waste hauler located in Connecticut\n\nWilliam Davis:              owner of the Davis site\n\nElectroformers:             found not to be corporate successor of\n                            Gar\n\nJohnny Granfield:      driver for CWR\n\nWilbert Jones:              driver for CWR\n\nMacera Brothers:            waste hauler that dumped at the Davis\n                            site; won judgment on partial findings\n                            at the close of UTC's evidence\n\nJohn Mayo:                  driver for CCC\n\nMorton:                     defendant found liable for the dumping\n                            of Thiokol; acknowledges successor\n\n                              - 110 -\n\f                      liability for Thiokol\n\nEmanuel Musillo:      principal of CWR\n\nMichael Musillo:      principal of Drum Automation, CWR's\n                      corporate successor\n\nCity of New Jersey:   won judgment on partial findings at the\n                      close of UTC's evidence\n\nPerkin-Elmer (PE):    defendant found liable for dumping\n\nJohn Prahm:           employee of CCC\n\nQualitron:            corporation that dumped at the Davis\n                      site; PE acknowledges successor\n                      liability for Qualitron\n\nSanitary Landfill:    landfill where CWR and CCC dumped waste\n                      before dumping at the Davis site\n\nUnited Technologies\nCorporation (UTC):    found liable in Phase I; sued third and\n                      fourth-party defendants in Phase III\n\n\n\n\n                        - 111 -\n\f                           APPENDIX II\n\n             A Summary of Relevant Monetary Sums\n\nEstimated Total Cost: $55 million\n\nInitial EPA response costs: $19 million\nInitial DOJ enforcement costs: $6 million\nSoil remediation: $14 million\nGroundwater cleanup: $13 million\nWater line extension: $3 million\n\nPhase I\n\nPartial Consent Decree: approximately $5.625 million\n\nClairol: $3 million, plus interest\nPfizer: $1.5 million, plus interest\nProvidence Journal: $650,000, plus interest\nCiba-Geigy: $475,000, plus interest\n\nPhase II\n\nConsent Decree I: $13.5 million, plus $440,000 for government\noversight costs and the expense of soil remediation\n\nAmerican Cyanamid: $2.75 million (portion to settle state claims)\nOlin Hunt: $2.75 million (portion to settle state claims)\nForty-seven non-carve-out parties: $7.2 million\nUTC:      Remainder of settlement, approximately $2.8 million\n          Soil remediation, estimated at $14 million\n          (UTC contribution action recoveries to be split with the\n          United States after deduction of attorneys' fees; UTC\n          recovery capped at $5.364 million)\n\nConsent Decree II: $4.135 million (part to U.S. and part to UTC)\n\nTwenty-three non-carve-out parties: $4.135 million\n\nConsent Decree III: $5 million (part to U.S. and part to UTC)\n\nNational Starch: $5 million\n\nConsent Decree IV: $200,000 (part to U.S. and part to UTC)\n\nSwan Engraving: $150,000\n\n                              - 112 -\n\fPower Semiconductors: $50,000\n\nCapuano Consent Decree: $200,000\n\nCapuano Brothers: $200,000\n\nTotal from Partial Consent Decrees, Phase I and II: approximately $33\nmillion (not including interest on escrowed amounts)\n\n\n\n\n                             - 113 -\n\f</pre>",
