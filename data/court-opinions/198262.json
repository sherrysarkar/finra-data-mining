CORTES-ALEJANDRO,\r\n\n                    Petitioner, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n    KATHERINE HAWK, DIRECTOR OF FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS,\r\n\n                    Respondent, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n        [Hon. Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Luis A. Cortes-Alejandro pro se.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jose A. Quiles\r\nEspinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Jacabed Rodriguez-Coss,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney.\r\n\nDecember 30, 1998\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Petitioner appeals from a denial of a\r\n  petition for collateral relief from his conviction under 28\r\n  U.S.C.  2255, and the denial of a motion for a new trial.  The\r\n  petition was filed in the district court prior to the effective\r\n  date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\r\n  1996 (\"AEDPA\"), so our review is under the habeas statutes\r\n  unaltered by the AEDPA.  See Martin v. Bissonette, 118 F.3d\r\n  871, 873 (1st Cir. 1997).  \r\n            Below, petitioner argued that the government had\r\n  violated its discovery obligations by withholding impeachment\r\n  information about two government witnesses and that \"new\"\r\n  impeachment evidence, acquired after petitioner's conviction,\r\n  warranted a new trial.  The district court rejected the\r\n  arguments, finding that, (1) the government had disclosed to\r\n  the defense all of the impeachment evidence in its possession\r\n  at the time of trial and, even if it had not, the allegedly\r\n  undisclosed evidence was not \"material\" to the outcome of the\r\n  trial; and (2) the \"new\" impeachment evidence acquired after\r\n  the trial was of marginal value and would not likely result in\r\n  an acquittal.\r\n           Having carefully examined the judgement in light of\r\nthe record, the government's brief, and petitioner's filings\r\nbelow,  we affirm.  There is no clear error in the court's\r\nfactual findings and, upon de novo review, we agree that the\r\nallegedly undisclosed impeachment evidence was not \"material\"\r\nto the outcome of the trial.  See United States v. Cunan, 152\r\nF.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 1998) (defining \"material\" evidence in\r\nthis context).  The \"new\" impeachment evidence also was of\r\ndubious materiality, and there was no \"manifest abuse of\r\ndiscretion\" in the district court's denial of the motion for a\r\nnew trial.  United States v. Montilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d 1060,\r\n1064 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    During the pendency of this appeal, petitioner filed\r\na confused \"motion to remand,\" which attacks, for the first\r\ntime on appeal, the legality of his sentence.  Construed as (1)\r\nan attempt to insinuate wholly new issues and arguments on\r\nappeal, the motion is denied.  Alternatively, (2) construed as the functional equivalent of a motion for permission to file a\r\nsecond or successive  2255 petition, permission is denied. \r\nSee Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(holding that when a prisoner's first and second habeas\r\npetitions straddle the AEDPA's effective date, permission to\r\nproceed with the second petition must be sought in the court of\r\nappeals), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1807 (1998).  There are no\r\ngrounds for certification shown in this motion.  See 28 U.S.C.\r\n 2255 (requiring for certification a \"new rule of\r\nconstitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral\r\nreview by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable,\" \r\nor \"newly discovered evidence\" which might establish that\r\npetitioner is not guilty of the offense of conviction). \r\nLastly, (3) construed as a motion arguing for retroactive\r\nrevision of the sentence due to an allegedly applicable change\r\nin the sentencing guidelines   while we entertain very grave\r\ndoubts about the merits of the argument   petitioner is advised\r\nthat permission from this court is not required for the filing\r\nof such a motion.  See 18 U.S.C.  3582(c).\r\n    The judgement is affirmed.  The \"motion to remand,\"\r\nalternatively construed as an application for permission to\r\nfile a successive petition, is denied.\n",
