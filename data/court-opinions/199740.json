This case comes to us on cross\n\nappeals from the district court opinion vacating an arbitral\n\naward as manifestly in disregard of the law.             On August 28,\n\n2000, Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. and Westwood Group, Inc.\n\n(collectively, \"Wonderland\") had been ordered by the arbitrator\n\nto pay Autotote Systems, Inc. $456,043.84 due on a million\n\ndollars advanced by Autotote to Wonderland in 1992.                     The\n\narbitrator   had,   however,   also     found   that   Autotote   was   in\n\nviolation of a divisible contractual obligation to provide\n\nWonderland   with   some    additional    equipment,     which    thereby\n\npermitted Wonderland to terminate the contract.            The district\n\ncourt found these two conclusions to be internally inconsistent\n\nand so vacated the award and remanded to the arbitrator for\n\nproceedings consistent with its opinion.          Wonderland Greyhound\n\nPark, Inc. v. Autotote Sys., Inc., 144 F. Supp. 2d 25, 29 (D.\n\nMass. 2001).   Autotote appeals from that decision.          Wonderland\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fappeals the district court's decision to remand the case to the\n\narbitrator.1\n\n         Our review of the district court's ruling on an\n\narbitration award is de novo.         Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v.\n\nHutson, 229 F.3d 321, 330 (1st Cir. 2000).      Judicial review of\n\nthe arbitrator's decision is \"extremely narrow and exceedingly\n\ndeferential.\"     Id. (quoting Wheelabrator Envirotech Operating\n\nServs. v. Mass. Laborers Dist. Council Local 1144, 88 F.3d 40,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 1996)). An arbitrator's award must be enforced \"if\n\nit is in any way plausible, even if we think [he] committed\n\nserious error.\"    Gupta v. Cisco Sys., Inc., No. 01-1122, 2001 WL\n\n1504671, at *2 (1st Cir. Dec. 3, 2001).     A court may only vacate\n\nan arbitrator's award in very rare circumstances, such as where\n\nthere was misconduct by the arbitrator, where the arbitrator\n\nexceeded the scope of his arbitral authority, or when the award\n\nwas made in manifest disregard of the law.      Bull HN Info. Sys.\n\nInc., 229 F.3d at 330-31; see 9 U.S.C. § 10 (2000).       Although\n\nthe district court articulated the appropriate standard of\n\nreview, we believe it misunderstood the arbitrator’s opinion and\n\n\n    1     Our disposition of this case makes this cross-appeal\nirrelevant.\n\n                                -3-\n\faccordingly     did   not    properly    apply   the   principles.         The\n\narbitrator’s opinion was far from being in manifest disregard of\n\nthe law and the district court was required to affirm it.\n\n           We   start       with   a   preliminary     argument     made   by\n\nWonderland.     Wonderland says that the arbitral award exceeded\n\nthe arbitrator’s authority as to remedy, even if the arbitrator\n\nwas correct that the contract was divisible.                   However, the\n\narbitral   clause     in    the    agreement   contains   no    limitations\n\nwhatsoever on the arbitrator's power, but simply requires the\n\nparties to arbitrate all grievances between them:\n\n           Any controversy or claim not settled by the parties\n           arising out of or relating to this contract, or the\n           breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in\n           accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration\n           Association, and judgement upon the award rendered by\n           the Arbitrator(s) may be entered in any Court having\n           jurisdiction thereof.\n\nWonderland’s argument is based entirely on clauses within the\n\ncontract as to remedies for breach of contract.                   One clause\n\nstates:\n\n           In the event that [Wonderland] shall default in the\n           performance of any provisions of this Agreement on its\n           part to be performed . . . and such default shall not\n           be cured within a period of ten (10) days after notice\n           shall have been given by AUTOTOTE to [Wonderland]\n           specifying such default, then AUTOTOTE may terminate\n           this Agreement by delivering to [Wonderland] written\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           notice of such termination prior to the expiration of\n           thirty (30) days after the expiration of said ten (10)\n           day period; and in the event of any such termination\n           AUTOTOTE shall remove its personnel, materials and\n           equipment from the RACETRACK, and the cost of such\n           removal shall be paid for by [Wonderland].\n\nThere is an identical clause for when Autotote defaults in the\n\nperformance of the contract.            There is also a clause in the\n\ncontract that states:\n\n           The remedies expressly provided in this Agreement for\n           breach thereof by AUTOTOTE or [Wonderland] shall\n           constitute the sole and exclusive remedies to the\n           aggrieved party, and all other remedies which might be\n           otherwise available under the law of any jurisdiction\n           are hereby waived by both AUTOTOTE and [Wonderland].\n\n           It was within the province of the arbitrator to\n\nconstrue the contract, including these remedial provisions, in\n\nthe first instance.     Id. at 330 (\"[I]t is the arbitrator's view\n\n. . . of the meaning of the contract that [the parties] have\n\nagreed to accept.\") (quoting United Paperworkers Int'l Union v.\n\nMisco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 37-38 (1987)).                 Accordingly, it was\n\nwithin   the   power   of   the   arbitrator        to   conclude    that   the\n\ncontractual remedial clause here did not limit the remedy for\n\nWonderland's    failure     to     meet      its    installment      repayment\n\nobligation.    The arbitrator did not exceed the scope of his\n\narbitral   authority    and      the    award      can   therefore   only   be\n\n                                       -5-\n\fchallenged for manifest disregard of the law.             An award is in\n\nmanifest disregard of the law if either \"the award is contrary\n\nto the plain language of the contract,\" or \"it is clear from the\n\nrecord that the arbitrator recognized the applicable law, but\n\nignored it.\"   Gupta, 2001 WL 1504671, at *2.\n\n         To    understand       why   the   arbitral   award,    which   the\n\ndistrict court found to be internally inconsistent, is neither\n\ninconsistent nor in manifest disregard of the law, it is\n\nnecessary to review some of the factual determinations made by\n\nthe arbitrator.   An arbitrator's factual findings are generally\n\n\"not open to judicial challenge,\" El Dorado Technical Servs.,\n\nInc. v. Union General De Trabajadores De Puerto Rico, 961 F.2d\n\n317, 320 (1st Cir. 1992), and \"[w]e accept the facts as the\n\narbitrator found them.\"          Boston Med. Ctr. v. Serv. Employees\n\nInt'l Union, Local 285, 260 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n         Autotote    is     a    provider     of   pari-mutuel    wagering\n\ntotalizer machines and services.2            In 1991 it entered into a\n\ncontract with Wonderland, a greyhound race track.                  In 1992\n\n\n\n    2     A totalizer machine, also known as a totalisator\nmachine or tote machine, is a machine that registers bets and\ndivides the total amount bet among those who won.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fWonderland asked Autotote for a one million dollar loan.               As\n\npart of the consideration for this loan, the 1991 contract was\n\nextended to 1997, and Wonderland agreed that it would repay the\n\nmillion dollar loan at the rate of $4,944.08 weekly, totaling\n\n$257,092.16 annually. Autotote in fact forwarded Wonderland the\n\nmillion dollars as agreed.         In addition, Autotote provided\n\ntotalizer services to Wonderland and was entitled to fees for\n\nthese services.     In 1993, Autotote made another advance of\n\n$325,000 to Wonderland.\n\n          In 1995 the parties executed an extension of the 1991\n\ncontract, which further extended the contract to 1998, and\n\nWonderland reaffirmed its burden to pay weekly installments of\n\n$4,944,   above   and   beyond   the    weekly   payment   of   fees   for\n\ntotalizer services.     Wonderland did not in fact pay for all of\n\nthe totalizer services and there is a stipulation that the sum\n\nowed on that account was $21,747.\n\n          In 1999, the parties again extended their contract.\n\nThis extended the contract retroactively from 1998 for a seven-\n\nyear term.   This amendment reduced the installment payments due\n\nto Autotote from weekly payments of $4,944.08 to weekly payments\n\nof $1,373.63 for a seven-year period, for a total sum of\n\n                                  -7-\n\f$500,000.    The 1999 amendment also required Autotote to supply\n\nWonderland with a specified array of new equipment, including\n\nhardware and software.    The arbitrator found that Autotote had\n\nfailed to supply the new equipment and that this failure was a\n\nmaterial breach of that portion of the 1991 contract as extended\n\nand amended in 1999.    That breach, according to the arbitrator,\n\njustified Wonderland in terminating the contract.    The question\n\nthen became whether the termination of the contract excused\n\nWonderland from repaying the monies advanced to it earlier by\n\nAutotote.\n\n            The arbitrator found that while Autotote’s failure to\n\nprovide the new equipment justified Wonderland’s termination of\n\nthe contract, that did not absolve Wonderland from liability to\n\nAutotote for the weekly fee of $1,373.63 for the seven-year\n\nterm, for a total payment of $500,000.      The arbitrator found\n\nthat Autotote had fulfilled its obligation in 1992 to provide a\n\nmillion dollars and that it was entitled to the benefit of the\n\nbargain as renegotiated in 1999 with respect to the installment\n\npayment contract.    The arbitrator found that the contract was\n\ndivisible and that the effect of the termination was to mature\n\nAutotote’s executory rights for a total payment of $500,000,\n\n                                -8-\n\fless the installments paid.       The arbitrator found that only 32\n\npayments of $1,373.63 had been made, thus entitling Autotote to\n\nan award of $456,043.84 for that portion of the contract.\n\n            On those facts, the arbitrator’s award cannot be said\n\nto be in manifest disregard of the law.         While the arbitrator\n\ndid not use the specific magic words that Wonderland was \"in\n\nbreach\"   of    the   divisible   obligation   with   respect   to   the\n\ninstallment payment stream, he did find that Wonderland failed\n\nto make installment payments and he rejected the reasons given\n\nby Wonderland to excuse its non-payment.       This is sufficient to\n\nestablish breach of contract.\n\n            As to the acceleration of payments, we have already\n\ndisposed of the argument that the arbitrator was limited in his\n\nremedies.      In fact, Autotote had loaned Wonderland a million\n\ndollars in 1992.      There was an agreement to repay the loan on an\n\ninstallment basis, but very few payments had been made over the\n\nyears. The arbitrator’s decision that the payments long overdue\n\nshould now be paid in full cannot be said to be in manifest\n\ndisregard of the law.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f         Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to enter an order enforcing the\n\narbitral award in full.3   Costs are awarded to Autotote.\n\n\n\n\n    3     This includes the award to Autotote of the stipulated\nsum of $21,747 for totalizer services fee arrearages due from\nWonderland, which was inexplicably omitted from the district\ncourt's order.\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

(collectively, \"Wonderland\") had been ordered by the arbitrator to pay Autotote Systems, Inc. $456,043.84 due on a million dollars advanced by Autotote to Wonderland in 1992. The arbitrator had, however, also found that Autotote was in violation of a divisible contractual obligation to provide Wonderland with some additional equipment, which thereby permitted Wonderland to terminate the contract. The district court found these two conclusions to be internally inconsistent and so vacated the award and remanded to the arbitrator for proceedings consistent with its opinion. Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Autotote Sys., Inc., 144 F. Supp. 2d 25, 29 (D. Mass. 2001). Autotote appeals from that decision.

Although the district court articulated the appropriate standard of review, we believe it misunderstood the arbitrator's opinion and accordingly did not properly apply the principles.

Wonderland says that the arbitral award exceeded the arbitrator's authority as to remedy, even if the arbitrator was correct that the contract was divisible. However, the arbitral clause in the agreement contains no limitations whatsoever on the arbitrator's power, but simply requires the parties to arbitrate all grievances between them:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any controversy or claim not settled by the parties arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgement upon the award rendered by the Arbitrator(s) may be entered in any Court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wonderland's argument is based entirely on clauses within the contract as to remedies for breach of contract.

Accordingly, it was within the power of the arbitrator to conclude that the contractual remedial clause here did not limit the remedy for Wonderland's failure to meet its installment repayment obligation. The arbitrator did not exceed the scope of his arbitral authority and the award can therefore only be challenged for manifest disregard of the law. An award is in manifest disregard of the law if either \"the award is contrary to the plain language of the contract,\" or \"it is clear from the record that the arbitrator recognized the applicable law, but ignored it.\" Gupta, 2001 WL 1504671, at *2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand why the arbitral award, which the district court found to be internally inconsistent, is neither inconsistent nor in manifest disregard of the law, it is necessary to review some of the factual determinations made by the arbitrator.

Wonderland did not in fact pay for all of the totalizer services and there is a stipulation that the sum owed on that account was $21,747.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, the parties again extended their contract. This extended the contract retroactively from 1998 for a seven-year term. This amendment reduced the installment payments due to Autotote from weekly payments of $4,944.08 to weekly payments of $1,373.63 for a seven-year period, for a total sum of $500,000. The 1999 amendment also required Autotote to supply Wonderland with a specified array of new equipment, including hardware and software. The arbitrator found that Autotote had failed to supply the new equipment and that this failure was a material breach of that portion of the 1991 contract as extended and amended in 1999. That breach, according to the arbitrator, justified Wonderland in terminating the contract. The question then became whether the termination of the contract excused Wonderland from repaying the monies advanced to it earlier by Autotote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrator found that while Autotote's failure to provide the new equipment justified Wonderland's termination of the contract, that did not absolve Wonderland from liability to Autotote for the weekly fee of $1,373.63 for the seven-year term, for a total payment of $500,000. The arbitrator found that Autotote had fulfilled its obligation in 1992 to provide a million dollars and that it was entitled to the benefit of the bargain as renegotiated in 1999 with respect to the installment payment contract. The arbitrator found that the contract was divisible and that the effect of the termination was to mature Autotote's executory rights for a total payment of $500,000, less the installments paid. The arbitrator found that only 32 payments of $1,373.63 had been made, thus entitling Autotote to an award of $456,043.84 for that portion of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On those facts, the arbitrator's award cannot be said to be in manifest disregard of the law. While the arbitrator did not use the specific magic words that Wonderland was \"in breach\" of the divisible obligation with respect to the installment payment stream, he did find that Wonderland failed to make installment payments and he rejected the reasons given by Wonderland to excuse its non-payment. This is sufficient to establish breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the acceleration of payments, we have already disposed of the argument that the arbitrator was limited in his remedies. In fact, Autotote had loaned Wonderland a million dollars in 1992. There was an agreement to repay the loan on an installment basis, but very few payments had been made over the years. The arbitrator's decision that the payments long overdue should now be paid in full cannot be said to be in manifest disregard of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court with instructions to enter an order enforcing the arbitral award in full.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Costs are awarded to Autotote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Our disposition of this case makes this cross-appeal irrelevant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  A totalizer machine, also known as a totalisator machine or tote machine, is a machine that registers bets and divides the total amount bet among those who won.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  This includes the award to Autotote of the stipulated sum of $21,747 for totalizer services fee arrearages due from Wonderland, which was inexplicably omitted from the district court's order.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

On August 28, 2000, Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. and Westwood Group, Inc. (collectively, \"Wonderland\") had been ordered by the arbitrator to pay Autotote Systems, Inc. $456,043.84 due on a million dollars advanced by Autotote to Wonderland in 1992. The arbitrator had, however, also found that Autotote was in violation of a divisible contractual obligation to provide Wonderland with some additional equipment, which thereby permitted Wonderland to terminate the contract. The district court found these two conclusions to be internally inconsistent and so vacated the award and remanded to the arbitrator for proceedings consistent with its opinion.

Dec. 3, 2001). A court may only vacate an arbitrator's award in very rare circumstances, such as where there was misconduct by the arbitrator, where the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his arbitral authority, or when the award was made in manifest disregard of the law. Bull HN Info. Sys. Inc., 229 F.3d at 330-31; see 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10 (2000). Although the district court articulated the appropriate standard of review, we believe it misunderstood the arbitrator's opinion and accordingly did not properly apply the principles. The arbitrator's opinion was far from being in manifest disregard of the law and the district court was required to affirm it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with a preliminary argument made by Wonderland. Wonderland says that the arbitral award exceeded the arbitrator's authority as to remedy, even if the arbitrator was correct that the contract was divisible. However, the arbitral clause in the agreement contains no limitations whatsoever on the arbitrator's power, but simply requires the parties to arbitrate all grievances between them:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any controversy or claim not settled by the parties arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgement upon the award rendered by the Arbitrator(s) may be entered in any Court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wonderland's argument is based entirely on clauses within the contract as to remedies for breach of contract. One clause states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event that [Wonderland] shall default in the performance of any provisions of this Agreement on its part to be performed . . . and such default shall not be cured within a period of ten (10) days after notice shall have been given by AUTOTOTE to [Wonderland] specifying such default, then AUTOTOTE may terminate this Agreement by delivering to [Wonderland] written notice of such termination prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after the expiration of said ten (10) day period; and in the event of any such termination AUTOTOTE shall remove its personnel, materials and equipment from the RACETRACK, and the cost of such removal shall be paid for by [Wonderland].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an identical clause for when Autotote defaults in the performance of the contract. There is also a clause in the contract that states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remedies expressly provided in this Agreement for breach thereof by AUTOTOTE or [Wonderland] shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies to the aggrieved party, and all other remedies which might be otherwise available under the law of any jurisdiction are hereby waived by both AUTOTOTE and [Wonderland].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was within the province of the arbitrator to construe the contract, including these remedial provisions, in the first instance. Id. at 330 (\"[I]t is the arbitrator's view . . . of the meaning of the contract that [the parties] have agreed to accept.\") (quoting United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 37-38 (1987)). Accordingly, it was within the power of the arbitrator to conclude that the contractual remedial clause here did not limit the remedy for Wonderland's failure to meet its installment repayment obligation. The arbitrator did not exceed the scope of his arbitral authority and the award can therefore only be challenged for manifest disregard of the law. An award is in manifest disregard of the law if either \"the award is contrary to the plain language of the contract,\" or \"it is clear from the record that the arbitrator recognized the applicable law, but ignored it.\" Gupta, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1504671</span></span>, at *2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand why the arbitral award, which the district court found to be internally inconsistent, is neither inconsistent nor in manifest disregard of the law, it is necessary to review some of the factual determinations made by the arbitrator.
