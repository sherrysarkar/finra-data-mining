This suit arises out of a dispute\n\nover a cable franchise for the Town of Houlton, Maine (\"Town\").                  In\n\nearly 1999, the Town decided not to renew the franchise held by\n\nNEPSK, Inc., d/b/a Houlton Cable (\"Houlton Cable\").                    Instead, it\n\nsought      competitive     proposals     for    a    new   cable   franchise,   and\n\neventually awarded the franchise to Houlton Cable's competitor,\n\nPine Tree Cablevision Associates (\"Pine Tree\"). Houlton Cable then\n\ncommenced this suit against the Town, alleging multiple violations\n\nof the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended by the\n\nCable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992\nand the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (codified in pertinent part\nat 47 U.S.C. §§ 521-573) (the \"Act\").                 The district court granted\n\nthe Town's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to two counts of\nthe complaint, based on Houlton Cable's failure to respond to the\nmotion as required by District of Maine Local Rule 7(b).                     Several\n\nmonths later, the court entered summary judgment for the Town on\nthe remaining count of the complaint.                   Houlton Cable challenges\nboth decisions.        We affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n               On   April   23,   1984,    the       Town   entered   into   a cable\n\nfranchise agreement with Houlton Cable's predecessor, Houlton CATV,\n\nInc.1       The franchise ran for a period of 15 years, and was set to\n\nexpire in April of 1999.          Under federal law, 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-\n\n        1\n       With the exception of certain services not relevant here, \"a\ncable operator may not provide cable service without a franchise.\"\n47 U.S.C. § 541(b).\n\n                                          -2-\n\f(g),   Houlton    Cable    was       entitled    to    initiate      formal   renewal\n\nprocedures by submitting a written request to the Town between\n\nApril and October, 1996.             If neither Houlton Cable nor the Town\ntook action within that six-month window, the renewal process would\n\nbe governed by the informal procedures set out in § 546(h).\n\n           Houlton Cable submitted a renewal proposal in November,\n1997, well      after    the    expiration      of    the    six-month     period   for\n\ninitiation of formal procedures. For several months, the Town took\n\nno action on the proposal.               Then, in April of 1998, the Town\n\nCouncil voted to \"invite new applications for the Houlton Cable\n\nfranchise.\"       Consistent      with    the    informal      renewal     procedures\n\nprescribed by § 546(h), the Town scheduled a public hearing to\n\naddress the cable franchise issue.                   Following that hearing, in\nFebruary of 2000, the Town Council decided not to renew Houlton\n\nCable's   franchise      and    to    solicit    bids       from   other   providers.\n\nMinutes from the public hearing and the Town Council's subsequent\nmeeting indicate that Houlton Cable's refusal to provide high-speed\n\nInternet access to its subscribers was a major factor in the Town's\n\ndecision to reject the renewal proposal.\n\n           On    March    31,    2000,    the    Town       issued   a   Request    for\n\nProposals (\"RFP\") soliciting proposals for a new, ten-year cable\n\nfranchise.      As the RFP made clear, the Town did not believe it\n\ncould support more than one franchise.                       Although it had not\n\nundertaken any detailed analysis of the issue, the Town was aware\n\nthat no municipality in Maine -- including those much larger than\n\nHoulton -- was served by more than one cable company. Accordingly,\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthe Town explained in the RFP that it planned to award only one\n\nfranchise:\n\n            The Town of Houlton recognizes that it cannot\n            award an exclusive cable television franchise\n            to any applicant. Nevertheless, the Town also\n            recognizes that the Town of Houlton can only\n            feasibly   support   one   cable   television\n            franchise at one time. Accordingly, the Town\n            intends to award only one cable television\n            franchise during the next ten year period,\n            which will be the franchise as a result of\n            this RFP process.\n\n             The Town received proposals from two parties, Houlton\n\nCable and Pine Tree.       After considering both proposals, the Town\n\ndetermined that Pine Tree's \"most closely [met] the needs of the\n\nTown as determined by public surveys and [the earlier] public\nhearing.\"     At a meeting in May, 2000, the Town Council voted to\n\nreject Houlton Cable's proposal, and to pursue negotiations with\n\nPine Tree.\n             Houlton Cable then initiated this suit against the Town.\n\nCount I of its complaint alleged that the Town violated the Act by\n\nfailing to comply with the formal renewal procedures set forth in\n\n§ 546(a)-(g).     Count II alleged that the Town had conditioned the\n\nrenewal of Houlton Cable's franchise on Houlton Cable's willingness\n\nto provide high speed internet service to its subscribers.         Such a\n\ndemand,      Houlton     Cable     maintained,    violated    47   U.S.C.\n\n§   541(b)(3)(D),      which   prohibits   franchising   authorities   from\n\nrequiring cable operators to provide certain \"telecommunication\n\nservice[s]\" as a condition of a franchise award, and 47 U.S.C.\n\n§ 544(e), which states that \"[n]o State or franchising authority\n\nmay prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any\n\n                                     -4-\n\ftype of . . . transmission technology.\" Finally, Count III alleged\n\nthat the     Town    unreasonably     refused    to    award      Houlton    Cable   a\n\n\"second\" franchise, in violation of 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1).\n             After answering the complaint, the Town moved under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(c) for judgment on the pleadings as to Counts I and\n\nII.    With respect to Count I, the Town argued that, since neither\nHoulton Cable nor the Town had initiated formal renewal procedures\n\nduring the six-month window, the renewal process properly was\n\ngoverned by the informal procedures authorized by § 456(h).                          In\n\nresponse to Count II, the Town contended that the Act did not apply\n\nretroactively       to   invalidate    the   terms     of   the    1984     Franchise\n\nAgreement, which provided that the decision as to renewal was\n\ncommitted to the Town's discretion, and would be based in part on\n\"the development of cable services.\"             In the alternative, the Town\n\nargued     that      high-speed       internet       access       is   neither        a\n\n\"telecommunication service\" nor a \"transmission technology,\" and\ntherefore is not governed by §§ 541(b)(3)(D)(a) and 544(e) of the\n\nAct.\n\n             Pursuant to Local Rule 7(b) of the District of Maine,\n\nHoulton Cable was obligated to respond to the Town's motion within\n\nten days.2    Houlton Cable did not so respond, and, accordingly, was\n\ndeemed to have consented to the motion.               Thus, on December 7, 2000\n\n-- one day after the ten-day period had expired -- the district\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       Rule 7(b) has since been amended to permit response \"within\ntwenty-one (21) days after the filing of a motion.\"\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcourt entered judgment for the Town on Counts I and II \"per Local\n\nRule 7(b).\"\n           Houlton Cable filed a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e),\nasking the court to reconsider and vacate its December 7 judgment.\n\nIt argued that the district court could not enter judgment on the\npleadings without first satisfying itself that the Town was in fact\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.          The court granted the\nmotion for reconsideration, but reaffirmed its initial judgment.\nRule 12(c), the court noted, does not prescribe any particular\nstandard of decision; therefore, it does not prohibit the entry of\n\njudgment on the basis of noncompliance with a local waiver rule,\n\nwithout consideration of the merits of the motion.               Given the\n\nabsence of a direct conflict between Federal Rule 12(c) and Local\nRule 7(b), the court concluded that it was entitled to enforce its\n\nlocal rule strictly.\n\n           The Town then moved for summary judgment on Count III of\nHoulton   Cable's   complaint,    arguing    that     the   provisions   of\n\n§   541(a)(1)   governing   applications    for   a   second,   competitive\n\nfranchise did not apply to the Town's choice to award an initial\nfranchise to one provider rather than another.          The court3 agreed,\n\nand entered judgment for the Town on Count III.             Houlton Cable\n\nfiled a timely notice of appeal, challenging the district court's\n\n\n\n      3\n       After the district court dismissed Counts I and II of\nHoulton Cable's complaint, the parties consented to further\nproceedings in the case before a magistrate judge. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 73(b). For the sake of simplicity, we refer to both the\nmagistrate judge and the district court judge as the \"district\ncourt\" or the \"court.\"\n\n                                  -6-\n\fDecember 7 grant of judgment on the pleadings as to Counts I and\n\nII, its refusal to rescind that judgment under Rule 59(e), and its\ngrant of summary judgment on Count III.\n\n                                II.\n\n          We turn, first, to the district court's decisions with\nrespect to Counts I and II.     In granting the Town's motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings, the court relied on District of Maine\n\nLocal Rule 7(b), which then provided:\n          Unless within ten (10) days after the filing\n          of a motion the opposing party files written\n          objection thereto, incorporating a memorandum\n          of law, the opposing party shall be deemed to\n          have waived objection.\nHoulton Cable conceded that it did not comply with that rule, and\nthat its failure to file a timely response did not constitute\n\n\"excusable neglect,\" permitting reconsideration under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 60(b)(1).   Thus, Houlton Cable sought relief under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 59(e) on the ground that the district court's judgment was based\n\non an error of law.   See Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez, 22 F.3d\n\n384, 390 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining that Rule 59(e) is the proper\nvehicle for a party seeking to overturn a judgment on the basis of\n\nalleged legal errors).    Maintaining that Rule 12(c) requires a\ndecision on the merits, it argued that the district court erred as\n\na matter of law when it granted the Town's motion for judgment on\nthe pleadings solely on the basis of a local \"deemed waiver\" rule\nlike Rule 7(b).\n\n          Houlton Cable renews that argument on appeal.   We review\nthe district court's initial application of its local rule for\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fabuse of discretion.   CMM Cable Rep, Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props.,\n\nInc., 97 F.3d 1504, 1528 (1st Cir. 1996).            We apply the same\nstandard to the district court's denial of a Rule 59(e) motion to\nalter or amend the judgment.    See Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271,\n\n289 (1st Cir. 1993).   However, the court's interpretation of Rule\n12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure presents a legal\nquestion, which we review de novo.         See Sec. & Exch. Comm'n v.\nSargent, 229 F.3d 68, 79 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Local Rule 7(b) and its predecessor, District of Maine\nLocal Rule 19(c), have been in existence for almost 20 years.4\n\nCourts in the District of Maine routinely apply such rules in\n\nsituations where the opposing party fails to file an objection to\n\na motion, regardless of whether the motion is dispositive.           See,\n\ne.g., Cardente v. Fleet Bank, 796 F. Supp. 603 (D. Me. 1992) (Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss); United Transp. Union v. Me. Cent. R.R.\n\nCo., 107 F.R.D. 383, 383-84 (D. Me. 1985) (motion to dismiss for\nlack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue); Gideon v. Adm'r,\n\nUnited States Small Bus. Admin., 102 F.R.D. 604 (D. Me. 1984)\n\n(motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction); see\nalso Desjardins v. Van Buren Cmty. Hosp., 969 F.2d 1280 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (affirming,   against    First    Amendment   challenge,   district\n\ncourt's order requiring defendant to make a public apology, on\n\nground that district court properly relied on Local Rule 19(c) to\nfind that defendant waived objection to plaintiff's motion to\n\n     4\n      Local Rule 19(c) provided: \"Unless within 10 days after the\nfiling of a motion the opposing party files a written objection\nthereto, he shall be deemed to have waived objection.\"\n\n                                  -8-\n\fcompel apology).    Other districts throughout the country have\n\nadopted similar rules5 to \"ensure the orderly, efficient, and\nexpeditious management of the extensive motion practice\" of the\ndistrict courts.   McDermott v. Lehman, 594 F. Supp. 1315, 1319 (D.\n\nMe. 1984).\n          We have recognized that \"[d]istrict courts enjoy broad\nlatitude\" in adopting and administering such local rules. Air Line\n\nPilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 26 F.3d 220, 224\n(1st Cir. 1994); see also, e.g., Ramsdell v. Bowles, 64 F.3d 5, 7\n(1st Cir. 1995) (acknowledging the district court's \"great leeway\n\nin the application and enforcement of its local rules\").        In\n\nexercising that discretion, district courts may, where appropriate,\n\n\"demand adherence to specific mandates contained in the rules.\"\nAir Line Pilots Ass'n, 26 F.3d at 224.    For example, in Corey v.\n\nMast Road Grain & Bldg. Materials Co., Inc., 738 F.2d 11 (1st Cir.\n\n1984) (per curiam), the defendants moved for dismissal under Fed.\n\n     5\n       See, e.g., D. Ariz. LR 1.10(i) (\"If a motion does not\nconform in all substantial respects with the requirements of this\nRule, or if the opposing party does not serve and file the required\nanswering memoranda, . . . such non-compliance may be deemed a\nconsent to the denial or granting of the motion and the Court may\ndispose of the motion summarily.\"); C.D. Ill. LR 7.1(B)(1) (\"If no\nresponse memorandum is filed within [14 days after service of a\nmotion], the presiding judge will presume there is no opposition\nand may rule on the motion without further notice to the\nparties.\"); N.D. Ind. LR 7.1(a) (\"Failure to file a response\n[within 15 days after service of a motion] may subject the motion\nto summary ruling.\"); D.N.H. LR 7.1(b) (\"The court shall deem\nwaived any objection not filed in accordance [within 10 days from\nthe date the motion was filed].\"); D.N.M. LR-Civ. 7.5(b) (\"Failure\nto serve (or file, if required by these rules) a response in\nopposition to any motion constitutes consent to grant the\nmotion.\"); D. Nev. LR-Civ. 7-2(d) (\"The failure of an opposing\nparty to file points and authorities in response to any motion\nshall constitute a consent to the granting of the motion.\").\n\n                                -9-\n\fR. Civ. P. 12(b) for lack of personal jurisdiction.         The district\n\ncourt granted the motion on the basis of the plaintiff's failure to\nfile a timely response, as required by Local Rule 12 of the\nDistrict of Massachusetts.     It later denied the plaintiff's Rule\n\n60(b)(1) motion for relief from the judgment. We affirmed, stating\nthat \"[t]he district court was entitled to insist upon compliance\nwith its local rule in these circumstances.\"       Id. at 12 (citing In\n\nre Harbour House Operating Corp., 724 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1983)\n(strictly applying Rule 3(b) of the First Circuit Rules governing\nbankruptcy appeals)).    Given plaintiff's failure to establish that\n\nher tardiness was caused by excusable neglect, we concluded that\n\n\"the   court   could    properly    decline   to   excuse    plaintiff's\n\nnoncompliance with the local rule.\"           Id.; accord Stanciel v.\n\nGramley, 267 F.3d 575, 579 (7th Cir. 2001) (affirming district\n\ncourt's grant of motion to dismiss on the basis of noncompliance\n\nwith local rule requiring response within 14 days); Tobel v. City\n\nof Hammond, 94 F.3d 360, 361-62 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"Plaintiffs'\n\nlawyers admit that they were not aware of the Local Rule.        This is\n\nthe end of the matter because the district court clearly has\nauthority to enforce strictly its Local Rules, even if a default\n\nresults.\"); Ghazali v. Moran, 46 F.3d 52, 53 (9th Cir. 1995)\n\n(\"Failure to follow a district court's local rules is a proper\n\nground for dismissal.\").\n          We reached a similar result in United States v. Proceeds\n\nof Sale of 3,888 Pounds of Atlantic Sea Scallops, 857 F.2d 46 (1st\n\nCir. 1988). There, the government had filed a forfeiture action in\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fRhode Island district court, hoping to obtain title to the value of\n\ncertain sea scallops it had seized.        Roughly one month later, the\ndefendant filed a combined \"answer and claim,\" which the government\nmoved to strike as untimely. The district court granted the motion\n\nto strike, based on the defendant's failure to respond within ten\ndays as required by Local Rule 12(a)(2). The government then moved\nfor a default judgment on the ground that the defendant's claim and\nanswer had been stricken.     The district court granted that motion\nas well, reaffirming its decision on the defendant's Rule 60(b)\nmotion for reconsideration.\n\n           Again, we affirmed.    As in Corey, we concluded that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant\n\nfavorable reconsideration under Rule 60(b)(1) in the absence of a\nshowing   of   excusable   neglect.      See    id.   at   49    (finding   that\n\ndefendant's alleged reliance on erroneous advice from local counsel\n\ndid not excuse untimely filings).         We continued:          \"We also agree\nwith the district court that a default judgment may stand even\n\nwhere there has been no showing of substantial prejudice to the\n\nparty benefitting from the default.            A district court simply may\n\ninsist upon compliance with its local rules.\"              Id.\n\n           As our holdings in Corey and Sea Scallops make clear, it\n\nis within the district court's discretion to dismiss an action\n\nbased on a party's unexcused failure to respond to a dispositive\nmotion when such response is required by local rule, at least when\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe   result   does   not   clearly    offend   equity.6   See   Pinto   v.\n\nUniversidad de Puerto Rico, 895 F.2d 18, 19 & n.1 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(\"We do not agree with defendant that a court may, without notice,\ntake a failure to respond to a motion to dismiss as a default,\n\nwarranting dismissal irrespective of substantive merit. . . . To be\ndistinguished is where a court had ordered a memorandum, and, of\ncourse, cases where a response was required by rule.\" (citing Sea\n\nScallops and Corey)).         It is equally clear, however, that a\ndistrict court cannot enforce its local rules in a way that\nconflicts with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.         See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 83(a)(1); Jaroma v. Massey, 873 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(\"Local district court rules cannot be construed in such a way as\n\n\n      6\n       We have cautioned that this discretion \"is not unbridled.\"\nUnited States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1992).       In\nRoberts, we held that the district court abused its discretion in\ndenying the government's motion to reconsider an order granting the\ndefendant's motion to suppress certain evidence as unopposed under\nMaine's Local Rule 19(c) (the predecessor to Rule 7(b)). Unlike\nHoulton Cable, the government in Roberts argued that its failure to\ncomply with the local rule was caused by excusable neglect. We\nfound that argument persuasive, and concluded that \"the lower court\nprobably undervalued the worth of the [government's] explanation.\"\nId. at 22.    We also noted that \"it would have helped\" if the\ndistrict court had considered several other factors in deciding the\ngovernment's motion to reconsider. Id. at 21-22 (listing factors\nsuch as the degree of tardiness, the nature of the case, and \"the\neffect of granting (or denying) the motion on the administration of\njustice\").\n     This case does not require us to determine whether and how\nRoberts might apply where, as here, the tardy party failed to offer\na \"credible explanation of what [went] wrong.\" Id. at 25. Houlton\nCable does not argue that the district court erred by failing to\ntake into account equitable considerations like those we outlined\nin Roberts. Instead, in both the district court and on appeal,\nHoulton Cable has argued only that the court's strict application\nof Local Rule 7(b) creates an impermissible conflict with Federal\nRule 12(c). As we explain below, the district court did not err in\nrejecting that argument.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fto render them inconsistent with applicable provisions of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.\").\n          As Houlton Cable points out, we have identified such a\nconflict in the context of motions for summary judgment filed under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56.    Rule 56(e) specifies that, if such a motion\nis unopposed, the district court may grant summary judgment \"if\nappropriate.\"   \"Under this provision it is clear that '[w]here the\nevidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the\nabsence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied even if\nno opposing evidentiary matter is presented.'\" Jaroma, 873 F.2d at\n\n20 (quoting Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722\n\nF.2d 922, 929 (1st Cir. 1983)).    Thus, a district court may not\n\nautomatically grant a motion for summary judgment simply because\nthe opposing party failed to comply with a local rule requiring a\n\nresponse within a certain number of days.   Rather, the court must\n\ndetermine whether summary judgment is \"appropriate,\" which means\nthat it must assure itself that the moving party's submission shows\n\nthat \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Advisory Committee Note to Rule 56\n\n(\"Where the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not\n\nestablish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be\n\ndenied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.\").\n          Given the potential tension between Rule 56(e) and local\n\nrules such as the District of Maine's Rule 7(b), we have recognized\n\nthe need to interpret local waiver rules \"so as to preserve [their]\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fscope and validity without running afoul of the requirements of\n\nRule 56.\"      Jaroma, 873 F.2d at 20.   To that end, in the summary\njudgment context we read the \"deemed waiver\" provision of the local\nrules to extend only to waiver of objection to the moving party's\n\nfactual assertions.     By failing to file the required response\nwithin the time prescribed by the applicable local rule, the non-\nmoving party\n            waives the right to controvert the facts\n            asserted by the moving party in the motion for\n            summary judgment and the supporting materials\n            accompanying it.    The court will accept as\n            true all material facts set forth by the\n            moving party with appropriate record support.\n            If those facts entitle the moving party to\n            judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment\n            will be granted.\n\nJaroma, 873 F.2d at 21 (emphasis added); see also McDermott, 594 F.\n\nSupp. at 1321 (same).\n\n            Houlton Cable argues that the district court's obligation\n\nto address the merits of a motion for summary judgment should\nextend as well to Rule 12(c) motions for judgment on the pleadings.\n\nIt emphasizes that a party seeking judgment on the pleadings under\n\nRule 12(c) will make precisely the same arguments as a party\n\nseeking summary judgment under Rule 56; namely, that \"no material\n\nissue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\"    5A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.\n\nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1368, at 518 (2d ed. 1990);\n\nLefebvre v. Comm'r, 830 F.2d 417, 419 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam)\n\n(describing standard for Rule 12(c)).    The only difference is that\n\na Rule 12(c) motion must be filed at the close of pleadings, and\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fmust be based solely on the factual allegations in the complaint\n\nand answer, whereas a motion for summary judgment may be filed at\nany time, and may be supported by additional materials such as\naffidavits, depositions, and the like.        Compare Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(c) with Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.          Such procedural differences,\nHoulton   Cable   maintains,   should   not   obscure   the    fundamental\nsimilarity between the substance of a Rule 12(c) motion on the one\nhand, and a Rule 56 motion on the other.        Given that similarity,\nHoulton Cable insists that the district court cannot rely on its\nlocal rule to grant a Rule 12(c) motion, when it could not do the\n\nsame if the motion had been filed under Rule 56.\n\n           Although that argument is not without force, it ignores\n\nan important -- and, in our view, dispositive -- difference between\nthe two federal rules.   Unlike Rule 56, nothing in the text of Rule\n\n12(c) compels the court to apply any particular standard when\n\ndeciding whether to grant or deny a motion for judgment on the\npleadings.   Rule 12(c) provides that, \"[a]fter the pleadings are\n\nclosed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party\n\nmay move for judgment on the pleadings.\"         As the district court\nobserved, the rule \"poses no standard or regime by which the Court\n\nshall decide the issues generated by the motion.\"             By contrast,\n\nRule 56(c) specifically states that summary judgment \"shall\" be\n\ngranted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fMoreover, Rule 56 explicitly addresses the possibility that the\n\nnon-moving party will not respond to the motion, and provides that\nsummary judgment may be entered in such circumstances only \"if\nappropriate.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).          Rule 12(c), on the other\n\nhand, does not require the court to make any such determination\nbefore granting the motion.\n             Given Rule 12(c)'s silence on the subject, we cannot\nconclude that the district court's strict enforcement of Local Rule\n7(b) creates an impermissible conflict with federal Rule 12(c). As\nthe district court put it, \"[t]here is simply no reason contained\n\nin   [Rule   12(c)]   or   its   intendment   to    prevent   an   otherwise\n\nappropriate and enforceable rule of default, i.e. Local Rule 7(b),\n\nfrom operating on a motion under Rule 12(c) without consideration\nby the court of its merits.\"          Accord Tobel, 94 F.3d at 362-63\n\n(affirming grant of motion for judgment on the pleadings based on\n\nopposing party's failure to respond as required by local rule);\nGhazali, 46 F.3d at 54 (reasoning that standards governing summary\n\njudgment motions do not apply to motions to dismiss, and holding\n\nthat district court did not abuse its discretion in granting motion\nto   dismiss    for   noncompliance   with    a    local   rule    specifying\n\nrequirements for response).       We agree, and hold that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in insisting on compliance with\n\nits local rule and in rejecting Houlton Cable's assertion of legal\nerror under Rule 59(e).\n\n                                    III.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f             We turn to Houlton Cable's claim that the district court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment to the Town on Count III of the\ncomplaint.     As noted, Count III asserted a claim for relief based\non an alleged violation of 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1), which provides:\n\n             A   franchising   authority   may   award,   in\n             accordance with the provisions of this\n             subchapter, 1 or more franchises within its\n             jurisdiction;   except   that   a   franchising\n             authority may not grant an exclusive franchise\n             and may not unreasonably refuse to award an\n             additional   competitive    franchise.      Any\n             applicant whose application for a second\n             franchise has been denied by a final decision\n             of the franchising authority may appeal such\n             final decision pursuant to the provisions of\n             section 555 of this title for failure to\n             comply with this subsection.\n\nSection 555, in turn, authorizes \"[a]ny cable operator adversely\n\naffected by any final determination made by a franchising authority\nunder section 541(a)(1)\" to appeal that decision to the federal\n\ndistrict court in the district in which the cable system is\n\nlocated.     47 U.S.C. § 555(a).\n             As far as we can tell, the question whether § 541(a)(1)\n\ncreates a cause of action for a cable provider that lost out in a\n\ncompetitive bidding process for a single franchise is one of first\n\nimpression.     By its terms, § 541(a)(1) governs only applications\n\nfor a \"second\" franchise. Thus, the parties agree that § 541(a)(1)\n\ndoes   not   speak   to   the   Town's   decision   to   award    the   initial\n\nfranchise to Pine Tree instead of Houlton Cable.                 Houlton Cable\nargues, however, that once the Town decided to award a franchise to\n\nPine Tree, it was obligated to determine whether it also should\n\naward Houlton Cable an \"additional competitive\" franchise. Because\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fthe    Town   readily     admits      that    it    never   even   considered    that\n\nquestion, Houlton Cable maintains that the outright denial of its\nfranchise proposal was \"unreasonabl[e]\" within the meaning of\n§ 541(a)(1).\n\n              The difficulty with that argument is that Houlton Cable\nnever submitted an application for a \"second\" franchise.                       Hence,\nthe Town never refused such an application, unreasonably or not.\nThe RFP made clear that the Town was soliciting bids for a single\nfranchise.      Houlton Cable's proposal -- submitted in response to\nthe RFP -- was, therefore, an application for that first, single\n\nfranchise.       Nowhere in its proposal did Houlton Cable indicate\n\nthat, if the Town decided to grant the initial franchise to Pine\n\nTree,    Houlton    Cable    wished      to    be    considered      for   a   second,\ncompetitive franchise.\n\n              Houlton Cable concedes as much.               However, it maintains\n\nthat such a desire can be assumed whenever two or more providers\nsubmit applications for a single franchise.                    In Houlton Cable's\n\nview, the losing co-applicant necessarily must be considered as an\n\napplicant for a second franchise, whether or not it explicitly\nasked for such treatment.             We disagree.      It is one thing to apply\n\nfor a single franchise; it is quite another to apply for a second,\n\ncompetitive franchise.           The latter may be far less profitable and,\n\ntherefore, far less attractive. As a result, it cannot be presumed\nthat    an    applicant    for    a    first    franchise     also    wishes    to   be\n\nconsidered for a second, competitive franchise.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f           Moreover, as the district court aptly observed, the\n\ninformation a franchising authority -- and a reviewing court --\nwould consider in assessing an application for a second franchise\nmight be very different from the type of information needed to\n\nweigh the strengths and weaknesses of competing applications for a\nfirst   franchise.       The      choice     of    one     provider    over   another\nimplicates questions such as which provider offers the better\npackage of services, and at the best price.                      By contrast, the\ndecision whether to award a second franchise (once one has been\nestablished)    raises      a    different      set   of   concerns:      Could   the\n\nmunicipality's infrastructure support two cable grids? Would it be\n\ntechnically feasible for a second provider to build its own system\n\nover the existing one?             Cf. City of Los Angeles v. Preferred\n\nCommunications, Inc., 476 U.S. 488, 495 (1986) (noting that factors\n\nsuch as \"the present uses of the public utility poles and rights-\n\nof-way and     how   [the       cable   operator]     proposes    to    install   and\nmaintain its facilities on them\" were relevant to the question\n\nwhether the City violated the First Amendment by refusing to grant\n\nmore than one cable franchise).\n\n           Of course, both sets of questions could be addressed at\n\nonce, in the initial selection process.                    But it does not follow\n\nthat they must be, or that the Town is obligated to raise the issue\n\nof a second franchise sua sponte.                 Rather, if an applicant like\nHoulton Cable wishes to be considered for a second franchise in the\n\nevent it is not chosen for the first, it must make that desire\n\nexplicit in its proposal.           Unless and until Houlton Cable submits\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f-- and the Town refuses -- an actual \"request\" for a \"second\"\n\nfranchise, it has no cause for complaint under § 541(a)(1).

In early 1999, the Town decided not to renew the franchise held by NEPSK, Inc., d/b/a Houlton Cable (\"Houlton Cable\"). Instead, it sought competitive proposals for a new cable franchise, and eventually awarded the franchise to Houlton Cable's competitor, Pine Tree Cablevision Associates (\"Pine Tree\"). Houlton Cable then commenced this suit against the Town, alleging multiple violations of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (codified in pertinent part at 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 521-573) (the \"Act\"). The district court granted the Town's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to two counts of the complaint, based on Houlton Cable's failure to respond to the motion as required by District of Maine Local Rule 7(b). Several months later, the court entered summary judgment for the Town on the remaining count of the complaint. Houlton Cable challenges both decisions. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 23, 1984, the Town entered into a cable franchise agreement with Houlton Cable's predecessor, Houlton CATV, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The franchise ran for a period of 15 years, and was set to expire in April of 1999. Under federal law, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 546(a)-(g), Houlton Cable was entitled to initiate formal renewal procedures by submitting a written request to the Town between April and October, 1996. If neither Houlton Cable nor the Town took action within that six-month window, the renewal process would be governed by the informal procedures set out in &#167; 546(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable submitted a renewal proposal in November, 1997, well after the expiration of the six-month period for initiation of formal procedures. For several months, the Town took no action on the proposal. Then, in April of 1998, the Town Council voted to \"invite new applications for the Houlton Cable franchise.\" Consistent with the informal renewal procedures prescribed by &#167; 546(h), the Town scheduled a public hearing to address the cable franchise issue. Following that hearing, in February of 2000, the Town Council decided not to renew Houlton Cable's franchise and to solicit bids from other providers. Minutes from the public hearing and the Town Council's subsequent meeting indicate that Houlton Cable's refusal to provide high-speed Internet access to its subscribers was a major factor in the Town's decision to reject the renewal proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 2000, the Town issued a Request for Proposals (\"RFP\") soliciting proposals for a new, ten-year cable franchise. As the RFP made clear, the Town did not believe it could support more than one franchise. Although it had not undertaken any detailed analysis of the issue, the Town was aware that no municipality in Maine &#8212; including those much larger than Houlton &#8212; was served by more than one cable company. Accordingly, the Town explained in the RFP that it planned to award only one franchise:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town of Houlton recognizes that it cannot award an exclusive cable television franchise to any applicant. Nevertheless, the Town also recognizes that the Town of Houlton can only feasibly support one cable television franchise at one time. Accordingly, the Town intends to award only one cable television franchise during the next ten year period, which will be the franchise as a result of this RFP process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town received proposals from two parties, Houlton Cable and Pine Tree. After considering both proposals, the Town determined that Pine Tree's \"most closely [met] the needs of the Town as determined by public surveys and [the earlier] public hearing.\" At a meeting in May, 2000, the Town Council voted to reject Houlton Cable's proposal, and to pursue negotiations with Pine Tree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable then initiated this suit against the Town. Count I of its complaint alleged that the Town violated the Act by failing to comply with the formal renewal procedures set forth in &#167; 546(a)-(g). Count II alleged that the Town had conditioned the renewal of Houlton Cable's franchise on Houlton Cable's willingness to provide high speed internet service to its subscribers. Such a demand, Houlton Cable maintained, violated 47 U.S.C. &#167; 541(b)(3)(D), which prohibits franchising authorities from requiring cable operators to provide certain \"telecommunication service[s]\" as a condition of a franchise award, and 47 U.S.C. &#167; 544(e), which states that \"[n]o State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any type of ... transmission technology.\" Finally, Count III alleged that the Town unreasonably refused to award Houlton Cable a \"second\" franchise, in violation of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After answering the complaint, the Town moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) for judgment on the pleadings as to Counts I and II. With respect to Count I, the Town argued that, since neither Houlton Cable nor the Town had initiated formal renewal procedures during the six-month window, the renewal process properly was governed by the informal procedures authorized by &#167; 456(h). In response to Count II, the Town contended that the Act did not apply retroactively to invalidate the terms of the 1984 Franchise Agreement, which provided that the decision as to renewal was committed to the Town's discretion, and would be based in part on \"the development of cable services.\" In the alternative, the Town argued that high-speed internet access is neither a \"telecommunication service\" nor a \"transmission technology,\" and therefore is not governed by &#167;&#167; 541(b)(3)(D)(a) and 544(e) of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Local Rule 7(b) of the District of Maine, Houlton Cable was obligated to respond to the Town's motion within ten days.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Houlton Cable did not so respond, and, accordingly, was deemed to have consented to the motion. Thus, on December 7, 2000 &#8212; one day after the ten-day period had expired &#8212; the district court entered judgment for the Town on Counts I and II \"per Local Rule 7(b).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable filed a motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e), asking the court to reconsider and vacate its December 7 judgment. It argued that the district court could not enter judgment on the pleadings without first satisfying itself that the Town was in fact entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court granted the motion for reconsideration, but reaffirmed its initial judgment. Rule 12(c), the court noted, does not prescribe any particular standard of decision; therefore, it does not prohibit the entry of judgment on the basis of noncompliance with a local waiver rule, without consideration of the merits of the motion. Given the absence of a direct conflict between Federal Rule 12(c) and Local Rule 7(b), the court concluded that it was entitled to enforce its local rule strictly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town then moved for summary judgment on Count III of Houlton Cable's complaint, arguing that the provisions of &#167; 541(a)(1) governing applications for a second, competitive franchise did not apply to the Town's choice to award an initial franchise to one provider rather than another. The court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> agreed, and entered judgment for the Town on Count III. Houlton Cable filed a timely notice of appeal, challenging the district court's December 7 grant of judgment on the pleadings as to Counts I and II, its refusal to rescind that judgment under Rule 59(e), and its grant of summary judgment on Count III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, first, to the district court's decisions with respect to Counts I and II. In granting the Town's motion for judgment on the pleadings, the court relied on District of Maine Local Rule 7(b), which then provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unless within ten (10) days after the filing of a motion the opposing party files written objection thereto, incorporating a memorandum of law, the opposing party shall be deemed to have waived objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable conceded that it did not comply with that rule, and that its failure to file a timely response did not constitute \"excusable neglect,\" permitting reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). Thus, Houlton Cable sought relief under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) on the ground that the district court's judgment was based on an error of law. <i>See Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez,</i> 22 F.3d 384, 390 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that Rule 59(e) is the proper vehicle for a party seeking to overturn a judgment on the basis of alleged legal errors). Maintaining that Rule 12(c) requires a decision on the merits, it argued that the district court erred as a matter of law when it granted the Town's motion for judgment on the pleadings solely on the basis of a local \"deemed waiver\" rule like Rule 7(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable renews that argument on appeal. We review the district court's initial application of its local rule for abuse of discretion. <i>CMM Cable Rep, Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc.,</i> 97 F.3d 1504, 1528 (1st Cir.1996). We apply the same standard to the district court's denial of a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment. <i>See Williams v. Poulos,</i> 11 F.3d 271, 289 (1st Cir.1993). However, the court's interpretation of Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure presents a legal question, which we review <i>de novo. See Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm'n v. Sargent,</i> 229 F.3d 68, 79 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Local Rule 7(b) and its predecessor, District of Maine Local Rule 19(c), have been in existence for almost 20 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Courts in the District of Maine routinely apply such rules in situations where the opposing party fails to file an objection to a motion, regardless of whether the motion is dispositive. <i>See, e.g., Cardente v. Fleet Bank,</i> 796 F.Supp. 603 (D.Me.1992) (Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss); <i>United Transp. Union v. Me. Cent. R.R.

Other districts throughout the country have adopted similar rules<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> to \"ensure the orderly, efficient, and expeditious management of the extensive motion practice\" of the district courts. <i>McDermott v. Lehman,</i> 594 F.Supp. 1315, 1319 (D.Me.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that \"[d]istrict courts enjoy broad latitude\" in adopting and administering such local rules. <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc.,</i> 26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see also, e.g., Ramsdell v. Bowles,</i> 64 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1995) (acknowledging the district court's \"great leeway in the application and enforcement of its local rules\"). In exercising that discretion, district courts may, where appropriate, \"demand adherence to specific mandates contained in the rules.\" <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n,</i> 26 F.3d at 224. For example, in <i>Corey v. Mast Road Grain &amp; Bldg. Materials Co., Inc.,</i> 738 F.2d 11 (1st Cir.1984) (per curiam), the defendants moved for dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) for lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court granted the motion on the basis of the plaintiff's failure to file a timely response, as required by Local Rule 12 of the District of Massachusetts. It later denied the plaintiff's Rule 60(b)(1) motion for relief from the judgment. We affirmed, stating that \"[t]he district court was entitled to insist upon compliance with its local rule in these circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12 (citing <i>In re Harbour House Operating Corp.,</i> 724 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1983) (strictly applying Rule 3(b) of the First Circuit Rules governing bankruptcy appeals)). Given plaintiff's failure to establish that her tardiness was caused by excusable neglect, we concluded that \"the court could properly decline to excuse plaintiff's noncompliance with the local rule.\" <i>Id.; accord Stanciel v. Gramley,</i> 267 F.3d 575, 579 (7th Cir. 2001) (affirming district court's grant of motion to dismiss on the basis of noncompliance with local rule requiring response within 14 days); <i>Tobel v. City of Hammond,</i> 94 F.3d 360, 361-62 (7th Cir.1996) (\"Plaintiffs' lawyers admit that they were not aware of the Local Rule. This is the end of the matter because the district court clearly has authority to enforce strictly its Local Rules, even if a default results.\"); <i>Ghazali v. Moran,</i> 46 F.3d 52, 53 (9th Cir.1995) (\"Failure to follow a district court's local rules is a proper ground for dismissal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reached a similar result in <i>United States v. Proceeds of Sale of 3,888 Pounds of Atlantic Sea Scallops,</i> 857 F.2d 46 (1st Cir.1988). There, the government had filed a forfeiture action in Rhode Island district court, hoping to obtain title to the value of certain sea scallops it had seized. Roughly one month later, the defendant filed a combined \"answer and claim,\" which the government moved to strike as untimely. The district court granted the motion to strike, based on the defendant's failure to respond within ten days as required by Local Rule 12(a)(2). The government then moved for a default judgment on the ground that the defendant's claim and answer had been stricken. The district court granted that motion as well, reaffirming its decision on the defendant's Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, we affirmed. As in <i>Corey,</i> we concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant favorable reconsideration under Rule 60(b)(1) in the absence of a showing of excusable neglect. <i>See id.</i> at 49 (finding that defendant's alleged reliance on erroneous advice from local counsel did not excuse untimely filings). We continued: \"We also agree with the district court that a default judgment may stand even where there has been no showing of substantial prejudice to the party benefitting from the default. A district court simply may insist upon compliance with its local rules.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our holdings in <i>Corey</i> and <i>Sea Scallops</i> make clear, it is within the district court's discretion to dismiss an action based on a party's unexcused failure to respond to a dispositive motion when such response is required by local rule, at least when the result does not clearly offend equity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Pinto v. Universidad De Puerto Rico,</i> 895 F.2d 18, 19 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.1990) (\"We do not agree with defendant that a court may, without notice, take a failure to respond to a motion to dismiss as a default, warranting dismissal irrespective of substantive merit.... To be distinguished is where a court had ordered a memorandum, and, of course, cases where a response was required by rule.\" (citing <i>Sea Scallops</i> and <i>Corey</i>)). It is equally clear, however, that a district court cannot enforce its local rules in a way that conflicts with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(a)(1); <i>Jaroma v. Massey,</i> 873 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"Local district court rules cannot be construed in such a way as to render them inconsistent with applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Houlton Cable points out, we have identified such a conflict in the context of motions for summary judgment filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Rule 56(e) specifies that, if such a motion is unopposed, the district court may grant summary judgment \"if appropriate.\" \"Under this provision it is clear that `[w]here the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.'\" <i>Jaroma,</i> 873 F.2d at 20 (quoting <i>Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp.,</i> 722 F.2d 922, 929 (1st Cir.1983)). Thus, a district court may not automatically grant a motion for summary judgment simply because the opposing party failed to comply with a local rule requiring a response within a certain number of days. Rather, the court must determine whether summary judgment is \"appropriate,\" which means that it must assure itself that the moving party's submission shows that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>see also</i> Advisory Committee Note to Rule 56 (\"Where the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the potential tension between Rule 56(e) and local rules such as the District of Maine's Rule 7(b), we have recognized the need to interpret local waiver rules \"so as to preserve [their] scope and validity without running afoul of the requirements of Rule 56.\" <i>Jaroma,</i> 873 F.2d at 20. To that end, in the summary judgment context we read the \"deemed waiver\" provision of the local rules to extend only to waiver of objection to the moving party's factual assertions. By failing to file the required response within the time prescribed by the applicable local rule, the non-moving party</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">waives the right to controvert the facts asserted by the moving party in the motion for summary judgment and the supporting materials accompanying it. The court will accept as true all material facts set forth by the moving party with appropriate record support. <i>If those facts entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law,</i> summary judgment will be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Jaroma,</i> 873 F.2d at 21 (emphasis added); <i>see also McDermott,</i> 594 F.Supp. at 1321 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable argues that the district court's obligation to address the merits of a motion for summary judgment should extend as well to Rule 12(c) motions for judgment on the pleadings. It emphasizes that a party seeking judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) will make precisely the same arguments as a party seeking summary judgment under Rule 56; namely, that \"no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" 5A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 1368, at 518 (2d ed.1990); <i>Lefebvre v. Comm'r,</i> 830 F.2d 417, 419 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam) (describing standard for Rule 12(c)). The only difference is that a Rule 12(c) motion must be filed at the close of pleadings, and must be based solely on the factual allegations in the complaint and answer, whereas a motion for summary judgment may be filed at any time, and may be supported by additional materials such as affidavits, depositions, and the like. <i>Compare</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) <i>with</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 56. Such procedural differences, Houlton Cable maintains, should not obscure the fundamental similarity between the substance of a Rule 12(c) motion on the one hand, and a Rule 56 motion on the other. Given that similarity, Houlton Cable insists that the district court cannot rely on its local rule to grant a Rule 12(c) motion, when it could not do the same if the motion had been filed under Rule 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although that argument is not without force, it ignores an important &#8212; and, in our view, dispositive &#8212; difference between the two federal rules. Unlike Rule 56, nothing in the text of Rule 12(c) compels the court to apply any particular standard when deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Rule 12(c) provides that, \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" As the district court observed, the rule \"poses no standard or regime by which the Court shall decide the issues generated by the motion.\" By contrast, Rule 56(c) specifically states that summary judgment \"shall\" be granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Moreover, Rule 56 explicitly addresses the possibility that the non-moving party will not respond to the motion, and provides that summary judgment may be entered in such circumstances only \"if appropriate.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Rule 12(c), on the other hand, does not require the court to make any such determination before granting the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given Rule 12(c)'s silence on the subject, we cannot conclude that the district court's strict enforcement of Local Rule 7(b) creates an impermissible conflict with federal Rule 12(c). As the district court put it, \"[t]here is simply no reason contained in [Rule 12(c)] or its intendment to prevent an otherwise appropriate and enforceable rule of default, <i>i.e.</i> Local Rule 7(b), from operating on a motion under Rule 12(c) without consideration by the court of its merits.\" <i>Accord Tobel,</i> 94 F.3d at 362-63 (affirming grant of motion for judgment on the pleadings based on opposing party's failure to respond as required by local rule); <i>Ghazali,</i> 46 F.3d at 54 (reasoning that standards governing summary judgment motions do not apply to motions to dismiss, and holding that district court did not abuse its discretion in granting motion to dismiss for noncompliance with a local rule specifying requirements for response). We agree, and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in insisting on compliance with its local rule and in rejecting Houlton Cable's assertion of legal error under Rule 59(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to Houlton Cable's claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Town on Count III of the complaint. As noted, Count III asserted a claim for relief based on an alleged violation of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A franchising authority may award, in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, 1 or more franchises within its jurisdiction; except that a franchising authority may not grant an exclusive franchise and may not unreasonably refuse to award an additional competitive franchise. Any applicant whose application for a second franchise has been denied by a final decision of the franchising authority may appeal such final decision pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title for failure to comply with this subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 555, in turn, authorizes \"[a]ny cable operator adversely affected by any final determination made by a franchising authority under section 541(a)(1)\" to appeal that decision to the federal district court in the district in which the cable system is located. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 555(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as we can tell, the question whether &#167; 541(a)(1) creates a cause of action for a cable provider that lost out in a competitive bidding process for a single franchise is one of first impression. By its terms, &#167; 541(a)(1) governs only applications for a \"second\" franchise. Thus, the parties agree that &#167; 541(a)(1) does not speak to the Town's decision to award the initial franchise to Pine Tree instead of Houlton Cable. Houlton Cable argues, however, that once the Town decided to award a franchise to Pine Tree, it was obligated to determine whether it also should award Houlton Cable an \"additional competitive\" franchise. Because the Town readily admits that it never even considered that question, Houlton Cable maintains that the outright denial of its franchise proposal was \"unreasonabl[e]\" within the meaning of &#167; 541(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with that argument is that Houlton Cable never submitted an application for a \"second\" franchise. Hence, the Town never refused such an application, unreasonably or not. The RFP made clear that the Town was soliciting bids for a single franchise. Houlton Cable's proposal &#8212; submitted in response to the RFP &#8212; was, therefore, an application for that first, single franchise. Nowhere in its proposal did Houlton Cable indicate that, if the Town decided to grant the initial franchise to Pine Tree, Houlton Cable wished to be considered for a second, competitive franchise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable concedes as much. However, it maintains that such a desire can be assumed whenever two or more providers submit applications for a single franchise. In Houlton Cable's view, the losing co-applicant necessarily must be considered as an applicant for a second franchise, whether or not it explicitly asked for such treatment. We disagree. It is one thing to apply for a single franchise; it is quite another to apply for a second, competitive franchise. The latter may be far less profitable and, therefore, far less attractive. As a result, it cannot be presumed that an applicant for a first franchise also wishes to be considered for a second, competitive franchise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as the district court aptly observed, the information a franchising authority &#8212; and a reviewing court &#8212; would consider in assessing an application for a second franchise might be very different from the type of information needed to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of competing applications for a first franchise. The choice of one provider over another implicates questions such as which provider offers the better package of services, and at the best price. By contrast, the decision whether to award a second franchise (once one has been established) raises a different set of concerns: Could the municipality's infrastructure support two cable grids? Would it be technically feasible for a second provider to build its own system over the existing one? <i>Cf. City of Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc.,</i> 476 U.S. 488, 495, 106 S.Ct. 2034, 90 L.Ed.2d 480 (1986) (noting that factors such as \"the present uses of the public utility poles and rights-of-way and how [the cable operator] proposes to install and maintain its facilities on them\" were relevant to the question whether the City violated the First Amendment by refusing to grant more than one cable franchise).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, both sets of questions could be addressed at once, in the initial selection process. But it does not follow that they must be, or that the Town is obligated to raise the issue of a second franchise <i>sua sponte.</i> Rather, if an applicant like Houlton Cable wishes to be considered for a second franchise in the event it is not chosen for the first, it must make that desire explicit in its proposal. Unless and until Houlton Cable submits &#8212; and the Town refuses &#8212; an actual \"request\" for a \"second\" franchise, it has no cause for complaint under &#167; 541(a)(1). <i>See I-Star Communications Corp. v. City of East Cleveland,</i> 885 F.Supp. 1035, 1042 (N.D.Ohio 1995) (dismissing &#167; 541(a)(1) claim based on plaintiff's failure to allege submission, and denial, of an application for a second competitive franchise); <i>cf.

In <i>Roberts,</i> we held that the district court abused its discretion in denying the government's motion to reconsider an order granting the defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence as unopposed under Maine's Local Rule 19(c) (the predecessor to Rule 7(b)). Unlike Houlton Cable, the government in <i>Roberts</i> argued that its failure to comply with the local rule was caused by excusable neglect. We found that argument persuasive, and concluded that \"the lower court probably undervalued the worth of the [government's] explanation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22. We also noted that \"it would have helped\" if the district court had considered several other factors in deciding the government's motion to reconsider. <i>Id.</i> at 21-22 (listing factors such as the degree of tardiness, the nature of the case, and \"the effect of granting (or denying) the motion on the administration of justice\").</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This case does not require us to determine whether and how <i>Roberts</i> might apply where, as here, the tardy party failed to offer a \"credible explanation of what [went] wrong.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25. Houlton Cable does not argue that the district court erred by failing to take into account equitable considerations like those we outlined in <i>Roberts.</i> Instead, in both the district court and on appeal, Houlton Cable has argued only that the court's strict application of Local Rule 7(b) creates an impermissible conflict with Federal Rule 12(c).

In early 1999, the Town decided not to renew the franchise held by NEPSK, Inc., d/b/a Houlton Cable (\"Houlton Cable\"). Instead, it sought competitive proposals for a new cable franchise, and eventually awarded the franchise to Houlton Cable's competitor, Pine Tree Cablevision Associates (\"Pine Tree\"). Houlton Cable then commenced this suit against the Town, alleging multiple violations of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (codified in pertinent part at 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 521-573) (the \"Act\"). The district court granted the Town's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to two counts of the complaint, based on Houlton Cable's failure to respond to the motion as required by District of Maine Local Rule 7(b). Several months later, the court entered summary judgment for the Town on the remaining count of the complaint. Houlton Cable challenges both decisions. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 23, 1984, the Town entered into a cable franchise agreement with Houlton Cable's predecessor, Houlton CATV, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The franchise ran for a period of 15 years, and was set to expire in April of 1999. Under federal law, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 546(a)-(g), Houlton Cable was entitled to initiate formal renewal procedures by submitting a written request to the Town between April and October, 1996. If neither Houlton Cable nor the Town took action within that six-month window, the renewal process would be governed by the informal procedures set out in &#167; 546(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable submitted a renewal proposal in November, 1997, well after the expiration of the six-month period for initiation of formal procedures. For several months, the Town took no action on the proposal. Then, in April of 1998, the Town Council voted to \"invite new applications for the Houlton Cable franchise.\" Consistent with the informal renewal procedures prescribed by &#167; 546(h), the Town scheduled a public hearing to address the cable franchise issue. Following that hearing, in February of 2000, the Town Council decided not to renew Houlton Cable's franchise and to solicit bids from other providers. Minutes from the public hearing and the Town Council's subsequent meeting indicate that Houlton Cable's refusal to provide high-speed Internet access to its subscribers was a major factor in the Town's decision to reject the renewal proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 2000, the Town issued a Request for Proposals (\"RFP\") soliciting proposals for a new, ten-year cable franchise. As the RFP made clear, the Town did not believe it could support more than one franchise. Although it had not undertaken any detailed analysis of the issue, the Town was aware that no municipality in Maine &#8212; including those much larger than Houlton &#8212; was served by more than one cable company. Accordingly, the Town explained in the RFP that it planned to award only one franchise:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town of Houlton recognizes that it cannot award an exclusive cable television franchise to any applicant. Nevertheless, the Town also recognizes that the Town of Houlton can only feasibly support one cable television franchise at one time. Accordingly, the Town intends to award only one cable television franchise during the next ten year period, which will be the franchise as a result of this RFP process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town received proposals from two parties, Houlton Cable and Pine Tree. After considering both proposals, the Town determined that Pine Tree's \"most closely [met] the needs of the Town as determined by public surveys and [the earlier] public hearing.\" At a meeting in May, 2000, the Town Council voted to reject Houlton Cable's proposal, and to pursue negotiations with Pine Tree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable then initiated this suit against the Town. Count I of its complaint alleged that the Town violated the Act by failing to comply with the formal renewal procedures set forth in &#167; 546(a)-(g). Count II alleged that the Town had conditioned the renewal of Houlton Cable's franchise on Houlton Cable's willingness to provide high speed internet service to its subscribers. Such a demand, Houlton Cable maintained, violated 47 U.S.C. &#167; 541(b)(3)(D), which prohibits franchising authorities from requiring cable operators to provide certain \"telecommunication service[s]\" as a condition of a franchise award, and 47 U.S.C. &#167; 544(e), which states that \"[n]o State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any type of ... transmission technology.\" Finally, Count III alleged that the Town unreasonably refused to award Houlton Cable a \"second\" franchise, in violation of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After answering the complaint, the Town moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) for judgment on the pleadings as to Counts I and II. With respect to Count I, the Town argued that, since neither Houlton Cable nor the Town had initiated formal renewal procedures during the six-month window, the renewal process properly was governed by the informal procedures authorized by &#167; 456(h). In response to Count II, the Town contended that the Act did not apply retroactively to invalidate the terms of the 1984 Franchise Agreement, which provided that the decision as to renewal was committed to the Town's discretion, and would be based in part on \"the development of cable services.\" In the alternative, the Town argued that high-speed internet access is neither a \"telecommunication service\" nor a \"transmission technology,\" and therefore is not governed by &#167;&#167; 541(b)(3)(D)(a) and 544(e) of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Local Rule 7(b) of the District of Maine, Houlton Cable was obligated to respond to the Town's motion within ten days.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Houlton Cable did not so respond, and, accordingly, was deemed to have consented to the motion. Thus, on December 7, 2000 &#8212; one day after the ten-day period had expired &#8212; the district court entered judgment for the Town on Counts I and II \"per Local Rule 7(b).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable filed a motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e), asking the court to reconsider and vacate its December 7 judgment. It argued that the district court could not enter judgment on the pleadings without first satisfying itself that the Town was in fact entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court granted the motion for reconsideration, but reaffirmed its initial judgment. Rule 12(c), the court noted, does not prescribe any particular standard of decision; therefore, it does not prohibit the entry of judgment on the basis of noncompliance with a local waiver rule, without consideration of the merits of the motion. Given the absence of a direct conflict between Federal Rule 12(c) and Local Rule 7(b), the court concluded that it was entitled to enforce its local rule strictly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town then moved for summary judgment on Count III of Houlton Cable's complaint, arguing that the provisions of &#167; 541(a)(1) governing applications for a second, competitive franchise did not apply to the Town's choice to award an initial franchise to one provider rather than another. The court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> agreed, and entered judgment for the Town on Count III. Houlton Cable filed a timely notice of appeal, challenging the district court's December 7 grant of judgment on the pleadings as to Counts I and II, its refusal to rescind that judgment under Rule 59(e), and its grant of summary judgment on Count III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, first, to the district court's decisions with respect to Counts I and II. In granting the Town's motion for judgment on the pleadings, the court relied on District of Maine Local Rule 7(b), which then provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unless within ten (10) days after the filing of a motion the opposing party files written objection thereto, incorporating a memorandum of law, the opposing party shall be deemed to have waived objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable conceded that it did not comply with that rule, and that its failure to file a timely response did not constitute \"excusable neglect,\" permitting reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). Thus, Houlton Cable sought relief under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) on the ground that the district court's judgment was based on an error of law. <i>See Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195330\"><a href=\"/opinion/195330/acevedo-villalobos-v-hon-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 390 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that Rule 59(e) is the proper vehicle for a party seeking to overturn a judgment on the basis of alleged legal errors). Maintaining that Rule 12(c) requires a decision on the merits, it argued that the district court erred as a matter of law when it granted the Town's motion for judgment on the pleadings solely on the basis of a local \"deemed waiver\" rule like Rule 7(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable renews that argument on appeal.

There, the government had filed a forfeiture action in Rhode Island district court, hoping to obtain title to the value of certain sea scallops it had seized. Roughly one month later, the defendant filed a combined \"answer and claim,\" which the government moved to strike as untimely. The district court granted the motion to strike, based on the defendant's failure to respond within ten days as required by Local Rule 12(a)(2). The government then moved for a default judgment on the ground that the defendant's claim and answer had been stricken.

It is equally clear, however, that a district court cannot enforce its local rules in a way that conflicts with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(a)(1); <i>Jaroma v.

Rule 56(e) specifies that, if such a motion is unopposed, the district court may grant summary judgment \"if appropriate.\" \"Under this provision it is clear that `[w]here the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.'\" <i>Jaroma,</i> 873 F.2d at 20 (quoting <i>Stepanischen v.

Thus, a district court may not automatically grant a motion for summary judgment simply because the opposing party failed to comply with a local rule requiring a response within a certain number of days. Rather, the court must determine whether summary judgment is \"appropriate,\" which means that it must assure itself that the moving party's submission shows that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>see also</i> Advisory Committee Note to Rule 56 (\"Where the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the potential tension between Rule 56(e) and local rules such as the District of Maine's Rule 7(b), we have recognized the need to interpret local waiver rules \"so as to preserve [their] scope and validity without running afoul of the requirements of Rule 56.\" <i>Jaroma,</i> 873 F.2d at 20. To that end, in the summary judgment context we read the \"deemed waiver\" provision of the local rules to extend only to waiver of objection to the moving party's factual assertions.

It emphasizes that a party seeking judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) will make precisely the same arguments as a party seeking summary judgment under Rule 56; namely, that \"no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" 5A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 1368, at 518 (2d ed.1990); <i>Lefebvre v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495226\"><a href=\"/opinion/495226/joseph-a-lefebvre-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 419 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam) (describing standard for Rule 12(c)). The only difference is that a Rule 12(c) motion must be filed at the close of pleadings, and must be based solely on the factual allegations in the complaint and answer, whereas a motion for summary judgment may be filed at any time, and may be supported by additional materials such as affidavits, depositions, and the like. <i>Compare</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) <i>with</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 56. Such procedural differences, Houlton Cable maintains, should not obscure the fundamental similarity between the substance of a Rule 12(c) motion on the one hand, and a Rule 56 motion on the other. Given that similarity, Houlton Cable insists that the district court cannot rely on its local rule to grant a Rule 12(c) motion, when it could not do the same if the motion had been filed under Rule 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although that argument is not without force, it ignores an important &#8212; and, in our view, dispositive &#8212; difference between the two federal rules. Unlike Rule 56, nothing in the text of Rule 12(c) compels the court to apply any particular standard when deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Rule 12(c) provides that, \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" As the district court observed, the rule \"poses no standard or regime by which the Court shall decide the issues generated by the motion.\" By contrast, Rule 56(c) specifically states that summary judgment \"shall\" be granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Moreover, Rule 56 explicitly addresses the possibility that the non-moving party will not respond to the motion, and provides that summary judgment may be entered in such circumstances only \"if appropriate.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Rule 12(c), on the other hand, does not require the court to make any such determination before granting the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given Rule 12(c)'s silence on the subject, we cannot conclude that the district court's strict enforcement of Local Rule 7(b) creates an impermissible conflict with federal Rule 12(c). As the district court put it, \"[t]here is simply no reason contained in [Rule 12(c)] or its intendment to prevent an otherwise appropriate and enforceable rule of default, <i>i.e.</i> Local Rule 7(b), from operating on a motion under Rule 12(c) without consideration by the court of its merits.\" <i>Accord Tobel,</i> 94 F.3d at 362-63 (affirming grant of motion for judgment on the pleadings based on opposing party's failure to respond as required by local rule); <i>Ghazali,</i> 46 F.3d at 54 (reasoning that standards governing summary judgment motions do not apply to motions to dismiss, and holding that district court did not abuse its discretion in granting motion to dismiss for noncompliance with a local rule specifying requirements for response). We agree, and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in insisting on compliance with its local rule and in rejecting Houlton Cable's assertion of legal error under Rule 59(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to Houlton Cable's claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Town on Count III of the complaint. As noted, Count III asserted a claim for relief based on an alleged violation of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A franchising authority may award, in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter, 1 or more franchises within its jurisdiction; except that a franchising authority may not grant an exclusive franchise and may not unreasonably refuse to award an additional competitive franchise. Any applicant whose application for a second franchise has been denied by a final decision of the franchising authority may appeal such final decision pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title for failure to comply with this subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 555, in turn, authorizes \"[a]ny cable operator adversely affected by any final determination made by a franchising authority under section 541(a)(1)\" to appeal that decision to the federal district court in the district in which the cable system is located. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 555(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as we can tell, the question whether &#167; 541(a)(1) creates a cause of action for a cable provider that lost out in a competitive bidding process for a single franchise is one of first impression. By its terms, &#167; 541(a)(1) governs only applications for a \"second\" franchise. Thus, the parties agree that &#167; 541(a)(1) does not speak to the Town's decision to award the initial franchise to Pine Tree instead of Houlton Cable. Houlton Cable argues, however, that once the Town decided to award a franchise to Pine Tree, it was obligated to determine whether it also should award Houlton Cable an \"additional competitive\" franchise. Because the Town readily admits that it never even considered that question, Houlton Cable maintains that the outright denial of its franchise proposal was \"unreasonabl[e]\" within the meaning of &#167; 541(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with that argument is that Houlton Cable never submitted an application for a \"second\" franchise. Hence, the Town never refused such an application, unreasonably or not. The RFP made clear that the Town was soliciting bids for a single franchise. Houlton Cable's proposal &#8212; submitted in response to the RFP &#8212; was, therefore, an application for that first, single franchise. Nowhere in its proposal did Houlton Cable indicate that, if the Town decided to grant the initial franchise to Pine Tree, Houlton Cable wished to be considered for a second, competitive franchise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houlton Cable concedes as much. However, it maintains that such a desire can be assumed whenever two or more providers submit applications for a single franchise. In Houlton Cable's view, the losing co-applicant necessarily must be considered as an applicant for a second franchise, whether or not it explicitly asked for such treatment. We disagree. It is one thing to apply for a single franchise; it is quite another to apply for a second, competitive franchise. The latter may be far less profitable and, therefore, far less attractive. As a result, it cannot be presumed that an applicant for a first franchise also wishes to be considered for a second, competitive franchise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as the district court aptly observed, the information a franchising authority &#8212; and a reviewing court &#8212; would consider in assessing an application for a second franchise might be very different from the type of information needed to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of competing applications for a first franchise. The choice of one provider over another implicates questions such as which provider offers the better package of services, and at the best price. By contrast, the decision whether to award a second franchise (once one has been established) raises a different set of concerns: Could the municipality's infrastructure support two cable grids? Would it be technically feasible for a second provider to build its own system over the existing one? <i>Cf. City of Los Angeles v.

But it does not follow that they must be, or that the Town is obligated to raise the issue of a second franchise <i>sua sponte.</i> Rather, if an applicant like Houlton Cable wishes to be considered for a second franchise in the event it is not chosen for the first, it must make that desire explicit in its proposal. Unless and until Houlton Cable submits &#8212; and the Town refuses &#8212; an actual \"request\" for a \"second\" franchise, it has no cause for complaint under &#167; 541(a)(1). <i>See I-Star Communications Corp. v.

In <i>Roberts,</i> we held that the district court abused its discretion in denying the government's motion to reconsider an order granting the defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence as unopposed under Maine's Local Rule 19(c) (the predecessor to Rule 7(b)). Unlike Houlton Cable, the government in <i>Roberts</i> argued that its failure to comply with the local rule was caused by excusable neglect. We found that argument persuasive, and concluded that \"the lower court probably undervalued the worth of the [government's] explanation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22. We also noted that \"it would have helped\" if the district court had considered several other factors in deciding the government's motion to reconsider. <i>Id.</i> at 21-22 (listing factors such as the degree of tardiness, the nature of the case, and \"the effect of granting (or denying) the motion on the administration of justice\").</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This case does not require us to determine whether and how <i>Roberts</i> might apply where, as here, the tardy party failed to offer a \"credible explanation of what [went] wrong.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25. Houlton Cable does not argue that the district court erred by failing to take into account equitable considerations like those we outlined in <i>Roberts.</i> Instead, in both the district court and on appeal, Houlton Cable has argued only that the court's strict application of Local Rule 7(b) creates an impermissible conflict with Federal Rule 12(c). As we explain below, the district court did not err in rejecting that argument.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
