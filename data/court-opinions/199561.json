McCartney, with whom Cancio, Nadal, Rivera, Díaz &\nBerríos were on brief, for petitioner.\n     James M. Oleske, with whom Linda Dreeben, Assistant General\nCounsel and Julie F. Marcus, Attorney, were on brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           August 20, 2001\n\f          Per curiam.    This case came before the National Labor\n\nRelations Board (the \"Board\") on unfair labor practice charges filed by\n\nRosa Berríos and the Federación Puertorriqueña de Trabajadores and on\n\nthe issuance of a consolidated complaint by the Board's Puerto Rico\n\nregional office. After a two-day hearing, an administrative law judge\n\nissued a decision finding that petitioner Hospital del Maestro (the\n\n\"Hospital\") had violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor\n\nRelations Act (the \"Act\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 151 et seq., and recommended\n\nthat the Board enter a remedial order.\n\n          On February 4, 2000, the Board issued an order transferring\n\nthe case to itself. The order, which was served on the Hospital and\n\nits counsel, stated that exceptions to the decision of the\n\nadministrative law judge were to be received by the Board on or before\n\nMarch 3, 2000. Attached to the order were excerpts from the Board's\n\nrules and regulations relating to the filing of exceptions. These\n\nrules, which include the computation of time for filing, state the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          [T]he Board will accept as timely filed any\n          document which is hand delivered to the Board on\n          or before the official closing time of the\n          receiving office on the due date or postmarked on\n          the day before (or earlier than) the due date;\n          documents which are postmarked on or after the\n          due date are untimely. \"Postmarking\" shall\n          include timely depositing the document with a\n          delivery service that will provide a record\n          showing that the document was tendered to the\n          delivery service in sufficient time for delivery\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          by the due date, but in no event later than the\n          day before the due date . . . .\n\nN.L.R.B. Rule § 102.111(b). The rules further state that documents may\n\nbe filed after the time prescribed therein \"only upon good cause shown\n\nbased on excusable neglect and when no undue prejudice would result.\"\n\nId. § 102.111(c).\n\n          On February 8, 2000, the Hospital requested an extension of\n\ntime in which to file its exceptions to the judge's decision and\n\nrecommended order. The Board granted the Hospital an extension until\n\nMarch 10, 2000. On March 9, 2000, the Hospital again requested an\n\nextension of time, specifically requesting a due date of March 14,\n\n2000. The Board granted the request, notifying the Hospital by letter\n\nthat the \"[d]ate for receipt of exceptions and brief in Washington, DC\n\nis extended to March 14, 2000.\"\n\n          On March 14, 2000, the Hospital mailed to the Board, by\n\nFederal Express overnight delivery, its exceptions to the judge's\n\ndecision and recommended order. The Board received the documents on\n\nMarch 15. That same day, the Board sent a letter advising the Hospital\n\nthat, under the provisions of § 102.111 of the Board's rules, the\n\nexceptions were \"untimely and [could not] be forwarded to the Board for\n\nconsideration.\" On March 28, 2000, the Hospital filed a motion with\n\nthe Board to accept its exceptions out of time, stating as its reason\n\nfor delay that it had \"misunderstood that the effective date of filing\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fcorresponded to the day that the Exceptions were notified by mail\n\n[sic].\" On April 5, 2000, the Board denied the Hospital's motion,\n\nstating that \"[t]he reasons provided for the late filing [did] not rise\n\nto the level of excusable neglect.\" The Board thereafter adopted pro\n\nforma the findings, conclusions, and recommended order of the\n\nadministrative law judge.     See 29 U.S.C. § 160(c),(e).\n\n          In Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates\n\nLtd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380 (1993), the Supreme Court examined the\n\nphrase \"excusable neglect,\" noting that it is \"a somewhat 'elastic\n\nconcept' and is not limited strictly to omissions caused by\n\ncircumstances beyond the control of the movant.\" Id. at 392.1 The\n\nCourt concluded that the determination should take into account \"all\n\nrelevant circumstances,\" including the \"the danger of prejudice . . .\n\n, the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial\n\nproceedings, the reasons for the delay, . . . and whether the movant\n\nacted in good faith.\" Id. at 395. The Hospital argues that the Board\n\nfailed to consider all of these factors and thus erroneously denied its\n\nlate filing.    We review the Board's decision for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Fall River Sav. Bank v. NLRB, 649 F.2d 50, 56 (1st Cir.\n\n1981); Melrose-Wakefield Hosp. Ass'n v. NLRB, 615 F.2d 563, 567 (1st\n\nCir. 1980).\n\n1 Although Pioneer involved the bankruptcy rules, we have acknowledged\nthat the Court's analysis provides guidance in other contexts. See\nPratt v. Philbrook, 109 F.3d 18, 19 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          The Hospital concedes that under the Board's rules, its\n\nexceptions were required to be received on or before March 14, 2000, or\n\nat least postmarked prior to that date. Its only justification for\n\nhaving misunderstood those requirements, moreover, is the apparent\n\nparadox that a mailing postmarked before March 14 but received more\n\nthan one day late would be considered timely, while a mailing\n\npostmarked on the due date and received the next day would not. The\n\nHospital does indeed highlight a possible effect of the Board's rules.\n\nHowever, it does not come close to explaining how this hypothetical\n\noutcome rendered the rule itself unclear or ambiguous. We have no\n\nbasis for finding the Hospital's neglect \"excusable\" when there is no\n\nproffered reason that would justify, or even plausibly explain, its\n\nmisreading of the rules. See Mirpuri v. ACT Manufacturing, Inc., 212\n\nF.3d 624, 631 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"A misunderstanding that occurs because\n\na party (or his counsel) elects to read the clear, unambiguous [rules]\n\n. . . through rose-colored glasses cannot constitute excusable\n\nneglect.\").\n\n          The Hospital argues that the other factors delineated in\n\nPioneer nevertheless tip the balance in its favor. It is true that the\n\ndelay in this case was only one day and that there was little danger of\n\nprejudice to the other party. We may assume, moreover, that the delay\n\ndid not negatively impact the Board's proceedings and that the Hospital\n\nacted in good faith. All of these taken together, however, would still\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fnot excuse an otherwise unjustified failure to abide by the Board's\n\ndeadline.    As the Eighth Circuit has correctly observed,\n\n            The four Pioneer factors do not carry equal\n            weight; the excuse given for the late filing must\n            have the greatest import. While prejudice,\n            length of delay, and good faith might have more\n            relevance in a closer case, the reason-for-delay\n            factor will always be critical to the inquiry. .\n            . . [A]t the end of the day, the focus must be\n            upon the nature of the neglect.\n\nLowry v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 211 F.3d 457, 463 (8th Cir. 2000).\n\nAs we have already noted, the Hospital has offered no pardonable reason\n\nwhy it misconstrued the plain, unambiguous meaning of the Board's\n\nrules. The favorable juxtaposition of the other Pioneer factors does\n\nnot, therefore, excuse the Hospital's oversight. We conclude that the\n\nBoard did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Hospital's\n\nstated reason for its untimely filing did not rise to the level of\n\n\"excusable neglect.\"\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",

The Hospital argues that the Board  failed to consider all of these factors and thus erroneously denied its  late filing.  We review the Board's decision for an abuse of  discretion.  Fall River Sav.

Its only justification for  having misunderstood those requirements, moreover, is the apparent  paradox that a mailing postmarked before March 14 but received more than one day late would be considered timely, while a mailing  postmarked on the due date and received the next day would not.  The  Hospital does indeed highlight a possible effect of the Board's rules. However, it does not come close to explaining how this hypothetical  outcome rendered the rule itself unclear or ambiguous.  We have no  basis for finding the Hospital's neglect \"excusable\" when there is no  proffered reason that would justify, or even plausibly explain, its  misreading of the rules.  See Mirpuri v. ACT Manufacturing, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198919\"><a href=\"/opinion/198919/mirpuri-v-act-manufacturing/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 631 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"A misunderstanding that occurs because  a party (or his counsel) elects to read the clear, unambiguous [rules]  . . . through rose-colored glasses cannot constitute excusable  neglect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital argues that the other factors delineated in Pioneer nevertheless tip the balance in its favor.  It is true that the  delay in this case was only one day and that there was little danger of  prejudice to the other party. We may assume, moreover, that the delay  did not negatively impact the Board's proceedings and that the Hospital  acted in good faith.  All of these taken together, however, would still  not excuse an otherwise unjustified failure to abide by the Board's  deadline.  As the Eighth Circuit has correctly observed,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The four Pioneer factors do not carry equal  weight; the excuse given for the late filing must  have the greatest import.  While prejudice,  length of delay, and good faith might have more  relevance in a closer case, the reason-for-delay  factor will always be critical to the inquiry. .  . . [A]t the end of the day, the focus must be  upon the nature of the neglect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lowry v.

As we have already noted, the Hospital has offered no pardonable reason  why it misconstrued the plain, unambiguous meaning of the Board's  rules.  The favorable juxtaposition of the other Pioneer factors does  not, therefore, excuse the Hospital's oversight.  We conclude that the  Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Hospital's  stated reason for its untimely filing did not rise to the level of  \"excusable neglect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   Although Pioneer involved the bankruptcy rules, we have acknowledged  that the Court's analysis provides guidance in other contexts.
