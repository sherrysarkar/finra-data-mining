Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U. S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Nestor Juan Rodriguez on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam Mendoza Toro,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Robert M. Peckrill,\nAssistant Regional Counsel, Social Security Administration, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       December 27, 2000\n\f                Per Curiam. Claimant-appellant Luz M. Delgado Lopez\n\n appeals from a judgment of the district court upholding a\n\n decision of the Commissioner denying her social security\n\n disability          benefits.             Claimant      argues          that      the\n\n Administrative        Law   Judge     (\"ALJ\")       failed    to    give       proper\n\n weight to the opinions of treating and examining sources,\n\n failed to consider the record as a whole, and failed to\n\n apply the correct Medical Vocational Guideline (or \"Grid\"\n\n rule).         Based on these arguments, claimant urges us to\n\n reverse       the   judgment    of    the        district    court.        In     the\n\n alternative, claimant requests that we vacate and remand for\n\n a   new       determination     by    the       Commissioner       in    light     of\n\n additional evidence.\n\n                Upon careful review of the briefs and record, we\n\n reject the claimed errors in the ALJ's decision essentially\n\n for     the    reasons   stated      by    the    magistrate       judge. 1       The\n\n magistrate judge adequately addresses claimant's challenge\n\n to the weighting of the evidence.                     Claimant's suggestion\n\n that the ALJ failed to consider the evidence as a whole is\n\n\n     1\n     We note one correction.     The ALJ found that claimant's\nbirth date is August 29, 1946, and claimant has not challenged\nthis finding on judicial review.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fmeritless.     Claimant's contention that the ALJ failed to\n\napply the correct Grid rule is predicated on her argument\n\nthat the ALJ should have accepted the functional limitations\n\nfound by Dr. Marin.      However, given that the ALJ was not\n\nbound by Dr. Marin's findings, the argument fails.\n\n            We also reject claimant's request for a remand for\n\nthe taking of additional evidence.          The controlling statute\n\nprovides in pertinent part that the court \"may at any time\n\norder     additional   evidence        to   be     taken     before   the\n\nCommissioner      of Social Security, but only upon a showing\n\nthat there is new evidence which is material and that there\n\nis good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence\n\ninto the record in a prior proceedings.\"                   42 U.S.C. §\n\n405(g).    As explained below, we conclude that the proffered\n\nevidence--a Certificate from the Puerto Rico Department of\n\nEducation and a Resolution from the Puerto Rico Industrial\n\nCommission--fails to meet this standard.\n\n            The Certificate indicates that claimant did not\n\ncomplete    the   requirements    of    a   high    school    education,\n\ncontrary to the finding of the ALJ.                However, given the\n\nALJ's finding that claimant is capable of light work and was\n\na younger individual at the relevant time, the Grid rules\n\ndirect a finding of not disabled regardless of claimant's\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\feducational level.         Under the circumstances, the Certificate\n\nis not material.          See Evangelista v. Secretary of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 703 F.2d 24, 27 (1 st Cir. 1987) (explaining\n\nthat evidence is material only if, were the proposed new\n\nevidence to be considered, the Secretary's decision might\n\nreasonably have been different).\n\n           Claimant makes no effort to spell out, in any\n\ndetail, the significance of the Resolution.                   The Resolution\n\ncontains      no   first    hand     medical       evidence,    but    rather\n\nreferences a magnetic resonance scan (\"MRI\") apparently\n\nadministered to claimant at her personal physician's request\n\nin 1996 (while the case was pending before the agency).\n\nClaimant   does     not    proffer    a    copy    of   the   MRI,    and   its\n\nsignificance is not entirely clear.                 Assuming for the sake\n\nof argument that the MRI is favorable to claimant, she has\n\nfailed   to    demonstrate      good       cause    for   the   failure      to\n\nincorporate it into prior proceedings.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
