The  defendant,  G.  Dennis Johnson,\r                                 \r\n\nappeals  his  convictions  and  sentences  for conspiracy  to\r\n\npossess with  intent to  distribute heroin,  see 21  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n846, and for aiding  and abetting in the distribution  of and\r\n\npossession with intent to distribute  heroin, see 21 U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n841(a)(1) and 18  U.S.C.   2.   After  careful review of  the\r\n\nparties' briefs and the  entire record, we find no  reason to\r\n\ndisturb the judgment below.\r\n\n          The defendant challenges his  convictions, claiming\r\n\nthe  evidence  was insufficient  to  prove  he possessed  the\r\n\nrequisite mental  state,  i.e., that  he  was a  knowing  and\r\n\nintentional participant  in the  drug deal arranged  by Daryl\r\n\nYoung, his co-conspirator.  We review the record to determine\r\n\nwhether on  all the  evidence and reasonable  inferences from\r\n\nthe evidence  a reasonable factfinder could  have found guilt\r\n\nbeyond  a reasonable doubt.   United States v.  Dodd, 43 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n759, 762 (1st Cir. 1995).  The district court, sitting as the\r\n\ntrier  of  fact,  heard   the  defendant,  in  tape  recorded\r\n\ntelephone conversations with  an undercover drug  enforcement\r\n\nagent posing as  a buyer, provide the buyer  with information\r\n\nnecessary to lead him  to the ultimate seller of  the heroin.\r\n\nAlthough the  defendant testified  that he was  suffering the\r\n\neffects of heroin withdrawal at  the time of the conversation\r\n\nand  did  not  know he  was  facilitating  a  drug deal,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court found,  as  it  was  free  to  do,  that  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndefendant's testimony was not credible.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nDiMarzo,  80  F.3d  656,  661  (1st  Cir.  1996)  (factfinder\r                   \r\n\nentitled to  reject defendant's testimonial  contradiction of\r\n\ngovernment witness and his proffered innocent explanation for\r\n\nhis conduct).  From  all the evidence the district  court was\r\n\nwarranted  in  inferring that  the  defendant  was a  knowing\r\n\nparticipant in the drug transaction.\r\n\n          The  defendant  challenges  the   district  court's\r\n\nimposition of  a two-level upward adjustment  to his sentence\r\n\nfor  obstruction of  justice, pursuant  to U.S.S.G.    3C1.1,\r\n\nbased  on  a finding that the defendant had committed perjury\r\n\nduring his  trial testimony.   The  district court  found the\r\n\ndefendant's  testimony that  he  was unaware  that Young  had\r\n\nbrought drugs  into Maine  not to  be credible  when compared\r\n\nwith the tape recording  of the defendant's conversation with\r\n\nthe  undercover  agent/buyer,  and  that  the  defendant  had\r\n\ndeliberately testified  falsely to obtain an  acquittal.  The\r\n\ndistrict court's finding  of untruthfulness, encompassing all\r\n\nthe  elements  of perjury,  is supported  by the  record, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Rehal, 940 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1991), and we\r                                  \r\n\nfind no clear error.\r\n\n          The defendant also claims that he was entitled to a\r\n\ndownward  adjustment  to  his  sentence  for   acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility  pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.     3E1.1.    Only  in\r\n\n\"extraordinary cases,\" however, will an adjustment be granted\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility when an enhancement has been\r\n\ngiven  for  obstruction  of   justice.    U.S.S.G.     3E1.1,\r\n\nApplication Note 4.   The defendant has not shown  this to be\r\n\nan extraordinary case.   Moreover, the clear demonstration of\r\n\nacceptance of  responsibility  necessary for  this section to\r\n\napply  requires from  the defendant  an authentic  showing of\r\n\nremorse, United States v. Bennett, 37 F.3d 687, 698 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1994);  \"[t]he  adjustment  is  not intended  to  apply  to a\r\n\ndefendant who puts the  government to its burden of  proof at\r\n\ntrial by denying the essential factual  elements of guilt, is\r\n\nconvicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1, Application Note 2.  The district court had\r\n\na plausible  basis for concluding that the  defendant had not\r\n\naccepted responsibility within the  meaning of the guideline.\r\n\nSee United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                      \r\n\n          Affirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
