Frank H. Freedman, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   John P. Crowley, III, and Hobbins, Gardner, Gardner &amp; Murphy\r\non brief for appellant.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Ariane D. Vuono,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 27, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nthe record, we conclude that defendant's claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel cannot be reviewed on direct appeal.  The\r\nattorney's performance, as described by defendant, was not\r\nnecessarily substandard, and the life sentence does not\r\nnecessarily show that the attorney's performance resulted in\r\nprejudice to defendant.  If defendant believes that he has a\r\nviable claim, he may raise it in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C.\r\n 2255.  See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.\r\n1993) (\"We have held with a regularity bordering on the\r\nmonotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance\r\ncannot make their debut on direct review of criminal\r\nconvictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to and\r\nacted upon by the trial court.\").\r\n          Defendant's remaining contentions also are without\r\nmerit.  The district court did not err in admitting the English\r\ntranslation of the transcription of the Spanish recording.  The\r\ngovernment witnesses laid an adequate foundation, and there was\r\nno indication that the transcript or translation were\r\ninaccurate.  See United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 48\r\n(1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Renfigo, 789 F.2d 975, 980\r\n(1st Cir. 1986).  Even if the material may have been highly\r\ninculpatory, it still was not subject to exclusion as unduly\r\nprejudicial.\r\n          In determining the identity of the drug substance,\r\nthe district court did not plainly err in relying on the\r\nundisputed information in the pre-sentence investigation\r\nreport.  That information also was not inconsistent with the\r\ntestimony at trial about defendant's drug dealings and the\r\npreparation of the drugs.\r\n          Defendant's motion to dispense with oral argument and\r\nfor expedited consideration is granted.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
