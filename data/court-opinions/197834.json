Having reviewed the parties briefs, read\r\nthe record, and heard argument, we affirm the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court essentially for the same reasons as are set out\r\nin the court's comprehensive opinion.  See Dominguez v. Eli\r\nLilly &amp; Co., 958 F. Supp. 721 (D.P.R. 1997).  Viewing the\r\nrecord in the light most favorable to appellants, we, like the\r\ncourt below, can find no genuine issue of material fact\r\nconcerning whether appellants were constructively discharged. \r\nSee Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir.\r\n1993).\r\n         Appellants assert on appeal that the district court\r\ngave undue emphasis to the Puerto Rico district court's \"anti-\r\nferret\" rule, D.P.R. R. 311.12, rather than following Federal\r\nRule of Civil Procedure 56's requirement to evaluate all the\r\nrecord evidence.  However, we see nothing inconsistent with\r\nRule 56 in the requirements contained in the anti-ferret rule,\r\nand the court's reference to it.  Moreover, in the alternative,\r\nthe district court grounded its decision upon a reading of the\r\nfull record, which it analyzed extensively and accurately.\r\n         We find no merit in appellants' claim that the\r\ndistrict court erroneously relied upon hearsay contained in the\r\naffidavit of Ricardo Flores Borgos.  Appellants overstate both\r\nthe hearsay nature of the affidavit and the importance of the\r\nalleged hearsay to the outcome of the case.  In ruling on\r\nappellants' Rule 60(b) motion, the district court denied that\r\nit had relied at all on the contested sections of the\r\naffidavit.  We discern no factual issue in this record.\r\n         Affirmed.  Costs to appellees.\r\n",
