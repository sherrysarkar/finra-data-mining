The  undercapitalized venture  was doomed\r\n\nfrom the opening  bell.  In  the aftermath  of its collapse,  the\r\n\nCommonwealth   of  Massachusetts   successfully  prosecuted   the\r\n\npetitioner on  charges of  larceny by check.   After  a fruitless\r\n\npursuit of appellate remedies in the state courts, the petitioner\r\n\nsought habeas  corpus relief in  a federal forum, naming  a state\r\n\ncorrectional  official  as  the  respondent.   In  an  ore  tenus\r                                                                           \r\n\ndecision, the district court dismissed the petition on the ground\r\n\nthat it contained  an unexhausted claim.  The petitioner appeals.\r\n\nWe affirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                       The Tale of the Tape\r                                 The Tale of the Tape\r                                                     \r\n\n          Early   in  1993,   the  petitioner,   a  resident   of\r\n\nMassachusetts,  teamed up with Steven Eisner and Lawrence Meyers,\r\n\nboth residents of  Arizona, to promote and  videotape prizefights\r\n\nbetween  American   and   Russian  boxers.     The   petitioner's\r\n\nresponsibilities  included  underwriting the  project,  supplying\r\n\nRussian boxers, and  marketing videotapes of the bouts, for which\r\n\nhe would  garner  the lion's  share of  the anticipated  profits.\r\n\nEisner was  to receive a monthly salary, reimbursed expenses, and\r\n\na  lesser  share  of  the  profits for  recruiting  the  American\r\n\npugilists  and handling  the logistics  of  the matches.   Meyers\r\n\nagreed to film the fisticuffs in exchange for an up-front payment\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nof $5,000 and a further  payment in approximately the same amount\r\n\nplus  expenses  (e.g.,  editing costs),  due  upon  production of\r\n\ncommercially acceptable videotapes of a particular card of bouts.\r\n\n          In April 1993,  the petitioner transmitted a  check for\r\n\n$5,000 to Meyers  as an initial payment  and sent two checks  for\r\n\n$2,500 and $7,500,  respectively, to  Eisner.   All three  checks\r\n\nwere  drawn  on  the  petitioner's  account  at  Cambridge  Trust\r\n\nCompany,  a Massachusetts  bank,  and  were  intended  to  effect\r\n\npayment  for services  rendered or to  be rendered  in connection\r\n\nwith boxing matches  scheduled to take place  in Laughlin, Nevada\r\n\non April  28, 1993.   The payees negotiated  the checks.   In due\r\n\ncourse,  however,  Cambridge  Trust   returned  them,  unhonored,\r\n\nexplaining  that  the  account  lacked  sufficient  funds.    The\r\n\npetitioner attributed  the incident to a bank error and persuaded\r\n\nEisner and Meyers to go forward with the promotion.\r\n\n          The three men  met in Laughlin  on April  28.  At  that\r\n\ntime, the petitioner  gave Meyers $3,000 in cash  and promised to\r\n\npay  the  balance  of his  fee  by  wire transfer  the  next day.\r\n\nAlthough that  transfer  never materialized,  the petitioner  did\r\n\nsend  a total of $13,000  to Eisner in  mid-May.  Eisner diverted\r\n\n$5,000  from  this sum  to  Meyers  to  cover  editing  expenses.\r\n\nDespite  the fact  that  he had  not  been paid  in full,  Meyers\r\n\nperformed the  editing work and  delivered a single  videotape to\r\n\nthe petitioner in Massachusetts with the hope that the petitioner\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ncould  sell it  and thereby  make  good on  the bounced  checks.1\r\n\nMeyers's hopes  soon were dashed:   the  petitioner's efforts  to\r\n\nmarket the  tape in  Russia proved  unavailing and he  thereafter\r\n\nturned a blind  eye to the insistent demand  letters forwarded by\r\n\nhis erstwhile partners.\r\n\n          To  make a  tedious tale  tolerably  terse, Eisner  and\r\n\nMeyers  eventually  called  the three  dishonored  checks  to the\r\n\nattention  of  the  Massachusetts authorities.    In  turn, those\r\n\nfinancial  instruments formed the  predicate for three  counts of\r\n\nlarceny by  check.   See Mass. Gen.  Laws ch.  266,    37 (1990).\r                                  \r\n\nTrial,  conviction, and  the  imposition  of  a  two-year  prison\r\n\nsentence  followed  apace.2    The  Massachusetts  Appeals  Court\r\n\naffirmed  the conviction, see Commonwealth v. Adelson, 666 N.E.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n167 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996), and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\r\n\nCourt  (SJC)  denied further  appellate review.   670  N.E.2d 966\r\n\n(Mass. 1996).\r\n\n          Undeterred by his lack of  success in the early rounds,\r\n\nthe  petitioner applied  for habeas corpus  relief in  the United\r\n\nStates District Court for the  District of Massachusetts.  See 28\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   2254 (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996).  He posited that  the state\r\n\ntrial judge's  decision to  withhold from  the jury the  question\r\n\nwhether  Massachusetts  courts  had subject  matter  jurisdiction\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1While the exact amount of money that Adelson owed Meyers is\r\ndisputed   by Meyers's reckoning, the  petitioner owed him $5,955\r\nfor  services rendered after all sums  actually received had been\r\ncredited   it is pellucid that Adelson never paid Meyers  in full\r\nfor the videotaping services.\r\n\n     2Execution of the sentence has been stayed.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nrelieved the prosecution  of its burden to prove  each element of\r\n\nthe criminal charges  and thus violated his right  to due process\r\n\nof  law under the Fourteenth  Amendment.  The petitioner bottomed\r\n\nthis  claim  of   constitutional  error  on  an   assertion  that\r\n\nMassachusetts  case law deems  jurisdiction a substantive element\r\n\nof every criminal offense and that the prosecution therefore must\r\n\nprove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n          The  district  court  dismissed  the  petition  without\r\n\nreaching  the  merits,   concluding  that  Adelson   inadequately\r\n\npresented his putative federal claim in the Massachusetts courts.\r\n\nJudge   Woodlock   did,   however,   grant   a   certificate   of\r\n\nappealability.  See 28 U.S.C.    2253(c); Fed. R. App.  P. 22(b).\r                             \r\n\nThis appeal ensued.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Exhaustion\r                                      Exhaustion\r                                                \r\n\n          In recognition of  the state courts' important  role in\r\n\nprotecting constitutional rights, the exhaustion principle holds,\r\n\nin  general,   that  a  federal  court  will   not  entertain  an\r\n\napplication for  habeas relief  unless the  petitioner first  has\r\n\nfully exhausted his  state remedies in respect to  each and every\r\n\nclaim contained within  the application.  See Rose  v. Lundy, 455\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  509,  518-19  (1982).     Although  exhaustion  is  not   a\r\n\njurisdictional bar  to federal  habeas review  of  a state  court\r\n\nconviction, it  is \"the  disputatious sentry  [that] patrols  the\r\n\npathways of  comity\" between  the federal  and state  sovereigns.\r\n\nNadworny v. Fair,  872 F.2d 1093, 1096 (1st Cir. 1989).  With few\r                          \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nexceptions   none  of which are applicable here    federal courts\r\n\nhave  enforced   the  exhaustion  requirement   consistently  and\r\n\nrigorously.    See, e.g.,  Rose,  455  U.S.  at 518;  Martens  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nShannon, 836  F.2d 715,  718 (1st  Cir. 1988).    Thus, a  habeas\r                 \r\n\npetitioner  bears a  heavy  burden  to show  that  he fairly  and\r\n\nrecognizably presented to the state courts  the factual and legal\r\n\nbases of this federal claim.  See Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270,\r                                                            \r\n\n276-77 (1971); Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1098.  To carry this burden,\r                                 \r\n\nthe petitioner  must demonstrate that he tendered  each claim \"in\r\n\nsuch a way as to make it probable that a reasonable  jurist would\r\n\nhave  been alerted  to  the existence  of the  federal question.\"\r\n\nScarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                          \r\n\n          Although  fair presentment  of  a claim  is obligatory,\r\n\nthere  are   myriad  ways  in   which  that  phenomenon   can  be\r\n\naccomplished.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1097-98 (noting at least\r                                     \r\n\nfive ways in which a habeas petitioner satisfactorily can present\r\n\na  federal claim  to  the  state courts).    But the  flexibility\r\n\ninherent  in this multi-channeled approach does not transform the\r\n\nexhaustion  requirement into  an  empty  formality.    A  federal\r\n\ncourt's calculation of  the probability that a  reasonable jurist\r\n\nwould have discerned  the federal question from a  perusal of the\r\n\npetitioner's  relevant state-court  filings is  not  a matter  of\r\n\nguesswork.   Rather, that calculation is informed \"by trappings  \r\n\nspecific   constitutional   language,   constitutional  citation,\r\n\nappropriate   federal   precedent,   substantive   constitutional\r\n\nanalogy,  argument with no  masking state-law character,  and the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nlike.\"   Id.  at 1101.    The fewer  the trappings  that  adorn a\r                      \r\n\npetitioner's  state-court filings, the  less likely that  we will\r\n\nfind his federal claim to have been exhausted.\r\n\n          Although these general principles provide  a modicum of\r\n\nguidance, our  de novo  appellate review  of  a district  court's\r\n\ndismissal  of  a  habeas  petition  for  want  of  exhaustion  is\r\n\nnecessarily  case-specific.  See id. at 1095.   We turn, then, to\r                                              \r\n\nthe particulars of the case at hand.\r\n\n          In  the district  court, the  petitioner, citing  cases\r\n\nsuch  as Schad v.  Arizona, 501 U.S.  624, 638 (1991),  and In re\r                                                                           \r\n\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970), articulated his constitutional\r                 \r\n\nclaim in the following terms:  (1) Massachusetts case law defines\r\n\njurisdiction as a  substantive element of all  criminal offenses;\r\n\n(2)  due process  requires  the  prosecution  to  prove  all  the\r\n\nsubstantive elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt; (3)\r\n\nand  therefore, in a Massachusetts criminal case, the prosecution\r\n\nmust prove jurisdiction  beyond a reasonable doubt.3   Given this\r\n\nsyllogism,  the petitioner posited  that the state  trial judge's\r\n\npreemption  of  the  jurisdictional  issue  and  his  concomitant\r\n\nrefusal to  instruct the jury  on it relieved the  prosecution of\r\n\nits due-process-imposed  burden  to  prove  all  the  substantive\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3We take  no view  of the  petitioner's characterization  of\r\nMassachusetts law.  We  note, however, that if Massachusetts  has\r\nnot made  jurisdiction a  substantive element  of the  larceny by\r\ncheck offense, then the  petitioner's claim would appear  to turn\r\non alleged errors of state, not  federal, law.  If this were  so,\r\nthen federal habeas  review would not  be available to him.   See\r                                                                           \r\nEstelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S.  62, 67-68 (1991); Lewis v. Jeffers,\r                                                                          \r\n497 U.S. 764,  780-81 (1990); Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1204\r                                                      \r\n(1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nelements of the charged crimes.   This is an intriguing argument,\r\n\nand  one  that  clearly states  a  federal  constitutional claim.\r\n\nWhether the claim would have merit is, however, a different issue\r\n\n  and one which, absent exhaustion, we need not decide.\r\n\n          The fly in the  ointment is that Adelson never  pitched\r\n\nthis argument to the  Massachusetts courts.   This is not to  say\r\n\nthat the argument is completely  alien to the state court record.\r\n\nIn  his brief  to  the  Massachusetts Appeals  Court  and in  his\r\n\nunsuccessful application to the SJC for further appellate review,\r\n\nthe petitioner set forth the factual underpinnings of his federal\r\n\nclaim.  But setting forth the factual underpinnings of a claim is\r\n\ninsufficient, in and of itself, to constitute fair presentment of\r\n\nthat claim.   A habeas  petitioner must also elucidate  the legal\r\n\nfoundation of his federal claim.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1096;\r                                                        \r\n\nGagne v. Fair, 835  F.2d 6, 7  (1st Cir. 1987).   It is on  these\r                       \r\n\nshoals that the petitioner's quest founders.\r\n\n          Exhaustion obligations mandate that a habeas petitioner\r\n\npresent, or  do his  best to  present, his  federal claim to  the\r\n\nstate's highest tribunal.   See United States ex  rel. Kennedy v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTyler, 269 U.S. 13, 17 (1925); Mele v. Fitchburg Dist.

Accordingly,  the  decisive\r\n\npleading is the application for further appellate  review, and we\r\n\nmust  determine  whether  the  petitioner  fairly  presented  the\r\n\nfederal  claim to  the  SJC  within \"the  four  corners\" of  that\r\n\napplication.    Mele,  850  F.2d  at  823.    In  this case,  the\r                              \r\n\npetitioner  argued to  the SJC,  as he  did to  the Massachusetts\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nAppeals Court, that the Commonwealth's evidence could not support\r\n\ncriminal jurisdiction  and that the  trial judge at  least should\r\n\nhave  submitted the  jurisdictional issue  to the  jury    but he\r\n\nneither  premised  these   arguments  on  federal  constitutional\r\n\ngrounds nor  provided any  signposts that  pointed  toward a  due\r\n\nprocess pathway to  reversal of his  conviction.  The  petitioner\r\n\ncited no  federal  cases,  made  no  mention  of  the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment,  and eschewed  all references  to the  concept of  due\r\n\nprocess.  He instead relied  only upon Massachusetts case law and\r\n\ndebated the assignment of error exclusively in state-law terms.\r\n\n          Under  these  circumstances,  we  cannot say  that  the\r\n\npetitioner  exhausted his  due process  claim.   It  is true,  of\r\n\ncourse, that deployment of federal  authority sometimes is not  a\r\n\nprerequisite to adequate presentation  of a federal claim to  the\r\n\nstate  courts.   See Scarpa,  38 F.3d  at 7.   Nevertheless, such\r                                     \r\n\noccasions will be  few and far between, and  they invariably will\r\n\ninvolve some suitable surrogate for explicit reference to federal\r\n\nauthorities, say, an  emphasis on federal  due process rights  in\r\n\nthe petitioner's  cited state cases  or an analysis of  state law\r\n\nthat  adopts or parallels  federal constitutional analysis.

We do not agree.  \"Rhetoric arguing that a\r\n\nclaim  previously asserted  without  federal  citation  or  other\r\n\nconspicuous  federal  emblemata   nonetheless  fell  within  some\r\n\nhypothetical  `mainstream' of  constitutional  litigation has  an\r\n\noxymoronic quality.\"   Id. at 1098.

As we have\r\n\nwarned  before,  \"scatter[ing]  some  makeshift  needles  in  the\r\n\nhaystack of the  state court record\"  is not enough  to ground  a\r\n\nclaim of exhaustion.

While\r\n\nthere  are occasional  exceptions  to the  exhaustion requirement\r\n\n(say, where exhaustion plainly would be futile or where the state\r\n\nhas waived the requirement), the petitioner does not, and cannot,\r\n\nargue that any apply in this instance.   On the other hand, while\r\n\nthe Antiterrorism and  Effective Death Penalty Act  of 1996, Pub.\r\n\nL.  No. 104-132,  110  Stat. 1214  (1996) (codified  in scattered\r\n\nsections  of  28  U.S.C.),  changes  preexisting  habeas  law  by\r\n\nconferring  upon federal courts express authorization to \"den[y a\r\n\nhabeas  petition] on the  merits, notwithstanding the  failure of\r\n\nthe applicant to exhaust the  remedies available in the courts of\r\n\nthe State,\" 28  U.S.C.   2254(b)(2),  we do  not think that  this\r\n\ncase is an  appropriate candidate for the use of such power.  The\r\n\npetitioner's  federal  claim  flows  from   an  apparently  novel\r\n\ninterpretation of Massachusetts law.  Assuming that he is not now\r\n\nprocedurally   barred   from   presenting   his   claim   to  the\r\n\nMassachusetts courts   a matter on  which we express no opinion  \r\n\nwe believe that  those tribunals are better situated  to test the\r\n\npetitioner's state-law hypothesis.

Adelson hatched a plan to film bouts between Russian and American pugilists and market the resultant videotapes to Russian television stations.  The undercapitalized venture was doomed from the opening bell.  In the aftermath of its collapse, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts successfully prosecuted the petitioner on charges of larceny by check.  After a fruitless pursuit of appellate remedies in the state courts, the petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in a federal forum, naming a state correctional official as the respondent.  In an ore tenus decision, the district court dismissed the petition on the ground that it contained an unexhausted claim.  The petitioner appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>The Tale of the Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 1993, the petitioner, a resident of Massachusetts, teamed up with Steven Eisner and Lawrence Meyers, both residents of Arizona, to promote and videotape prizefights between American and Russian boxers.  The petitioner's responsibilities included underwriting the project, supplying Russian boxers, and marketing videotapes of the bouts, for which he would garner the lion's share of the anticipated profits.  Eisner was to receive a monthly salary, reimbursed expenses, and a lesser share of the profits for recruiting the American pugilists and handling the logistics of the matches.  Meyers agreed to film the fisticuffs in exchange for an up-front payment of $5,000 and a further payment in approximately the same amount plus expenses (e.g., editing costs), due upon production of commercially acceptable videotapes of a particular card of bouts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1993, the petitioner transmitted a check for $5,000 to Meyers as an initial payment and sent two checks for $2,500 and $7,500, respectively, to Eisner.  All three checks were drawn on the petitioner's account at Cambridge Trust Company, a Massachusetts bank, and were intended to effect payment for services rendered or to be rendered in connection with boxing matches scheduled to take place in Laughlin, Nevada on April 28, 1993.  The payees negotiated the checks.  In due course, however, Cambridge Trust returned them, unhonored, explaining that the account lacked sufficient funds.  The petitioner attributed the incident to a bank error and persuaded Eisner and Meyers to go forward with the promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three men met in Laughlin on April 28.  At that time, the petitioner gave Meyers $3,000 in cash and promised to pay the balance of his fee by wire transfer the next day.  Although that transfer never materialized, the petitioner did send a total of $13,000 to Eisner in mid-May.  Eisner diverted $5,000 from this sum to Meyers to cover editing expenses.  Despite the fact that he had not been paid in full, Meyers performed the editing work and delivered a single videotape to the petitioner in Massachusetts with the hope that the petitioner could sell it and thereby make good on the bounced checks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Meyers's hopes soon were dashed:  the petitioner's efforts to market the tape in Russia proved unavailing and he thereafter turned a blind eye to the insistent demand letters forwarded by his erstwhile partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, Eisner and Meyers eventually called the three dishonored checks to the attention of the Massachusetts authorities.  In turn, those financial instruments formed the predicate for three counts of larceny by check.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 37 (1990).  Trial, conviction, and the imposition of a two-year prison sentence followed apace.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the conviction, see Commonwealth v. Adelson, 40 Mass.App.Ct. 585, 666 N.E.2d 167 (1996), and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) denied further appellate review.  423 Mass. 1105, 670 N.E.2d 966 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undeterred by his lack of success in the early rounds, the petitioner applied for habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 (1994 &amp; Supp.  II 1996).  He posited that the state trial judge's decision to withhold from the jury the question whether Massachusetts courts had subject matter jurisdiction relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove each element of the criminal charges and thus violated his right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The petitioner bottomed this claim of constitutional error on an assertion that Massachusetts case law deems jurisdiction a substantive element of every criminal offense and that the prosecution therefore must prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the petition without reaching the merits, concluding that Adelson inadequately presented his putative federal claim in the Massachusetts courts.  Judge Woodlock did, however, grant a certificate of appealability.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c);  Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b).  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Exhaustion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recognition of the state courts' important role in protecting constitutional rights, the exhaustion principle holds, in general, that a federal court will not entertain an application for habeas relief unless the petitioner first has fully exhausted his state remedies in respect to each and every claim contained within the application.  See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518-19, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1203-04, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982).  Although exhaustion is not a jurisdictional bar to federal habeas review of a state court conviction, it is \"the disputatious sentry [that] patrols the pathways of comity\" between the federal and state sovereigns.  Nadworny v. Fair, 872 F.2d 1093, 1096 (1st Cir.1989).  With few exceptions--none of which are applicable here--federal courts have enforced the exhaustion requirement consistently and rigorously.  See, e.g., Rose, 455 U.S. at 518, 102 S.Ct. at 1203;  Martens v. Shannon, 836 F.2d 715, 718 (1st Cir.1988).  Thus, a habeas petitioner bears a heavy burden to show that he fairly and recognizably presented to the state courts the factual and legal bases of this federal claim.  See Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 276-77, 92 S.Ct. 509, 512-13, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971);  Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1098.   To carry this burden, the petitioner must demonstrate that he tendered each claim \"in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question.\"  Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although fair presentment of a claim is obligatory, there are myriad ways in which that phenomenon can be accomplished.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1097-98 (noting at least five ways in which a habeas petitioner satisfactorily can present a federal claim to the state courts).  But the flexibility inherent in this multi-channeled approach does not transform the exhaustion requirement into an empty formality.  A federal court's calculation of the probability that a reasonable jurist would have discerned the federal question from a perusal of the petitioner's relevant state-court filings is not a matter of guesswork.  Rather, that calculation is informed \"by trappings--specific constitutional language, constitutional citation, appropriate federal precedent, substantive constitutional analogy, argument with no masking state-law character, and the like.\"  Id. at 1101.   The fewer the trappings that adorn a petitioner's state-court filings, the less likely that we will find his federal claim to have been exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these general principles provide a modicum of guidance, our de novo appellate review of a district court's dismissal of a habeas petition for want of exhaustion is necessarily case-specific.  See id. at 1095.   We turn, then, to the particulars of the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the petitioner, citing cases such as Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624, 638, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 2500, 115 L.Ed.2d 555 (1991), and In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072-73, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), articulated his constitutional claim in the following terms:  (1) Massachusetts case law defines jurisdiction as a substantive element of all criminal offenses;  (2) due process requires the prosecution to prove all the substantive elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt;  (3) and therefore, in a Massachusetts criminal case, the prosecution must prove jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Given this syllogism, the petitioner posited that the state trial judge's preemption of the jurisdictional issue and his concomitant refusal to instruct the jury on it relieved the prosecution of its due-process-imposed burden to prove all the substantive elements of the charged crimes.  This is an intriguing argument, and one that clearly states a federal constitutional claim.  Whether the claim would have merit is, however, a different issue--and one which, absent exhaustion, we need not decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fly in the ointment is that Adelson never pitched this argument to the Massachusetts courts.  This is not to say that the argument is completely alien to the state court record.  In his brief to the Massachusetts Appeals Court and in his unsuccessful application to the SJC for further appellate review, the petitioner set forth the factual underpinnings of his federal claim.  But setting forth the factual underpinnings of a claim is insufficient, in and of itself, to constitute fair presentment of that claim.  A habeas petitioner must also elucidate the legal foundation of his federal claim.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1096;  Gagne v. Fair, 835 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir.1987).  It is on these shoals that the petitioner's quest founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exhaustion obligations mandate that a habeas petitioner present, or do his best to present, his federal claim to the state's highest tribunal.  See United States ex rel.  Kennedy v. Tyler, 269 U.S. 13, 17, 46 S.Ct. 1, 2-3, 70 L.Ed. 138 (1925);  Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Court, 850 F.2d 817, 820 (1st Cir.1988).  Accordingly, the decisive pleading is the application for further appellate review, and we must determine whether the petitioner fairly presented the federal claim to the SJC within \"the four corners\" of that application.  Mele, 850 F.2d at 823.   In this case, the petitioner argued to the SJC, as he did to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, that the Commonwealth's evidence could not support criminal jurisdiction and that the trial judge at least should have submitted the jurisdictional issue to the jury--but he neither premised these arguments on federal constitutional grounds nor provided any signposts that pointed toward a due process pathway to reversal of his conviction.  The petitioner cited no federal cases, made no mention of the Fourteenth Amendment, and eschewed all references to the concept of due process.  He instead relied only upon Massachusetts case law and debated the assignment of error exclusively in state-law terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the petitioner exhausted his due process claim.  It is true, of course, that deployment of federal authority sometimes is not a prerequisite to adequate presentation of a federal claim to the state courts.  See Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 7. Nevertheless, such occasions will be few and far between, and they invariably will involve some suitable surrogate for explicit reference to federal authorities, say, an emphasis on federal due process rights in the petitioner's cited state cases or an analysis of state law that adopts or parallels federal constitutional analysis.  See Lanigan v. Maloney, 853 F.2d 40, 44 (1st Cir.1988);  Dougan v. Ponte, 727 F.2d 199, 201 (1st Cir.1984);  cf.  Anderson v. Harless, 459 U.S. 4, 7 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 276, 278 n. 3, 74 L.Ed.2d 3 (1982) (per curiam) (\"We doubt that a defendant's citation to a state-court decision predicated solely on state law ordinarily will be sufficient to fairly apprise a reviewing court of a potential federal claim merely because the defendant in the cited case advanced a federal claim.\")  (emphasis in original).  No such surrogate dwells in the present record.  Indeed, in his application for further appellate review the petitioner did not even attempt to analogize his state-law claims of error to a due process violation.  This is simply not enough to alert even the most perspicacious of jurists to the embedded constitutional claim.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a desperate effort to overcome the fact that any supposed presentation of his federal claim to the Massachusetts courts is masked, or, more accurately, completely camouflaged, by a dense state-law overlay, the petitioner maintains that his use of the phrase \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" conjured up constitutional visions perceptible to any reasonable jurist, and, thus, saves the day.  We do not agree.  \"Rhetoric arguing that a claim previously asserted without federal citation or other conspicuous federal emblemata nonetheless fell within some hypothetical 'mainstream' of constitutional litigation has an oxymoronic quality.\"  Id. at 1098.   Consequently, we regularly have held, and today reaffirm, that the mere incantation of constitutional buzzwords, unaccompanied by any federal constitutional analysis, does not suffice to carry the burden of demonstrating fair presentment of a federal claim.  See Gagne, 835 F.2d at 8;  Dougan, 727 F.2d at 201.   In all events, to the extent that the \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" mantra might raise a constitutional eyebrow, the petitioner invoked it only once, in passing, in his brief to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, and not at all in his application to the SJC. As we have warned before, \"scatter[ing] some makeshift needles in the haystack of the state court record\" is not enough to ground a claim of exhaustion.  Martens, 836 F.2d at 717.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of fair presentment ends the matter.  While there are occasional exceptions to the exhaustion requirement (say, where exhaustion plainly would be futile or where the state has waived the requirement), the petitioner does not, and cannot, argue that any apply in this instance.  On the other hand, while the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.), changes preexisting habeas law by conferring upon federal courts express authorization to \"den[y a habeas petition] on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(b)(2), we do not think that this case is an appropriate candidate for the use of such power.  The petitioner's federal claim flows from an apparently novel interpretation of Massachusetts law.  Assuming that he is not now procedurally barred from presenting his claim to the Massachusetts courts--a matter on which we express no opinion--we believe that those tribunals are better situated to test the petitioner's state-law hypothesis.  See Gagne, 835 F.2d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Habeas counsel often confront an inhospitable legal landscape, and the problem is complicated by the intricacies of the exhaustion requirement.  We must, however, apply that requirement impartially.  Here, only the most intrepid judicial spelunker could have picked a path through the petitioner's state-law-strewn grotto and excavated a buried claim of constitutional error.  Because the petitioner did not present his federal claim to the Massachusetts courts \"face-up and squarely,\" Martens, 836 F.2d at 717, the district court properly dismissed his habeas petition, without prejudice, for want of exhaustion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While the exact amount of money that Adelson owed Meyers is disputed--by Meyers's reckoning, the petitioner owed him $5,955 for services rendered after all sums actually received had been credited--it is pellucid that Adelson never paid Meyers in full for the videotaping services</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Execution of the sentence has been stayed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We take no view of the petitioner's characterization of Massachusetts law.  We note, however, that if Massachusetts has not made jurisdiction a substantive element of the larceny by check offense, then the petitioner's claim would appear to turn on alleged errors of state, not federal, law.  If this were so, then federal habeas review would not be available to him.  See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 479-80, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991);  Lewis v.

Adelson hatched a plan to film bouts between Russian and American pugilists and market the resultant videotapes to Russian television stations.  The undercapitalized venture was doomed from the opening bell.  In the aftermath of its collapse, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts successfully prosecuted the petitioner on charges of larceny by check.  After a fruitless pursuit of appellate remedies in the state courts, the petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in a federal forum, naming a state correctional official as the respondent.  In an ore tenus decision, the district court dismissed the petition on the ground that it contained an unexhausted claim.  The petitioner appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>The Tale of the Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 1993, the petitioner, a resident of Massachusetts, teamed up with Steven Eisner and Lawrence Meyers, both residents of Arizona, to promote and videotape prizefights between American and Russian boxers.  The petitioner's responsibilities included underwriting the project, supplying Russian boxers, and marketing videotapes of the bouts, for which he would garner the lion's share of the anticipated profits.  Eisner was to receive a monthly salary, reimbursed expenses, and a lesser share of the profits for recruiting the American pugilists and handling the logistics of the matches.  Meyers agreed to film the fisticuffs in exchange for an up-front payment of $5,000 and a further payment in approximately the same amount plus expenses (e.g., editing costs), due upon production of commercially acceptable videotapes of a particular card of bouts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1993, the petitioner transmitted a check for $5,000 to Meyers as an initial payment and sent two checks for $2,500 and $7,500, respectively, to Eisner.  All three checks were drawn on the petitioner's account at Cambridge Trust Company, a Massachusetts bank, and were intended to effect payment for services rendered or to be rendered in connection with boxing matches scheduled to take place in Laughlin, Nevada on April 28, 1993.  The payees negotiated the checks.  In due course, however, Cambridge Trust returned them, unhonored, explaining that the account lacked sufficient funds.  The petitioner attributed the incident to a bank error and persuaded Eisner and Meyers to go forward with the promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three men met in Laughlin on April 28.  At that time, the petitioner gave Meyers $3,000 in cash and promised to pay the balance of his fee by wire transfer the next day.  Although that transfer never materialized, the petitioner did send a total of $13,000 to Eisner in mid-May.  Eisner diverted $5,000 from this sum to Meyers to cover editing expenses.  Despite the fact that he had not been paid in full, Meyers performed the editing work and delivered a single videotape to the petitioner in Massachusetts with the hope that the petitioner could sell it and thereby make good on the bounced checks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Meyers's hopes soon were dashed:  the petitioner's efforts to market the tape in Russia proved unavailing and he thereafter turned a blind eye to the insistent demand letters forwarded by his erstwhile partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, Eisner and Meyers eventually called the three dishonored checks to the attention of the Massachusetts authorities.  In turn, those financial instruments formed the predicate for three counts of larceny by check.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 37 (1990).  Trial, conviction, and the imposition of a two-year prison sentence followed apace.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the conviction, see Commonwealth v.

See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 (1994 &amp; Supp.  II 1996).  He posited that the state trial judge's decision to withhold from the jury the question whether Massachusetts courts had subject matter jurisdiction relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove each element of the criminal charges and thus violated his right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The petitioner bottomed this claim of constitutional error on an assertion that Massachusetts case law deems jurisdiction a substantive element of every criminal offense and that the prosecution therefore must prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the petition without reaching the merits, concluding that Adelson inadequately presented his putative federal claim in the Massachusetts courts.  Judge Woodlock did, however, grant a certificate of appealability.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c);  Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b).  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Exhaustion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recognition of the state courts' important role in protecting constitutional rights, the exhaustion principle holds, in general, that a federal court will not entertain an application for habeas relief unless the petitioner first has fully exhausted his state remedies in respect to each and every claim contained within the application.  See Rose v. Lundy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 518-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span>, 1203-04, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span> (1982).  Although exhaustion is not a jurisdictional bar to federal habeas review of a state court conviction, it is \"the disputatious sentry [that] patrols the pathways of comity\" between the federal and state sovereigns.  Nadworny v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521901\"><a href=\"/opinion/521901/william-nadworny-v-michael-v-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span>, 1096 (1st Cir.1989).  With few exceptions--none of which are applicable here--federal courts have enforced the exhaustion requirement consistently and rigorously.  See, e.g., Rose, 455 U.S. at 518, 102 S.Ct. at 1203;  Martens v. Shannon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499731\"><a href=\"/opinion/499731/christopher-martens-v-james-shannon-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 718 (1st Cir.1988).  Thus, a habeas petitioner bears a heavy burden to show that he fairly and recognizably presented to the state courts the factual and legal bases of this federal claim.  See Picard v. Connor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108417\"><a href=\"/opinion/108417/picard-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 276-77, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108417\"><a href=\"/opinion/108417/picard-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span> (1971);  Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1098.   To carry this burden, the petitioner must demonstrate that he tendered each claim \"in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question.\"  Scarpa v. Dubois, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680706\"><a href=\"/opinion/680706/nazzaro-scarpa-v-larry-e-dubois-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although fair presentment of a claim is obligatory, there are myriad ways in which that phenomenon can be accomplished.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1097-98 (noting at least five ways in which a habeas petitioner satisfactorily can present a federal claim to the state courts).  But the flexibility inherent in this multi-channeled approach does not transform the exhaustion requirement into an empty formality.  A federal court's calculation of the probability that a reasonable jurist would have discerned the federal question from a perusal of the petitioner's relevant state-court filings is not a matter of guesswork.  Rather, that calculation is informed \"by trappings--specific constitutional language, constitutional citation, appropriate federal precedent, substantive constitutional analogy, argument with no masking state-law character, and the like.\"  Id. at 1101.   The fewer the trappings that adorn a petitioner's state-court filings, the less likely that we will find his federal claim to have been exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these general principles provide a modicum of guidance, our de novo appellate review of a district court's dismissal of a habeas petition for want of exhaustion is necessarily case-specific.  See id. at 1095.   We turn, then, to the particulars of the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the petitioner, citing cases such as Schad v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span> (1970), articulated his constitutional claim in the following terms:  (1) Massachusetts case law defines jurisdiction as a substantive element of all criminal offenses;  (2) due process requires the prosecution to prove all the substantive elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt;  (3) and therefore, in a Massachusetts criminal case, the prosecution must prove jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Given this syllogism, the petitioner posited that the state trial judge's preemption of the jurisdictional issue and his concomitant refusal to instruct the jury on it relieved the prosecution of its due-process-imposed burden to prove all the substantive elements of the charged crimes.  This is an intriguing argument, and one that clearly states a federal constitutional claim.  Whether the claim would have merit is, however, a different issue--and one which, absent exhaustion, we need not decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fly in the ointment is that Adelson never pitched this argument to the Massachusetts courts.  This is not to say that the argument is completely alien to the state court record.  In his brief to the Massachusetts Appeals Court and in his unsuccessful application to the SJC for further appellate review, the petitioner set forth the factual underpinnings of his federal claim.  But setting forth the factual underpinnings of a claim is insufficient, in and of itself, to constitute fair presentment of that claim.  A habeas petitioner must also elucidate the legal foundation of his federal claim.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1096;  Gagne v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498435\"><a href=\"/opinion/498435/normand-gagne-v-michael-fair-commissioner-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1987).  It is on these shoals that the petitioner's quest founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exhaustion obligations mandate that a habeas petitioner present, or do his best to present, his federal claim to the state's highest tribunal.

Accordingly, the decisive pleading is the application for further appellate review, and we must determine whether the petitioner fairly presented the federal claim to the SJC within \"the four corners\" of that application.  Mele, 850 F.2d at 823.   In this case, the petitioner argued to the SJC, as he did to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, that the Commonwealth's evidence could not support criminal jurisdiction and that the trial judge at least should have submitted the jurisdictional issue to the jury--but he neither premised these arguments on federal constitutional grounds nor provided any signposts that pointed toward a due process pathway to reversal of his conviction.  The petitioner cited no federal cases, made no mention of the Fourteenth Amendment, and eschewed all references to the concept of due process.  He instead relied only upon Massachusetts case law and debated the assignment of error exclusively in state-law terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the petitioner exhausted his due process claim.  It is true, of course, that deployment of federal authority sometimes is not a prerequisite to adequate presentation of a federal claim to the state courts.  See Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 7. Nevertheless, such occasions will be few and far between, and they invariably will involve some suitable surrogate for explicit reference to federal authorities, say, an emphasis on federal due process rights in the petitioner's cited state cases or an analysis of state law that adopts or parallels federal constitutional analysis.

No such surrogate dwells in the present record.  Indeed, in his application for further appellate review the petitioner did not even attempt to analogize his state-law claims of error to a due process violation.  This is simply not enough to alert even the most perspicacious of jurists to the embedded constitutional claim.  See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a desperate effort to overcome the fact that any supposed presentation of his federal claim to the Massachusetts courts is masked, or, more accurately, completely camouflaged, by a dense state-law overlay, the petitioner maintains that his use of the phrase \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" conjured up constitutional visions perceptible to any reasonable jurist, and, thus, saves the day.  We do not agree.  \"Rhetoric arguing that a claim previously asserted without federal citation or other conspicuous federal emblemata nonetheless fell within some hypothetical 'mainstream' of constitutional litigation has an oxymoronic quality.\"  Id. at 1098.   Consequently, we regularly have held, and today reaffirm, that the mere incantation of constitutional buzzwords, unaccompanied by any federal constitutional analysis, does not suffice to carry the burden of demonstrating fair presentment of a federal claim.  See Gagne, 835 F.2d at 8;  Dougan, 727 F.2d at 201.   In all events, to the extent that the \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" mantra might raise a constitutional eyebrow, the petitioner invoked it only once, in passing, in his brief to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, and not at all in his application to the SJC. As we have warned before, \"scatter[ing] some makeshift needles in the haystack of the state court record\" is not enough to ground a claim of exhaustion.  Martens, 836 F.2d at 717.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of fair presentment ends the matter.  While there are occasional exceptions to the exhaustion requirement (say, where exhaustion plainly would be futile or where the state has waived the requirement), the petitioner does not, and cannot, argue that any apply in this instance.  On the other hand, while the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.), changes preexisting habeas law by conferring upon federal courts express authorization to \"den[y a habeas petition] on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(b)(2), we do not think that this case is an appropriate candidate for the use of such power.  The petitioner's federal claim flows from an apparently novel interpretation of Massachusetts law.  Assuming that he is not now procedurally barred from presenting his claim to the Massachusetts courts--a matter on which we express no opinion--we believe that those tribunals are better situated to test the petitioner's state-law hypothesis.  See Gagne, 835 F.2d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Habeas counsel often confront an inhospitable legal landscape, and the problem is complicated by the intricacies of the exhaustion requirement.  We must, however, apply that requirement impartially.  Here, only the most intrepid judicial spelunker could have picked a path through the petitioner's state-law-strewn grotto and excavated a buried claim of constitutional error.  Because the petitioner did not present his federal claim to the Massachusetts courts \"face-up and squarely,\" Martens, 836 F.2d at 717, the district court properly dismissed his habeas petition, without prejudice, for want of exhaustion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While the exact amount of money that Adelson owed Meyers is disputed--by Meyers's reckoning, the petitioner owed him $5,955 for services rendered after all sums actually received had been credited--it is pellucid that Adelson never paid Meyers in full for the videotaping services</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Execution of the sentence has been stayed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We take no view of the petitioner's characterization of Massachusetts law.  We note, however, that if Massachusetts has not made jurisdiction a substantive element of the larceny by check offense, then the petitioner's claim would appear to turn on alleged errors of state, not federal, law.  If this were so, then federal habeas review would not be available to him.  See Estelle v.
