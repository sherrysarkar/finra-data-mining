Plaintiff/appellant James  Hollingsworth\r                            \r\n\nappeals    the    entry    of    judgment    in   favor    of\r\n\ndefendants/appellees on  Hollingsworth's suit pursuant  to 42\r\n\nU.S.C.    1983.  Having reviewed carefully the record in this\r\n\ncase,  including  the briefs  of  the  parties, we  summarily\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n     Hollingsworth suffered  no deprivation of his  rights to\r\n\nprocedural due process either when the hearing officer denied\r\n\nhis request  to call witnesses at his disciplinary hearing or\r\n\nwhen he  discounted the affidavits  Hollingsworth was allowed\r\n\nto submit.  A denial of a request to present witnesses is not\r\n\na  due process  violation  when it  is based  on the  need of\r\n\ninstitutional safety.  See  Ponte v. Real, 471 U.S.  491, 497\r                                                     \r\n\n(1985).  Here,  the district court credited  the testimony of\r\n\nthe hearing  officer that, even  if Hollingsworth had  made a\r\n\ntimely request  to present witnesses, the  request would have\r\n\nbeen denied  because of  safety concerns in  transporting the\r\n\nwitnesses from another prison.   As to the second  claim, the\r\n\nhearing  officer had  sufficient  support in  the record  for\r\n\nfinding  two  of  the  affidavits  not  exculpatory  and  for\r\n\nquestioning the credibility of the others.\r\n\n     Furthermore, the  district court  did not err  either in\r\n\nrefusing  Hollingsworth's  request  to  present  witnesses at\r\n\ntrial or  in not allowing  him to  introduce allegedly  newly\r\n\nfound exculpatory evidence.   The district  court supportably\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nfound that the witnesses'  testimony was not relevant  to any\r\n\nissue before the court.  Similarly, inasmuch as Hollingsworth\r\n\ndoes  not claim  that the  hearing officer  lacked sufficient\r\n\nevidence  to support  a finding of  guilty, the  \"newly found\r\n\nevidence\"  was  irrelevant  to  Hollingsworth's  due  process\r\n\nclaims.   Moreover,  this evidence,  which was  cumulative of\r\n\nwhat had already been  presented at the disciplinary hearing,\r\n\ndoes nothing  to call the hearing  officer's determination of\r\n\nguilt into question.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
