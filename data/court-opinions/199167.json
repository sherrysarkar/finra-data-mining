RAINERI,\n\n                    Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n                   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                     Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n       [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Selya, Boudin and Stahl,\n\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Tina Schneider, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\n     Peter E. Papps, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       December 1, 2000\n\f\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.    The federal courts historically\n\nhave been solicitous of the rights of pro se litigants.           E.g.,\n\nHaines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam); Prou\n\nv. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir. 1999).         As part and\n\nparcel      of     that   solicitude,     courts     frequently    have\n\nrecharacterized inartfully drawn pleadings to assist pro se\n\nprisoners    who    mistakenly   relied   on   inappropriate   rules   or\n\nstatutes.        The enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective\n\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110\n\nStat. 1214 (1996) (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.)\n\naltered the dynamics of this entrenched practice in respect to\n\npost-conviction motions in criminal cases.             Under AEDPA, a\n\nprisoner, whether federal or state, retains the right to press\n\na first petition for a writ of habeas corpus — but second or\n\nsuccessive petitions may be pressed only under very limited\n\ncircumstances.      See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2255, 2244(b).     This change in\n\nthe law raised the stakes attendant to recharacterizing a post-\n\nconviction motion as a habeas petition:             conversion, though\n\ninitially meant to guide a prisoner through the thicket of legal\n\ntechnicalities, suddenly had the potential to deprive him of his\n\none full and fair opportunity to seek habeas relief.\n\n            This appeal requires us to answer a pointed question:\n\nWhen a district court, acting sua sponte, recharacterizes a\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ffederal prisoner's post-conviction motion as a section 2255\n\npetition, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255,1 does that action render the\n\nprisoner's later attempt to file a section 2255 petition a\n\nsecond or successive petition within the purview of the AEDPA\n\namendments?   This is an unanswered query in this circuit, but\n\none that has divided the courts of appeals elsewhere.   Compare\n\nUnited States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644, 652 (3d Cir. 1999)\n\n(holding that if a district court chooses to recharacterize a\n\npro se prisoner's post-conviction motion as a habeas petition,\n\nit first must take prophylactic measures to warn the prisoner of\n\nthe consequences of the conversion under AEDPA and give him the\n\nopportunity to withdraw the pleading), and Adams v. United\n\nStates, 155 F.3d 582, 584 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (similar),\n\nwith In re Tolliver, 97 F.3d 89, 90 (5th Cir. 1996) (per curiam)\n\n(applying AEDPA's \"second or successive\" requirements to bar\n\nrelief when the district court had construed a pro se prisoner's\n\nprior pleading as a section 2255 petition).     We take a view\n\nsimilar to, but more narrowly confined than, the    Miller and\n\n\n\n    1In terms, 28 U.S.C. § 2255 speaks of a \"motion\" rather than\na \"petition,\" yet the latter word is more commonly used to\ndescribe the vehicle by which a person held in custody seeks\npost-conviction relief. Accordingly, we use the term \"petition\"\nthroughout this opinion in order to avoid confusion.      By the\nsame token, we use the phrases \"section 2255 petition,\" \"habeas\npetition,\"   and   \"petition    for   post-conviction    relief\"\ninterchangeably.\n\n                              -4-\n\fAdams courts.    In the end, we reverse the order of dismissal and\n\nremand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                    I.\n\n                                Background\n\n           On April 6, 1992, a federal grand jury in the District\n\nof New Hampshire indicted petitioner-appellant Bruce T. Raineri\n\nfor conspiring to obstruct commerce by robbery involving force\n\nor violence, using or carrying a firearm in connection with that\n\nconspiracy, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.          See\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 1951, 924(c)(1), 922(g).          The petitioner pled\n\nguilty to all three charges on June 17, 1992.            He tried to\n\nwithdraw   his   plea   twice    thereafter.   Both   efforts   failed\n\n(although the government did agree to dismiss the felon-in-\n\npossession count).\n\n           On September 27, 1993, the district court (Devine, J.)\n\nsentenced the petitioner to a ten-year incarcerative term, to be\n\nfollowed by a five-year term of supervised release.        The court\n\nalso ordered the petitioner to make restitution and pay a $100\n\nspecial assessment.     The petitioner appealed, alleging that his\n\nguilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, or properly informed.\n\nWe found the change-of-plea hearing to have been contaminated by\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f\"a set of mistakes.\"            United States v. Raineri, 42 F.3d 36, 40\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).            We nonetheless concluded that those bevues\n\nwere harmless and that the district court acted within its\n\ndiscretion        in     denying   the    petitioner's       serial       motions    to\n\nwithdraw his plea.           Id. at 42-44.        Accordingly we affirmed the\n\nconviction         and    sentence       (in    the      process     rejecting      the\n\npetitioner's quest for a downward departure).2                      Id. at 44.      The\n\nUnited States Supreme Court thereafter denied certiorari.                           515\n\nU.S. 1126 (1995).\n\n                On January 22, 1996, the petitioner, acting pro se,\n\nfiled what he termed a \"Motion for Correction of Sentence and/or\n\nNew Trial.\"        He brought the motion \"pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\nRule       35   and/or   Rule   33\"   and      alleged    that     the   government's\n\nproffer at the change-of-plea hearing had been insufficient as\n\na matter of law in respect to the firearms count under a newly-\n\ndecided Supreme Court case, Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S.\n\n137 (1995).        On July 11, 1996, Judge Devine, acting sua sponte,\n\nfound Rules 33 and 35 inapplicable, but recharacterized the\n\npetitioner's motion as an application for post-conviction relief\n\n\n\n\n       2\n     We did, however, remand to clarify an ambiguity as to\nwhether the dismissal of the felon-in-possession count operated\nwith prejudice.    Raineri, 42 F.3d at 43.      On remand, the\ndistrict court satisfactorily resolved that uncertainty.\n\n                                          -6-\n\funder     28    U.S.C.     §        2255.       The   judge     then   denied     the\n\nrecharacterized motion on the merits.\n\n               The petitioner promptly filed a notice of appeal.                   We\n\ntreated    the    notice       as    an     application   for   a   certificate    of\n\nappealability, see 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), found it meritless, and\n\nterminated the erstwhile appeal.3                  The petitioner again sought\n\ncertiorari, but to no avail.                  522 U.S. 879 (1997).\n\n               On April 21, 1997, the petitioner, still appearing pro\n\nse, filed a \"Motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside\n\nor Correct Sentence.\"               This motion raised a plethora of claims,\n\nincluding prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of\n\ntrial and appellate counsel, and an assortment of supposed\n\nerrors attributable to the district court.                          The petitioner\n\nsupplemented this pleading on several occasions, endeavoring to\n\nadd more issues.\n\n               The 1997 habeas petition languished for over two years,\n\ndue in part to the untimely death of Judge Devine.                     Eventually,\n\nhowever, the file was reassigned to Judge McAuliffe.                       On July\n\n26, 1999, the government responded for the first time to the\n\npetitioner's pleadings, alleging, inter alia, that the pending\n\nsection 2255 petition was Raineri's second such petition, and\n\n\n    3The petitioner filed several other motions in connection\nwith his appeal.    For present purposes, those motions are\nimmaterial and we need not dwell on the details.\n\n                                             -7-\n\fthat he had failed to receive the requisite authorization from\n\nthe court of appeals to proceed with a second or successive\n\nhabeas petition.      See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A) (as incorporated\n\nin 28 U.S.C. § 2255); see also Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d\n\n54, 58 (1st Cir. 1997) (discussing statutory regime),                 cert.\n\ndenied, 523 U.S. 1123 (1998).           The petitioner replied that he\n\nhad no need to go through the authorization procedure because\n\nthe pending petition constituted his first such filing.\n\n           On December 8, 1999, Judge McAuliffe resolved this\n\ndispute in the government's favor.            He ruled, in substance, that\n\nthe recharacterized 1996 motion counted as a habeas petition for\n\nAEDPA purposes, and that, therefore, the pending petition was a\n\nsecond petition under the statute.            On this basis, he held that\n\nthe district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition\n\nand transferred the matter to this court to determine whether a\n\ncertificate of appealability should issue.                  See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2253(c).\n\n           At   our     direction,      the     petitioner     prepared    an\n\napplication for leave to file a second or successive petition.\n\nAt the same time, he renewed his asseveration that the pending\n\npetition actually was his first, and that he needed no special\n\nauthorization to proceed in the district court.              Recognizing the\n\nsubtlety   of   the   problem,   we    authorized     the    appointment   of\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcounsel for the petitioner on April 14, 2000, and ordered the\n\nparties     to   brief     the      question     of    whether         sua    sponte\n\nrecharacterization       of   an     earlier    motion      as   a    section    2255\n\npetition     can      trigger       AEDPA's      \"second         or    successive\"\n\nrequirements.      It is to that question that we now turn.\n\n                                       II.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n            AEDPA, which took effect on April 24, 1996, imposes\n\nsubstantial procedural restrictions on second or successive\n\nhabeas     petitions.         Of    particular     relevance          here,     AEDPA\n\nincorporates by reference in section 2255 the same screen that\n\nit makes applicable to second or successive habeas petitions\n\nprosecuted on behalf of state prisoners:               it requires a federal\n\nprisoner,    before     prosecuting      a    second   or    successive       habeas\n\npetition in the district court, to obtain from \"the appropriate\n\ncourt of appeals . . . an order authorizing the district court\n\nto consider the application.\"                28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A) (as\n\nincorporated in 28 U.S.C. § 2255).               In turn, AEDPA directs the\n\ncourt of appeals to exercise this gatekeeping power sparingly,\n\nin conformity with a rigorous set of substantive standards.                       See\n\nPratt, 129 F.3d at 60-63 (discussing statutory provision and\n\nconcomitant standards).            Despite the fact that the petitioner's\n\ninitial Rule 33/Rule 35 motion in this case was filed before\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fAEDPA's effective date, it nonetheless has the capacity to\n\ntrigger the new requirements for second or successive petitions.\n\nSee id. at 60 (holding that if a prisoner filed a section 2255\n\npetition prior to AEDPA's effective date and thereafter lost on\n\nthe merits, then a subsequent section 2255 petition, filed after\n\nAEDPA's effective date, must satisfy the procedural strictures\n\nthat AEDPA attaches to second or successive habeas petitions).\n\nThe question, then, reduces to whether a pro se petitioner's\n\nrecharacterized pleading should be deemed a habeas petition for\n\nAEDPA purposes.\n\n         The Fifth Circuit answered this question affirmatively\n\nin Tolliver, 97 F.3d at 90.    But that answer seems to lead to a\n\nperverse result:    a judge who strives to balance the scales of\n\njustice by construing pro se prisoner pleadings liberally risks\n\nprecluding   the   pleader   from   any   opportunity   to   litigate\n\npotentially meritorious constitutional claims.      Mindful of this\n\nanomaly, the Second Circuit, in Adams, 155 F.3d at 584, and the\n\nThird Circuit, in Miller, 197 F.3d at 652, have answered similar\n\nquestions in the negative.    Withal, the Adams court embellished\n\nits answer by imposing a limitation on the ongoing authority of\n\nthe district courts.   It declared that:\n\n         [D]istrict courts should not recharacterize\n         a motion purportedly made under some other\n         rule as a motion made under § 2255 unless\n         (a) the movant, with knowledge of the\n\n                                -10-\n\f           potential adverse consequences of such\n           recharacterization, agrees to have the\n           motion so recharacterized, or (b) the court\n           finds that, notwithstanding its designation,\n           the motion should be considered as made\n           under § 2255 because of the nature of the\n           relief sought, and offers the movant the\n           opportunity to withdraw the motion rather\n           than have it so recharacterized.\n\nAdams, 155 F.3d at 584.       Miller advocated a nearly identical\n\nrule.    197 F.3d at 652.\n\n           With respect, we believe that Adams and Miller sweep\n\nmore broadly than the exigencies of this situation require.\n\nThose decisions not only ameliorate the problem but also burden\n\nthe district courts with a new protocol.            We are reluctant to\n\nemulate that example.       After all, there are times, even after\n\nAEDPA, when recharacterization will be to a pro se litigant's\n\nbenefit, or in the interests of justice, or otherwise plainly\n\nwarranted.     Consequently,    we   do   not   think   that    we   should\n\ndiscourage    overburdened     district    courts    from      pursuing   a\n\nsometimes useful practice by forcing them to jump through extra\n\nhoops.   Doing so might well result in losing the baby along with\n\nthe bath water.\n\n           In any event, the problem presented in cases like this\n\ncan be resolved without risking such unfortunate consequences.\n\n\"The phrase 'second or successive petition' is a term of art,\"\n\ndesigned to avoid abuse of the writ.       Slack v. McDaniel, 120 S.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fCt 1595, 1605 (2000).           Thus, not every post-conviction motion,\n\nnor even every habeas petition, furnishes the foundation for\n\ntreating a subsequent habeas petition as \"second or successive.\"\n\nE.g., id. (holding that a habeas petition dismissed for want of\n\nexhaustion cannot serve as a basis for subsequently invoking the\n\n\"second   or   successive\"       requirements);       Stewart      v.   Martinez-\n\nVillareal, 523 U.S. 637, 644-45 (1998) (holding to like effect\n\nwith regard to a habeas petition dismissed as premature).                     Along\n\nthese lines, we do not believe that a pro se pleading which is\n\nneither   denominated      as    a    habeas    petition   nor   substantially\n\nequivalent     to   a   habeas       petition   can   function     as   a    proper\n\npredicate for purposes of the \"second or successive\" regime\n\nmerely because the trial court, acting without advance notice\n\nto, or the informed consent of, the pleader, spontaneously\n\nrecharacterizes it as a habeas petition.                We hold, therefore,\n\nthat when a district court, acting sua sponte, converts a post-\n\nconviction motion filed under some other statute or rule into a\n\nsection 2255 petition without notice and an opportunity to be\n\nheard (or in the alternative, the pleader's informed consent),\n\nthe   recharacterized      motion       ordinarily    will   not    count     as   a\n\n\"first\"   habeas        petition       sufficient     to     trigger        AEDPA's\n\ngatekeeping requirements.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f            This holding disposes of the instant appeal.      The\n\npetitioner's original motion was not premised upon section 2255\n\nat all, but, rather, upon Rules 33 and 35.    Having dictated the\n\nterms of engagement, the petitioner was entitled to have his\n\nmotion decided as he had framed it.4     The district court could\n\nnot, without the petitioner's informed consent, transmogrify\n\nthat motion into a habeas petition sufficient to extinguish the\n\npetitioner's one clear chance at habeas relief under AEDPA.   For\n\nthat reason, the district court should have treated the instant\n\napplication as a \"first\" habeas petition.\n\n            Let us be perfectly clear.   We do not doubt that the\n\ndistrict court, in recharacterizing the petitioner's pleading,\n\nwas endeavoring to treat a pro se litigant fairly.     We applaud\n\nthat solicitude.    But, because the court acted sua sponte and\n\nwithout any advance notice to the petitioner, we cannot treat\n\nthe earlier pleading as a \"first\" habeas petition for AEDPA\n\npurposes.    It follows inexorably that the district court erred\n\nin deeming the current pleading a \"second or successive\" habeas\n\npetition.\n\n\n\n    4 The motion, as submitted, was a losing proposition. Rule\n33 was inapplicable because the petitioner's conviction did not\nfollow a trial, see, e.g., United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d\n70, 78 (1st Cir. 1995), and Rule 35 was inapplicable on its\nface.   Thus, the district court could have denied it out of\nhand.\n\n                               -13-\n\f                                    III.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n             In an era in which Congress has seen fit to narrow the\n\ndoorway to habeas relief, fairness concerns dictate that courts\n\ntake care not to apply the new law woodenly.               So it is here:\n\nunder the circumstances of this case, the petitioner's Rule\n\n33/Rule      35    motion,    notwithstanding        its      sua   sponte\n\nrecharacterization by the district court, cannot be considered\n\na \"first\" habeas petition within the meaning of AEDPA.

As part and parcel of that solicitude, courts frequently have recharacterized inartfully drawn pleadings to assist pro se prisoners who mistakenly relied on inappropriate rules or statutes.  The enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.) altered the dynamics of this entrenched practice in respect to post-conviction motions in criminal cases.  Under AEDPA, a prisoner, whether federal or state, retains the right to press a first petition for a writ of habeas corpus -- but second or successive petitions may be pressed only under very limited circumstances.  See 28 U.S.C.  2255, 2244(b).  This change in the law raised the stakes attendant to recharacterizing a post-conviction motion as a habeas petition:  conversion, though initially meant to guide a prisoner through the thicket of legal technicalities, suddenly had the potential to deprive him of his one full and fair opportunity to seek habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal requires us to answer a pointed question:  When a district court, acting sua sponte, recharacterizes a federal prisoner's post-conviction motion as a section 2255 petition, see 28 U.S.C.  2255,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> does that action render the prisoner's later attempt to file a section 2255 petition a second or successive petition within the purview of the AEDPA amendments?  This is an unanswered query in this circuit, but one that has divided the courts of appeals elsewhere.  Compare United States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644, 652 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that if a district court chooses to recharacterize a pro se prisoner's post-conviction motion as a habeas petition, it first must take prophylactic measures to warn the prisoner of the consequences of the conversion under AEDPA and give him the opportunity to withdraw the pleading), and Adams v. United States, 155 F.3d 582, 584 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (similar), with In re Tolliver, 97 F.3d 89, 90 (5th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (applying AEDPA's \"second or successive\" requirements to bar relief when the district court had construed a pro se prisoner's prior pleading as a section 2255 petition).  We take a view similar to, but more narrowly confined than, the Miller and Adams courts.  In the end, we reverse the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 1992, a federal grand jury in the District of New Hampshire indicted petitioner-appellant Bruce T. Raineri for conspiring to obstruct commerce by robbery involving force or violence, using or carrying a firearm in connection with that conspiracy, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  See 18 U.S.C.  1951, 924(c)(1), 922(g).  The petitioner pled guilty to all three charges on June 17, 1992.  He tried to withdraw his plea twice thereafter.  Both efforts failed (although the government did agree to dismiss the felon-in-possession count).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 1993, the district court (Devine, J.) sentenced the petitioner to a ten-year incarcerative term, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.  The court also ordered the petitioner to make restitution and pay a $100 special assessment.  The petitioner appealed, alleging that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, or properly informed.  We found the change-of-plea hearing to have been contaminated by \"a set of mistakes.\"  United States v. Raineri, 42 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 1994).  We nonetheless concluded that those bevues were harmless and that the district court acted within its discretion in denying the petitioner's serial motions to withdraw his plea.  Id. at 42-44.  Accordingly we affirmed the conviction and sentence (in the process rejecting the petitioner's quest for a downward departure).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Id. at 44.  The United States Supreme Court thereafter denied certiorari.  515 U.S. 1126 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 1996, the petitioner, acting pro se, filed what he termed a \"Motion for Correction of Sentence and/or New Trial.\"  He brought the motion \"pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 35 and/or Rule 33\" and alleged that the government's proffer at the change-of-plea hearing had been insufficient as a matter of law in respect to the firearms count under a newly-decided Supreme Court case, Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137 (1995).  On July 11, 1996, Judge Devine, acting sua sponte, found Rules 33 and 35 inapplicable, but recharacterized the petitioner's motion as an application for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C.  2255.  The judge then denied the recharacterized motion on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner promptly filed a notice of appeal.  We treated the notice as an application for a certificate of appealability, see 28 U.S.C.  2253(c), found it meritless, and terminated the erstwhile appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The petitioner again sought certiorari, but to no avail.  522 U.S. 879 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 1997, the petitioner, still appearing pro se, filed a \"Motion under 28 U.S.C.  2255 to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence.\"  This motion raised a plethora of claims, including prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, and an assortment of supposed errors attributable to the district court.  The petitioner supplemented this pleading on several occasions, endeavoring to add more issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1997 habeas petition languished for over two years, due in part to the untimely death of Judge Devine.  Eventually, however, the file was reassigned to Judge McAuliffe.  On July 26, 1999, the government responded for the first time to the petitioner's pleadings, alleging, inter alia, that the pending section 2255 petition was Raineri's second such petition, and that he had failed to receive the requisite authorization from the court of appeals to proceed with a second or successive habeas petition.  See 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(3)(A) (as incorporated in 28 U.S.C.  2255); see also Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 1997) (discussing statutory regime), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1123 (1998).  The petitioner replied that he had no need to go through the authorization procedure because the pending petition constituted his first such filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 8, 1999, Judge McAuliffe resolved this dispute in the government's favor.  He ruled, in substance, that the recharacterized 1996 motion counted as a habeas petition for AEDPA purposes, and that, therefore, the pending petition was a second petition under the statute.  On this basis, he held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition and transferred the matter to this court to determine whether a certificate of appealability should issue.  See 28 U.S.C.  2253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At our direction, the petitioner prepared an application for leave to file a second or successive petition.  At the same time, he renewed his asseveration that the pending petition actually was his first, and that he needed no special authorization to proceed in the district court.  Recognizing the subtlety of the problem, we authorized the appointment of counsel for the petitioner on April 14, 2000, and ordered the parties to brief the question of whether sua sponte recharacterization of an earlier motion as a section 2255 petition can trigger AEDPA's \"second or successive\" requirements.  It is to that question that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AEDPA, which took effect on April 24, 1996, imposes substantial procedural restrictions on second or successive habeas petitions.  Of particular relevance here, AEDPA incorporates by reference in section 2255 the same screen that it makes applicable to second or successive habeas petitions prosecuted on behalf of state prisoners:  it requires a federal prisoner, before prosecuting a second or successive habeas petition in the district court, to obtain from \"the appropriate court of appeals . . . an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\"  28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(3)(A) (as incorporated in 28 U.S.C.  2255).  In turn, AEDPA directs the court of appeals to exercise this gatekeeping power sparingly, in conformity with a rigorous set of substantive standards.  See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 60-63 (discussing statutory provision and concomitant standards).  Despite the fact that the petitioner's initial Rule 33/Rule 35 motion in this case was filed before AEDPA's effective date, it nonetheless has the capacity to trigger the new requirements for second or successive petitions.  See id. at 60 (holding that if a prisoner filed a section 2255 petition prior to AEDPA's effective date and thereafter lost on the merits, then a subsequent section 2255 petition, filed after AEDPA's effective date, must satisfy the procedural strictures that AEDPA attaches to second or successive habeas petitions).  The question, then, reduces to whether a pro se petitioner's recharacterized pleading should be deemed a habeas petition for AEDPA purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit answered this question affirmatively in Tolliver, 97 F.3d at 90.  But that answer seems to lead to a perverse result:  a judge who strives to balance the scales of justice by construing pro se prisoner pleadings liberally risks precluding the pleader from any opportunity to litigate potentially meritorious constitutional claims.  Mindful of this anomaly, the Second Circuit, in Adams, 155 F.3d at 584, and the Third Circuit, in Miller, 197 F.3d at 652, have answered similar questions in the negative.  Withal, the Adams court embellished its answer by imposing a limitation on the ongoing authority of the district courts.  It declared that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]istrict courts should not recharacterize a motion purportedly made under some other rule as a motion made under  2255 unless (a) the movant, with knowledge of the potential adverse consequences of such recharacterization, agrees to have the motion so recharacterized, or (b) the court finds that, notwithstanding its designation, the motion should be considered as made under  2255 because of the nature of the relief sought, and offers the movant the opportunity to withdraw the motion rather than have it so recharacterized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adams, 155 F.3d at 584.  Miller advocated a nearly identical rule.  197 F.3d at 652.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect, we believe that Adams and Miller sweep more broadly than the exigencies of this situation require.  Those decisions not only ameliorate the problem but also burden the district courts with a new protocol.  We are reluctant to emulate that example.  After all, there are times, even after AEDPA, when recharacterization will be to a pro se litigant's benefit, or in the interests of justice, or otherwise plainly warranted.  Consequently, we do not think that we should discourage overburdened district courts from pursuing a sometimes useful practice by forcing them to jump through extra hoops.  Doing so might well result in losing the baby along with the bath water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the problem presented in cases like this  can be resolved without risking such unfortunate consequences.  \"The phrase 'second or successive petition' is a term of art,\" designed to avoid abuse of the writ.  Slack v. McDaniel, 120 S. Ct 1595, 1605 (2000).  Thus, not every post-conviction motion, nor even every habeas petition, furnishes the foundation for treating a subsequent habeas petition as \"second or successive.\"  E.g., id. (holding that a habeas petition dismissed for want of exhaustion cannot serve as a basis for subsequently invoking the \"second or successive\" requirements); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637, 644-45 (1998) (holding to like effect with regard to a habeas petition dismissed as premature).  Along these lines, we do not believe that a pro se pleading which is neither denominated as a habeas petition nor substantially equivalent to a habeas petition can function as a proper predicate for purposes of the \"second or successive\" regime merely because the trial court, acting without advance notice to, or the informed consent of, the pleader, spontaneously recharacterizes it as a habeas petition.  We hold, therefore, that when a district court, acting sua sponte, converts a post-conviction motion filed under some other statute or rule into a section 2255 petition without notice and an opportunity to be heard (or in the alternative, the pleader's informed consent), the recharacterized motion ordinarily will not count as a \"first\" habeas petition sufficient to trigger AEDPA's gatekeeping requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding disposes of the instant appeal.  The petitioner's original motion was not premised upon section 2255 at all, but, rather, upon Rules 33 and 35.  Having dictated the terms of engagement, the petitioner was entitled to have his motion decided as he had framed it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court could not, without the petitioner's informed consent, transmogrify that motion into a habeas petition sufficient to extinguish the petitioner's one clear chance at habeas relief under AEDPA.  For that reason, the district court should have treated the instant application as a \"first\" habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear.  We do not doubt that the district court, in recharacterizing the petitioner's pleading, was endeavoring to treat a pro se litigant fairly.  We applaud that solicitude.  But, because the court acted sua sponte and without any advance notice to the petitioner, we cannot treat the earlier pleading as a \"first\" habeas petition for AEDPA purposes.  It follows inexorably that the district court erred in deeming the current pleading a \"second or successive\" habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an era in which Congress has seen fit to narrow the doorway to habeas relief, fairness concerns dictate that courts take care not to apply the new law woodenly.  So it is here:  under the circumstances of this case, the petitioner's Rule 33/Rule 35 motion, notwithstanding its sua sponte recharacterization by the district court, cannot be considered a \"first\" habeas petition within the meaning of AEDPA.  And if that motion was not a \"first\" petition, the application at issue here cannot be a \"second\" petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For these reasons, we reverse the order of dismissal, vacate the transfer order, and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  The petitioner's provisional application for leave to file a second or successive habeas petition, prepared at our direction, is deemed withdrawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   In terms, 28 U.S.C.  2255 speaks of a \"motion\" rather than a \"petition,\" yet the latter word is more commonly used to describe the vehicle by which a person held in custody seeks post-conviction relief.  Accordingly, we use the term \"petition\" throughout this opinion in order to avoid confusion.  By the same token, we use the phrases \"section 2255 petition,\" \"habeas petition,\" and \"petition for post-conviction relief\" interchangeably.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>   We did, however, remand to clarify an ambiguity as to whether the dismissal of the felon-in-possession count operated with prejudice.  Raineri, 42 F.3d at 43.  On remand, the district court satisfactorily resolved that uncertainty.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>   The petitioner filed several other motions in connection with his appeal.

Rule 33 was inapplicable because the petitioner's conviction did not follow a trial, see, e.g., United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 78 (1st Cir. 1995), and Rule 35 was inapplicable on its face.  Thus, the district court could have denied it out of hand.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Both efforts failed (although the government did agree to dismiss the felon-in-possession count).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 1993, the district court (Devine, J.) sentenced the petitioner to a ten-year incarcerative term, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.  The court also ordered the petitioner to make restitution and pay a $100 special assessment.  The petitioner appealed, alleging that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, or properly informed.  We found the change-of-plea hearing to have been contaminated by \"a set of mistakes.\"  United States v. Raineri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195774\"><a href=\"/opinion/195774/united-states-v-raineri/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir. 1994).  We nonetheless concluded that those bevues were harmless and that the district court acted within its discretion in denying the petitioner's serial motions to withdraw his plea.  Id. at 42-44.  Accordingly we affirmed the conviction and sentence (in the process rejecting the petitioner's quest for a downward departure).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Id. at 44.  The United States Supreme Court thereafter denied certiorari.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></span> (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, 1996, the petitioner, acting pro se, filed what he termed a \"Motion for Correction of Sentence and/or New Trial.\"  He brought the motion \"pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 35 and/or Rule 33\" and alleged that the government's proffer at the change-of-plea hearing had been insufficient as a matter of law in respect to the firearms count under a newly-decided Supreme Court case, Bailey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span> (1995).  On July 11, 1996, Judge Devine, acting sua sponte, found Rules 33 and 35 inapplicable, but recharacterized the petitioner's motion as an application for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C.  2255.  The judge then denied the recharacterized motion on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner promptly filed a notice of appeal.  We treated the notice as an application for a certificate of appealability, see 28 U.S.C.  2253(c), found it meritless, and terminated the erstwhile appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The petitioner again sought certiorari, but to no avail.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></span> (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21, 1997, the petitioner, still appearing pro se, filed a \"Motion under 28 U.S.C.  2255 to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence.\"  This motion raised a plethora of claims, including prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, and an assortment of supposed errors attributable to the district court.  The petitioner supplemented this pleading on several occasions, endeavoring to add more issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1997 habeas petition languished for over two years, due in part to the untimely death of Judge Devine.  Eventually, however, the file was reassigned to Judge McAuliffe.  On July 26, 1999, the government responded for the first time to the petitioner's pleadings, alleging, inter alia, that the pending section 2255 petition was Raineri's second such petition, and that he had failed to receive the requisite authorization from the court of appeals to proceed with a second or successive habeas petition.  See 28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(3)(A) (as incorporated in 28 U.S.C.  2255); see also Pratt v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197639\"><a href=\"/opinion/197639/pratt-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir. 1997) (discussing statutory regime), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></span> (1998).  The petitioner replied that he had no need to go through the authorization procedure because the pending petition constituted his first such filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 8, 1999, Judge McAuliffe resolved this dispute in the government's favor.  He ruled, in substance, that the recharacterized 1996 motion counted as a habeas petition for AEDPA purposes, and that, therefore, the pending petition was a second petition under the statute.  On this basis, he held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition and transferred the matter to this court to determine whether a certificate of appealability should issue.  See 28 U.S.C.  2253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At our direction, the petitioner prepared an application for leave to file a second or successive petition.  At the same time, he renewed his asseveration that the pending petition actually was his first, and that he needed no special authorization to proceed in the district court.  Recognizing the subtlety of the problem, we authorized the appointment of counsel for the petitioner on April 14, 2000, and ordered the parties to brief the question of whether sua sponte recharacterization of an earlier motion as a section 2255 petition can trigger AEDPA's \"second or successive\" requirements.  It is to that question that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AEDPA, which took effect on April 24, 1996, imposes substantial procedural restrictions on second or successive habeas petitions.  Of particular relevance here, AEDPA incorporates by reference in section 2255 the same screen that it makes applicable to second or successive habeas petitions prosecuted on behalf of state prisoners:  it requires a federal prisoner, before prosecuting a second or successive habeas petition in the district court, to obtain from \"the appropriate court of appeals . . . an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\"  28 U.S.C.  2244(b)(3)(A) (as incorporated in 28 U.S.C.  2255).  In turn, AEDPA directs the court of appeals to exercise this gatekeeping power sparingly, in conformity with a rigorous set of substantive standards.  See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 60-63 (discussing statutory provision and concomitant standards).  Despite the fact that the petitioner's initial Rule 33/Rule 35 motion in this case was filed before AEDPA's effective date, it nonetheless has the capacity to trigger the new requirements for second or successive petitions.  See id. at 60 (holding that if a prisoner filed a section 2255 petition prior to AEDPA's effective date and thereafter lost on the merits, then a subsequent section 2255 petition, filed after AEDPA's effective date, must satisfy the procedural strictures that AEDPA attaches to second or successive habeas petitions).  The question, then, reduces to whether a pro se petitioner's recharacterized pleading should be deemed a habeas petition for AEDPA purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit answered this question affirmatively in Tolliver, 97 F.3d at 90.  But that answer seems to lead to a perverse result:  a judge who strives to balance the scales of justice by construing pro se prisoner pleadings liberally risks precluding the pleader from any opportunity to litigate potentially meritorious constitutional claims.  Mindful of this anomaly, the Second Circuit, in Adams, 155 F.3d at 584, and the Third Circuit, in Miller, 197 F.3d at 652, have answered similar questions in the negative.  Withal, the Adams court embellished its answer by imposing a limitation on the ongoing authority of the district courts.  It declared that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]istrict courts should not recharacterize a motion purportedly made under some other rule as a motion made under  2255 unless (a) the movant, with knowledge of the potential adverse consequences of such recharacterization, agrees to have the motion so recharacterized, or (b) the court finds that, notwithstanding its designation, the motion should be considered as made under  2255 because of the nature of the relief sought, and offers the movant the opportunity to withdraw the motion rather than have it so recharacterized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adams, 155 F.3d at 584.  Miller advocated a nearly identical rule.  197 F.3d at 652.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect, we believe that Adams and Miller sweep more broadly than the exigencies of this situation require.  Those decisions not only ameliorate the problem but also burden the district courts with a new protocol.  We are reluctant to emulate that example.  After all, there are times, even after AEDPA, when recharacterization will be to a pro se litigant's benefit, or in the interests of justice, or otherwise plainly warranted.  Consequently, we do not think that we should discourage overburdened district courts from pursuing a sometimes useful practice by forcing them to jump through extra hoops.  Doing so might well result in losing the baby along with the bath water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the problem presented in cases like this  can be resolved without risking such unfortunate consequences.  \"The phrase 'second or successive petition' is a term of art,\" designed to avoid abuse of the writ.  Slack v. McDaniel, 120 S. Ct 1595, 1605 (2000).  Thus, not every post-conviction motion, nor even every habeas petition, furnishes the foundation for treating a subsequent habeas petition as \"second or successive.\"  E.g., id. (holding that a habeas petition dismissed for want of exhaustion cannot serve as a basis for subsequently invoking the \"second or successive\" requirements); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118206\"><a href=\"/opinion/118206/stewart-v-martinez-villareal/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 644-45 (1998) (holding to like effect with regard to a habeas petition dismissed as premature).  Along these lines, we do not believe that a pro se pleading which is neither denominated as a habeas petition nor substantially equivalent to a habeas petition can function as a proper predicate for purposes of the \"second or successive\" regime merely because the trial court, acting without advance notice to, or the informed consent of, the pleader, spontaneously recharacterizes it as a habeas petition.  We hold, therefore, that when a district court, acting sua sponte, converts a post-conviction motion filed under some other statute or rule into a section 2255 petition without notice and an opportunity to be heard (or in the alternative, the pleader's informed consent), the recharacterized motion ordinarily will not count as a \"first\" habeas petition sufficient to trigger AEDPA's gatekeeping requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding disposes of the instant appeal.  The petitioner's original motion was not premised upon section 2255 at all, but, rather, upon Rules 33 and 35.  Having dictated the terms of engagement, the petitioner was entitled to have his motion decided as he had framed it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court could not, without the petitioner's informed consent, transmogrify that motion into a habeas petition sufficient to extinguish the petitioner's one clear chance at habeas relief under AEDPA.  For that reason, the district court should have treated the instant application as a \"first\" habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear.  We do not doubt that the district court, in recharacterizing the petitioner's pleading, was endeavoring to treat a pro se litigant fairly.  We applaud that solicitude.  But, because the court acted sua sponte and without any advance notice to the petitioner, we cannot treat the earlier pleading as a \"first\" habeas petition for AEDPA purposes.  It follows inexorably that the district court erred in deeming the current pleading a \"second or successive\" habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an era in which Congress has seen fit to narrow the doorway to habeas relief, fairness concerns dictate that courts take care not to apply the new law woodenly.  So it is here:  under the circumstances of this case, the petitioner's Rule 33/Rule 35 motion, notwithstanding its sua sponte recharacterization by the district court, cannot be considered a \"first\" habeas petition within the meaning of AEDPA.  And if that motion was not a \"first\" petition, the application at issue here cannot be a \"second\" petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For these reasons, we reverse the order of dismissal, vacate the transfer order, and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  The petitioner's provisional application for leave to file a second or successive habeas petition, prepared at our direction, is deemed withdrawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   In terms, 28 U.S.C.  2255 speaks of a \"motion\" rather than a \"petition,\" yet the latter word is more commonly used to describe the vehicle by which a person held in custody seeks post-conviction relief.  Accordingly, we use the term \"petition\" throughout this opinion in order to avoid confusion.  By the same token, we use the phrases \"section 2255 petition,\" \"habeas petition,\" and \"petition for post-conviction relief\" interchangeably.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>   We did, however, remand to clarify an ambiguity as to whether the dismissal of the felon-in-possession count operated with prejudice.  Raineri, 42 F.3d at 43.  On remand, the district court satisfactorily resolved that uncertainty.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>   The petitioner filed several other motions in connection with his appeal.  For present purposes, those motions are immaterial and we need not dwell on the details.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>   The motion, as submitted, was a losing proposition.  Rule 33 was inapplicable because the petitioner's conviction did not follow a trial, see, e.g., United States v. Graciani, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir. 1995), and Rule 35 was inapplicable on its face.  Thus, the district court could have denied it out of hand.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
