Michael A. Crooker,  who is currently\r                                \r\n\nserving  a  96-month term  of  imprisonment,  appeals from  a\r\n\ndistrict  court order denying his motion to delete or amend a\r\n\nspecial  condition  of supervised  release  requiring him  to\r\n\ncomply with the requirements  of the Internal Revenue Service\r\n\n(I.R.S).  We think that Crooker's concern that  the condition\r\n\nis  too vague is premature.   Crooker's probation officer has\r\n\nindicated that the I.R.S.  will contact Crooker directly with\r\n\nits  requirements and  instructions.   Cf.  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGallo,  20 F.3d  7, 12  (1st Cir.  1994) (observing  that the\r                 \r\n\nnotification  process is not  limited to the  four corners of\r\n\nthe  probation order,  and that  the meaning  of a  probation\r\n\norder  may  be illuminated  by  the  judge's statements,  the\r\n\nprobation officer's instructions, or other events, any or all\r\n\nof which may assist  in completing the notification process).\r\n\nShould  the I.R.S. fail to do so on or about the time Crooker\r\n\nis  released--or   should   the  instructions   be   unclear,\r\n\nincomplete, or  otherwise leave  any  of Crooker's  questions\r\n\nunanswered--Crooker  may  seek  further   clarification  from\r\n\nProbation  or from  the district  court.   Similarly, Crooker\r\n\nmay, at that  time, bring  to the attention  of the  district\r\n\ncourt   any   concern  that   the  I.R.S.   instructions  are\r\n\ninconsistent  with the  plea agreement  or with  the district\r\n\ncourt's intent at sentencing.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.
