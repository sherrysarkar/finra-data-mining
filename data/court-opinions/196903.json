The  motion to recuse  Judge Torruella  is\r                           \r\n\ndenied.\r\n\n     We summarily affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs' action.\r\n\nTo the  extent plaintiffs were  asking the district  court to\r\n\nreview,  set  aside, or  effectively  annul the  Commonwealth\r\n\ncourt  orders,  plaintiffs'  action  was  properly  dismissed\r\n\nbecause  the district  court  lacked  jurisdiction to  review\r\n\nthose orders.

The  remainder of  plaintiffs'  action was  properly\r\n\ndismissed because  plaintiffs failed adequately  to state any\r\n\nclaim  under  either  federal  or  Commonwealth  law  against\r\n\ndefendants.   The district court did not abuse its discretion\r\n\nin  failing to afford  plaintiffs any further  opportunity to\r\n\namend their complaint.  Nor is there any merit in plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims of bias.\r\n\n     Appellees  ask in  their  brief  for  double  costs  and\r\n\nattorneys  fees   to  be  assessed   because  of  appellants'\r\n\nrepetitive,  frivolous   filings.     Appellants'  litigation\r\n\ntactics  are abusive.   Their filings are  extremely verbose,\r\n\nrepetitive, and  often incoherent.   They  continue to  press\r\n\narguments  which  we  have   rejected  in  appellants'  other\r\n\nappeals.   They  do not  reserve  their reply  brief for  new\r\n\narguments,  but rather repeat at length material presented in\r\n\ntheir  main brief.
