Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                     \r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n               Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\nHall, Senior Circuit Judge,  \r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n  Bruce J. McGiverin for appellant.\r\n  Miguel A. Pereira, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\r\nGuillermo Gil, U.S. Attorney, Jos A. Quiles-Espinosa, Senior\r\nLitigation Counsel, and Nelson Prez-Sosa and Rebecca Kellogg de\r\nJess, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, were on brief, for appellee.  \r\n\n                                       \r\n\n                    December 1, 1998\r\n                                \r\n                                    LYNCH, Circuit Judge.  Yamil Serrano-Delgado contends\r\nthat the district court erred in denying his requests to\r\nwithdraw his guilty plea and that his counsel provided\r\nineffective assistance.  We affirm his conviction.\r\n                            I\r\n                                    Serrano-Delgado was one of thirty-seven defendants\r\nindicted in connection with a violent drug conspiracy.  (For a\r\nfurther recitation of the factual background, see United Statesv. Solano-Moreta, No. 98-1091, a companion case that we also\r\ndecide today.)  On June 25, 1996, twelve days before trial\r\nbegan, Serrano-Delgado pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute\r\ncontrolled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1). \r\n  Serrano-Delgado first communicated his desire to\r\nwithdraw his guilty plea to the district court in late August\r\n1996, after the acquittal of five of his co-defendants at trial. \r\nIn a formal motion filed on November 8, 1996, Serrano-Delgado\r\ncontended that he had pled guilty based on prior counsel's\r\nalleged advice that no one was ever acquitted in federal court,\r\nthat he was legally innocent of the conspiracy charged, and that\r\nthe court failed to comply with the dictates of Rule 11 when it\r\naccepted his guilty plea.  After an evidentiary hearing and the\r\npost-hearing receipt of various supporting documents, the\r\ndistrict court denied Serrano-Delgado's motion on February 14,\r\n1997.\r\n  Before sentencing, both Serrano-Delgado and his\r\ncounsel filed a second set of motions to withdraw the plea,\r\narguing, among other things, that Serrano-Delgado's former\r\ncounsel advised him that in exchange for his guilty plea the\r\ngovernment would guarantee that Puerto Rico authorities would\r\nnot pursue charges against him.  After another hearing, the\r\ncourt once again denied the relief requested.\r\n  Serrano-Delgado was sentenced to 264 months\r\nimprisonment in accordance with the terms of his Federal Rule of\r\nCriminal Procedure 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement.\r\n                             II     Serrano-Delgado focuses his arguments on appeal on the\r\ndistrict court's denial of his withdrawal motions.  For a\r\ndiscussion of the standard by which a district court decides\r\nsuch a motion and the standard by which this court reviews the\r\ndistrict court's decision, see Solano-Moreta, No. 98-1091.\r\n  Serrano-Delgado's attempt to demonstrate that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying his motions is\r\nunavailing.  The district court found after a thorough\r\nconsideration of Serrano-Delgado's contentions that the timing\r\nof his motion weighed against him, that the evidence of his\r\nimprisonment and hospitalization during some of the relevant\r\ntime period was \"not sufficient to make a successful claim of\r\ninnocence regarding his role in the charged conspiracy,\" that his\r\nplea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent despite his low\r\nlevel of formal education and evidence of learning disabilities\r\nand psychological problems, and that he was properly advised of\r\nthe elements of the conspiracy charge to which he pled guilty. \r\nThe court also found that defendant was not misled into\r\nbelieving that the plea agreement prevented his prosecution in\r\nthe Puerto Rico courts.\r\n  The district court's refusal to permit the withdrawal\r\nof the plea here was well within its discretion.  Giving the\r\ndeference due to the district court's findings, see Solano-\r\nMoreta, No. 98-1091, we agree that Serrano-Delgado's delay in\r\nfiling his motion does not indicate a \"swift change of heart,\"\r\nUnited States v. Tilley, 964 F.2d 66, 72 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted), and that he has not\r\ndemonstrated defects in the Rule 11 proceeding or a\r\nmisunderstanding of the terms of the plea agreement, see United\r\nStates v. Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1996)\r\n(noting that the defendant carries the burden of persuasion), \r\ncert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 711 (1997).  We further agree that,\r\nalthough Serrano-Delgado has come forward with some evidence\r\nthat suggests that he was not actively involved in the acts\r\nundertaken by the conspiracy during certain (but not all)\r\nrelevant periods, the suggestion that this amounts to legal\r\ninnocence is not powerful enough to outweigh the factors that\r\ncut against him.\r\n  We also conclude that Serrano-Delgado has not shown\r\nthat the district court, which had presided over the trial of\r\neight co-defendants, erred in accepting at sentencing the plea\r\nagreement's stipulation that his admitted participation in the\r\nconspiracy made him responsible for at least 150 kilograms of\r\ncocaine.  See generally United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124\r\nF.3d 342, 354 (1st Cir. 1997); Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d at 25.\r\n  Finally, although Serrano-Delgado claims that he was\r\nineffectively assisted by counsel during one of his plea\r\nwithdrawal hearings, we decline to address this claim on direct\r\nappeal.  The claim, involving the attorney who represented\r\nSerrano-Delgado through the district court's entry of final\r\njudgment, was never presented to the district court and the\r\nrecord is insufficiently developed to warrant review at this\r\njuncture.  See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st\r\nCir. 1993) (\"[T]he trial judge, by reason of his familiarity\r\nwith the case, is usually in the best position to assess both\r\nthe quality of the legal representation afforded to the\r\ndefendant in the district court and the impact of any shortfall\r\nin that representation.\").  Although on occasion we have\r\nreviewed an ineffective assistance claim without the benefit of\r\nthe district court's views, this case does not fall into any\r\nexception to our normal rule.  See id.  Accordingly, this claim\r\n(along with any other claims of ineffective assistance) may, if\r\nSerrano-Delgado chooses, be presented on collateral review under\r\n28 U.S.C.  2255.  See United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d\r\n771, 776 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Ordinarily, a collateral proceeding\r\n. . . is the proper forum for fact-bound ineffective assistance\r\nclaims.\").\r\n  We have considered all of defendant's arguments\r\nproperly presented on direct appeal and find them without merit. \r\nDefendant's conviction is affirmed without prejudice to his\r\nright to renew his ineffective assistance claims in a collateral\r\nproceeding.\n",
