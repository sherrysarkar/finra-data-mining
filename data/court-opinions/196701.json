See United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.),\r                                             \r\n\ncert.  denied, 116 S.Ct. 522 (1995); United States v.

In other words, if the aggregate\r\n\nevidence, examined in the required light, justifies a judgment of\r\n\nconviction, \"it need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial\r\n\nto a finding of innocence.\"  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467.\r                                              \r\n\n          In applying  these criteria, all  the evidence,  direct\r\n\nand  circumstantial,  must   be  viewed  from   the  government's\r\n\nperspective, and the viewer must credit all reasonable inferences\r\n\nconsistent with the  verdict.   See United States  v. Taylor,  54\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.

Phrased another way, \"the trial judge\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The appellant  fled midway through  his trial.   The  trial\r\ncontinued in his absence.

An overview of the  crime is\r\n\nset forth in United States v. Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16 (1st Cir.\r                                                     \r\n\n1995),  in which  we affirmed  the conviction  of one  of Prada's\r\n\ncodefendants.    The record  on  appeal makes  pellucid  that the\r\n\nappellant, at a bare minimum, recruited  Erasto Miranda-Rodriguez\r\n\n(Miranda) as a  courier, and determined the amount  to be paid to\r\n\nthis  somewhat reluctant dragon for  his services in the smuggle.\r\n\nAll  incoming calls from Miranda  were routed to  Prada and, when\r\n\nthe day arrived on which the cocaine was to be transported to the\r\n\nmainland, Prada personally delivered it to Miranda, urged him on,\r\n\nand accompanied him to  the airport.  This, and  other, evidence,\r\n\nif credited by the jury    as it plainly was   left no reasonable\r\n\ndoubt but that the appellant associated himself with the  overall\r\n\nventure, participated in it  as an enterprise he wished  to bring\r\n\nto  fruition, and endeavored by  his actions to  make it succeed.\r\n\nNo  more is  exigible  to sustain  a  conviction for  aiding  and\r\n\nabetting.  See Nye &amp;  Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S.  613, 619\r                                                       \r\n\n(1949); see also 18 U.S.C.   2.\r                          \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n          The  appellant  also  challenges  the  district court's\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncalculation  of  the  guideline  sentencing range  (GSR)  in  two\r\n\nrespects.  Both sorties are unavailing.\r\n\n          1.   The appellant claims  that he was  not a principal\r\n\nparticipant  in the  offense of  conviction, and  that  the lower\r\n\ncourt erred in designating him as a \"manager\" or \"supervisor\" and\r\n\nincreasing   his  offense   level  accordingly.     See  U.S.S.G.\r                                                                 \r\n\n 3B1.1(c).  We discern no error.\r\n\n          Absent  a mistake of  law   and  we see none  here   we\r\n\nreview  a   district  court's   factual  findings   concerning  a\r\n\ndefendant's  role in  the offense  for clear  error.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Akitoye,  923 F.2d  221, 227  (1st Cir.  1991); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Ocasio, 914  F.2d 330, 333  (1st Cir. 1990).   Although\r                          \r\n\nthis  is  not an  insurmountable  barrier, it  is  nevertheless a\r\n\ndaunting one.  Debates over a defendant's role in the offense are\r\n\nfact-based  and, therefore, \"will almost always be won or lost in\r\n\nthe district court.\"   United States v. Graciani, 61  F.3d 70, 75\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1995).   There is  no  justification for  a different\r\n\nresult here.\r\n\n          We  will not  belabor the obvious.   See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.  Ruiz-Garcia,  886  F.2d  474,  477  (1st  Cir.  1989)\r                                 \r\n\n(warning, in a sentencing appeal, that an appellate  court should\r\n\nnot \"wast[e]  overtaxed judicial resources razing  castles in the\r\n\nair\").    In determining  whether  the  government satisfied  its\r\n\nburden of proving the appellant's liability for a two level role-\r\n\nin-the-offense adjustment, the sentencing court was not obligated\r\n\nto  accept   the  appellant's  self-interested   account  of  his\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ninvolvement as a mere  courier.  See United States  v. Paz-Uribe,\r                                                                          \r\n\n891 F.2d 396, 399  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 951 (1990).\r                                                     \r\n\nThe record  strongly suggests that,  in this case,  the appellant\r\n\nwas  Miranda's  immediate  supervisor:     he  persuaded  him  to\r\n\nundertake the  journey, authorized his  compensation, brought him\r\n\nthe contraband, urged him  to go forward, accompanied him  to the\r\n\nairport, and, presumably    based on the appellant's  own (nearly\r\n\nidentical) itinerary and tickets    planned personally to oversee\r\n\nthe contraband's  safe arrival.2  These  facts adequately support\r\n\nthe district court's  assessment of the  appellant's role in  the\r\n\noffense.  See, e.g.,  Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 227; United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDiaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 48-49 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 493\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 862 (1989).\r\n\n          2.  The appellant also  assails the district court  for\r\n\nrefusing  to  grant  a  downward  adjustment  for  acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility.  See U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.  This is merely  sound and\r                              \r\n\nfury, signifying  little.   The appellant steadfastly  denied his\r\n\nguilt,  fled in  mid-trial  when matters  did  not go  well,  and\r\n\ncontinued  to minimize his involvement  in the affair  up to (and\r\n\nincluding)  the time of sentencing.  Thus, the district court had\r\n\na  plausible basis  for  concluding that  the  appellant had  not\r\n\nforthrightly accepted responsibility.\r\n\n          We  need go  no further.    As we  wrote on  an earlier\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The appellant and Miranda were both scheduled to take Delta\r\nFlight No. 189 from  Carolina, Puerto Rico, to  Atlanta, Georgia.\r\nTheir  tickets  had been  purchased  simultaneously  at the  same\r\ntravel agency.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\noccasion, \"[t]he guidelines do not require a sentencing judge  to\r\n\nplay  the ostrich,  burying his  head in  the sand,  struthiously\r\n\naccepting every allocution at face value, and ignoring  the stark\r\n\nreality of events.\"  United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 30 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1990).  The discount for acceptance of responsibility is not\r\n\nautomatic;  achieving  it   \"necessitates  candor  and  authentic\r\n\nremorse     not  merely  a  pat  recital  of  the  vocabulary  of\r\n\ncontrition.\"    Id.    The  district  court's  finding  that  the\r                             \r\n\nappellant did not meet  this standard easily survives clear-error\r\n\nreview.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir.

The district court imposed a lengthy incarcerative sentence.   Prada appeals.   We summarily affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* A criminal defendant who essays a claim of evidentiary insufficiency must scramble across rocky terrain.   As long as the proof presented, taken in the light most amiable to the verdict, suffices to allow a rational jury to find each essential element of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, the claim fails.  See United States v. Olbres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196204\"><a href=\"/opinion/196204/united-states-v-olbres/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In other words, if the aggregate evidence, examined in the required light, justifies a judgment of conviction, \"it need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial to a finding of innocence.\"  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying these criteria, all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, must be viewed from the government's perspective, and the viewer must credit all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict.  See United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 974 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

Phrased another way, \"the trial judge must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and credibility questions in the prosecution's favor;  and, moreover, as among competing inferences, two or more of which are plausible, the judge must choose the inference that best fits the prosecution's theory of guilt.\"  Olbres, 61 F.3d at 970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's insufficiency claim cannot pass muster under these straightforward rules.

The record on appeal makes pellucid that the appellant, at a bare minimum, recruited Erasto Miranda-Rodriguez (Miranda) as a courier, and determined the amount to be paid to this somewhat reluctant dragon for his services in the smuggle.   All incoming calls from Miranda were routed to Prada and, when the day arrived on which the cocaine was to be transported to the mainland, Prada personally delivered it to Miranda, urged him on, and accompanied him to the airport.   This, and other, evidence, if credited by the jury as it plainly was left no reasonable doubt but that the appellant associated himself with the overall venture, participated in it as an enterprise he wished to bring to fruition, and endeavored by his actions to make it succeed.   No more is exigible to sustain a conviction for aiding and abetting.  See Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104655\"><a href=\"/opinion/104655/nye-nissen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span>, 619 (1949);  see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also challenges the district court's calculation of the guideline sentencing range (GSR) in two respects.
