Having been convicted  by a\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\r\n\njury  of  carjacking  and   kidnapping,  Jaime  Calderon  was\r\n\nsentenced  to 30  years of  imprisonment, and  five years  of\r\n\nsupervised  release  thereafter.    He  now   challenges  the\r\n\nverdict,  saying  that  certain  evidence  should  have  been\r\n\nsuppressed and  he should  have been given  a hearing  on the\r\n\nmotion  to suppress,  that  the  superseding  indictment  was\r\n\ninvalid, that there was insufficient evidence to convict, and\r\n\nthat  the   jury's  conviction  of  him  on  two  counts  was\r\n\nimpermissibly inconsistent with  its acquittal of him  on two\r\n\nother  counts.   There  being  more  than  ample evidence  to\r\n\nconvict  and  none   of  the  asserted  errors   having  been\r\n\ncommitted, we affirm.   Indeed, this is  a case in which  the\r\n\npolice  search was  backed by  more than  the usual,  and the\r\n\ncareful  efforts  by  the  police  to  have  both   belt  and\r\n\nsuspenders  to support  the search  marks  more, rather  than\r\n\nless,  concern  for adherence  to the  procedural protections\r\n\nafforded defendants.\r\n\nThe Crime\r                     \r\n\n          On  the evidence, the jury was entitled to find the\r\n\nfollowing.  On August 31, 1994, Calderon heard that two young\r\n\nmen  were  selling  stereo  speakers  out of  a  van  in  his\r\n\nneighborhood  in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Emboldened by access\r\n\nto newly  stolen guns, Calderon  decided to take the  van and\r\n\nthe speakers.   Calderon, age 33, recruited  three teenagers,\r\n\nincluding  his nephew  Jose  Hernandez,  to  help  him.  When\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nHernandez  originally balked,  his uncle  excoriated him  and\r\n\ncalled him a \"chicken.\"  The other two recruits, Angel Rivera\r\n\nand Julio Sanchez,  approached the two young  stereo salesmen\r\n\nand asked  if they  would take them  in the  van to  a nearby\r\n\nplace  where  they  could  make  a  purchase  outside of  the\r\n\npresence of police  officers who might  be looking for  them.\r\n\nOnce  inside the  van,  Rivera  and Sanchez  used  a gun  and\r\n\nchokeholds to force the two salesmen  to the back of the van,\r\n\nwhere  they were  made to  lie,  face down.   The  carjackers\r\n\nstruck one on the head  with a gun, causing profuse bleeding,\r\n\nand told the  two men that if  they ever went to  the police,\r\n\nthey would be hunted down at their homes and killed.  \r\n\n          Rivera and Sanchez  picked up Calderon in  the van,\r\n\nat his  apartment,  where  he  assumed the  role  of  driver.\r\n\nHernandez joined the  group as the van left the neighborhood.\r\n\nBecause the salesmen were face down, they  could not identify\r\n\nCalderon,  but  were  aware  of  his  presence  in  the  van.\r\n\nCalderon, who was in  charge, gave instructions that  \"if the\r\n\nkids get smart or something, . . . smack them around a little\r\n\njust  to   calm  them   down.\"    The   van  was   driven  to\r\n\nMassachusetts.   In Lowell, Calderon, a heroin addict, bought\r\n\nheroin and  unloaded some  of the speakers.   The  two \"kids\"\r\n\nwere  held with  their faces  down for  three hours  and then\r\n\ndumped into a wooded ditch in Billerica after one of them was\r\n\nkicked in the head.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Calderon's  defense at  trial  was  that he  simply\r\n\naccepted a ride to Lowell, where he knew he could buy heroin,\r\n\nand had no part in the carjacking or kidnapping.  A search of\r\n\nthe apartment  of Calderon's girlfriend,  however, turned  up\r\n\nboth the stolen speakers and Calderon.\r\n\n          In  the  interim,  a  disquieted  Hernandez  turned\r\n\nhimself in to the Nashua police and voluntarily cooperated.\r\n\nThe Search\r                      \r\n\n          Based on information from  a confidential informant\r\n\nthat  at least  one pair  of the  stolen speakers was  at the\r\n\napartment  of  Carmen  Delgado,  Calderon's  girlfriend,  the\r\n\npolice went to Delgado's apartment at 11 p.m. on September 6,\r\n\n1994.  At that time the police had an outstanding warrant for\r\n\nCalderon's arrest for a failure  to appear on a motor vehicle\r\n\nviolation and Calderon  was a prime suspect in the kidnapping\r\n\nand carjacking.    The officers  had reason  to believe  that\r\n\nCalderon was living at the address.\r\n\n          The police  knocked and, when  Delgado answered the\r\n\ndoor, they asked  for permission to search.   An officer also\r\n\nread  from  a consent  form.    Delgado  gave consent.    The\r\n\nofficers then asked  her to sign the consent  form, which she\r\n\ndid.   Two of  the stolen speakers  were in plain  sight.  In\r\n\naddition, there was a man in the living room.  The man gave a\r\n\nname, not the name \"Jaime Calderon,\" and four different dates\r\n\nof birth.  An officer stepped outside to look at a photograph\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nof Calderon, realized the man  was Calderon, and went back in\r\n\nand arrested him.  Not knowing who or what was in the rest of\r\n\nthe apartment, the police searched the remainder.  They found\r\n\ntwo other speakers, of the  type stolen, in a bedroom closet.\r\n\nA few hours later, the officers  obtained a warrant to make a\r\n\ndetailed  search of the  apartment for weapons  and speakers.\r\n\nDelgado gave the police inconsistent versions of her story to\r\n\nthe   effect  that  the   speakers  came  to   her  apartment\r\n\ninnocently.\r\n\nMotion to Suppress\r                              \r\n\n          Calderon argues  that the district  court erred  in\r\n\ndenying  his   motion  to   suppress   evidence  without   an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing and that on  the merits the motion should\r\n\nhave  been granted.    The decision  to  hold an  evidentiary\r\n\nhearing is committed  to the discretion of the district court\r\n\nand our review  is for abuse of that discretion.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1332 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                           \r\n\n          Evidentiary  hearings  on motions  to  suppress are\r\n\nrequired  only where a  defendant makes a  sufficient showing\r\n\nthat the  evidence seized  was the  product of  a warrantless\r\n\nsearch that does not fall within any exception to the warrant\r\n\nrequirement.  Id.   The burden is on the defendant  to allege\r                             \r\n\nfacts,  \"sufficiently   definite,  specific,   detailed,  and\r\n\nnonconjectural,  to enable  the  court  to  conclude  that  a\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nsubstantial claim  is presented.\"   Id.  (internal quotations\r                                                   \r\n\nomitted).   \r\n\n          Calderon argues that the motion to  suppress should\r\n\nhave been  granted because Delgado  gave no valid  consent to\r\n\nthe search, and that it was  error for the district court not\r\n\nto take  evidence and  grant the motion.   Leaving  aside the\r\n\nquestion of whether Delgado's consent was necessary under the\r\n\ncircumstances,1 we analyze  the issue as Calderon  has framed\r\n\nit.   Calderon posits  that because Delgado  primarily speaks\r\n\nSpanish,  she could  not have  understood  what the  English-\r\n\nspeaking police were saying in their late night, disorienting\r\n\nappearance at  her apartment.   But this is a  supposition to\r\n\nwhich Calderon gave  no flesh when he had  the opportunity on\r\n\nthe  motion to  suppress.   Calderon  filed no  affidavits in\r\n\nsupport of the motion, not  even from Delgado, on whose state\r\n\nof  mind  he  now  so  heavily relies.2    In  contrast,  the\r\n\nprosecution, in opposing  the motion, provided copies  of the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  For example, the police believed Calderon to be living\r\nwith Delgado and had an arrest warrant for Calderon. \r\n\"Generally, the police do not need a search warrant to enter\r\na suspect's home when they have an arrest warrant for the\r\nsuspect.\"  United States v. Lauter, 57 F.3d 212, 214 (2d Cir.\r                                              \r\n1995); see also Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 603 (1980). \r                                              \r\n\n2.  On appeal, Calderon asserts for the first time that the\r\npolice officers had already crossed the threshold of the\r\napartment when they asked Delgado for her consent, and that\r\nthis was an additional factor showing coercion.  The\r\nargument, not having been made before the district court, is\r\nwaived.  See United States v. Carvell, 74 F.3d 8,  , No. 95-\r                                                 \r\n1606, slip op. at 15 (1st Cir.

Delgado gave\r\n\nthe police varying versions of how the speakers came to be in\r\n\nthe  apartment.   There was  no indication  that she  did not\r\n\ncomprehend the explanation of the consent form or voluntarily\r\n\nexecute  it -- indeed, all indications  were to the contrary.\r\n\nCalderon presented no evidence at all that Delgado's will was\r\n\n\"'overborne'\" or  that she  suffered a  \"'critically impaired\r\n\ncapacity  for   self-determination.'\"     United  States   v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nWilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.)

See 18\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.   1201.  Subsequently,  the missing phrase was  added,\r\n\nand that superseding indictment was presented to a grand jury\r\n\non  October 26,  1994,  which  returned it.    And that  fact\r\n\ndisposes of Calderon's claim.  Cf. United States v.

He now challenges the verdict, saying that certain evidence should have been suppressed and he should have been given a hearing on the motion to suppress, that the superseding indictment was invalid, that there was insufficient evidence to convict, and that the jury's conviction of him on two counts was impermissibly inconsistent with its acquittal of him on two other counts.   There being more than ample evidence to convict and none of the asserted errors having been committed, we affirm.   Indeed, this is a case in which the police search was backed by more than the usual, and the careful efforts by the police to have both belt and suspenders to support the search marks more, rather than less, concern for adherence to the procedural protections afforded defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Crime</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evidence, the jury was entitled to find the following.   On August 31, 1994, Calderon heard that two young men were selling stereo speakers out of a van in his neighborhood in Nashua, New Hampshire.   Emboldened by access to newly stolen guns, Calderon decided to take the van and the speakers.   Calderon, age 33, recruited three teenagers, including his nephew Jose Hernandez, to help him.   When Hernandez originally balked, his uncle excoriated him and called him a \"chicken.\"   The other two recruits, Angel Rivera and Julio Sanchez, approached the two young stereo salesmen and asked if they would take them in the van to a nearby place where they could make a purchase outside of the presence of police officers who might be looking for them.   Once inside the van, Rivera and Sanchez used a gun and chokeholds to force the two salesmen to the back of the van, where they were made to lie, face down.   The carjackers struck one on the head with a gun, causing profuse bleeding, and told the two men that if they ever went to the police, they would be hunted down at their homes and killed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera and Sanchez picked up Calderon in the van, at his apartment, where he assumed the role of driver.   Hernandez joined the group as the van left the neighborhood.   Because the salesmen were face down, they could not identify Calderon, but were aware of his presence in the van.   Calderon, who was in charge, gave instructions that \"if the kids get smart or something, ... smack them around a little just to calm them down.\"   The van was driven to Massachusetts.   In Lowell, Calderon, a heroin addict, bought heroin and unloaded some of the speakers.   The two \"kids\" were held with their faces down for three hours and then dumped into a wooded ditch in Billerica after one of them was kicked in the head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calderon's defense at trial was that he simply accepted a ride to Lowell, where he knew he could buy heroin, and had no part in the carjacking or kidnapping.   A search of the apartment of Calderon's girlfriend, however, turned up both the stolen speakers and Calderon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interim, a disquieted Hernandez turned himself in to the Nashua police and voluntarily cooperated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Search</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on information from a confidential informant that at least one pair of the stolen speakers was at the apartment of Carmen Delgado, Calderon's girlfriend, the police went to Delgado's apartment at 11 p.m. on September 6, 1994.   At that time the police had an outstanding warrant for Calderon's arrest for a failure to appear on a motor vehicle violation and Calderon was a prime suspect in the kidnapping and carjacking.   The officers had reason to believe that Calderon was living at the address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police knocked and, when Delgado answered the door, they asked for permission to search.   An officer also read from a consent form.   Delgado gave consent.   The officers then asked her to sign the consent form, which she did.   Two of the stolen speakers were in plain sight.   In addition, there was a man in the living room.   The man gave a name, not the name \"Jaime Calderon,\" and four different dates of birth.   An officer stepped outside to look at a photograph of Calderon, realized the man was Calderon, and went back in and arrested him.   Not knowing who or what was in the rest of the apartment, the police searched the remainder.   They found two other speakers, of the type stolen, in a bedroom closet.   A few hours later, the officers obtained a warrant to make a detailed search of the apartment for weapons and speakers.   Delgado gave the police inconsistent versions of her story to the effect that the speakers came to her apartment innocently.Motion to Suppress</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calderon argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence without an evidentiary hearing and that on the merits the motion should have been granted.   The decision to hold an evidentiary hearing is committed to the discretion of the district court and our review is for abuse of that discretion.   See United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1332 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidentiary hearings on motions to suppress are required only where a defendant makes a sufficient showing that the evidence seized was the product of a warrantless search that does not fall within any exception to the warrant requirement.  Id.  The burden is on the defendant to allege facts, \"sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural, to enable the court to conclude that a substantial claim is presented.\"  Id. (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calderon argues that the motion to suppress should have been granted because Delgado gave no valid consent to the search, and that it was error for the district court not to take evidence and grant the motion.   Leaving aside the question of whether Delgado's consent was necessary under the circumstances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we analyze the issue as Calderon has framed it.   Calderon posits that because Delgado primarily speaks Spanish, she could not have understood what the English-speaking police were saying in their late night, disorienting appearance at her apartment.   But this is a supposition to which Calderon gave no flesh when he had the opportunity on the motion to suppress.   Calderon filed no affidavits in support of the motion, not even from Delgado, on whose state of mind he now so heavily relies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In contrast, the prosecution, in opposing the motion, provided copies of the police reports which told a different story.   Delgado gave the police varying versions of how the speakers came to be in the apartment.   There was no indication that she did not comprehend the explanation of the consent form or voluntarily execute it--indeed, all indications were to the contrary.   Calderon presented no evidence at all that Delgado's will was \" 'overborne' \" or that she suffered a \" 'critically impaired capacity for self-determination.' \"  United States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.)  (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 225, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2046-47, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1211, 111 S.Ct. 2813, 115 L.Ed.2d 985 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court explained its denial of Calderon's motion to suppress without an evidentiary hearing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Defendant vaguely claims that Ms. Delgado's consent was coerced or was otherwise ineffective, but he offers no affidavit or statement from Ms. Delgado to that effect, describes no circumstances supporting his assertion, and makes no offer of proof relative to any other facts that might support his assertion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no basis to disturb the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Constructive Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calderon's second argument is that there was a \"constructive amendment\" to his indictment, in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.  \"The [F]ifth [A]mendment requires that a defendant be tried only on a charge made by the grand jury,\" and the Sixth Amendment \"requires that the defendant be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.\"  United States v. Kelly, 722 F.2d 873, 876 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1070, 104 S.Ct. 1425, 79 L.Ed.2d 749 (1984).   When Calderon was first indicted on September 14, 1994, the kidnapping charge omitted the phrase \"for ransom or reward or otherwise,\" a necessary element of the offense. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1201.   Subsequently, the missing phrase was added, and that superseding indictment was presented to a grand jury on October 26, 1994, which returned it.   And that fact disposes of Calderon's claim.   Cf. United States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d 30, 35 (1st Cir.1985) (constructive amendment occurs where \"the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed on them \" (emphasis added;  internal quotations omitted)).   A defendant cannot complain of an improper constructive amendment if the indictment is actually amended by resubmission to the grand jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Cf. United States v. Angiulo, 847 F.2d 956, 964 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 852, 109 S.Ct. 138, 102 L.Ed.2d 110 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calderon argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to have found him guilty, and so the district court erred in not granting his motion for acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.  \"In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim we look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.\"  United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59, 61-62 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of Calderon's challenge is that the jury should not have believed the version of the story, contrary to his, recounted by two of his accomplices and a confidential informant whose son was in prison.   The argument fails.   It was well within the jury's province for it to choose to believe the testimony of Calderon's accomplices--in the face of his cross-examination of their characters and motives--and to disbelieve Calderon's version of the story.   See id.  \"Credibility determinations are uniquely within the jury's province, and we defer to the jury's verdict if the evidence can support varying inferences.\"  Id.

In criminal law \"the Supreme Court has made it clear that verdict inconsistency in itself is not a sufficient basis for vacating a conviction.\"  United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 41 (1st Cir.1991) (citing United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984), and Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">This Court explained in Lopez:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Verdict inconsistency does not indicate that the government necessarily failed to prove an essential element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt....

It is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on [one] offense, and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the [other] offense.   As long as the trial and appellate courts are convinced on independent review that there was sufficient evidence to sustain a rational verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant is properly protected against any risk of injustice resulting from jury irrationality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.

An officer stepped outside to look at a photograph of Calderon, realized the man was Calderon, and went back in and arrested him.   Not knowing who or what was in the rest of the apartment, the police searched the remainder.   They found two other speakers, of the type stolen, in a bedroom closet.   A few hours later, the officers obtained a warrant to make a detailed search of the apartment for weapons and speakers.   Delgado gave the police inconsistent versions of her story to the effect that the speakers came to her apartment innocently.Motion to Suppress</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calderon argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence without an evidentiary hearing and that on the merits the motion should have been granted.   The decision to hold an evidentiary hearing is committed to the discretion of the district court and our review is for abuse of that discretion.   See United States v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195723\"><a href=\"/opinion/195723/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span>, 1332 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidentiary hearings on motions to suppress are required only where a defendant makes a sufficient showing that the evidence seized was the product of a warrantless search that does not fall within any exception to the warrant requirement.  Id.  The burden is on the defendant to allege facts, \"sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural, to enable the court to conclude that a substantial claim is presented.\"  Id. (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calderon argues that the motion to suppress should have been granted because Delgado gave no valid consent to the search, and that it was error for the district court not to take evidence and grant the motion.   Leaving aside the question of whether Delgado's consent was necessary under the circumstances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we analyze the issue as Calderon has framed it.   Calderon posits that because Delgado primarily speaks Spanish, she could not have understood what the English-speaking police were saying in their late night, disorienting appearance at her apartment.   But this is a supposition to which Calderon gave no flesh when he had the opportunity on the motion to suppress.   Calderon filed no affidavits in support of the motion, not even from Delgado, on whose state of mind he now so heavily relies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In contrast, the prosecution, in opposing the motion, provided copies of the police reports which told a different story.   Delgado gave the police varying versions of how the speakers came to be in the apartment.   There was no indication that she did not comprehend the explanation of the consent form or voluntarily execute it--indeed, all indications were to the contrary.   Calderon presented no evidence at all that Delgado's will was \" 'overborne' \" or that she suffered a \" 'critically impaired capacity for self-determination.' \"  United States v.

When Calderon was first indicted on September 14, 1994, the kidnapping charge omitted the phrase \"for ransom or reward or otherwise,\" a necessary element of the offense. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1201.   Subsequently, the missing phrase was added, and that superseding indictment was presented to a grand jury on October 26, 1994, which returned it.   And that fact disposes of Calderon's claim.   Cf. United States v.

The argument fails.   It was well within the jury's province for it to choose to believe the testimony of Calderon's accomplices--in the face of his cross-examination of their characters and motives--and to disbelieve Calderon's version of the story.   See id.  \"Credibility determinations are uniquely within the jury's province, and we defer to the jury's verdict if the evidence can support varying inferences.\"  Id.
