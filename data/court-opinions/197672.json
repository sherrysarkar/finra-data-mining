Defendant-appellant Glenn  P. LaCedra\r                      Per Curiam.\r                                \r\n\nappeals  his jury convictions for possession of an unlawfully\r\n\nmade  destructive  device  under  26  U.S.C.     5861(c)  and\r\n\npossession of a  destructive device not registered  to him in\r\n\nthe  National  Firearms  Registration  and  Transfer   Record\r\n\npursuant  to the  requirements of  26 U.S.C.    5861(d).   He\r\n\ncontends  that   the  statutory  obligations  to   apply  for\r\n\npermission to make, and to register, a pipe bomb constitute a\r\n\nviolation  of  his Fifth  Amendment  privilege  against self-\r\n\nincrimination.    LaCedra  also  appeals  from his  sentence,\r\n\narguing that the district court clearly erred in finding that\r\n\nhe created  a substantial  risk  of death  or serious  bodily\r\n\ninjury  to  another  and  attempted  to  commit  first-degree\r\n\nmurder.  We affirm.\r\n\n           Beginning  with  the  sentencing   issues,  it  is\r\n\napparent  to us that  the district  court committed  no clear\r\n\nerror.    The  court  adopted  the  findings  of  defendant's\r\n\nPresentence  Report (PSR),1 which were based on evidence that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  PSR  determined defendant's  preadjustments  offense\r\nlevel through two separate routes.  It first applied U.S.S.G.\r\n   2K1.4,  covering  arson  and property  damage  by  use  of\r\nexplosives, to recommend  a base offense level of  24 under  \r\n2K1.4(a)(1)(A)  on  a  finding   that  defendant  \"knowingly\"\r\ncreated a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\r\nBased on  the premise that  defendant had intended  to commit\r\nmurder,   the  PSR  applied  U.S.S.G.     2K1.4(c)  to  cross\r\nreference   2K1.4(a)(1)(A)  with U.S.S.G.    2A2.1(a)(1), the\r\nattempted  murder guideline,  thereby increasing  defendant's\r\nbase offense level to 28.  \r\n          The PSR  also alternatively  calculated defendant's\r\noffense level under  U.S.S.G.   2K2.1, covering  the unlawful\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nshowed, among  other things,  that after  the victim  spurned\r\n\ndefendant's persistent advances,  LaCedra placed a pipe  bomb\r\n\nunder her  car  near the  gas tank.   To  create an  ignition\r\n\ndevice, he wrapped  the bomb's fuse several  times around the\r\n\nvehicle's exhaust pipe,  a \"source of significant  heat\" when\r\n\nthe  car  was running.    Further, the  evidence  showed that\r\n\ndefendant was familiar with bombmaking and that, in fact, the\r\n\npositioning of  the bomb under the victim's car was seemingly\r\n\ndesigned  to  cause  the gas  tank  to  explode, raising  the\r\n\npotential  for additional damage.   This and  other evidence,\r\n\nincluding  a detailed diagram that defendant drew showing the\r\n\nplacement  of a  pipe bomb under  the victim's  car, provided\r\n\nample basis for the court to determine, by a preponderance of\r\n\nthe  evidence, that  defendant had  attempted  to murder  the\r\n\nvictim  and  that  the  object  of  the  offense  would  have\r\n\nconstituted  first-degree  murder.   Defendant's  contentions\r\n\nthat  he intended only to scare  the victim and that the bomb\r\n\nmay well have never exploded even had it not been noticed and\r\n\nremoved do not undermine the  court's conclusion.  We end our\r\n\nanalysis  here because our resolution of the attempted murder\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\npossession  of firearms,  to arrive  at a  base level  of 18,\r\nwhich it then augmented six levels pursuant to    2K2.1(b)(3)\r\nand (b)(5), and  similarly cross-referenced under    2A2.1 to\r\narrive at the same offense level of 28.  \r\n          The  PSR concluded  with a recommendation  that the\r\nbase offense  level of 28  be enhanced two levels  because of\r\ndefendant's  attempt to obstruct justice during his trial, an\r\nenhancement  not  contested  by defendant.    See  U.S.S.G.  \r                                                             \r\n3C1.1. \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nissue also disposes  of defendant's argument that he  did not\r\n\nknowingly  create  a  substantial risk  of  death  or serious\r\n\nbodilyinjuryto anotherforpurposes ofU.S.S.G.  2K1.4(a)(1)(A).\r\n\n          Proceeding to defendant's constitutional issues, we\r\n\nsummarily note that  26 U.S.C.    5861(c) and  5861(d) do not\r\n\nviolate  the  Fifth   Amendment.    The  Supreme   Court  has\r\n\nexplicitly held that   5861(d) satisfies the Fifth Amendment.\r\n\nSee United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 605-07 (1971).  The\r                                      \r\n\nreasoning in Freed  can be applied  also to    5861(c).   The\r                              \r\n\nNational  Firearms  Act  places no  obligation  on  a firearm\r\n\npossessor, qua possessor, to seek to register a firearm.  If,\r                          \r\n\nas the evidence  indicates, defendant made  the pipe bomb  at\r\n\nissue, then he  was required to submit an  application to the\r\n\nBureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms  before making  the\r\n\nbomb.  Applying  to make the device  is a legal act,  and had\r\n\ndefendant done so, his Fifth Amendment rights  would not have\r\n\nbeen  implicated for the  simple reason that  his application\r\n\nwould have been denied.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n",
