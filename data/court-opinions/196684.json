Robert Williams, who is  incarcerated\r                                \r\r\n\nin  the  High  Security  prison  at  the  Adult  Correctional\r\n\nInstitution  in  Rhode  Island,  appeals  from  the  district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of his  suit against state prison officials\r\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.    1983.   We affirm,  substantially for  the\r\n\nreasons given in the magistrate judge's report dated July 27,\r\n\n1995,  which the district court adopted as its decision.1  We\r                                                                    1\r\n\nadd only the following comments.\r\n\n          1.  The disciplinary  board imposed a 30-day period\r\n\nof punitive segregation on Williams.  Thus, Sandin v. Conner,\r                                                                        \r\n\n115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995), is controlling, as the district court\r\n\nrecognized,   and  dismissal  of  Williams'  claim  that  his\r\n\ndisciplinary hearing  was conducted  in violation of  his due\r\n\nprocess  rights   was  correct.2     Although   Williams  was\r                                           2\r\n\nsubsequently  reclassified  and  so  apparently   endured  an\r\n\nadditional period of segregation, he has not asserted any due\r\n\nprocess error in the classification proceeding which resulted\r\n\nin  that separate period of  segregation.  In  the absence of\r\n\nany  allegation of constitutional error in the classification\r\n\nproceeding, the district court  had no obligation to consider\r\n\nwhether   Williams'   subsequent  segregation   implicated  a\r\n\nconstitutional liberty interest.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1We  hereby grant  defendants' motion to  summarily affirm\r               1\r\nthe judgment  below and deny  Williams' motion to  proceed in\r\nforma pauperis on appeal. \r\n\n   2Consequently, the  district court did not  err in denying\r               2\r\nWilliams' discovery  requests, all of  which sought  material\r\nrelevant to his due process claims.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          2.    Contrary to  Williams'  claim,  the testimony\r\n\nbefore  the  magistrate  judge  on conditions  at  the  Adult\r\n\nCorrectional Institution included  testimony on conditions at\r\n\nthe High Security facility.  \r\n\n          We  affirm  the  judgment  of  the  district  court\r                                                                         \r\n\ndismissing appellant's federal claims.
