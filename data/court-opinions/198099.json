Eugene W. Beaulieu, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nWayne P. Doane, with whom Cuddy &amp; Lanham and Joyce\r\nMykleby were on brief for appellant, cross-appellee.\r\nDaniel L. LaCasse for appellee, cross-appellant.\r\n\nAugust 18, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam. Roland Chambers sued his employer, the City\r\nof Calais, Maine, following his demotion and the eventual\r\ntermination of his employment.  A jury found for Chambers on claims\r\nof age discrimination under the federal Age Discrimination in\r\nEmployment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.A.  621-634 (West Supp. 1998) and\r\nthe Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, \r\n4551-4633 (West 1997), but against Chambers on his claims of\r\ndisability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act\r\n(ADA), 42 U.S.C.A.  12111-12117 (West Supp. 1998).\r\nChambers appeals the magistrate judge's determination on\r\nequitable remedies, challenging the judge's decision not to award\r\nfront pay, to offset an award of back pay with Chambers' income\r\nfrom collateral sources, and not to award certain incidental\r\nexpenses.  The City appeals from the judge's denial of its renewed\r\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that the evidence \r\nwas insufficient for the jury to have found liability on Chambers'\r\nage discrimination claim.  We affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\nWe recite the facts as the jury could have found them, in\r\nthe light most favorable to its verdict.  See Wildman v. Lerner\r\nStores Corp., 771 F.2d 605, 607 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\nRoland Chambers began working for the City in 1980, when\r\nhe was thirty-four years old.  Chambers worked most of his career\r\nat the City's highway department.  He was made foreman of the\r\nhighway crew in 1990.  Because of lower back pain, Chambers\r\nconsulted a physician in 1993, who advised him against certain\r\nphysical activities.  Chambers gave a copy of this report to his\r\nemployer.\r\nIn May 1994, the City hired a new city manager, Mark\r\nRyckman, who was twenty-four years old at the time, fresh from a\r\ngraduate program.  Ryckman undertook a restructuring of the\r\ndepartment, a restructuring that eliminated Chambers' position of\r\nhighway crew foreman.  In October 1994, Ryckman called Chambers\r\ninto a meeting and informed him that his position was being\r\neliminated.  Chambers was offered his earlier position of\r\ndriver/operator, which was at a significantly lower wage, and was\r\nnot offered any other position with the City.  Chambers chose to\r\naccept the demotion rather than resign.  Chambers was forty-eight\r\nyears of age at the time, within the ADEA-protected age group.\r\nAt the meeting, Chambers also learned that Mark Magoon,\r\nage thirty-six, would be named the new public works director,\r\nreplacing Maurice Bernard, age fifty-nine.  Bernard was demoted and\r\nafter a few years left the employ of the City.  Magoon held the job\r\nof cemetery foreman, a supervisory position which was comparable in\r\npay and responsibilities to Chambers' previous position as foreman\r\nof the highway crew.  Chambers expressed interest in the cemetery\r\nforeman's position, but he was told that it was not available.\r\nChambers also learned at the meeting that Magoon had\r\nnamed Robert Seelye, age thirty-five, to be the new cemetery\r\nforeman.  Magoon testified, \"I felt [Seelye] could work with the\r\nyounger kids and such as myself [sic] when I worked with the\r\nyounger crew at the cemetery.  I just felt he could work with [the\r\nyounger crew] better.\"\r\nChambers complained at the meeting that the cemetery\r\nforeman position had not been posted in accordance with the City's\r\nusual policy, and also expressed opposition to Ryckman's decision\r\nto name Magoon as Public Works Director, noting Magoon's lack of\r\nexperience.  At trial, City Manager Ryckman admitted that the\r\ncemetery foreman position had not been posted as open and that this\r\nwas in violation of the City's personnel guidelines.  Chambers\r\nfiled an internal grievance.  Ryckman told Chambers that Ryckman\r\ndid not feel he had to justify the restructuring to him.  Following\r\nthis incident, Chambers was assigned menial tasks such as sweeping\r\nsidewalks and shoveling snow out of sewer basins.\r\nIn November 1994, approximately one month after his\r\ndemotion, Chambers filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights\r\nCommission, alleging that the demotion was because of his age. \r\nChambers noted in his complaint that the only two City employees\r\nwho had been demoted during the restructuring, himself and Barnard,\r\nwere the oldest workers in the Department, and that younger\r\nworkers, Magoon and Seelye, had been promoted as part of the\r\nrestructuring.  Both Ryckman and Magoon knew of Chambers' age\r\ndiscrimination complaint.\r\nIn April 1995, Magoon ordered Chambers to do \"cold-\r\npatching,\" a method of repairing pot holes that requires shoveling\r\ncold asphalt by hand.  Chambers said that he was physically unable\r\nto perform this task because of his back trouble, and presented a\r\ndoctor's note to that effect.  Magoon suspended Chambers without\r\npay for two weeks.  Chambers filed an internal grievance, alleging\r\nthat his suspension was in retaliation for his age discrimination\r\ncomplaint.\r\nIn August 1995, Chambers was again assigned hard physical\r\nlabor for a three-week period, cleaning leaves and debris from\r\nsewer and storm basins.  Chambers was physically unable to perform\r\nthis work without severe pain.  Chambers nevertheless attempted to\r\nperform the assigned tasks, and, as a result, rendered himself\r\nunable to come to work near the end of the period.  When he\r\nreturned, Chambers confronted Magoon and demanded to be put on\r\n\"light duty\" assignments.  Chambers was again suspended without pay\r\nfor two weeks.  After briefly returning to work, Chambers was\r\nfired.\r\nChambers filed this suit against his employer, alleging\r\nthat the City had violated his due process rights and had\r\ndiscriminated against him on account of age and disability.  The\r\ndistrict court dismissed the due process claim; the claims for age\r\nand disability discrimination went to the jury.  The jury found\r\nthat the City was liable for age discrimination, but not for\r\ndisability discrimination, and awarded compensatory damages of\r\n$180,000.\r\n                            II.\r\nWe review de novo the denial of the City's renewed motion\r\nfor judgment as a matter of law, \"which means that we use the same\r\nstringent decisional standards that control the district court.\" \r\nHendricks &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Daewoo Corp., 923 F.2d 209, 214 (1st\r\nCir. 1991).  Thus, we will reverse the jury verdict \"only if the\r\nevidence, viewed from the perspective most favorable to the\r\nnonmovant, is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to\r\njudgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\" \r\nGibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(citation omitted).\r\nAlthough the evidence is close, a reasonable jury could\r\nhave found that the City's actions violated Chambers' rights under\r\nthe ADEA and its state counterpart, the MHRA.  Chambers bore the\r\nburden of establishing that age was a motivating factor in the\r\nCity's actions; the City is liable if that impermissible factor was\r\nthe decisive one, in the sense that it would not have taken the\r\nadverse action but for its discriminatory motive.  See Loeb v.\r\nTextron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1019 (1st Cir. 1979) (ADEA); Wells v.\r\nFranklin Broad. Corp., 403 A.2d 771, 773 (Me. 1979) (Maine law).\r\nMagoon's comments were evidence that age was a\r\n\"motivating factor\" in the City's decision to demote him.  In light\r\nof all the evidence, the comments also were evidence that, if\r\nChambers had been younger, he would have received a supervisory\r\nposition following the restructuring, such as Magoon and Seelye had\r\nreceived.  Of course, \"[w]ords of praise for youth . . . do not, by\r\nthemselves, indicate a bias against more mature workers,\" Mesnickv. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991), and \"stray\r\ncomments are insufficient to meet the plaintiff's burden in an ADEA\r\ncase,\" Thomas v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 144 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).  However, there was additional circumstantial evidence in\r\nthis case of bias, including failure to follow established\r\npersonnel policies of posting open positions, and the fact that the\r\nCity demoted the two oldest employees in the Department while\r\npromoting two much younger ones.  See Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys.\r\nCorp., 1998 WL 387405, at *6 (1st Cir. July 16, 1998).  Moreover,\r\nthe jury could reasonably have determined that the City's actions\r\nfollowing Chambers' filing a complaint with the Maine Human Rights\r\nCommission, including the hard labor assignments in the face of a\r\ndoctor's note that Chambers should not do the work assigned, the\r\nresulting suspensions, and ultimately Chambers' termination, were\r\nat least in part in retaliation for Chambers' complaint.\r\nThe jury was not asked to answer the questions of age\r\ndiscrimination and of retaliation separately, so neither do we. \r\nAfter a thorough review of the whole record, we find that there was\r\nsufficient evidence for the jury to have held the City liable for\r\nviolating the ADEA and the MHRA.\r\n                            III.\r\nBefore turning to Chambers' appeal, we observe that the\r\njury's award of compensatory damages of $180,000 was based on an\r\nerror, but an error to which the City did not object at trial and\r\nwhich is not a basis for its appeal.  While the ADA authorizes\r\nemotional distress damages, the ADEA does not similarly authorize\r\nsuch damages.  See Vazquez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 579 F.2d\r\n107, 112 (1st Cir. 1978); see also Commissioner v. Schleier, 515\r\nU.S. 323, 326 &amp; n.2 (1995) (noting unanimous agreement in the\r\ncourts of appeals that \"ADEA does not permit a separate recovery of\r\ncompensatory damages for pain and suffering or emotional\r\ndistress\").  Instead, the ADEA permits only equitable relief in the\r\nform of lost wages, including back pay, front pay and certain other\r\nmonetary loss, relief that is a matter for the judge to calculate. \r\nThe error resulted from a verdict form, to which the City agreed,\r\nthat permitted the jury to award compensatory damages if it found\r\nliability on either claim.  The verdict form should have indicated\r\nthat the jury was to award compensatory damages only if it found\r\nliability on the ADA claim.\r\n   The defendant, however, did not at any time object to the\r\nverdict form.  Nor did the defendant argue to the district court\r\nthat the ADEA does not authorize such damages in its motion for a\r\nnew trial or a remittur of damages.  Instead, it argued only that\r\nthe damages were excessive.  Issues that are not raised in the\r\ndistrict court are waived on appeal; we will reach the issue in a\r\ncivil case only if it is \"so compelling as virtually to insure\r\nappellant's success, and a gross miscarriage of justice would\r\nresult from [the] failure to address it.\"  Credit Francais Int'l,\r\nSA v. Bio-Vita, Ltd., 78 F.3d 698, 709 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations\r\nand internal quotation marks omitted)(emphasis supplied).\r\n   \"In this context, 'miscarriage of justice' means more\r\nthan the individualized harm that occurs whenever the failure\r\nseasonably to raise a claim or defense alters the outcome of a\r\ncase.  Rather, courts ordinarily will relax the raise-or-waive\r\nprinciple on this basis only if a failure to do so threatens the\r\nfrustration of some broadly important right.\"  National Assoc. of\r\nSocial Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 628 n.5 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n(citation omitted).  This high standard is rarely met when a party\r\nattempts to raise an issue for the first time on appeal. \r\nSee Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1196 (1st Cir.\r\n1995) (noting that \"the exceptions are few and far between\").  We\r\nare even more reluctant to save the City from its waiver when it\r\nhas not raised the issue on appeal.  See Whyte v. Connecticut Mut.\r\nLife Ins. Co., 818 F.2d 1005, 1011 n.20 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"It cannot\r\nbe disputed that the standard that must be met for this court to\r\nraise an issue on appeal is at least as high as the standard for a\r\nparty seeking to raise an issue for the first time on appeal.\") \r\nPermitting the jury award to stand will not result in a \"gross\r\nmiscarriage of justice\" under the circumstances.\r\n   Chambers sought total equitable relief in the amount of\r\n$354,391.62.  Chambers' request included (1) back pay of\r\n$35,022.19, which he requested should be doubled as liquidated\r\ndamages under the ADEA, (2) front pay of $213,154.05, (3) travel\r\ncosts of $21,735.00, (4) lost sick time of $2,661.60, (5) lost\r\nvacation time of $1,744.40 and (6) civil penal damages under the\r\nMHRA of $10,000, the maximum under Maine law.\r\n   The magistrate judge denied Chambers' request for front\r\npay, and also denied Chambers' requests for travel costs, lost sick\r\ntime and lost vacation time.  The judge awarded only $6,022.00 as\r\nback pay, after deducting from the award the wages that Chambers\r\nwas able to earn at his new employment, and then doubled this\r\namount, as requested, as liquidated damages.  The judge also\r\nawarded civil penal damages under Maine law, but awarded only\r\n$1,000, not the maximum $10,000 that Chambers had requested,\r\narriving at a total equitable remedy of $13,044.00\r\n   We review the district court's calculation of equitable\r\nrelief for abuse of discretion, and find none.  See Lussier v.\r\nRunyon, 50 F.3d 1103, 1111 (1st Cir. 1995).  Front pay and the\r\nother incidental expenses which the district court denied are\r\ndiscretionary, see Wildman, 771 F.2d at 616, and the district\r\ncourt's decision to deduct Chambers' wages from his new position\r\nfrom its back pay award, although not mandated by the ADEA, is\r\npermitted as part of the district court's endeavor to fashion an\r\naward that places the injured party \"as near as may be, in the\r\nsituation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been\r\ncommitted.\"  Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418-19\r\n(1975) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The\r\nmagistrate judge noted, in denying these items, that the jury's\r\n$180,000 award, plus the $13,044 in equitable relief, had made the\r\nplaintiff whole.  It was appropriate for the magistrate judge to\r\nconsider the jury award in deciding whether to award certain items\r\nof discretionary equitable relief.  Considering the relief as a\r\nwhole, it was not error for the magistrate judge to have awarded\r\nonly $13,044 in equitable relief.\r\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Each\r\nparty shall bear its own costs.\n",

Chambers bore the\r\nburden of establishing that age was a motivating factor in the\r\nCity's actions; the City is liable if that impermissible factor was\r\nthe decisive one, in the sense that it would not have taken the\r\nadverse action but for its discriminatory motive.

However, there was additional circumstantial evidence in\r\nthis case of bias, including failure to follow established\r\npersonnel policies of posting open positions, and the fact that the\r\nCity demoted the two oldest employees in the Department while\r\npromoting two much younger ones.  See Brennan v.

July 16, 1998).  Moreover,\r\nthe jury could reasonably have determined that the City's actions\r\nfollowing Chambers' filing a complaint with the Maine Human Rights\r\nCommission, including the hard labor assignments in the face of a\r\ndoctor's note that Chambers should not do the work assigned, the\r\nresulting suspensions, and ultimately Chambers' termination, were\r\nat least in part in retaliation for Chambers' complaint.\r\nThe jury was not asked to answer the questions of age\r\ndiscrimination and of retaliation separately, so neither do we. \r\nAfter a thorough review of the whole record, we find that there was\r\nsufficient evidence for the jury to have held the City liable for\r\nviolating the ADEA and the MHRA.\r\n                            III.\r\nBefore turning to Chambers' appeal, we observe that the\r\njury's award of compensatory damages of $180,000 was based on an\r\nerror, but an error to which the City did not object at trial and\r\nwhich is not a basis for its appeal.  While the ADA authorizes\r\nemotional distress damages, the ADEA does not similarly authorize\r\nsuch damages.  See Vazquez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"357899\"><a href=\"/opinion/357899/17-fair-emplpraccas-1116-17-empl-prac-dec-p-8394-miguel-vazquez-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112 (1st Cir. 1978); see also Commissioner v.

Instead, the ADEA permits only equitable relief in the\r\nform of lost wages, including back pay, front pay and certain other\r\nmonetary loss, relief that is a matter for the judge to calculate. \r\nThe error resulted from a verdict form, to which the City agreed,\r\nthat permitted the jury to award compensatory damages if it found\r\nliability on either claim.  The verdict form should have indicated\r\nthat the jury was to award compensatory damages only if it found\r\nliability on the ADA claim.\r\n   The defendant, however, did not at any time object to the\r\nverdict form.  Nor did the defendant argue to the district court\r\nthat the ADEA does not authorize such damages in its motion for a\r\nnew trial or a remittur of damages.  Instead, it argued only that\r\nthe damages were excessive.  Issues that are not raised in the\r\ndistrict court are waived on appeal; we will reach the issue in a\r\ncivil case only if it is \"so compelling as virtually to insure\r\nappellant's success, and a gross miscarriage of justice would\r\nresult from [the] failure to address it.\"  Credit Francais Int'l,\r\nSA v.

Chambers' request included (1) back pay of\r\n$35,022.19, which he requested should be doubled as liquidated\r\ndamages under the ADEA, (2) front pay of $213,154.05, (3) travel\r\ncosts of $21,735.00, (4) lost sick time of $2,661.60, (5) lost\r\nvacation time of $1,744.40 and (6) civil penal damages under the\r\nMHRA of $10,000, the maximum under Maine law.\r\n   The magistrate judge denied Chambers' request for front\r\npay, and also denied Chambers' requests for travel costs, lost sick\r\ntime and lost vacation time.  The judge awarded only $6,022.00 as\r\nback pay, after deducting from the award the wages that Chambers\r\nwas able to earn at his new employment, and then doubled this\r\namount, as requested, as liquidated damages.  The judge also\r\nawarded civil penal damages under Maine law, but awarded only\r\n$1,000, not the maximum $10,000 that Chambers had requested,\r\narriving at a total equitable remedy of $13,044.00\r\n   We review the district court's calculation of equitable\r\nrelief for abuse of discretion, and find none.

Front pay and the\r\nother incidental expenses which the district court denied are\r\ndiscretionary, see Wildman, 771 F.2d at 616, and the district\r\ncourt's decision to deduct Chambers' wages from his new position\r\nfrom its back pay award, although not mandated by the ADEA, is\r\npermitted as part of the district court's endeavor to fashion an\r\naward that places the injured party \"as near as may be, in the\r\nsituation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been\r\ncommitted.\"  Albemarle Paper Co. v.

The\r\nmagistrate judge noted, in denying these items, that the jury's\r\n$180,000 award, plus the $13,044 in equitable relief, had made the\r\nplaintiff whole.  It was appropriate for the magistrate judge to\r\nconsider the jury award in deciding whether to award certain items\r\nof discretionary equitable relief.  Considering the relief as a\r\nwhole, it was not error for the magistrate judge to have awarded\r\nonly $13,044 in equitable relief.\r\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
