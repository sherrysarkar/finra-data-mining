Appellant Jose Bonilla-Romero appeals\r                                 \r\n\nfrom  the district court's  denial of his  motion to withdraw\r\n\nhis guilty plea  to one count of aiding and  abetting his co-\r\n\ndefendants  in  knowingly,   intentionally,  and   unlawfully\r\n\npossessing  with intent  to distribute  cocaine and  from the\r\n\ncourt's  denial   of  his   request  for  an   acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility reduction at sentencing.  We affirm. \r\n\n          We conclude  that the district court  did not abuse\r\n\nits discretion in denying  the motion to withdraw the  guilty\r\n\nplea.  See United States v.

Bonilla has  not disputed that  he agreed  to\r\n\nplead guilty in  a written  plea agreement and  that he  pled\r\n\nguilty under oath at a plea hearing which complied fully with\r\n\nthe requirements of  Fed. R. Crim. P.  11.  His  assertion of\r\n\ninnocence,  made  seven  weeks  after his  guilty  plea,  was\r\n\nclearly belated.  The testimony of one co-defendant suggested\r\n\na  possible defense,  but  was directly  contradicted by  the\r\n\ntestimony  of a  different  co-defendant,  whom the  district\r\n\ncourt obviously  credited.

Wicker, 80\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 263, 268  (8th Cir.  1996) (the district  court did  not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in denying a motion to withdraw a guilty\r\n\nplea where the court had assessed the defendant's credibility\r\n\nnegatively);  United States v. Caban,  962 F.2d 646, 650 (7th\r                                                \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nCir. 1992) (\"Because  credibility determinations are left  to\r\n\nthe  sound discretion of  the trial court,  it seems unlikely\r\n\nthat the  district court  abused its discretion  by rejecting\r\n\nCaban's  motion to withdraw his  plea which was  based upon a\r\n\nversion of events that the court did not find credible.\").\r\n\n          Since  Bonilla  protested  his  innocence  even  at\r\n\nsentencing, the district  court did not  err in declining  to\r\n\ngrant   him  the   requested  acceptance   of  responsibility\r\n\nreduction.
