PEREZ-ALVARADO,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n    KENNETH S. APFEL, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY,\r\n                  Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n     [Hon. Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Juan F. Matos Bonet and Matos Bonet &amp; Matos De Juan on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam Mendoza-Torro,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Wayne G. Lewis, Assistant\r\nRegional Counsel, Social Security Administration, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJune 23, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Claimant Julio Perez Alvarado appeals a\r\ndistrict court judgment that upheld the denial of his \r\napplication for Social Security disability benefits.  Alleging\r\nthat he suffers from bronchial asthma and back, left leg, and\r\nchest pain, claimant maintains that he has been continuously\r\ndisabled since he fractured his left thigh bone in a 1976\r\nautomobile accident.  \r\n   After thoroughly reviewing the record and the\r\nparties' briefs on appeal, we conclude that the ALJ's decision\r\nis supported by substantial evidence and uninfected by error of\r\nlaw.  Contrary to claimant's contention on appeal, the ALJ was\r\nnot required to credit the vocational expert's testimony that\r\nclaimant could not work if he could not lift at all.  Dr.\r\nBonilla's report did not say that claimant was wholly unable to\r\nlift.  To the contrary, the relatively benign findings recorded\r\nin this report and the other medical evidence supported the\r\nALJ's conclusion that claimant retained the capacity to perform\r\nat least the sedentary jobs that the vocational expert\r\ndescribed.    Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\r\naffirmed.\r\n",
