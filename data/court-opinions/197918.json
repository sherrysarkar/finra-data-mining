The lawsuit that undergirds this\r\nappeal pits a fledgling law school, built on a foundation of\r\nunconventional premises, against the legal establishment.  The\r\ngargantuan record, capable of inducing tapephobia in even the\r\nhardiest appellate panel, is forbidding, but sheer bulk rarely is\r\nan accurate proxy for complexity.  Having scaled the mountain of\r\npapers and obtained a clear view of the legal landscape, we\r\nconclude that the lower court correctly apprehended both the issues\r\nand the answers.  Consequently, we uphold the several rulings that\r\nthe appellant so vigorously contests.\r\nI.  THE PROTAGONISTS\r\n     In late 1995, Massachusetts School of Law (MSL) sued the\r\nAmerican Bar Association (the ABA), the American Association of Law\r\nSchools (the AALS), New England School of Law (NESL), and fourteen\r\nindividual defendants.  The facts that inform MSL's wide-ranging\r\nallegations are too diffuse to shed much light at this juncture, so\r\nwe leave them shuttered until they can illuminate the specific\r\nissues raised by this appeal.  We deem it helpful, however, to\r\ndescribe at the outset the institutions and individuals involved in\r\nthe litigation.\r\n     We begin with MSL, a non-profit institution that opened\r\nits doors in 1988.  The school's self-proclaimed mission is to\r\nprovide high-quality, affordable legal education to capable persons\r\nwho traditionally have been shut out of the legal profession,\r\nincluding members of disadvantaged demographic populations and\r\npersons turning to the law in search of a second career.  To this\r\nend, MSL does not require applicants to take the Law School\r\nAptitude Test (LSAT) because it considers the test biased. \r\nMoreover, MSL's curriculum features a higher-than-usual percentage\r\nof adjunct instructors and a concentrated focus on professional\r\nskills courses.  MSL is not a fully accredited law school, but in\r\n1990, the Massachusetts Board of Regents authorized the school to\r\naward the J.D. degree and thereby enabled MSL graduates to sit for\r\nthe Massachusetts bar.\r\n     The ABA is the largest national organization of the legal\r\nprofession.  It has a membership of more than 380,000, composed\r\nprincipally of practicing lawyers (including lawyers in government\r\nand corporate America), judges, court administrators, and legal\r\neducators.  Though the ABA does not have the power to discipline\r\nlawyers, it promulgates model rules, develops guidelines, and\r\nstrives to function as the national voice of the legal profession. \r\nIn that capacity, it long has served as the chief accreditor of law\r\nschools.\r\n     The AALS is a non-profit association of 160 law schools. \r\nIts stated objective is \"the improvement of the legal profession\r\nthrough legal education.\"  It serves as a trade organization for\r\nlaw professors and, with reference to legal education, acts as the\r\nacademy's principal representative to the federal government and to\r\nnational higher education organizations.  The AALS is separate from\r\nthe ABA, but the two informally interlock in various ways.  Many\r\nindividuals are active in both organizations and many AALS members\r\nparticipate in the ABA accreditation process.\r\n     The fourteen individual defendants divide into two\r\ngroups.  One group (the Eight Individual Defendants) comprises the\r\nseven members of the ABA's Accreditation Committee (the Committee)\r\nplus the immediate past chair of the ABA's Section of Legal\r\nEducation and Admissions to the Bar (the Section).  The other group\r\n(the Six Individual Defendants) comprises the five members of the\r\nABA team that visited MSL during its unsuccessful effort to obtain\r\naccreditation, plus a consultant who advised the ABA during that\r\nprocess.  All fourteen individual defendants are active\r\nparticipants in accreditation-related matters.\r\n     NESL is an ABA-accredited law school located in Boston,\r\nMassachusetts.  MSL regards itself as a competitor of NESL   and\r\none which, if accredited, would be all the more formidable.\r\nII.  THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS\r\n     For more than 70 years, the ABA has promulgated the\r\nstandards for law school accreditation (the Standards).  It is\r\nwidely believed among legal educators and regulatory organizations\r\nthat compliance with the Standards enhances the quality of legal\r\neducation.  MSL disputes this conventional wisdom but, since 1952,\r\nthe United States Department of Education (the DOE) has recognized\r\nthe ABA as a \"reliable authority\" anent the quality of legal\r\neducation and has designated it as the relevant accrediting body. \r\n20 U.S.C.  1099b(a).  As a result of this recognition, ABA-\r\naccredited schools are eligible to participate in federal  student\r\nloan programs.  See 20 U.S.C.  1141(a)(5).  Accredited\r\ninstitutions also receive various state-based benefits, not the\r\nleast of which is that all fifty states, the District of Columbia,\r\nand the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico deem graduation from an ABA-\r\naccredited institution sufficient to satisfy the legal education\r\nrequirement for admission to the bar.\r\n     The accreditation process works something like this.  A\r\nlaw school may apply for ABA accreditation after three years of\r\noperation.  Its application must include a self-study, delineating\r\nits perception of its present and projected compliance with the\r\nStandards and explaining any deviations from them.  The Committee\r\nreviews each application and appoints a site-visit team  to conduct\r\ninterviews and inspect the applicant's physical plant.  This team\r\nreports its findings to the Committee.  If the Committee determines\r\nthat the school is in compliance with the Standards, the\r\naccreditation process moves forward.  If a school is found not to\r\nbe in compliance with the Standards, the Committee nonetheless may\r\nrecommend provisional accreditation if it receives satisfactory\r\nassurances that the applicant will achieve compliance within three\r\nyears.  See Standard 104(a).\r\n     In the absence of compliance (actual or anticipated),\r\nthere is another potential route to accreditation:  the applicant\r\nmay request a variance from the Standards, and the body that\r\noversees the accreditation process, the Council of the Section (the\r\nCouncil), may choose to grant it as a matter of discretion. \r\nStandard 802 governs the variance procedure.  Because this Standard\r\nis central to MSL's accreditation effort, we reprint it in full:\r\n     A law school proposing to offer a program of\r\n     legal education contrary to the terms of the\r\n     Standards may apply to the Council for a\r\n     variance.  The variance may be granted if the\r\n     Council finds that the proposal is consistent\r\n     with the general purpose of the Standards. \r\n     The Council may impose such conditions or\r\n     qualifications as it deems appropriate.\r\n\nIII.  MSL'S ACCREDITATION EFFORT\r\n     MSL applied for ABA accreditation in 1992.  From the\r\noutset, MSL recognized that its practices were discordant with the\r\nStandards, yet remained steadfast in its deliberately contrarian\r\nmission.  At no time did MSL argue present compliance with the\r\nStandards or promise future compliance.  Instead, it confessed in\r\nits self-study that \"[t]o the considerable extent MSL's goals and\r\nmethods are innovative, sometimes they deliberately run counter to\r\nconventional ABA criteria of accreditation.\"  Not surprisingly, MSL\r\ninvoked Standard 802 by letter dated January 27, 1993, and\r\nrequested \"a waiver of each and every Standard that . . . might bar\r\naccreditation\" on the ground that, despite its admitted lack of\r\nconformity, \"MSL provides a high quality legal education that meets\r\nthe underlying objectives of the accreditation process.\"\r\n     An ABA team visited MSL's campus in April 1993.  The next\r\nmonth, the site-visit team recommended that the Committee deny\r\naccreditation because MSL was in default of myriad Standards.  The\r\nCommittee accepted the recommendation and rejected the application. \r\nMSL successively appealed to the Council and to the ABA's House of\r\nDelegates, both of which upheld the denial of accreditation.\r\nIV.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n     Although the instant litigation has all the hurly-burly\r\nof a major engagement, it is in point of fact a rear-guard action. \r\nIn November 1993, MSL brought an antitrust suit against the ABA,\r\nthe AALS, and twenty-one individual defendants (including twelve of\r\nthe fourteen persons sued here) in the United States District Court\r\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The Third Circuit\r\nsubsequently characterized MSL's complaint as alleging that the\r\nnamed defendants conspired \"to enforce the ABA's anticompetitive\r\naccreditation standards [and thus violated the Sherman Act] by: \r\n(1) fixing the price of faculty salaries; (2) requiring reduced\r\nteaching hours and non-teaching duties; (3) requiring paid\r\nsabbaticals; (4) forcing the hiring of more professors in order to\r\nlower student/faculty ratios; (5) limiting the use of adjunct\r\nprofessors; (6) prohibiting the use of required or for-credit bar\r\nreview courses; (7) forcing schools to limit the number of hours\r\nstudents could work; (8) prohibiting ABA-accredited schools from\r\naccepting credit transfers from unaccredited schools and from\r\nenrolling graduates of unaccredited schools in graduate programs;\r\n(9) requiring more expensive and elaborate physical and library\r\nfacilities; and (10) requiring schools to use the LSAT.\" \r\nMassachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. American Bar Ass'n,\r\n107 F.3d 1026, 1031-32 (3d Cir.) (MSL I), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct.\r\n264 (1997).  Between 1994 and 1996, the district court published no\r\nfewer than nine opinions.  At the end of the line, the district\r\ncourt entered summary judgment in favor of all remaining defendants\r\n(including the ABA and the AALS), and the Third Circuit affirmed. \r\nSee id. \r\n     With the antitrust case still extant,  MSL sought to try\r\nits luck in the Massachusetts state courts.  Its suit named the\r\nABA, the AALS, twelve of the same individuals whom it had sued in\r\nMSL I, and three virgin defendants (NESL and two additional\r\nCommittee members, Moeser and Yu).  MSL's complaint asserts claims\r\nfor violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A and for tortious\r\nmisrepresentation against all the defendants, as well as claims for\r\nfraud, deceit, civil conspiracy, and breach of contract against the\r\nAALS, the ABA, and the fourteen named individuals.  The strand that\r\nsews together this tapestry of charges is MSL's accusation that the\r\nABA and the AALS for many years have banded together to monopolize\r\nlegal education with a goal of increasing their institutional power\r\nand boosting the salaries of law professors and administrators. \r\nMSL asserts that its educational philosophy poses a threat to the\r\nABA/AALS cabal and that the two organizations therefore conspired\r\nto deny MSL accreditation, despite the fact that MSL's educational\r\nofferings are exemplary.\r\n     Invoking 20 U.S.C.  1099b(f), discussed infra Part V,\r\nthe defendants removed the case to the United States District Court\r\nfor the District of Massachusetts.  The district court denied MSL's\r\ntimely motion to remand.  After a full year's worth of pretrial\r\nskirmishing, the court methodically dismembered MSL's complaint,\r\ndefendant by defendant, during a four month period in 1997:  on\r\nJanuary 10, it granted NESL's motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6); on February 13, it granted the Eight Individual\r\nDefendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction; on\r\nMarch 3, it granted the AALS's motion for summary judgment; and on\r\nMay 8, it granted summary judgment in favor of the ABA and the Six\r\nIndividual Defendants.  MSL appeals from each of these rulings.\r\n     We first address two threshold jurisdictional issues: \r\nthe refusal to remand and the court's holding that it lacked\r\njurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants.  From that point\r\nforward, we proceed on a defendant-by-defendant basis.\r\nV.  THE MOTION TO REMAND\r\n     The court below denied MSL's motion to remand, ruling\r\nthat the suit arose under federal law.  See 28 U.S.C.  1331\r\n(1994); see also Viqueira v. First Bank,     F.3d    ,     (1st\r\nCir. 1998) [No. 97-2127, slip. op. at 8-13] (discussing federal\r\nquestion jurisdiction).  Judge Lasker premised this holding on 20\r\nU.S.C.  1099b(f), which provides in pertinent part:\r\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law,\r\n     any civil action brought by an institution of\r\n     higher education seeking accreditation from,\r\n     or accredited by, an accrediting agency or\r\n     association approved by the Secretary . . .\r\n     and involving the denial, withdrawal, or\r\n     termination of accreditation of the\r\n     institution of higher education, shall be\r\n     brought in the appropriate United States\r\n     district court.\r\n\nWe review the denial of a motion to remand de novo and place the\r\nburden of persuasion upon the party who insists that federal\r\njurisdiction obtains.  See BIW Deceived v. Local S6, 132 F.3d 824,\r\n831 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n     We appear to be the first appellate court to address this\r\nseldom-used removal statute.  The statutory language is\r\nstraightforward and the provision's meaning clear:  if a civil\r\naction brought by an institution of higher education involves a\r\ndenial of accreditation, then federal jurisdiction exists.  MSL, by\r\nself-characterization, is an institution of higher education, and\r\nthe ABA's withholding of accreditation is the cynosure of its suit. \r\nThus, to the extent that MSL alleges harms within the accreditation\r\nprocess   and such allegations permeate its complaint   section\r\n1099b(f) applies.\r\n     The only colorable issue that MSL raises with regard to\r\nremand implicates the constitutionality of section 1099b(f).  This,\r\ntoo, is a question of first impression.  For a case properly to\r\n\"aris[e] under\" federal law, 28 U.S.C.  1331, Congress must confer\r\nfederal jurisdiction in the context of a broad statutory framework\r\nwithin an area susceptible to congressional regulation.  In other\r\nwords, the jurisdictional grant must be \"simply one part of [a]\r\ncomprehensive scheme.\"  Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,\r\n461 U.S. 480, 496 (1983).  MSL contends that section 1099b(f) fails\r\nthis test and that Article III does not permit Congress to confer\r\nfederal jurisdiction by means of such a freewheeling jurisdictional\r\nstatute.  See, e.g., The Propellor Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 53\r\nU.S. (12 How.) 443, 452 (1851); Mossman v. Higginson, 4 U.S. (4\r\nDall.) 12, 13 (1800) (per curiam).\r\n     The focus of our inquiry thus becomes whether section\r\n1099b(f)'s grant of jurisdiction occurs within a sufficiently\r\ncomprehensive regulatory scheme.  We answer this question\r\naffirmatively.  Accreditation serves an important national function\r\nbecause once an institution of higher education becomes accredited\r\nby the DOE or its designated accrediting agency, the institution\r\nbecomes eligible for federal student loan monies.  See Chicago Sch.\r\nof Automatic Transmissions, Inc. v. Accreditation Alliance of\r\nCareer Schs. &amp; Colleges, 44 F.3d 447, 449 (7th Cir. 1994).  The\r\nHigher Education Act and the DOE's implementing regulations spin a\r\nsophisticated regulatory web that governs the relationship between\r\naccrediting agencies and accreditation applicants.  See, e.g., 34\r\nC.F.R.  602.24, 602.28 (1996) (requiring that accrediting agencies\r\napply consistent standards and give applicants due process).  The\r\ngrant of federal jurisdiction over matters involving accreditation\r\nis reasonably related to the efficient operation of that system. \r\nNo more is exigible.\r\n     To summarize, section 1099b(f)'s grant of federal\r\njurisdiction occurs within a broad statutory framework, properly\r\nthe subject of congressional concern.  Accordingly, the statute\r\ncomports with Article III.  Removal was altogether appropriate.\r\nVI.  THE EIGHT INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS\r\n     When the district court applies the prima facie standard\r\nand grants a motion to dismiss for want of in personam jurisdiction\r\nwithout conducting an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed\r\njurisdictional facts, the court of appeals reviews its ruling de\r\nnovo.  See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d\r\n138, 147 (1st Cir. 1995).  The lower court's decision to dismiss\r\nMSL's action as to the Committee members   defendants Hasl, Moeser,\r\nRyan, Schneider, Sowle, Walwer, and Yu   falls within this sphere. \r\nSo does the order dismissing the action against the last of the\r\nEight Individual Defendants, Henry Ramsey, Jr. (the chair of the\r\nSection).  Withal, Ramsey's situation requires a more extended\r\nanalysis.\r\n     The factual basis for MSL's jurisdictional initiative\r\nderives predominantly from three events that occurred in 1993. \r\nAccording to the complaint, Hasl, Moeser, Schneider, and Ramsey met\r\nin Boston on February 6.  The quartet allegedly \"used false\r\nstatements and charges\"   the nature of which is not disclosed   in\r\norder \"to try to bring their plan of non-accreditation of MSL to\r\nfruition.\"  A review of the parties' proffers reveals, however,\r\nthat the only MSL-related business transacted at this meeting\r\ninvolved a decision to delay the site visit by one month.  MSL next\r\nalludes to a Committee meeting that took place on June 23 in\r\nBrooklyn, New York.  The Eight Individual Defendants all attended\r\nthis session and participated in the denial of MSL's application\r\nfor accreditation.  The Eight Individual Defendants, save Ramsey,\r\nalso attended a retreat that took place on Nantucket Island, in\r\nMassachusetts, from June 24-27.  MSL asserts conclusorily that the\r\nCommittee \"finalized\" the denial of its application during this\r\nperiod, but the record flatly contradicts this assertion:  the\r\nretreat participants all maintain (to quote from typical language\r\nappearing in their several affidavits) that \"[w]hile in Nantucket,\r\nthe Committee did not take up any agenda item concerning MSL, as\r\nall matters concerning MSL had been concluded in Brooklyn, New\r\nYork, on June 23, 1993.\"  MSL proffers no clear evidence showing\r\nthat these statements are inaccurate.\r\n     On a motion to dismiss for want of in personamjurisdiction, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), the plaintiff ultimately\r\nbears the burden of persuading the court that jurisdiction exists. \r\nSee McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 189\r\n(1936); Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., 115 F.3d 81, 83 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  In conducting the requisite analysis under the prima\r\nfacie standard, we take specific facts affirmatively alleged by the\r\nplaintiff as true (whether or not disputed) and construe them in\r\nthe light most congenial to the plaintiff's jurisdictional claim. \r\nSee Ticketmaster, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 203 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nWe then add to the mix facts put forward by the defendants, to the\r\nextent that they are uncontradicted.  See, e.g., Topp v. Compair\r\nInc., 814 F.2d 830, 836-37 (1st Cir. 1987).  We caution that,\r\ndespite the liberality of this approach, the law does not require\r\nus struthiously to \"credit conclusory allegations or draw\r\nfarfetched inferences.\"  Ticketmaster-N.Y., 26 F.3d at 203.\r\n     A district court may exercise authority over a defendant\r\nby virtue of either general or specific jurisdiction.  SeeDonatelli v. National Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459,  462-63 (1st\r\nCir. 1990).  General jurisdiction \"exists when the litigation is\r\nnot directly founded on the defendant's forum-based contacts, but\r\nthe defendant has nevertheless engaged in continuous and systematic\r\nactivity, unrelated to the suit, in the forum state.\"  United\r\nElec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d\r\n1080, 1088 (1st Cir. 1992).  MSL does not argue, and we find no\r\nfacts to suggest, that any of the Eight Individual Defendants can\r\nbe brought before a Massachusetts court on a general jurisdiction\r\ntheory.\r\n     In the absence of general jurisdiction, a court's power\r\ndepends upon the existence of specific jurisdiction.  Specific\r\njurisdiction exists when there is a demonstrable nexus between a\r\nplaintiff's claims and a defendant's forum-based activities, such\r\nas when the litigation itself is founded directly on those\r\nactivities.  See Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 462.  In this instance, MSL\r\nasserts specific jurisdiction under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 223A.  3\r\n(1992).  MSL cites variously to section 3(a), which extends\r\n\"personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an\r\nagent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the\r\nperson's . . . transacting any business\" in Massachusetts, and to\r\nsection 3(c), which authorizes personal jurisdiction over a non-\r\nresident who causes \"tortious injury\" by an \"act or omission in\r\nthis Commonwealth.\"\r\n     We need not pause to consider the particulars of the\r\nMassachusetts long-arm statute.  Even if that statute, correctly\r\napplied, would purport to grant jurisdiction over the Eight\r\nIndividual Defendants   a matter of state law on which we take no\r\nview   MSL still would have to demonstrate that \"the exercise of\r\njurisdiction pursuant to that statute comports with the strictures\r\nof the Constitution.\"  Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  In the personal jurisdiction context, we have characterized\r\ncompliance with the Constitution as implicating \"three distinct\r\ncomponents, namely, relatedness, purposeful availment (sometimes\r\ncalled 'minimum contacts'), and reasonableness.\"  Foster-Miller, 46\r\nF.3d at 144.  We analyze the situations of the Eight Individuals\r\nDefendants through this prism.\r\n     In order for the extension of personal jurisdiction to\r\nsurvive constitutional scrutiny, a claim must \"arise out of, or be\r\nrelated to, the defendant's in-forum activities.\"  Ticketmaster-\r\nN.Y., 26 F.3d at 206.  We have approached the relatedness inquiry\r\nwith slightly different emphases when the plaintiff asserts a\r\ncontract claim then when she asserts a tort claim:  if a contract\r\nclaim, our stereotypical inquiry tends to ask whether the\r\ndefendant's forum-based activities are \"instrumental in the\r\nformation of the contract,\" Hahn v. Vermont Law Sch., 698 F.2d 48,\r\n51 (1st Cir. 1983); if a tort claim, we customarily look to whether\r\nthe plaintiff has established \"cause in fact (i.e., the injury\r\nwould not have occurred 'but for' the defendant's forum-state\r\nactivity) and legal cause (i.e., the defendant's in-state conduct\r\ngave birth to the cause of action).\"  United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach.\r\nWorkers, 960 F.2d at 1089; see also Ticketmaster-N.Y., 26 F.3d at\r\n207 (noting that the relatedness inquiry is intended in part to\r\n\"ensure[] that the element of causation remains in the forefront of\r\nthe due process investigation\").  In respect to the Eight\r\nIndividual Defendants, MSL presents only tort claims before us,\r\nand thus our relatedness analysis thus focuses on causation.  We\r\nfind this element clearly lacking as regards the seven Committee\r\nmembers.\r\nThe only activities undertaken in Massachusetts by any of\r\nthese seven persons that possibly could relate to MSL's state-law\r\nclaims consists of the participation of three of them in the Boston\r\nmeeting and the attendance of all seven at the Nantucket retreat. \r\nMSL's insinuations notwithstanding, the particularized facts that\r\nwere before the district court show conclusively that both of these\r\nactivities were benign:  the Boston meeting dealt with MSL in a\r\npurely peripheral sense (doing no more than to delay the site visit\r\nto MSL's facility by one month), and the retreat did not deal with\r\nMSL at all.\r\nMSL also argues that two letters written to it by James\r\nWhite, an ABA consultant, are sufficient to extend personal\r\njurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants.  One of these\r\ncommuniques informed MSL of the Committee's decision not to grant\r\nMSL provisional approval; contemporaneous copies were sent by White\r\nto the seven Committee members.  The other letter informed MSL of\r\nthe Council's decision to reject its application for a variance\r\npursuant to Standard 802 and to deny its accreditation appeal. \r\nContemporaneous copies of this letter were sent to defendants Hasl,\r\nMoeser, and Ramsey.\r\nThese missives do not carry weight in the jurisdictional\r\ncalculus vis--vis the Eight Individual Defendants.  We cannot\r\nsubscribe to a transitive view of minimum contacts, which would\r\nhold that a letter from A to B that reports on C's actions confers\r\npersonal jurisdiction over C in B's home state based on those\r\nactions.  Without a more substantial nexus, the extension of such\r\njurisdiction would violate due process, for the connection between\r\nC's actions in an extra-forum jurisdiction and B's home state is\r\ntoo attenuated to satisfy the relatedness requirement.  SeeHelicoperos Nacionales de Colombia v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 417\r\n(1984).  Nor do we think that the case for the application of such\r\na novel rule is bolstered by the mere fact that A (acting, for\r\naught that appears, on his own initiative) chooses to inform C of\r\nhis communication with B by mailing her a copy of it.\r\nAlthough MSL does not assert in so many words that the\r\nCommittee's denial of accreditation at the Brooklyn meeting\r\nconstitutes conduct directed into Massachusetts sufficient to\r\nbestow personal jurisdiction, it intimates as much.  We therefore\r\naddress this possibility.  The transmission of facts or information\r\ninto Massachusetts via telephone or mail would of course constitute\r\nevidence of a jurisdictional contact directed into the forum state,\r\nsee Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 476 (1985), but\r\nwe must determine whether the Committee's decision to deny\r\naccreditation   a decision that had effects in Massachusetts  \r\nqualifies as such a contact.\r\nWe have wrestled before with this issue of whether the\r\nin-forum effects of extra-forum activities suffice to constitute\r\nminimum contacts and have found in the negative.  For example, in\r\nSawtelle v. Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381 (1st Cir. 1995), we recounted\r\nKowalski v. Doherty, Wallace, Pillsbury &amp; Murphy, 787 F.2d 7 (1st\r\nCir. 1986), and noted that in Kowalski \"we rejected the plaintiff's\r\ncontention that, because the 'effects' of the firm's negligence\r\nwere felt in New Hampshire, the law firm had caused an injury there\r\nby conduct directed at that forum.\"  Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1390. \r\nJust as the New Hampshire effects of Massachusetts negligence,\r\nwithout more, could not sustain an action in New Hampshire against\r\nthe negligent actor, see Kowalski, 787 F.2d at 11, so too the\r\nMassachusetts effects of the Eight Individual Defendants' New York\r\nactions, without more, fail to sustain an action in a Massachusetts\r\ncourt.  Accord Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1394 (holding that New\r\nHampshire effects of non-forum negligence, without more, are\r\ninsufficient to support personal jurisdiction).\r\nRamsey is in a slightly different position.  Although\r\nwhat we have just discussed pertains to him   after all, he\r\nparticipated in both the Boston and Brooklyn meetings   it is not\r\nconclusive because the record reflects that, unlike his seven\r\ncohorts, he had other contacts which might suffice to clear the\r\nrelatedness hurdle.  Ramsey wrote a memorandum to White that\r\nmemorialized a conversation between Ramsey and MSL's Dean Velvel. \r\nRamsey reported that during this conversation Velvel attempted to\r\ncouple MSL's effort to obtain waivers under Standard 802 with MSL's\r\nplan to persuade the DOE to jettison the ABA as the national\r\naccrediting agency for law schools.  The memorandum itself\r\nindicates that Ramsey sent a copy to Velvel, presumably at MSL, and\r\nthe inclusion of Velvel's Andover telephone number indicates that\r\nVelvel was in Massachusetts when he and Ramsey spoke.  Although the\r\ncontents of this memorandum hardly flatter MSL, the memorandum\r\nconstitutes some indication that Ramsey engaged in conduct that\r\nmight bear upon the relatedness inquiry.\r\nBecause of our doubts about the outcome of the\r\nrelatedness inquiry vis--vis Ramsey, we turn to the question of\r\nwhether Ramsey's contacts with Massachusetts \"represent a\r\npurposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in\r\n[Massachusetts], thereby invoking the benefits and protections of\r\n[its] laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before\r\n[the Massachusetts] court foreseeable.\"  Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 61\r\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\r\nEven though the record suggests that Ramsey participated\r\nin a telephone call with Dean Velvel concerning MSL's accreditation\r\nwhile Velvel was in Massachusetts, it is uninformative as to who\r\ninitiated the call.  In either case, we believe that this solitary\r\ntelephone conversation and the subsequent mailing of a copy of\r\nRamsey's memorandum, even when combined with Ramsey's participation\r\nin the Boston meeting, are insufficient to establish purposeful\r\navailment.  See, e.g., Aylward v. Fleet Bank, 122 F.3d 616, 618\r\n(8th Cir. 1997) (holding that three telephone calls and one letter\r\nwithin a seven month period were insufficient to support the\r\nexercise of personal jurisdiction when the alleged injury did not\r\narise directly from the contacts); U.S.S. Yachts, Inc. v. Ocean\r\nYachts, Inc., 894 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that three\r\nletters sent to Puerto Rico were insufficient to support the\r\nexercise of personal jurisdiction in that venue).  Put another way,\r\nbased on these exiguous contacts Ramsey could not reasonably have\r\nforeseen being haled into a Massachusetts court to answer\r\nallegations of a wide-ranging conspiracy.  We therefore conclude\r\nthat the extension of personal jurisdiction to him would violate\r\nhis due process rights.\r\nIn a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, MSL laments that\r\nit did not have the opportunity to engage in jurisdictional\r\ndiscovery.  The docket contains no evidence, however, that MSL ever\r\nmade a motion or other documented request for jurisdictional\r\ndiscovery in the district court.  Therefore, in accordance with\r\nfirmly settled principles, we will not entertain its plaint now. \r\nSee Sunview Condo. Ass'n v. Flexel Int'l, Ltd., 116 F.3d 962, 964-\r\n65 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nWe have said enough on this score.  Because MSL neither\r\nalleged nor proffered sufficient facts to permit the exercise of\r\njurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants, the district\r\ncourt did not err when it granted their motion to dismiss.  SeeFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).\r\nVII.  THE ABA AND THE AALS\r\nThe ABA and the AALS each present multiple grounds in\r\nsupport of the district court's grant of summary judgment.  The\r\nmost striking of these is the defense of res judicata.  In its\r\npresent iteration, this defense turns on whether the judgment\r\nentered in the previous litigation between the parties (MSL I) bars\r\nthe plaintiff from maintaining the instant action against these two\r\ninstitutional defendants. \r\nWhere, as here, both the potentially precluding suit and\r\nthe potentially precluded suit were litigated in federal courts,\r\nfederal law governs the res judicata effect of the prior judgment. \r\nSee Gonzalez v. Banco Central Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  The elements of federal res judicata are \"(1) a final\r\njudgment on the merits in an earlier suit, (2) sufficient\r\nidenticality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier\r\nand later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the\r\nparties in the two suits.\"  Id.  In this instance, the first and\r\nthird tines of the test are foregone conclusions.  Because the\r\nSupreme Court denied certiorari after the Third Circuit affirmed\r\nthe district court's entry of final judgment in MSL I, the finality\r\nof the earlier judgment cannot be gainsaid.  By like token, MSL,\r\nthe ABA, and the AALS were parties to the precursor litigation and\r\nthus satisfy the identicality requirement.  The question, then, is\r\nwhether the state-law claims that MSL now advances against the ABA\r\nand the AALS are sufficiently related to the causes of action\r\nasserted in MSL I to warrant claim preclusion.\r\nWe begin with bedrock.  To bring claim preclusion into\r\nplay, a cause of action need not be a clone of the earlier cause of\r\naction.  \"Under res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an\r\naction precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating\r\nissues that were or could have been raised in that action.\"  Allenv. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980).  We have adopted a\r\ntransactional approach to determine whether causes of action are\r\nsufficiently related to support a res judicata defense.  See Kalev. Combined Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 1161, 1166 (1st Cir. 1991).  \"Under\r\nthis approach, a cause of action is defined as a set of facts which\r\ncan be characterized as a single transaction or series of related\r\ntransactions.\"  Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Amertex Enters., Ltd.,\r\n48 F.3d 576, 583 (1st Cir. 1995).  This boils down to whether the\r\ncauses of action arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts. \r\nSee Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 755.  In mounting this inquiry, we\r\nroutinely ask \"whether the facts are related in time, space,\r\norigin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit,\r\nand whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties'\r\nexpectations.\"  Aunyx Corp. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 978 F.2d 3, 6\r\n(1st Cir. 1992) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments  24\r\n(1982)).\r\nThese principles are dispositive here.  MSL's pending\r\nclaims, though rooted in Massachusetts law, plainly arise from the\r\nsame set of operative facts as its earlier antitrust claims. \r\nAlthough MSL describes the later claims more colloquially and\r\ndresses them in different legal raiment, the conduct that\r\nunderbraces the two sets of claims is strikingly similar in time,\r\nspace, origin, and motivation.  Both suits stem from MSL's failed\r\nefforts in 1992 and 1993 to receive ABA accreditation.  In both\r\ncases, MSL alleges that the ABA and the AALS orchestrated a long-\r\nterm scheme to accumulate power and money and a short-term scheme\r\nto deny accreditation unjustly to MSL because MSL dared to oppose\r\ntheir hegemony.\r\nIn addition to their common heritage, the two suits also\r\nare compatible in a practical sense.  It is  settled \"that where\r\nthe witnesses or proof needed in the second action overlap\r\nsubstantially with those used in the first action, the second\r\naction should ordinarily be precluded.\"  Porn v. National Grange\r\nMut. Ins. Co., 93 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 1996).  Because neither\r\nMSL's antitrust claims nor its state-law claims survived summary\r\ndisposition, we must make an informed prophecy as to what witnesses\r\nwould have appeared and what proof would have emerged had the two\r\ncases been tried.  Here, the two suits' factual underpinnings are\r\nthe same.  This unmistakable congruence strongly suggests that the\r\nsame witnesses   largely ABA, AALS, and MSL personnel   and\r\ninformation   the evolution of the ABA accreditation procedures and\r\nthe details of the MSL accreditation effort   would have been\r\nnecessary to resolve both cases.  This substantial imbrication\r\nmakes it apparent that the two cases would have formed a convenient\r\ntrial unit and argues powerfully for claim preclusion.  See id. at\r\n34; see also King v. Uncon Oil Co., 117 F.3d 443, 445 (10th Cir.\r\n1997).\r\nTo the extent that reasonable expectations, objectively\r\nassayed, enter into the res judicata calculus, they augur here\r\ntoward the same conclusion.  In the first place, since the two sets\r\nof claims arise in the same time frame out of similar facts, \"one\r\nwould reasonably expect them to be brought together,\" Porn, 93 F.3d\r\nat 37.  In the second place, a party may be more readily presumed\r\nto expect that a court will treat multiple causes of action as a\r\nsingle trial unit when the plaintiff has all the facts necessary to\r\nbring the second claim at its disposal before or during the\r\npendency of the first.  MSL does not identify any significant facts\r\nthat were not within its ken  before the antitrust action reached\r\nits climax.  We therefore conclude that the application of res\r\njudicata is an entirely predictable consequence of MSL's unilateral\r\ndecision to split its claim.\r\nOf course, res judicata will not attach if the claim\r\nasserted in the second suit could not have been asserted in the\r\nfirst.  See In re Newport Harbor Assocs., 589 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir.\r\n1978).  In an effort to avoid looming defeat, MSL tries to squeeze\r\nthrough this loophole by questioning whether it could have brought\r\nthe instant claims in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \r\nInsofar as this question relates to MSL's pursuit of the ABA and\r\nthe AALS, it is easily answered.\r\nUnder 28 U.S.C.  1367(a), a federal court that exercises\r\nfederal question jurisdiction over a claim may also assert\r\nsupplemental jurisdiction over all state-law claims that arise from\r\nthe same operative facts.  See BIW Deceived, 132 F.3d at 833;\r\nRodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Co., 57 F.3d 1168, 1175 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  As we already have determined, the facts upon which MSL\r\ngrounded its antitrust action concern MSL's efforts to receive ABA\r\naccreditation between 1992 and 1993.  This same trove of facts also\r\nprovides the basis for MSL's state-law claims against the ABA and\r\nthe AALS.  As a result, had MSL ventured to bring its current\r\ncompendium of claims before the Pennsylvania federal district court\r\nas part and parcel of MSL I, that court could have entertained them\r\nin conjunction with the antitrust action then before it.  See 28\r\nU.S.C.  1367.\r\nDespite the fact that the Court has ceded the federal\r\njudiciary broad leeway to \"look to the common law or to the\r\npolicies supporting res judicata . . . in assessing the preclusive\r\neffect of decisions of other federal courts,\" Allen, 449 U.S. at\r\n96, MSL makes one last effort to undercut the district court's\r\ndetermination.  Res judicata cannot be applied against a plaintiff\r\nunless the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate\r\nall its claims in the original action.  See id. at 90; Kale, 924\r\nF.2d at 1168. Citing a series of adverse discovery rulings, MSL\r\nargues that it did not receive such an opportunity in the Eastern\r\nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\r\nThe Court has not yet addressed the standard for\r\ndetermining the existence vel non of a full and fair opportunity in\r\nregard to a prior federal judgment.  The standard, however, is\r\nquite permissive as it pertains to prior state court judgments.  To\r\nmeet this standard, a state court judgment need only \"satisfy the\r\nminimal procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due\r\nProcess Clause.\"  Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461,\r\n481 (1982).  We do not envision a significantly less latitudinarian\r\ntest for federal court judgments.  We hold, therefore, that as long\r\nas a prior federal court judgment is procured in a manner that\r\nsatisfies due process concerns, the requisite \"full and fair\r\nopportunity\" existed.\r\nHere, MSL points to its numerous failed efforts to obtain\r\nadditional discovery in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and\r\nasseverates that draconian restrictions deprived it of an adequate\r\nchance to litigate its claims in MSL I.  These allegations of\r\ndiscovery error are reheated for our consumption.  They previously\r\nwere reviewed and rejected by the Third Circuit, see MSL I, 107\r\nF.3d at 1033-34, and we see no reason to revisit that\r\ndetermination.\r\nAt any rate, a full and fair opportunity to litigate\r\ncannot be equated with a license to do as a party pleases.  The\r\nadjudicative process operates pursuant to rules, and an opportunity\r\nto litigate is no less \"full\" or \"fair\" simply because the forum\r\ncourt enforces conventional limitations on pretrial discovery.  By\r\nany conceivable criterion, MSL had its full and fair opportunity to\r\nassert, in the Pennsylvania proceeding, the panoply of procedural\r\nand substantive rights guaranteed it by federal law.  Its first\r\naction therefore furnishes a proper predicate for the application\r\nof res judicata in its second action.\r\nIn this instance, all roads lead to Rome.  MSL had an\r\nappropriate opportunity to litigate its first set of claims, and\r\nconveniently could have brought the second set as part of the same\r\nproceeding.  Its failure to do so dooms the instant action since\r\nMSL's two sets of allegations arise from a common nucleus of\r\noperative facts and fit together tongue and groove.  We conclude\r\nthat, as a consequence of this road not taken, res judicata\r\nprecludes MSL's state-law claims against the ABA and the AALS. \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment in favor of these two institutional defendants.\r\nVIII.  NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL OF LAW\r\nThe district court granted NESL's motion to dismiss,\r\nruling that the complaint failed to state a claim against NESL upon\r\nwhich relief could be granted.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  We\r\nreview this determination de novo, accept all well-pleaded facts as\r\ntrue, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. \r\nSee Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st\r\nCir. 1989).  Notwithstanding the generous contours of this\r\nstandard, a reviewing court need not \"swallow plaintiff's invective\r\nhook, line, and sinker; bald assertions unsupportable conclusions,\r\nperiphrastic circumlocutions, and the like need not be credited.\" \r\nAulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nMSL's briefing reads as if it were seeking to hold NESL\r\nliable for civil conspiracy.  Nevertheless, its complaint aims the\r\nconspiracy charge elsewhere and the sufficiency of a complaint\r\nordinarily should be tested by examining the claims that are stated\r\ntherein rather than by weighing afterthought claims that are only\r\nmentioned in a legal brief.  See Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust\r\nCo.,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1998) [No. 97-1666, slip op. at\r\n20-21]; Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 190 (1st Cir. 1996);\r\nLitton Indus., Inc. v. Colon, 587 F.2d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 1978).  As\r\nMSL's complaint does not level a conspiracy charge against NESL, we\r\nlimit our inquiry to the claims that MSL saw fit to plead.\r\nMSL's complaint asserts two causes of action against\r\nNESL:  tortious misrepresentation and violations of the\r\nMassachusetts statute governing unfair and deceptive trade\r\npractices (commonly known as Chapter 93A).  The complaint\r\npredicates these causes of action on an exchange of correspondence\r\nbetween NESL officials (specifically, James Lawton, the chair of\r\nNESL's board of trustees, and Ellen Wayne, NESL's placement\r\ndirector) and the ABA's consultant, James White.  We catalog these\r\nfour pieces of correspondence.\r\nLawton wrote to White on January 2, 1990, stating in\r\npertinent part:\r\n     The chairman of the Massachusetts Board\r\nof Regents is former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas\r\nand he is for all intents and purposes the\r\n\"principal\" in the Massachusetts School of Law\r\nat Andover.  Mr. Tsongas has the solid support\r\nof the Boston Globe and the Board of Regents\r\nare under his complete control at this time.\r\n     My guess is that any other, new or\r\ncompeting law schools, which may come into\r\nexistence will not receive support from the\r\nRegents who are a rigidly controlled group of\r\nDukakis loyalists who will only do what they\r\nare told by the present administration under\r\nTsongas and [Governor] Dukakis.\r\n\nLater that year, Wayne informed White that Massachusetts\r\nauthorities had authorized MSL to award J.D. degrees, and that its\r\ngraduates henceforth could sit for the Massachusetts bar.  This\r\nmissive, dated June 19, 1990, also mentioned that MSL had requested\r\nand received a table at a fair sponsored by the Northeast\r\nAssociation of Pre-Law Advisors (NAPLA).  Wayne reported that\r\nNAPLA's by-laws had compelled approval of MSL's request, but that\r\nthe NAPLA board of directors would amend the by-laws to restrict\r\nparticipation in subsequent programs to \"ABA approved law\r\nschool[s].\"  The complaint does not allege that NAPLA excluded MSL\r\nfrom any subsequent events.\r\nEight days later, White wrote to Lawton and solicited his\r\nopinion as to the possibility of convincing the Massachusetts\r\nSupreme Judicial Court (SJC) to amend its rules and require\r\ngraduation from an ABA-accredited law school as a prerequisite to\r\ntaking the Massachusetts bar examination.  Lawton's response, dated\r\nJuly 17, 1990, indicated his approbation and recommended that\r\nmembers of the bar petition for such an amendment.  The complaint\r\ndoes not allege that such a request was ever made or that the SJC\r\nrevised its rules in the desired manner.\r\nThe first letter from Lawton to White is plainly\r\ninaccurate insofar as it proclaims a Tsongas/MSL connection. \r\nSenator Tsongas, who had ties to a different unaccredited law\r\nschool, had none with MSL.  MSL does not assert that the first\r\nletter contains any other inaccuracies and does not point to any\r\nmisstatements in the remaining three epistles.\r\nAgainst this mise-en-scne, we turn to MSL's claim of\r\ntortious misrepresentation.  This strikes us as something of a\r\nmisnomer (our canvass of Massachusetts case law does not reveal a\r\nsingle articulation of the elements of a particularized cause of\r\naction for tortious misrepresentation), but in all events,\r\nMassachusetts jurisprudence recognizes causes of action for both\r\nfraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation.  See,\r\ne.g., Craig v. Everett M. Brooks Co., 222 N.E.2d 752, 753 (Mass.\r\n1967) (fraudulent misrepresentation); NYCAL Corp. v. KPMG Peat\r\nMarwick, 688 N.E.2d 1368, 1371 (Mass. 1998) (negligent\r\nmisrepresentation).  MSL's complaint does not plead this claim with\r\nsufficient particularity to support a charge of fraud, see Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 9(b), and thus, we interpret the complaint as an attempt\r\nto articulate a claim for negligent misrepresentation.  The\r\nelements of such a cause of action are that the defendant falsely\r\nrepresented a past or existing material fact without any reasonable\r\nbasis for thinking it to be true; that he intended to euchre the\r\nplaintiff into relying on the representation; that the plaintiff,\r\nunaware of the representation's falsity, justifiably relied on it;\r\nand that the plaintiff suffered harm due to his reliance.  See 37\r\nAm. Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit  12 (1968).\r\nThe claim deserves short shrift.  To be sure, the\r\ncomments about Senator Tsongas amount to a misrepresentation, but\r\nMSL does not plead that it relied on that misrepresentation to its\r\ndetriment, and such reliance cannot plausibly be inferred from the\r\ncomplaint's other averments.  The general rule is that, without\r\nthis necessary element, there can be no recovery for negligent\r\nmisrepresentation under Massachusetts law.  See Romanoff v. Balcom,\r\n339 N.E.2d 927, 927 (Mass. App. Ct. 1976).\r\nThere is an exception to this rule.  In the absence of\r\ndetrimental reliance, a party still may be held liable under\r\nMassachusetts law for misrepresentation of information negligently\r\nsupplied for the guidance of others.  See  Fox v. F &amp; J Gattozzi\r\nCorp., 672 N.E.2d 547, 551 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996) (stating that if\r\na defendant \"in the course of his business . . . supplies false\r\ninformation for the guidance of others in their business\r\ntransactions,\" he \"is subject to liability for pecuniary loss\r\ncaused to [third persons] by [the recipient's] justifiable reliance\r\nupon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or\r\ncompetence in obtaining or communicating the information\") (quoting\r\nRestatement (Second) Torts  552(a) (1977)).\r\nMSL's claim for tortious misrepresentation fails to\r\nqualify for this exception.  Even if we assume that Lawton's first\r\nletter to White occurred in the course of a \"business transaction\"\r\na fact that MSL does not allege   MSL pleads neither that it (or\r\nanyone else, for that matter) relied upon Lawton's faux pas nor\r\nthat it suffered any harm as a result of the transmittal of the\r\nTsongas-related (mis)information.  Hence, the district court did\r\nnot err in granting NESL's motion to dismiss the tortious\r\nmisrepresentation count.\r\nWe next engage MSL's Chapter 93A claim for \"unfair and\r\ndeceptive acts.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A,  2.  By their nature,\r\nChapter 93A claims tend to be case-specific.  Their general meter,\r\nhowever, is that the defendant's conduct must be not only wrong,\r\nbut also egregiously wrong   and this standard calls for\r\ndeterminations of egregiousness well beyond what is required for\r\nmost common law claims.  See Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas,\r\n390 N.E.2d 243, 251 (Mass. 1979).  To quote a by-now-familiar\r\nformulation, \"the objectionable conduct must attain a level of\r\nrascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the\r\nrough and tumble of the world of commerce.\"  Levings v. Forbes &amp;\r\nWallace, Inc., 396 N.E.2d 149, 153 (Mass. App. Ct. 1979).\r\nMSL's complaint is inscrutable as to the precise nature\r\nof its Chapter 93A claim and its briefing is not very helpful on\r\nthis score.  Its complaint attributes nothing to NESL beyond the\r\nlatter's role in the exchange of correspondence described above. \r\nMSL apparently means to asseverate that publication of the\r\nstatements contained in the exchange of correspondence defamed or\r\notherwise damaged it and thus transgressed Chapter 93A.  This\r\nasseveration cannot survive scrutiny.\r\nThe SJC recently has held that \"where allegedly\r\ndefamatory statements do not support a cause of action for\r\ndefamation, they also do not support a cause of action under\r\n[Chapter] 93A.\"  Dulgarian v. Stone, 652 N.E.2d 603, 609 (Mass.\r\n1995).  Truth is an absolute defense to a defamation action under\r\nMassachusetts law, see Bander v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 47\r\nN.E.2d 595, 598 (Mass. 1943), and MSL therefore must demonstrate\r\nthat NESL published \"a false and defamatory written communication\r\nof and concerning the plaintiff.\"  McAvoy v. Shufrin, 518 N.E.2d\r\n513, 517 (Mass. 1988).  As previously noted, the only false\r\nstatement ascribed to any NESL representative concerns Senator\r\nTsongas's alleged patronage of MSL.\r\nWe next consider if that statement can form the basis for\r\na claim of defamation by MSL.  Whether a statement is reasonably\r\nsusceptible of a defamatory meaning is a question of law for the\r\ncourt.  See Foley v. Lowell Sun Pub. Co., 533 N.E.2d 196, 197\r\n(Mass. 1989).  For a communication to qualify as defamatory, \"[t]he\r\ntest is, whether, in the circumstances, the writing discredits the\r\nplaintiff in the minds of any considerable and respectable class in\r\nthe community.\"  Smith v. Suburban Restaurants, Inc., 373 N.E.2d\r\n215, 217 (Mass. 1978).  The core question, therefore, is not\r\nwhether Lawton's demonstrated falsehood discredits somebody   it\r\nplainly denigrates the late senator   but whether it significantly\r\ndiscredits MSL.  See New Eng. Tractor-Trailer Training, Inc. v.\r\nGlobe Newspaper Co., 480 N.E.2d 1005, 1007 (Mass. 1985).\r\nIn our estimation, the misstatement contained in Lawton's\r\nJanuary 2 letter does not sink to this level.  The senator enjoyed\r\nan enviable reputation as a public servant of the highest\r\nintegrity.  MSL has failed utterly to suggest how any educational\r\ninstitution could be defamed by attributing to it a connection with\r\nhim.  Absent such a link, no action lies.  See, e.g., Schwanbeck v.\r\nFederal-Mogul Corp., 578 N.E.2d 789, 804 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991)\r\n(explaining that false statements must have adverse consequences\r\nfor a plaintiff in order to be actionable under Chapter 93A). \r\nThus, the Tsongas-related comment, though untrue, is not defamatory\r\nof and concerning MSL.\r\nNor does MSL's complaint allege any other cognizable\r\nbasis for Chapter 93A liability on NESL's part.  The four items of\r\ncorrespondence hint that NESL did not wish MSL well, but none of\r\nthe matters which its representatives discussed with White suggest\r\nactivities so scurrilous as to trigger liability under Chapter 93A. \r\nAlthough we understand that a Chapter 93A violation need not rest\r\non an independent common law tort, see Massachusetts Farm Bureau\r\nFed'n, Inc. v. Blue Cross, Inc., 532 N.E.2d 660, 664 (Mass. 1989),\r\nthe conduct must at least come within shouting distance of some\r\nestablished concept of unfairness.  See Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,\r\n851 F.2d 513, 515-16 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\nTo sum up, even if Lawton and Wayne, on NESL's behalf,\r\nparticipated in activities of the kind adumbrated by their\r\ncorrespondence, such activities, though hostile to MSL and inimical\r\nto its interests, are not \"so seriously deceptive and harmful\" as\r\nto permit recovery under Chapter 93A.  Zayre Corp. v. Computer Sys.\r\nof Am., Inc., 511 N.E.2d 23, 30 n.23 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987). \r\nIndeed, NESL's suspected (but unproven and unalleged) \"actions\"  \r\ne.g., asking NAPLA to amend its by-laws or petitioning the SJC to\r\nrevise its rules   do not abridge any legal duty or bedrock concept\r\nof unfairness, and are not so \"unethical, oppressive, or\r\nunscrupulous\" as to be actionable under Chapter 93A.  PMP Assocs.,\r\nInc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 321 N.E.2d 915, 917 (Mass. 1975)\r\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  What is more, MSL\r\nfails to allege how NESL's involvement in these activities actually\r\ncaused any cognizable economic harm to it.  In itself, this is a\r\nfatal flaw.  See Zayre Corp., 511 N.E.2d at 30; see also Mass. Gen.\r\nLaws ch. 93A,  11 (explaining that, in a Chapter 93A claim, the\r\ncomplainant must show that she \"suffer[ed] a loss of money or\r\nproperty, real or personal, as a result of the use . . . of an\r\nunfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or\r\npractice\").\r\nThat ends the matter.  Because MSL has not advanced any \r\nsound basis on which NESL could be held liable either for negligent\r\nmisrepresentation or for transgressing Chapter 93A, we uphold Judge\r\nLasker's order granting NESL's motion to dismiss.\r\nIX.  THE SIX INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS\r\nWe need not linger long over MSL's claims against the Six\r\nIndividual Defendants.  This sextet comprises the ABA's consultant\r\n(White), plus the five members of the site-visit team (Garcia-\r\nPedrosa, Nahstoll, Smith, Strickland, and Winograd).  Judge Lasker\r\ndismissed MSL's breach of contract claim against these persons\r\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) and entered summary judgment in their favor on \r\nMSL's remaining claims.\r\nOur review is swift because \"[w]e have steadfastly deemed\r\nwaived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not\r\naccompanied by developed argumentation.\"  United States v.\r\nBongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997).  An issue lacks\r\ndeveloped argumentation if the appellant merely mentions it as \"a\r\npossible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do\r\ncounsel's work.\"  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\r\nCir. 1990).\r\nThis is such a case.  MSL's brief focuses mainly on the\r\nABA and does not  make any real attempt to construct a reasoned\r\nargument that would call into legitimate question the district\r\ncourt's rulings with regard to the Six Individual Defendants.  Of\r\ncourse, with a record appendix that boasts more than 6,500 pages,\r\nMSL has furnished a welter of paper, but it has not arrayed these\r\nplethoric evidentiary materials in any systematic way vis--vis\r\nthese defendants.  Instead, MSL strives to bind together several\r\nmounds of proof, quasi-proof, and unsubstantiated allegations\r\ntogether with desultory rhetoric.  More is required to pass muster\r\nunder Bongiorno and Zannino.  Accordingly, MSL has forfeited any\r\nobjection to the lower court's entry of judgment in favor of the\r\nSix Individual Defendants.\r\nX.  THE RULE 56(f) MOTION\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) provides:\r\n     Should it appear from the affidavits of a\r\nparty opposing [a motion for summary judgment]\r\nthat the party cannot for reasons stated\r\npresent by affidavit facts essential to\r\njustify the party's opposition, the court may\r\nrefuse the application for judgment or may\r\norder a continuance to permit affidavits to be\r\nobtained or depositions to be taken or\r\ndiscovery to be had or may make such other\r\norder as is just.\r\n\nMSL contends that the district court erroneously denied its motion\r\nfor further discovery under Rule 56(f).  This contention lacks\r\nforce.\r\nWe first set the stage.  The ABA and the Six Individual\r\nDefendants moved for dismissal on March 29, 1996.  The AALS filed\r\na motion for summary judgment on the same date.  MSL opposed both\r\nmotions and the court heard oral arguments on June 7.  Three weeks\r\nlater, while the district court still had the motions under\r\nadvisement, MSL moved to defer their adjudication until it had\r\nobtained more discovery.  After conferring with all counsel, the\r\ndistrict court denied the Rule 56(f) motion on August 28.  On\r\nSeptember 26, 1996, the AALS filed a supplemental motion for\r\nsummary judgment.  Four days later, the ABA and the Six Individual\r\nDefendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment.  MSL again\r\nfiled oppositions, but did not renew its Rule 56(f) motion.  The\r\ndistrict court granted the AALS's motion for brevis disposition on\r\nMarch 3, 1997, and granted the parallel  motion brought on behalf\r\nof the ABA and the Six Individual Defendants on May 8, 1997.\r\nIn this venue, MSL ardently embraces Rule 56(f).  It\r\ncontends that the district court acted improvidently in refusing\r\nthe requested continuance and proceeding to rule upon the\r\ndefendants' dispositive motions.\r\nTo savor the balm of Rule 56(f), a party must act in a\r\ntimely fashion.  See Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge\r\nAssocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1204 (1st Cir. 1994).  Moreover, the\r\nmoving papers must contain a proffer which, at a bare minimum,\r\narticulates a plausible basis for the movant's belief that\r\npreviously undisclosed or undocumented facts exist, that those\r\nfacts can be secured by further discovery, and that, if obtained,\r\nthere is some credible prospect that the new evidence will create\r\na trialworthy issue.  See Mattoon v. City of Pittsfield, 980 F.2d\r\n1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1992); Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun.\r\nWholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir. 1988).  Finally,\r\nthe motion must set forth good cause to explain the movant's\r\nfailure to have conducted the desired discovery at an earlier date. \r\nSee Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 584 (1st\r\nCir. 1994); Resolution Trust, 22 F.3d at 1205.\r\nWe review the denial of relief under Rule 56(f) for abuse\r\nof discretion.  See Sheinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259, 1263 (1st\r\nCir. 1991).  We discern no abuse  here.  To the contrary, the\r\nrecord reveals that MSL's attempt to invoke Rule 56(f) was both too\r\nlate and too little.\r\nWe deal first with the temporal aspect.  It is firmly\r\nestablished that a Rule 56(f) motion must be made within a\r\nreasonable time following the receipt of a motion for summary\r\njudgment.  See Resolution Trust, 22 F.3d at 1204.  This means that\r\na Rule 56(f) motion normally should precede or accompany the\r\nresponse to the summary judgment motion or follow as soon as\r\npracticable thereafter.  See Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 988.  Of\r\ncourse, there may be extenuating circumstances under which \"a party\r\nopposing a dispositive motion may not realize until the initial\r\nround of oral argument that he requires additional discovery time.\" \r\nId.  But this is an outer limit, and a Rule 56(f) extension request\r\nmade after the conclusion of oral argument on a summary judgment\r\nmotion ordinarily comes too late.  See  C.B. Trucking, Inc. v.\r\nWaste Mgmt., Inc.,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1998) [No. 96-2347,\r\nslip op. at 8 n.2]; Ashton-Tate Corp. v. Ross, 916 F.2d 516, 520\r\n(9th Cir. 1990); Dowling v. City of Philadelphia, 855 F.2d 136, 140\r\n(3d Cir. 1988); Pfeil v. Rogers, 757 F.2d 850, 856-57 (7th Cir.\r\n1985).\r\nMeasured against these temporal benchmarks, MSL's motion\r\nwhich was not made until three weeks after oral argument on the\r\ndefendants' initial set of dispositive motions   was out of time. \r\nNor do sufficiently excusatory circumstances exist.  At the time it\r\ninstituted this action, MSL had been at war with the ABA and the\r\nAALS for roughly two years.  It had received amplitudinous\r\ndiscovery in the antitrust case and knew   or should have known  \r\nimmediately upon receipt of the defendants' dispositive motions\r\nwhether it needed more information to oppose them.  There is no\r\nreadily apparent reason why MSL procrastinated in deploying Rule\r\n56(f), and MSL fails to offer any persuasive explanation for the\r\ndelay.\r\nAlthough we could affirm the district court's denial of\r\nRule 56(f) relief on this basis alone, the ruling also rests on\r\nsolid substantive grounds.  The plaintiff accompanied its motion\r\nwith an affidavit, executed by Dean Velvel, that described the\r\nfacts it hoped to unearth through further discovery.  By and large,\r\nthese facts pertain to the existence and operation of the\r\nostensible conspiracy between the ABA and the AALS.  But MSL did\r\nnot suggest below, and does not suggest here, how these new\r\nmaterials would palliate the force of the ABA's and the AALS's res\r\njudicata defense.\r\nThat omission undermines MSL's position.  Whatever other\r\nissues originally may have lurked in the penumbra of the\r\ndefendants' motions, the stark reality is that MSL's action\r\nfounders because it could have raised its state-law claims in MSL\r\nI, but did not do so.  No additional discovery can alter that\r\nreality.  Thus, the short answer to MSL's protest about truncated\r\ndiscovery is that, as against the ABA and the AALS, the district\r\ncourt's refusal to grant a Rule 56(f) continuance was harmless.\r\nSubstantively speaking, there is yet another obstacle\r\nblocking MSL's path.  A party relying on Rule 56(f) must\r\ndemonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing discovery. \r\nSee C.B. Trucking,     F.3d at     [slip op. at 9]; Ayala-Gerena v.\r\nBristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 1996).  The\r\ndistrict court denied MSL's motion to remand on January 18, 1996. \r\nInsofar as we can tell, MSL thereafter failed to take steps\r\nreasonably available to it to secure discovery.  We explain\r\nbriefly.\r\nThe District of Massachusetts operates under an\r\n\"automatic discovery\" paradigm.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1); D.\r\nMass. Loc. R. 26.2 (1996).  The court's local rules provide that\r\nunless otherwise ordered by a judicial officer, a \"party must\r\nprovide to other parties disclosure of the information and\r\nmaterials called for by [the automatic discovery rule]\" before that\r\nparty can initiate further discovery.  D. Mass. Loc. R. 26.2(A). \r\nThe record contains no evidence that MSL complied with its\r\nautomatic discovery responsibilities, that it attempted to initiate\r\nany discovery, or that it sought permission from a judicial officer\r\nto do so.  What is more, Judge Lasker issued a scheduling order on\r\nFebruary 28, 1996, in which he admonished all counsel that, if\r\ndiscovery could not be effectuated consensually, \"motions to compel\r\ndiscovery may be filed in accordance with the provisions of Local\r\nRule 26.2(C).\"  MSL never filed any such motion.\r\nWe will not paint the lily.  Rule 56(f) is designed to\r\n\"minister[] to the vigilant, not to those who slumber upon\r\nperceptible rights.\"  Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 989 n.5\r\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Given its\r\nlethargic approach to discovery, MSL cannot now be heard to\r\ncomplain about the district court's refusal to stay proceedings on\r\nthe summary judgment motions.  See Mattoon, 980 F.2d at 8; Hebertv. Wicklund, 744 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1984).\r\nTo this point, we have focused on the ABA and the AALS. \r\nNonetheless, the upshot is the same across the board.  With regard\r\nto the fourteen individual defendants, the affidavit that\r\naccompanied the Rule 56(f) motion mentions only one   Steven Smith\r\nand only mentions him in the most inconsequential manner.  The\r\naffidavit does not refer to NESL.  Therefore, the record does not\r\nsustain a claim that discoverable materials actually existed that\r\nwould have raised a trialworthy issue as to any of these fifteen\r\ndefendants.\r\nXI.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  MSL adduces other arguments, but\r\nnone of them requires elaboration.  It suffices to say that David\r\ndoes not always best Goliath.  \r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

The gargantuan record, capable of inducing tapephobia in even the hardiest appellate panel, is forbidding, but sheer bulk rarely is an accurate proxy for complexity.  Having scaled the mountain of papers and obtained a clear view of the legal landscape, we conclude that the lower court correctly apprehended both the issues and the answers.  Consequently, we uphold the several rulings that the appellant so vigorously contests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE PROTAGONISTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1995, Massachusetts School of Law (MSL) sued the American Bar Association (the ABA), the American Association of Law Schools (the AALS), New England School of Law (NESL), and fourteen individual defendants.  The facts that inform MSL's wide-ranging allegations are too diffuse to shed much light at this juncture, so we leave them shuttered until they can illuminate the specific issues raised by this appeal.  We deem it helpful, however, to describe at the outset the institutions and individuals involved in the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with MSL, a non-profit institution that opened its doors in 1988.  The school's self-proclaimed mission is to provide high-quality, affordable legal education to capable persons who traditionally have been shut out of the legal profession, including members of disadvantaged demographic populations and persons turning to the law in search of a second career.  To this end, MSL does not require applicants to take the Law School Aptitude Test (LSAT) because it considers the test biased.  Moreover, MSL's curriculum features a higher-than-usual percentage of adjunct instructors and a concentrated focus on professional skills courses.  MSL is not a fully accredited law school, but in 1990, the Massachusetts Board of Regents authorized the school to award the J.D. degree and thereby enabled MSL graduates to sit for the Massachusetts bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ABA is the largest national organization of the legal profession.  It has a membership of more than 380,000, composed principally of practicing lawyers (including lawyers in government and corporate America), judges, court administrators, and legal educators.  Though the ABA does not have the power to discipline lawyers, it promulgates model rules, develops guidelines, and strives to function as the national voice of the legal profession.  In that capacity, it long has served as the chief accreditor of law schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AALS is a non-profit association of 160 law schools.  Its stated objective is \"the improvement of the legal profession through legal education.\"   It serves as a trade organization for law professors and, with reference to legal education, acts as the academy's principal representative to the federal government and to national higher education organizations.  The AALS is separate from the ABA, but the two informally interlock in various ways.  Many individuals are active in both organizations and many AALS members participate in the ABA accreditation process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourteen individual defendants divide into two groups.  One group (the Eight Individual Defendants) comprises the seven members of the ABA's Accreditation Committee (the Committee) plus the immediate past chair of the ABA's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar (the Section).  The other group (the Six Individual Defendants) comprises the five members of the ABA team that visited MSL during its unsuccessful effort to obtain accreditation, plus a consultant who advised the ABA during that process.  All fourteen individual defendants are active participants in accreditation-related matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NESL is an ABA-accredited law school located in Boston, Massachusetts.  MSL regards itself as a competitor of NESL--and one which, if accredited, would be all the more formidable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For more than 70 years, the ABA has promulgated the standards for law school accreditation (the Standards).  It is widely believed among legal educators and regulatory organizations that compliance with the Standards enhances the quality of legal education.  MSL disputes this conventional wisdom but, since 1952, the United States Department of Education (the DOE) has recognized the ABA as a \"reliable authority\" anent the quality of legal education and has designated it as the relevant accrediting body.  20 U.S.C. &#167; 1099b(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As a result of this recognition, ABA-accredited schools are eligible to participate in federal student loan programs.  See 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1141(a)(5).  Accredited institutions also receive various state-based benefits, not the least of which is that all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico deem graduation from an ABA-accredited institution sufficient to satisfy the legal education requirement for admission to the bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The accreditation process works something like this.  A law school may apply for ABA accreditation after three years of operation.  Its application must include a self-study, delineating its perception of its present and projected compliance with the Standards and explaining any deviations from them.  The Committee reviews each application and appoints a site-visit team to conduct interviews and inspect the applicant's physical plant.  This team reports its findings to the Committee.  If the Committee determines that the school is in compliance with the Standards, the accreditation process moves forward.  If a school is found not to be in compliance with the Standards, the Committee nonetheless may recommend provisional accreditation if it receives satisfactory assurances that the applicant will achieve compliance within three years.  See Standard 104(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of compliance (actual or anticipated), there is another potential route to accreditation:  the applicant may request a variance from the Standards, and the body that oversees the accreditation process, the Council of the Section (the Council), may choose to grant it as a matter of discretion.  Standard 802 governs the variance procedure.  Because this Standard is central to MSL's accreditation effort, we reprint it in full:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A law school proposing to offer a program of legal education contrary to the terms of the Standards may apply to the Council for a variance.  The variance may be granted if the Council finds that the proposal is consistent with the general purpose of the Standards.  The Council may impose such conditions or qualifications as it deems appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. MSL'S ACCREDITATION EFFORT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL applied for ABA accreditation in 1992.  From the outset, MSL recognized that its practices were discordant with the Standards, yet remained steadfast in its deliberately contrarian mission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  At no time did MSL argue present compliance with the Standards or promise future compliance.  Instead, it confessed in its self-study that \"[t]o the considerable extent MSL's goals and methods are innovative, sometimes they deliberately run counter to conventional ABA criteria of accreditation.\"   Not surprisingly, MSL invoked Standard 802 by letter dated January 27, 1993, and requested \"a waiver of each and every Standard that ... might bar accreditation\" on the ground that, despite its admitted lack of conformity, \"MSL provides a high quality legal education that meets the underlying objectives of the accreditation process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ABA team visited MSL's campus in April 1993.  The next month, the site-visit team recommended that the Committee deny accreditation because MSL was in default of myriad Standards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The Committee accepted the recommendation and rejected the application.  MSL successively appealed to the Council and to the ABA's House of Delegates, both of which upheld the denial of accreditation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the instant litigation has all the hurly-burly of a major engagement, it is in point of fact a rear-guard action.  In November 1993, MSL brought an antitrust suit against the ABA, the AALS, and twenty-one individual defendants (including twelve of the fourteen persons sued here) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The Third Circuit subsequently characterized MSL's complaint as alleging that the named defendants conspired \"to enforce the ABA's anticompetitive accreditation standards [and thus violated the Sherman Act] by:  (1) fixing the price of faculty salaries;  (2) requiring reduced teaching hours and non-teaching duties;  (3) requiring paid sabbaticals;  (4) forcing the hiring of more professors in order to lower student/faculty ratios;  (5) limiting the use of adjunct professors;  (6) prohibiting the use of required or for-credit bar review courses;  (7) forcing schools to limit the number of hours students could work;  (8) prohibiting ABA-accredited schools from accepting credit transfers from unaccredited schools and from enrolling graduates of unaccredited schools in graduate programs;  (9) requiring more expensive and elaborate physical and library facilities;  and (10) requiring schools to use the LSAT.\"  Massachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. American Bar Ass'n, 107 F.3d 1026, 1031-32 (3d Cir.)  (MSL I ), cert. denied, --- U.S.----, 118 S.Ct. 264, 139 L.Ed.2d 191 (1997).  Between 1994 and 1996, the district court published no fewer than nine opinions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  At the end of the line, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of all remaining defendants (including the ABA and the AALS), and the Third Circuit affirmed.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the antitrust case still extant, MSL sought to try its luck in the Massachusetts state courts.  Its suit named the ABA, the AALS, twelve of the same individuals whom it had sued in MSL I, and three virgin defendants (NESL and two additional Committee members, Moeser and Yu).  MSL's complaint asserts claims for violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A and for tortious misrepresentation against all the defendants, as well as claims for fraud, deceit, civil conspiracy, and breach of contract against the AALS, the ABA, and the fourteen named individuals.  The strand that sews together this tapestry of charges is MSL's accusation that the ABA and the AALS for many years have banded together to monopolize legal education with a goal of increasing their institutional power and boosting the salaries of law professors and administrators.  MSL asserts that its educational philosophy poses a threat to the ABA/AALS cabal and that the two organizations therefore conspired to deny MSL accreditation, despite the fact that MSL's educational offerings are exemplary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1099b(f), discussed infra Part V, the defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The district court denied MSL's timely motion to remand.  After a full year's worth of pretrial skirmishing, the court methodically dismembered MSL's complaint, defendant by defendant, during a four month period in 1997:  on January 10, it granted NESL's motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6);  on February 13, it granted the Eight Individual Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction;  on March 3, it granted the AALS's motion for summary judgment;  and on May 8, it granted summary judgment in favor of the ABA and the Six Individual Defendants.  MSL appeals from each of these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address two threshold jurisdictional issues:  the refusal to remand and the court's holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants.  From that point forward, we proceed on a defendant-by-defendant basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE MOTION TO REMAND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below denied MSL's motion to remand, ruling that the suit arose under federal law.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 (1994);  see also Viqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 17-19 (1st Cir.1998) (discussing federal question jurisdiction).  Judge Lasker premised this holding on 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1099b(f), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action brought by an institution of higher education seeking accreditation from, or accredited by, an accrediting agency or association approved by the Secretary ... and involving the denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation of the institution of higher education, shall be brought in the appropriate United States district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to remand de novo and place the burden of persuasion upon the party who insists that federal jurisdiction obtains.  See BIW Deceived v. Local S6, 132 F.3d 824, 831 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We appear to be the first appellate court to address this seldom-used removal statute.  The statutory language is straightforward and the provision's meaning clear:  if a civil action brought by an institution of higher education involves a denial of accreditation, then federal jurisdiction exists.  MSL, by self-characterization, is an institution of higher education, and the ABA's withholding of accreditation is the cynosure of its suit.  Thus, to the extent that MSL alleges harms within the accreditation process--and such allegations permeate its complaint--section 1099b(f) applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only colorable issue that MSL raises with regard to remand implicates the constitutionality of section 1099b(f).  This, too, is a question of first impression.  For a case properly to \"aris[e] under\" federal law, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, Congress must confer federal jurisdiction in the context of a broad statutory framework within an area susceptible to congressional regulation.  In other words, the jurisdictional grant must be \"simply one part of [a] comprehensive scheme.\"  Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 496, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 1972-73, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983).  MSL contends that section 1099b(f) fails this test and that Article III does not permit Congress to confer federal jurisdiction by means of such a freewheeling jurisdictional statute.  See, e.g., The Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 53 U.S.  (12 How.) 443, 452, 13 L.Ed. 1058 (1851);  Mossman v. Higginson, 4 U.S.  (4 Dall.) 12, 13, 1 L.Ed. 720 (1800) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus of our inquiry thus becomes whether section 1099b(f)'s grant of jurisdiction occurs within a sufficiently comprehensive regulatory scheme.  We answer this question affirmatively.  Accreditation serves an important national function because once an institution of higher education becomes accredited by the DOE or its designated accrediting agency, the institution becomes eligible for federal student loan monies.  See Chicago Sch. of Automatic Transmissions, Inc. v. Accreditation Alliance of Career Schs. &amp; Colleges, 44 F.3d 447, 449 (7th Cir.1994).  The Higher Education Act and the DOE's implementing regulations spin a sophisticated regulatory web that governs the relationship between accrediting agencies and accreditation applicants.  See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. &#167; 602.24, 602.28 (1996) (requiring that accrediting agencies apply consistent standards and give applicants due process).  The grant of federal jurisdiction over matters involving accreditation is reasonably related to the efficient operation of that system.  No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, section 1099b(f)'s grant of federal jurisdiction occurs within a broad statutory framework, properly the subject of congressional concern.  Accordingly, the statute comports with Article III.  Removal was altogether appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. THE EIGHT INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court applies the prima facie standard and grants a motion to dismiss for want of in personam jurisdiction without conducting an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts, the court of appeals reviews its ruling de novo.  See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d 138, 147 (1st Cir.1995).  The lower court's decision to dismiss MSL's action as to the Committee members--defendants Hasl, Moeser, Ryan, Schneider, Sowle, Walwer, and Yu--falls within this sphere.  So does the order dismissing the action against the last of the Eight Individual Defendants, Henry Ramsey, Jr.  (the chair of the Section).  Withal, Ramsey's situation requires a more extended analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual basis for MSL's jurisdictional initiative derives predominantly from three events that occurred in 1993.  According to the complaint, Hasl, Moeser, Schneider, and Ramsey met in Boston on February 6. The quartet allegedly \"used false statements and charges\"--the nature of which is not disclosed--in order \"to try to bring their plan of non-accreditation of MSL to fruition.\"   A review of the parties' proffers reveals, however, that the only MSL-related business transacted at this meeting involved a decision to delay the site visit by one month.  MSL next alludes to a Committee meeting that took place on June 23 in Brooklyn, New York.  The Eight Individual Defendants all attended this session and participated in the denial of MSL's application for accreditation.  The Eight Individual Defendants, save Ramsey, also attended a retreat that took place on Nantucket Island, in Massachusetts, from June 24-27.  MSL asserts conclusorily that the Committee \"finalized\" the denial of its application during this period, but the record flatly contradicts this assertion:  the retreat participants all maintain (to quote from typical language appearing in their several affidavits) that \"[w]hile in Nantucket, the Committee did not take up any agenda item concerning MSL, as all matters concerning MSL had been concluded in Brooklyn, New York, on June 23, 1993.\"   MSL proffers no clear evidence showing that these statements are inaccurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a motion to dismiss for want of in personam jurisdiction, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), the plaintiff ultimately bears the burden of persuading the court that jurisdiction exists.  See McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 189, 56 S.Ct. 780, 785, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936);  Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., 115 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir.1997).  In conducting the requisite analysis under the prima facie standard, we take specific facts affirmatively alleged by the plaintiff as true (whether or not disputed) and construe them in the light most congenial to the plaintiff's jurisdictional claim.  See Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 203 (1st Cir.1994).  We then add to the mix facts put forward by the defendants, to the extent that they are uncontradicted.  See, e.g., Topp v. CompAir Inc., 814 F.2d 830, 836-37 (1st Cir.1987).  We caution that, despite the liberality of this approach, the law does not require us struthiously to \"credit conclusory allegations or draw farfetched inferences.\"  Ticketmaster-N.Y., 26 F.3d at 203.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may exercise authority over a defendant by virtue of either general or specific jurisdiction.  See Donatelli v. National Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459, 462-63 (1st Cir.1990).  General jurisdiction \"exists when the litigation is not directly founded on the defendant's forum-based contacts, but the defendant has nevertheless engaged in continuous and systematic activity, unrelated to the suit, in the forum state.\"  United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1088 (1st Cir.1992).  MSL does not argue, and we find no facts to suggest, that any of the Eight Individual Defendants can be brought before a Massachusetts court on a general jurisdiction theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of general jurisdiction, a court's power depends upon the existence of specific jurisdiction.  Specific jurisdiction exists when there is a demonstrable nexus between a plaintiff's claims and a defendant's forum-based activities, such as when the litigation itself is founded directly on those activities.  See Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 462.   In this instance, MSL asserts specific jurisdiction under Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  223A. &#167; 3 (1992).  MSL cites variously to section 3(a), which extends \"personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's ... transacting any business\" in Massachusetts, and to section 3(c), which authorizes personal jurisdiction over a non-resident who causes \"tortious injury\" by an \"act or omission in this Commonwealth.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pause to consider the particulars of the Massachusetts long-arm statute.  Even if that statute, correctly applied, would purport to grant jurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants--a matter of state law on which we take no view--MSL still would have to demonstrate that \"the exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to that statute comports with the strictures of the Constitution.\"  Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir.1994).  In the personal jurisdiction context, we have characterized compliance with the Constitution as implicating \"three distinct components, namely, relatedness, purposeful availment (sometimes called 'minimum contacts'), and reasonableness.\"  Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 144.   We analyze the situations of the Eight Individuals Defendants through this prism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for the extension of personal jurisdiction to survive constitutional scrutiny, a claim must \"arise out of, or be related to, the defendant's in-forum activities.\"  Ticketmaster-N.Y., 26 F.3d at 206.   We have approached the relatedness inquiry with slightly different emphases when the plaintiff asserts a contract claim then when she asserts a tort claim:  if a contract claim, our stereotypical inquiry tends to ask whether the defendant's forum-based activities are \"instrumental in the formation of the contract,\" Hahn v. Vermont Law Sch., 698 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir.1983);  if a tort claim, we customarily look to whether the plaintiff has established \"cause in fact (i.e., the injury would not have occurred 'but for' the defendant's forum-state activity) and legal cause (i.e., the defendant's in-state conduct gave birth to the cause of action).\"  United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers, 960 F.2d at 1089;  see also Ticketmaster-N.Y., 26 F.3d at 207 (noting that the relatedness inquiry is intended in part to \"ensure[ ] that the element of causation remains in the forefront of the due process investigation\").  In respect to the Eight Individual Defendants, MSL presents only tort claims before us,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and thus our relatedness analysis thus focuses on causation.  We find this element clearly lacking as regards the seven Committee members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only activities undertaken in Massachusetts by any of these seven persons that possibly could relate to MSL's state-law claims consists of the participation of three of them in the Boston meeting and the attendance of all seven at the Nantucket retreat.  MSL's insinuations notwithstanding, the particularized facts that were before the district court show conclusively that both of these activities were benign:  the Boston meeting dealt with MSL in a purely peripheral sense (doing no more than to delay the site visit to MSL's facility by one month),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and the retreat did not deal with MSL at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL also argues that two letters written to it by James White, an ABA consultant, are sufficient to extend personal jurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants.  One of these communiques informed MSL of the Committee's decision not to grant MSL provisional approval;  contemporaneous copies were sent by White to the seven Committee members.  The other letter informed MSL of the Council's decision to reject its application for a variance pursuant to Standard 802 and to deny its accreditation appeal.  Contemporaneous copies of this letter were sent to defendants Hasl, Moeser, and Ramsey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These missives do not carry weight in the jurisdictional calculus vis-a-vis the Eight Individual Defendants.  We cannot subscribe to a transitive view of minimum contacts, which would hold that a letter from A to B that reports on C's actions confers personal jurisdiction over C in B's home state based on those actions.  Without a more substantial nexus, the extension of such jurisdiction would violate due process, for the connection between C's actions in an extra-forum jurisdiction and B's home state is too attenuated to satisfy the relatedness requirement.  See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 417, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 1873-74, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984).  Nor do we think that the case for the application of such a novel rule is bolstered by the mere fact that A (acting, for aught that appears, on his own initiative) chooses to inform C of his communication with B by mailing her a copy of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although MSL does not assert in so many words that the Committee's denial of accreditation at the Brooklyn meeting constitutes conduct directed into Massachusetts sufficient to bestow personal jurisdiction, it intimates as much.  We therefore address this possibility.  The transmission of facts or information into Massachusetts via telephone or mail would of course constitute evidence of a jurisdictional contact directed into the forum state, see Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 2184, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985), but we must determine whether the Committee's decision to deny accreditation--a decision that had effects in Massachusetts--qualifies as such a contact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have wrestled before with this issue of whether the in-forum effects of extra-forum activities suffice to constitute minimum contacts and have found in the negative.  For example, in Sawtelle v. Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381 (1st Cir.1995), we recounted Kowalski v. Doherty, Wallace, Pillsbury &amp; Murphy, 787 F.2d 7 (1st Cir.1986), and noted that in Kowalski \"we rejected the plaintiff's contention that, because the 'effects' of the firm's negligence were felt in New Hampshire, the law firm had caused an injury there by conduct directed at that forum.\"  Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1390.   Just as the New Hampshire effects of Massachusetts negligence, without more, could not sustain an action in New Hampshire against the negligent actor, see Kowalski, 787 F.2d at 11, so too the Massachusetts effects of the Eight Individual Defendants' New York actions, without more, fail to sustain an action in a Massachusetts court.  Accord Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1394 (holding that New Hampshire effects of non-forum negligence, without more, are insufficient to support personal jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramsey is in a slightly different position.  Although what we have just discussed pertains to him--after all, he participated in both the Boston and Brooklyn meetings--it is not conclusive because the record reflects that, unlike his seven cohorts, he had other contacts which might suffice to clear the relatedness hurdle.  Ramsey wrote a memorandum to White that memorialized a conversation between Ramsey and MSL's Dean Velvel.  Ramsey reported that during this conversation Velvel attempted to couple MSL's effort to obtain waivers under Standard 802 with MSL's plan to persuade the DOE to jettison the ABA as the national accrediting agency for law schools.  The memorandum itself indicates that Ramsey sent a copy to Velvel, presumably at MSL, and the inclusion of Velvel's Andover telephone number indicates that Velvel was in Massachusetts when he and Ramsey spoke.  Although the contents of this memorandum hardly flatter MSL, the memorandum constitutes some indication that Ramsey engaged in conduct that might bear upon the relatedness inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of our doubts about the outcome of the relatedness inquiry vis-a-vis Ramsey, we turn to the question of whether Ramsey's contacts with Massachusetts \"represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in [Massachusetts], thereby invoking the benefits and protections of [its] laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before [the Massachusetts] court foreseeable.\"  Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 61 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the record suggests that Ramsey participated in a telephone call with Dean Velvel concerning MSL's accreditation while Velvel was in Massachusetts, it is uninformative as to who initiated the call.  In either case, we believe that this solitary telephone conversation and the subsequent mailing of a copy of Ramsey's memorandum, even when combined with Ramsey's participation in the Boston meeting, are insufficient to establish purposeful availment.  See, e.g., Aylward v. Fleet Bank, 122 F.3d 616, 618 (8th Cir.1997) (holding that three telephone calls and one letter within a seven month period were insufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction when the alleged injury did not arise directly from the contacts);  U.S.S. Yachts, Inc. v. Ocean Yachts, Inc., 894 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that three letters sent to Puerto Rico were insufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction in that venue).  Put another way, based on these exiguous contacts Ramsey could not reasonably have foreseen being haled into a Massachusetts court to answer allegations of a wide-ranging conspiracy.  We therefore conclude that the extension of personal jurisdiction to him would violate his due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, MSL laments that it did not have the opportunity to engage in jurisdictional discovery.  The docket contains no evidence, however, that MSL ever made a motion or other documented request for jurisdictional discovery in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Therefore, in accordance with firmly settled principles, we will not entertain its plaint now.  See Sunview Condo.  Ass'n v. Flexel Int'l, Ltd., 116 F.3d 962, 964-65 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.  Because MSL neither alleged nor proffered sufficient facts to permit the exercise of jurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants, the district court did not err when it granted their motion to dismiss.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. THE ABA AND THE AALS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ABA and the AALS each present multiple grounds in support of the district court's grant of summary judgment.  The most striking of these is the defense of res judicata.  In its present iteration, this defense turns on whether the judgment entered in the previous litigation between the parties (MSL I ) bars the plaintiff from maintaining the instant action against these two institutional defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, both the potentially precluding suit and the potentially precluded suit were litigated in federal courts, federal law governs the res judicata effect of the prior judgment.  See Gonzalez v. Banco Central Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.1994).  The elements of federal res judicata are \"(1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier suit, (2) sufficient identicality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the parties in the two suits.\"  Id. In this instance, the first and third tines of the test are foregone conclusions.  Because the Supreme Court denied certiorari after the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's entry of final judgment in MSL I, the finality of the earlier judgment cannot be gainsaid.  By like token, MSL, the ABA, and the AALS were parties to the precursor litigation and thus satisfy the identicality requirement.  The question, then, is whether the state-law claims that MSL now advances against the ABA and the AALS are sufficiently related to the causes of action asserted in MSL I to warrant claim preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock.  To bring claim preclusion into play, a cause of action need not be a clone of the earlier cause of action.  \"Under res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\"  Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 414-15, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980).  We have adopted a transactional approach to determine whether causes of action are sufficiently related to support a res judicata defense.  See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 1161, 1166 (1st Cir.1991).  \"Under this approach, a cause of action is defined as a set of facts which can be characterized as a single transaction or series of related transactions.\"  Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Amertex Enters., Ltd., 48 F.3d 576, 583 (1st Cir.1995).  This boils down to whether the causes of action arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts.  See Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 755.   In mounting this inquiry, we routinely ask \"whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations.\"  Aunyx Corp. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 978 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24 (1982)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles are dispositive here.  MSL's pending claims, though rooted in Massachusetts law, plainly arise from the same set of operative facts as its earlier antitrust claims.  Although MSL describes the later claims more colloquially and dresses them in different legal raiment, the conduct that underbraces the two sets of claims is strikingly similar in time, space, origin, and motivation.  Both suits stem from MSL's failed efforts in 1992 and 1993 to receive ABA accreditation.  In both cases, MSL alleges that the ABA and the AALS orchestrated a long-term scheme to accumulate power and money and a short-term scheme to deny accreditation unjustly to MSL because MSL dared to oppose their hegemony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to their common heritage, the two suits also are compatible in a practical sense.  It is settled \"that where the witnesses or proof needed in the second action overlap substantially with those used in the first action, the second action should ordinarily be precluded.\"  Porn v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 93 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.1996).  Because neither MSL's antitrust claims nor its state-law claims survived summary disposition, we must make an informed prophecy as to what witnesses would have appeared and what proof would have emerged had the two cases been tried.  Here, the two suits' factual underpinnings are the same.  This unmistakable congruence strongly suggests that the same witnesses--largely ABA, AALS, and MSL personnel--and information--the evolution of the ABA accreditation procedures and the details of the MSL accreditation effort--would have been necessary to resolve both cases.  This substantial imbrication makes it apparent that the two cases would have formed a convenient trial unit and argues powerfully for claim preclusion.  See id. at 34;  see also King v. Union Oil Co., 117 F.3d 443, 445 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that reasonable expectations, objectively assayed, enter into the res judicata calculus, they augur here toward the same conclusion.  In the first place, since the two sets of claims arise in the same time frame out of similar facts, \"one would reasonably expect them to be brought together,\" Porn, 93 F.3d at 37.   In the second place, a party may be more readily presumed to expect that a court will treat multiple causes of action as a single trial unit when the plaintiff has all the facts necessary to bring the second claim at its disposal before or during the pendency of the first.  MSL does not identify any significant facts that were not within its ken before the antitrust action reached its climax.  We therefore conclude that the application of res judicata is an entirely predictable consequence of MSL's unilateral decision to split its claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, res judicata will not attach if the claim asserted in the second suit could not have been asserted in the first.  See In re Newport Harbor Assocs., 589 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1978).  In an effort to avoid looming defeat, MSL tries to squeeze through this loophole by questioning whether it could have brought the instant claims in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  Insofar as this question relates to MSL's pursuit of the ABA and the AALS, it is easily answered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(a), a federal court that exercises federal question jurisdiction over a claim may also assert supplemental jurisdiction over all state-law claims that arise from the same operative facts.  See BIW Deceived, 132 F.3d at 833;  Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1175 (1st Cir.1995).  As we already have determined, the facts upon which MSL grounded its antitrust action concern MSL's efforts to receive ABA accreditation between 1992 and 1993.  This same trove of facts also provides the basis for MSL's state-law claims against the ABA and the AALS.  As a result, had MSL ventured to bring its current compendium of claims before the Pennsylvania federal district court as part and parcel of MSL I, that court could have entertained them in conjunction with the antitrust action then before it.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the fact that the Court has ceded the federal judiciary broad leeway to \"look to the common law or to the policies supporting res judicata ... in assessing the preclusive effect of decisions of other federal courts,\" Allen, 449 U.S. at 96, 101 S.Ct. at 415, MSL makes one last effort to undercut the district court's determination.  Res judicata cannot be applied against a plaintiff unless the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate all its claims in the original action.  See id. at 90, 101 S.Ct. at 412-13;  Kale, 924 F.2d at 1168.   Citing a series of adverse discovery rulings, MSL argues that it did not receive such an opportunity in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has not yet addressed the standard for determining the existence vel non of a full and fair opportunity in regard to a prior federal judgment.  The standard, however, is quite permissive as it pertains to prior state court judgments.  To meet this standard, a state court judgment need only \"satisfy the minimal procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\"  Kremer v. Chemical Constr.  Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1897, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982).  We do not envision a significantly less latitudinarian test for federal court judgments.  We hold, therefore, that as long as a prior federal court judgment is procured in a manner that satisfies due process concerns, the requisite \"full and fair opportunity\" existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, MSL points to its numerous failed efforts to obtain additional discovery in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and asseverates that draconian restrictions deprived it of an adequate chance to litigate its claims in MSL I. These allegations of discovery error are reheated for our consumption.  They previously were reviewed and rejected by the Third Circuit, see MSL I, 107 F.3d at 1033-34, and we see no reason to revisit that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, a full and fair opportunity to litigate cannot be equated with a license to do as a party pleases.  The adjudicative process operates pursuant to rules, and an opportunity to litigate is no less \"full\" or \"fair\" simply because the forum court enforces conventional limitations on pretrial discovery.  By any conceivable criterion, MSL had its full and fair opportunity to assert, in the Pennsylvania proceeding, the panoply of procedural and substantive rights guaranteed it by federal law.  Its first action therefore furnishes a proper predicate for the application of res judicata in its second action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, all roads lead to Rome.  MSL had an appropriate opportunity to litigate its first set of claims, and conveniently could have brought the second set as part of the same proceeding.  Its failure to do so dooms the instant action since MSL's two sets of allegations arise from a common nucleus of operative facts and fit together tongue and groove.  We conclude that, as a consequence of this road not taken, res judicata precludes MSL's state-law claims against the ABA and the AALS.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of these two institutional defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>VIII. NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL OF LAW</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted NESL's motion to dismiss, ruling that the complaint failed to state a claim against NESL upon which relief could be granted.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  We review this determination de novo, accept all well-pleaded facts as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1989).  Notwithstanding the generous contours of this standard, a reviewing court need not \"swallow plaintiff's invective hook, line, and sinker;  bald assertions unsupportable conclusions, periphrastic circumlocutions, and the like need not be credited.\"  Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL's briefing reads as if it were seeking to hold NESL liable for civil conspiracy.  Nevertheless, its complaint aims the conspiracy charge elsewhere and the sufficiency of a complaint ordinarily should be tested by examining the claims that are stated therein rather than by weighing afterthought claims that are only mentioned in a legal brief.  See Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 22 (1st Cir.1998);  Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 190 (1st Cir.1996);  Litton Indus., Inc. v. Colon, 587 F.2d 70, 74 (1st Cir.1978).  As MSL's complaint does not level a conspiracy charge against NESL, we limit our inquiry to the claims that MSL saw fit to plead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL's complaint asserts two causes of action against NESL:  tortious misrepresentation and violations of the Massachusetts statute governing unfair and deceptive trade practices (commonly known as Chapter 93A).  The complaint predicates these causes of action on an exchange of correspondence between NESL officials (specifically, James Lawton, the chair of NESL's board of trustees, and Ellen Wayne, NESL's placement director) and the ABA's consultant, James White.  We catalog these four pieces of correspondence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawton wrote to White on January 2, 1990, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Regents is former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas and he is for all intents and purposes the \"principal\" in the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover.  Mr. Tsongas has the solid support of the Boston Globe and the Board of Regents are under his complete control at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My guess is that any other, new or competing law schools, which may come into existence will not receive support from the Regents who are a rigidly controlled group of Dukakis loyalists who will only do what they are told by the present administration under Tsongas and [Governor] Dukakis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that year, Wayne informed White that Massachusetts authorities had authorized MSL to award J.D. degrees, and that its graduates henceforth could sit for the Massachusetts bar.  This missive, dated June 19, 1990, also mentioned that MSL had requested and received a table at a fair sponsored by the Northeast Association of Pre-Law Advisors (NAPLA).  Wayne reported that NAPLA's by-laws had compelled approval of MSL's request, but that the NAPLA board of directors would amend the by-laws to restrict participation in subsequent programs to \"ABA approved law school[s].\"  The complaint does not allege that NAPLA excluded MSL from any subsequent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eight days later, White wrote to Lawton and solicited his opinion as to the possibility of convincing the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) to amend its rules and require graduation from an ABA-accredited law school as a prerequisite to taking the Massachusetts bar examination.  Lawton's response, dated July 17, 1990, indicated his approbation and recommended that members of the bar petition for such an amendment.  The complaint does not allege that such a request was ever made or that the SJC revised its rules in the desired manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first letter from Lawton to White is plainly inaccurate insofar as it proclaims a Tsongas/MSL connection.  Senator Tsongas, who had ties to a different unaccredited law school, had none with MSL. MSL does not assert that the first letter contains any other inaccuracies and does not point to any misstatements in the remaining three epistles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this mise-en-scene, we turn to MSL's claim of tortious misrepresentation.  This strikes us as something of a misnomer (our canvass of Massachusetts case law does not reveal a single articulation of the elements of a particularized cause of action for tortious misrepresentation), but in all events, Massachusetts jurisprudence recognizes causes of action for both fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation.  See, e.g., Craig v. Everett M. Brooks Co., 351 Mass. 497, 222 N.E.2d 752, 753 (1967) (fraudulent misrepresentation);  Nycal Corp. v. KPMG Peat Marwick, 426 Mass. 491, 688 N.E.2d 1368, 1371 (1998) (negligent misrepresentation).  MSL's complaint does not plead this claim with sufficient particularity to support a charge of fraud,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> see Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), and thus, we interpret the complaint as an attempt to articulate a claim for negligent misrepresentation.  The elements of such a cause of action are that the defendant falsely represented a past or existing material fact without any reasonable basis for thinking it to be true;  that he intended to euchre the plaintiff into relying on the representation;  that the plaintiff, unaware of the representation's falsity, justifiably relied on it;  and that the plaintiff suffered harm due to his reliance.  See 37 Am.Jur.2d, Fraud and Deceit &#167; 12 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim deserves short shrift.  To be sure, the comments about Senator Tsongas amount to a misrepresentation, but MSL does not plead that it relied on that misrepresentation to its detriment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and such reliance cannot plausibly be inferred from the complaint's other averments.  The general rule is that, without this necessary element, there can be no recovery for negligent misrepresentation under Massachusetts law.  See Romanoff v. Balcom, 4 Mass.App.Ct. 768, 339 N.E.2d 927, 927 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an exception to this rule.  In the absence of detrimental reliance, a party still may be held liable under Massachusetts law for misrepresentation of information negligently supplied for the guidance of others.  See Fox v. F &amp; J Gattozzi Corp., 41 Mass.App.Ct. 581, 672 N.E.2d 547, 551 (1996) (stating that if a defendant \"in the course of his business ... supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,\" he \"is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to [third persons] by [the recipient's] justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information\") (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts &#167; 552(1) (1977)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL's claim for tortious misrepresentation fails to qualify for this exception.  Even if we assume that Lawton's first letter to White occurred in the course of a \"business transaction\"--a fact that MSL does not allege--MSL pleads neither that it (or anyone else, for that matter) relied upon Lawton's faux pas nor that it suffered any harm as a result of the transmittal of the Tsongas-related (mis)information.  Hence, the district court did not err in granting NESL's motion to dismiss the tortious misrepresentation count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next engage MSL's Chapter 93A claim for \"unfair and deceptive acts.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 2.  By their nature, Chapter 93A claims tend to be case-specific.  Their general meter, however, is that the defendant's conduct must be not only wrong, but also egregiously wrong--and this standard calls for determinations of egregiousness well beyond what is required for most common law claims.  See Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas, 378 Mass. 85, 390 N.E.2d 243, 251 (1979).  To quote a by-now-familiar formulation, \"the objectionable conduct must attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\"  Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., 8 Mass.App.Ct. 498, 396 N.E.2d 149, 153 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL's complaint is inscrutable as to the precise nature of its Chapter 93A claim and its briefing is not very helpful on this score.  Its complaint attributes nothing to NESL beyond the latter's role in the exchange of correspondence described above.  MSL apparently means to asseverate that publication of the statements contained in the exchange of correspondence defamed or otherwise damaged it and thus transgressed Chapter 93A.  This asseveration cannot survive scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC recently has held that \"where allegedly defamatory statements do not support a cause of action for defamation, they also do not support a cause of action under [Chapter] 93A.\"  Dulgarian v. Stone, 420 Mass. 843, 652 N.E.2d 603, 609 (1995).  Truth is an absolute defense to a defamation action under Massachusetts law, see Bander v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 313 Mass. 337, 47 N.E.2d 595, 598 (1943), and MSL therefore must demonstrate that NESL published \"a false and defamatory written communication of and concerning the plaintiff.\"  McAvoy v. Shufrin, 401 Mass. 593, 518 N.E.2d 513, 517 (1988).  As previously noted, the only false statement ascribed to any NESL representative concerns Senator Tsongas's alleged patronage of MSL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider if that statement can form the basis for a claim of defamation by MSL. Whether a statement is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning is a question of law for the court.  See Foley v. Lowell Sun Pub. Co., 404 Mass. 9, 533 N.E.2d 196, 197 (1989).  For a communication to qualify as defamatory, \"[t]he test is, whether, in the circumstances, the writing discredits the plaintiff in the minds of any considerable and respectable class in the community.\"  Smith v. Suburban Restaurants, Inc., 374 Mass. 528, 373 N.E.2d 215, 217 (1978).  The core question, therefore, is not whether Lawton's demonstrated falsehood discredits somebody--it plainly denigrates the late senator--but whether it significantly discredits MSL. See New Eng.  Tractor-Trailer Training, Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 395 Mass. 471, 480 N.E.2d 1005, 1007 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our estimation, the misstatement contained in Lawton's January 2 letter does not sink to this level.  The senator enjoyed an enviable reputation as a public servant of the highest integrity.  MSL has failed utterly to suggest how any educational institution could be defamed by attributing to it a connection with him.  Absent such a link, no action lies.  See, e.g., Schwanbeck v. Federal-Mogul Corp., 31 Mass.App.Ct. 390, 578 N.E.2d 789, 804 (1991) (explaining that false statements must have adverse consequences for a plaintiff in order to be actionable under Chapter 93A).  Thus, the Tsongas-related comment, though untrue, is not defamatory of and concerning MSL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does MSL's complaint allege any other cognizable basis for Chapter 93A liability on NESL's part.  The four items of correspondence hint that NESL did not wish MSL well, but none of the matters which its representatives discussed with White suggest activities so scurrilous as to trigger liability under Chapter 93A.  Although we understand that a Chapter 93A violation need not rest on an independent common law tort, see Massachusetts Farm Bureau Fed'n, Inc. v. Blue Cross, Inc., 403 Mass. 722, 532 N.E.2d 660, 664 (1989), the conduct must at least come within shouting distance of some established concept of unfairness.  See Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515-16 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, even if Lawton and Wayne, on NESL's behalf, participated in activities of the kind adumbrated by their correspondence, such activities, though hostile to MSL and inimical to its interests, are not \"so seriously deceptive and harmful\" as to permit recovery under Chapter 93A.  Zayre Corp. v. Computer Sys. of Am., Inc., 24 Mass.App.Ct. 559, 511 N.E.2d 23, 30 n. 23 (1987).  Indeed, NESL's suspected (but unproven and unalleged) \"actions\"--e.g., asking NAPLA to amend its by-laws or petitioning the SJC to revise its rules--do not abridge any legal duty or bedrock concept of unfairness, and are not so \"unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous\" as to be actionable under Chapter 93A.  PMP Assocs., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 366 Mass. 593, 321 N.E.2d 915, 917 (1975) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  What is more, MSL fails to allege how NESL's involvement in these activities actually caused any cognizable economic harm to it.  In itself, this is a fatal flaw.  See Zayre Corp., 511 N.E.2d at 30;  see also Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11 (explaining that, in a Chapter 93A claim, the complainant must show that she \"suffer[ed] a loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use ... of an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  Because MSL has not advanced any sound basis on which NESL could be held liable either for negligent misrepresentation or for transgressing Chapter 93A, we uphold Judge Lasker's order granting NESL's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IX. THE SIX INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over MSL's claims against the Six Individual Defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  This sextet comprises the ABA's consultant (White), plus the five members of the site-visit team (Garcia-Pedrosa, Nahstoll, Smith, Strickland, and Winograd).  Judge Lasker dismissed MSL's breach of contract claim against these persons under Rule 12(b)(6) and entered summary judgment in their favor on MSL's remaining claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is swift because \"[w]e have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\"  United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.1997).  An issue lacks developed argumentation if the appellant merely mentions it as \"a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work.\"  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case.  MSL's brief focuses mainly on the ABA and does not make any real attempt to construct a reasoned argument that would call into legitimate question the district court's rulings with regard to the Six Individual Defendants.  Of course, with a record appendix that boasts more than 6,500 pages, MSL has furnished a welter of paper, but it has not arrayed these plethoric evidentiary materials in any systematic way vis-a-vis these defendants.  Instead, MSL strives to bind together several mounds of proof, quasi-proof, and unsubstantiated allegations together with desultory rhetoric.  More is required to pass muster under Bongiorno and Zannino.   Accordingly, MSL has forfeited any objection to the lower court's entry of judgment in favor of the Six Individual Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>X. THE RULE 56(f) MOTION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing [a motion for summary judgment] that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL contends that the district court erroneously denied its motion for further discovery under Rule 56(f).  This contention lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first set the stage.  The ABA and the Six Individual Defendants moved for dismissal on March 29, 1996.  The AALS filed a motion for summary judgment on the same date.  MSL opposed both motions and the court heard oral arguments on June 7. Three weeks later, while the district court still had the motions under advisement, MSL moved to defer their adjudication until it had obtained more discovery.  After conferring with all counsel, the district court denied the Rule 56(f) motion on August 28.  On September 26, 1996, the AALS filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment.  Four days later, the ABA and the Six Individual Defendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment.  MSL again filed oppositions, but did not renew its Rule 56(f) motion.  The district court granted the AALS's motion for brevis disposition on March 3, 1997, and granted the parallel motion brought on behalf of the ABA and the Six Individual Defendants on May 8, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, MSL ardently embraces Rule 56(f).  It contends that the district court acted improvidently in refusing the requested continuance and proceeding to rule upon the defendants' dispositive motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To savor the balm of Rule 56(f), a party must act in a timely fashion.  See Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge Assocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1204 (1st Cir.1994).  Moreover, the moving papers must contain a proffer which, at a bare minimum, articulates a plausible basis for the movant's belief that previously undisclosed or undocumented facts exist, that those facts can be secured by further discovery, and that, if obtained, there is some credible prospect that the new evidence will create a trialworthy issue.  See Mattoon v. City of Pittsfield, 980 F.2d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.1992);  Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir.1988).  Finally, the motion must set forth good cause to explain the movant's failure to have conducted the desired discovery at an earlier date.  See Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 584 (1st Cir.1994);  Resolution Trust, 22 F.3d at 1205.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of relief under Rule 56(f) for abuse of discretion.  See Sheinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259, 1263 (1st Cir.1991).  We discern no abuse here.  To the contrary, the record reveals that MSL's attempt to invoke Rule 56(f) was both too late and too little.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal first with the temporal aspect.  It is firmly established that a Rule 56(f) motion must be made within a reasonable time following the receipt of a motion for summary judgment.  See Resolution Trust, 22 F.3d at 1204.   This means that a Rule 56(f) motion normally should precede or accompany the response to the summary judgment motion or follow as soon as practicable thereafter.  See Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 988.   Of course, there may be extenuating circumstances under which \"a party opposing a dispositive motion may not realize until the initial round of oral argument that he requires additional discovery time.\"  Id. But this is an outer limit, and a Rule 56(f) extension request made after the conclusion of oral argument on a summary judgment motion ordinarily comes too late.  See C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 137 F.3d 41, 44 n. 2 (1st Cir.1998) ;  Ashton-Tate Corp. v. Ross, 916 F.2d 516, 520 (9th Cir.1990);  Dowling v. City of Philadelphia, 855 F.2d 136, 140 (3d Cir.1988);  Pfeil v. Rogers, 757 F.2d 850, 856-57 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Measured against these temporal benchmarks, MSL's motion--which was not made until three weeks after oral argument on the defendants' initial set of dispositive motions--was out of time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Nor do sufficiently excusatory circumstances exist.  At the time it instituted this action, MSL had been at war with the ABA and the AALS for roughly two years.  It had received amplitudinous discovery in the antitrust case and knew--or should have known--immediately upon receipt of the defendants' dispositive motions whether it needed more information to oppose them.  There is no readily apparent reason why MSL procrastinated in deploying Rule 56(f), and MSL fails to offer any persuasive explanation for the delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we could affirm the district court's denial of Rule 56(f) relief on this basis alone, the ruling also rests on solid substantive grounds.  The plaintiff accompanied its motion with an affidavit, executed by Dean Velvel, that described the facts it hoped to unearth through further discovery.  By and large, these facts pertain to the existence and operation of the ostensible conspiracy between the ABA and the AALS.  But MSL did not suggest below, and does not suggest here, how these new materials would palliate the force of the ABA's and the AALS's res judicata defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That omission undermines MSL's position.  Whatever other issues originally may have lurked in the penumbra of the defendants' motions, the stark reality is that MSL's action founders because it could have raised its state-law claims in MSL I, but did not do so.  No additional discovery can alter that reality.  Thus, the short answer to MSL's protest about truncated discovery is that, as against the ABA and the AALS, the district court's refusal to grant a Rule 56(f) continuance was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantively speaking, there is yet another obstacle blocking MSL's path.  A party relying on Rule 56(f) must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing discovery.  See C.B. Trucking, 137 F.3d at 45;  Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir.1996).  The district court denied MSL's motion to remand on January 18, 1996.  Insofar as we can tell, MSL thereafter failed to take steps reasonably available to it to secure discovery.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District of Massachusetts operates under an \"automatic discovery\" paradigm.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1);  D. Mass.  Loc. R. 26.2 (1996).  The court's local rules provide that unless otherwise ordered by a judicial officer, a \"party must provide to other parties disclosure of the information and materials called for by [the automatic discovery rule]\" before that party can initiate further discovery.  D. Mass.  Loc. R. 26.2(A).  The record contains no evidence that MSL complied with its automatic discovery responsibilities, that it attempted to initiate any discovery, or that it sought permission from a judicial officer to do so.  What is more, Judge Lasker issued a scheduling order on February 28, 1996, in which he admonished all counsel that, if discovery could not be effectuated consensually, \"motions to compel discovery may be filed in accordance with the provisions of Local Rule 26.2(C).\"   MSL never filed any such motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Rule 56(f) is designed to \"minister[ ] to the vigilant, not to those who slumber upon perceptible rights.\"  Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 989 n. 5 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Given its lethargic approach to discovery, MSL cannot now be heard to complain about the district court's refusal to stay proceedings on the summary judgment motions.  See Mattoon, 980 F.2d at 8;  Hebert v. Wicklund, 744 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this point, we have focused on the ABA and the AALS.  Nonetheless, the upshot is the same across the board.  With regard to the fourteen individual defendants, the affidavit that accompanied the Rule 56(f) motion mentions only one--Steven Smith--and only mentions him in the most inconsequential manner.  The affidavit does not refer to NESL.  Therefore, the record does not sustain a claim that discoverable materials actually existed that would have raised a trialworthy issue as to any of these fifteen defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  MSL adduces other arguments, but none of them requires elaboration.  It suffices to say that David does not always best Goliath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Federal law provides criteria by which a DOE-approved accreditor must review an applicant institution.

In a 1992 memorandum from Dean Lawrence Velvel to members of MSL's board of trustees, the dean predicted that if the ABA \"is given reason to believe it is facing a tiger, it will seek to quickly come to a reasonable accommodation with MSL.\" He then noted that \"[t]he ABA ran a deficit of two million dollars last year, and is in desperation about insufficient revenues....  The ABA's financial straits are crucially important because ... the lawyers needed to defend serious lawsuits cost a small fortune.  The ABA will not want and cannot afford the heavy fees it would have to spend to defend against a suit by MSL.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Areas of noncompliance included (1) an inordinately high student/faculty ratio;  (2) the school's excessive reliance on part-time faculty;  (3) the unusually heavy teaching loads carried by full-time faculty members;  (4) the failure to provide sabbaticals for full-time faculty;  (5) the inclusion of six-credit bar review courses in the school's curriculum;  (6) the lack of a suitable placement program;  (7) problems with MSL's class schedule;  (8) the absence of any policies designed to ensure that full-time MSL students devote substantially all their working hours to the study of law;  (9) the failure to use LSATs or some other acceptable testing mechanism to determine apparent aptitude for legal study;  (10) the absence of any written plan for achieving compliance with Standard 212 (requiring \"concrete action\" to provide legal education to qualified members of groups that \"have been victims of discrimination in various forms\");  and (11) an inadequate physical plant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> See Massachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v.

Cos., 746 F.2d 87, 92 (1st Cir.1984), and the actions attributed to the individual defendants apparently occurred in their capacities as representatives of the ABA.  The situation is tenebrous, however, because most of these defendants (all except Moeser and Yu, to be exact) successfully escaped from the Pennsylvania proceedings on jurisdictional grounds, see MSL v. ABA, 846 F.Supp. 374 (E.D.Pa.1994), thus complicating their current effort to find shelter under the Pennsylvania court's judgment.  See generally Computer Assocs.  Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 126 F.3d 365, 370 (2d Cir.1997) (suggesting, on somewhat dissimilar facts, that \"[e]ven where a second action arises from some of the same factual circumstances that gave rise to a prior action, res judicata is inapplicable if formal jurisdictional or statutory barriers precluded the plaintiff from asserting its claims in the first action\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 1676, 140 L.Ed.2d 814 (1998).   We do not need to resolve this thorny question because all the individual defendants reach safe harbor on other, more pedestrian theories.

THE PROTAGONISTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1995, Massachusetts School of Law (MSL) sued the American Bar Association (the ABA), the American Association of Law Schools (the AALS), New England School of Law (NESL), and fourteen individual defendants.  The facts that inform MSL's wide-ranging allegations are too diffuse to shed much light at this juncture, so we leave them shuttered until they can illuminate the specific issues raised by this appeal.  We deem it helpful, however, to describe at the outset the institutions and individuals involved in the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with MSL, a non-profit institution that opened its doors in 1988.  The school's self-proclaimed mission is to provide high-quality, affordable legal education to capable persons who traditionally have been shut out of the legal profession, including members of disadvantaged demographic populations and persons turning to the law in search of a second career.  To this end, MSL does not require applicants to take the Law School Aptitude Test (LSAT) because it considers the test biased.  Moreover, MSL's curriculum features a higher-than-usual percentage of adjunct instructors and a concentrated focus on professional skills courses.  MSL is not a fully accredited law school, but in 1990, the Massachusetts Board of Regents authorized the school to award the J.D. degree and thereby enabled MSL graduates to sit for the Massachusetts bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ABA is the largest national organization of the legal profession.  It has a membership of more than 380,000, composed principally of practicing lawyers (including lawyers in government and corporate America), judges, court administrators, and legal educators.  Though the ABA does not have the power to discipline lawyers, it promulgates model rules, develops guidelines, and strives to function as the national voice of the legal profession.  In that capacity, it long has served as the chief accreditor of law schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AALS is a non-profit association of 160 law schools.  Its stated objective is \"the improvement of the legal profession through legal education.\"   It serves as a trade organization for law professors and, with reference to legal education, acts as the academy's principal representative to the federal government and to national higher education organizations.  The AALS is separate from the ABA, but the two informally interlock in various ways.  Many individuals are active in both organizations and many AALS members participate in the ABA accreditation process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourteen individual defendants divide into two groups.  One group (the Eight Individual Defendants) comprises the seven members of the ABA's Accreditation Committee (the Committee) plus the immediate past chair of the ABA's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar (the Section).  The other group (the Six Individual Defendants) comprises the five members of the ABA team that visited MSL during its unsuccessful effort to obtain accreditation, plus a consultant who advised the ABA during that process.  All fourteen individual defendants are active participants in accreditation-related matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NESL is an ABA-accredited law school located in Boston, Massachusetts.  MSL regards itself as a competitor of NESL--and one which, if accredited, would be all the more formidable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For more than 70 years, the ABA has promulgated the standards for law school accreditation (the Standards).  It is widely believed among legal educators and regulatory organizations that compliance with the Standards enhances the quality of legal education.  MSL disputes this conventional wisdom but, since 1952, the United States Department of Education (the DOE) has recognized the ABA as a \"reliable authority\" anent the quality of legal education and has designated it as the relevant accrediting body.  20 U.S.C. &#167; 1099b(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As a result of this recognition, ABA-accredited schools are eligible to participate in federal student loan programs.  See 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1141(a)(5).  Accredited institutions also receive various state-based benefits, not the least of which is that all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico deem graduation from an ABA-accredited institution sufficient to satisfy the legal education requirement for admission to the bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The accreditation process works something like this.  A law school may apply for ABA accreditation after three years of operation.  Its application must include a self-study, delineating its perception of its present and projected compliance with the Standards and explaining any deviations from them.  The Committee reviews each application and appoints a site-visit team to conduct interviews and inspect the applicant's physical plant.  This team reports its findings to the Committee.  If the Committee determines that the school is in compliance with the Standards, the accreditation process moves forward.  If a school is found not to be in compliance with the Standards, the Committee nonetheless may recommend provisional accreditation if it receives satisfactory assurances that the applicant will achieve compliance within three years.  See Standard 104(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of compliance (actual or anticipated), there is another potential route to accreditation:  the applicant may request a variance from the Standards, and the body that oversees the accreditation process, the Council of the Section (the Council), may choose to grant it as a matter of discretion.  Standard 802 governs the variance procedure.  Because this Standard is central to MSL's accreditation effort, we reprint it in full:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A law school proposing to offer a program of legal education contrary to the terms of the Standards may apply to the Council for a variance.  The variance may be granted if the Council finds that the proposal is consistent with the general purpose of the Standards.  The Council may impose such conditions or qualifications as it deems appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. MSL'S ACCREDITATION EFFORT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL applied for ABA accreditation in 1992.  From the outset, MSL recognized that its practices were discordant with the Standards, yet remained steadfast in its deliberately contrarian mission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  At no time did MSL argue present compliance with the Standards or promise future compliance.  Instead, it confessed in its self-study that \"[t]o the considerable extent MSL's goals and methods are innovative, sometimes they deliberately run counter to conventional ABA criteria of accreditation.\"   Not surprisingly, MSL invoked Standard 802 by letter dated January 27, 1993, and requested \"a waiver of each and every Standard that ... might bar accreditation\" on the ground that, despite its admitted lack of conformity, \"MSL provides a high quality legal education that meets the underlying objectives of the accreditation process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ABA team visited MSL's campus in April 1993.  The next month, the site-visit team recommended that the Committee deny accreditation because MSL was in default of myriad Standards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The Committee accepted the recommendation and rejected the application.  MSL successively appealed to the Council and to the ABA's House of Delegates, both of which upheld the denial of accreditation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the instant litigation has all the hurly-burly of a major engagement, it is in point of fact a rear-guard action.  In November 1993, MSL brought an antitrust suit against the ABA, the AALS, and twenty-one individual defendants (including twelve of the fourteen persons sued here) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The Third Circuit subsequently characterized MSL's complaint as alleging that the named defendants conspired \"to enforce the ABA's anticompetitive accreditation standards [and thus violated the Sherman Act] by:  (1) fixing the price of faculty salaries;  (2) requiring reduced teaching hours and non-teaching duties;  (3) requiring paid sabbaticals;  (4) forcing the hiring of more professors in order to lower student/faculty ratios;  (5) limiting the use of adjunct professors;  (6) prohibiting the use of required or for-credit bar review courses;  (7) forcing schools to limit the number of hours students could work;  (8) prohibiting ABA-accredited schools from accepting credit transfers from unaccredited schools and from enrolling graduates of unaccredited schools in graduate programs;  (9) requiring more expensive and elaborate physical and library facilities;  and (10) requiring schools to use the LSAT.\"  Massachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v.

Its suit named the ABA, the AALS, twelve of the same individuals whom it had sued in MSL I, and three virgin defendants (NESL and two additional Committee members, Moeser and Yu).  MSL's complaint asserts claims for violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A and for tortious misrepresentation against all the defendants, as well as claims for fraud, deceit, civil conspiracy, and breach of contract against the AALS, the ABA, and the fourteen named individuals.  The strand that sews together this tapestry of charges is MSL's accusation that the ABA and the AALS for many years have banded together to monopolize legal education with a goal of increasing their institutional power and boosting the salaries of law professors and administrators.  MSL asserts that its educational philosophy poses a threat to the ABA/AALS cabal and that the two organizations therefore conspired to deny MSL accreditation, despite the fact that MSL's educational offerings are exemplary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1099b(f), discussed infra Part V, the defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The district court denied MSL's timely motion to remand.  After a full year's worth of pretrial skirmishing, the court methodically dismembered MSL's complaint, defendant by defendant, during a four month period in 1997:  on January 10, it granted NESL's motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6);  on February 13, it granted the Eight Individual Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction;  on March 3, it granted the AALS's motion for summary judgment;  and on May 8, it granted summary judgment in favor of the ABA and the Six Individual Defendants.  MSL appeals from each of these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address two threshold jurisdictional issues:  the refusal to remand and the court's holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants.  From that point forward, we proceed on a defendant-by-defendant basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE MOTION TO REMAND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below denied MSL's motion to remand, ruling that the suit arose under federal law.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 (1994);  see also Viqueira v. First Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197886\"><a href=\"/opinion/197886/jamie-viqueira-v-first-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17-19 (1st Cir.1998) (discussing federal question jurisdiction).  Judge Lasker premised this holding on 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1099b(f), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action brought by an institution of higher education seeking accreditation from, or accredited by, an accrediting agency or association approved by the Secretary ... and involving the denial, withdrawal, or termination of accreditation of the institution of higher education, shall be brought in the appropriate United States district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to remand de novo and place the burden of persuasion upon the party who insists that federal jurisdiction obtains.  See BIW Deceived v. Local S6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749863\"><a href=\"/opinion/749863/biw-deceived-v-local-s6-industrial-union-of-marine-and-shipbuilding/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span>, 831 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We appear to be the first appellate court to address this seldom-used removal statute.  The statutory language is straightforward and the provision's meaning clear:  if a civil action brought by an institution of higher education involves a denial of accreditation, then federal jurisdiction exists.  MSL, by self-characterization, is an institution of higher education, and the ABA's withholding of accreditation is the cynosure of its suit.  Thus, to the extent that MSL alleges harms within the accreditation process--and such allegations permeate its complaint--section 1099b(f) applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only colorable issue that MSL raises with regard to remand implicates the constitutionality of section 1099b(f).  This, too, is a question of first impression.  For a case properly to \"aris[e] under\" federal law, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, Congress must confer federal jurisdiction in the context of a broad statutory framework within an area susceptible to congressional regulation.  In other words, the jurisdictional grant must be \"simply one part of [a] comprehensive scheme.\"  Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110932\"><a href=\"/opinion/110932/verlinden-bv-v-central-bank-of-nigeria/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 496, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110932\"><a href=\"/opinion/110932/verlinden-bv-v-central-bank-of-nigeria/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span> (1983).  MSL contends that section 1099b(f) fails this test and that Article III does not permit Congress to confer federal jurisdiction by means of such a freewheeling jurisdictional statute.  See, e.g., The Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 53 U.S.  (12 How.) 443, 452, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

We answer this question affirmatively.  Accreditation serves an important national function because once an institution of higher education becomes accredited by the DOE or its designated accrediting agency, the institution becomes eligible for federal student loan monies.  See Chicago Sch. of Automatic Transmissions, Inc. v. Accreditation Alliance of Career Schs. &amp; Colleges, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686484\"><a href=\"/opinion/686484/chicago-school-of-automatic-transmissions-inc-v-accreditation-alliance/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 449 (7th Cir.1994).  The Higher Education Act and the DOE's implementing regulations spin a sophisticated regulatory web that governs the relationship between accrediting agencies and accreditation applicants.  See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. &#167; 602.24, 602.28 (1996) (requiring that accrediting agencies apply consistent standards and give applicants due process).  The grant of federal jurisdiction over matters involving accreditation is reasonably related to the efficient operation of that system.  No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, section 1099b(f)'s grant of federal jurisdiction occurs within a broad statutory framework, properly the subject of congressional concern.  Accordingly, the statute comports with Article III.  Removal was altogether appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. THE EIGHT INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court applies the prima facie standard and grants a motion to dismiss for want of in personam jurisdiction without conducting an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts, the court of appeals reviews its ruling de novo.  See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195899\"><a href=\"/opinion/195899/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 147 (1st Cir.1995).  The lower court's decision to dismiss MSL's action as to the Committee members--defendants Hasl, Moeser, Ryan, Schneider, Sowle, Walwer, and Yu--falls within this sphere.  So does the order dismissing the action against the last of the Eight Individual Defendants, Henry Ramsey, Jr.  (the chair of the Section).  Withal, Ramsey's situation requires a more extended analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual basis for MSL's jurisdictional initiative derives predominantly from three events that occurred in 1993.  According to the complaint, Hasl, Moeser, Schneider, and Ramsey met in Boston on February 6. The quartet allegedly \"used false statements and charges\"--the nature of which is not disclosed--in order \"to try to bring their plan of non-accreditation of MSL to fruition.\"   A review of the parties' proffers reveals, however, that the only MSL-related business transacted at this meeting involved a decision to delay the site visit by one month.  MSL next alludes to a Committee meeting that took place on June 23 in Brooklyn, New York.  The Eight Individual Defendants all attended this session and participated in the denial of MSL's application for accreditation.  The Eight Individual Defendants, save Ramsey, also attended a retreat that took place on Nantucket Island, in Massachusetts, from June 24-27.  MSL asserts conclusorily that the Committee \"finalized\" the denial of its application during this period, but the record flatly contradicts this assertion:  the retreat participants all maintain (to quote from typical language appearing in their several affidavits) that \"[w]hile in Nantucket, the Committee did not take up any agenda item concerning MSL, as all matters concerning MSL had been concluded in Brooklyn, New York, on June 23, 1993.\"   MSL proffers no clear evidence showing that these statements are inaccurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a motion to dismiss for want of in personam jurisdiction, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), the plaintiff ultimately bears the burden of persuading the court that jurisdiction exists.

In conducting the requisite analysis under the prima facie standard, we take specific facts affirmatively alleged by the plaintiff as true (whether or not disputed) and construe them in the light most congenial to the plaintiff's jurisdictional claim.

See Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 462.   In this instance, MSL asserts specific jurisdiction under Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  223A. &#167; 3 (1992).  MSL cites variously to section 3(a), which extends \"personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person's ... transacting any business\" in Massachusetts, and to section 3(c), which authorizes personal jurisdiction over a non-resident who causes \"tortious injury\" by an \"act or omission in this Commonwealth.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pause to consider the particulars of the Massachusetts long-arm statute.

In respect to the Eight Individual Defendants, MSL presents only tort claims before us,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and thus our relatedness analysis thus focuses on causation.  We find this element clearly lacking as regards the seven Committee members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only activities undertaken in Massachusetts by any of these seven persons that possibly could relate to MSL's state-law claims consists of the participation of three of them in the Boston meeting and the attendance of all seven at the Nantucket retreat.  MSL's insinuations notwithstanding, the particularized facts that were before the district court show conclusively that both of these activities were benign:  the Boston meeting dealt with MSL in a purely peripheral sense (doing no more than to delay the site visit to MSL's facility by one month),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and the retreat did not deal with MSL at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL also argues that two letters written to it by James White, an ABA consultant, are sufficient to extend personal jurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants.  One of these communiques informed MSL of the Committee's decision not to grant MSL provisional approval;  contemporaneous copies were sent by White to the seven Committee members.  The other letter informed MSL of the Council's decision to reject its application for a variance pursuant to Standard 802 and to deny its accreditation appeal.  Contemporaneous copies of this letter were sent to defendants Hasl, Moeser, and Ramsey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These missives do not carry weight in the jurisdictional calculus vis-a-vis the Eight Individual Defendants.  We cannot subscribe to a transitive view of minimum contacts, which would hold that a letter from A to B that reports on C's actions confers personal jurisdiction over C in B's home state based on those actions.  Without a more substantial nexus, the extension of such jurisdiction would violate due process, for the connection between C's actions in an extra-forum jurisdiction and B's home state is too attenuated to satisfy the relatedness requirement.

We therefore address this possibility.  The transmission of facts or information into Massachusetts via telephone or mail would of course constitute evidence of a jurisdictional contact directed into the forum state, see Burger King Corp. v.

For example, in Sawtelle v. Farrell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709024\"><a href=\"/opinion/709024/arthur-f-sawtelle-etc-v-george-e-farrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), we recounted Kowalski v.

Just as the New Hampshire effects of Massachusetts negligence, without more, could not sustain an action in New Hampshire against the negligent actor, see Kowalski, 787 F.2d at 11, so too the Massachusetts effects of the Eight Individual Defendants' New York actions, without more, fail to sustain an action in a Massachusetts court.  Accord Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1394 (holding that New Hampshire effects of non-forum negligence, without more, are insufficient to support personal jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramsey is in a slightly different position.  Although what we have just discussed pertains to him--after all, he participated in both the Boston and Brooklyn meetings--it is not conclusive because the record reflects that, unlike his seven cohorts, he had other contacts which might suffice to clear the relatedness hurdle.  Ramsey wrote a memorandum to White that memorialized a conversation between Ramsey and MSL's Dean Velvel.  Ramsey reported that during this conversation Velvel attempted to couple MSL's effort to obtain waivers under Standard 802 with MSL's plan to persuade the DOE to jettison the ABA as the national accrediting agency for law schools.  The memorandum itself indicates that Ramsey sent a copy to Velvel, presumably at MSL, and the inclusion of Velvel's Andover telephone number indicates that Velvel was in Massachusetts when he and Ramsey spoke.  Although the contents of this memorandum hardly flatter MSL, the memorandum constitutes some indication that Ramsey engaged in conduct that might bear upon the relatedness inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of our doubts about the outcome of the relatedness inquiry vis-a-vis Ramsey, we turn to the question of whether Ramsey's contacts with Massachusetts \"represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in [Massachusetts], thereby invoking the benefits and protections of [its] laws and making the defendant's involuntary presence before [the Massachusetts] court foreseeable.\"  Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 61 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the record suggests that Ramsey participated in a telephone call with Dean Velvel concerning MSL's accreditation while Velvel was in Massachusetts, it is uninformative as to who initiated the call.  In either case, we believe that this solitary telephone conversation and the subsequent mailing of a copy of Ramsey's memorandum, even when combined with Ramsey's participation in the Boston meeting, are insufficient to establish purposeful availment.  See, e.g., Aylward v. Fleet Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744828\"><a href=\"/opinion/744828/ronald-l-aylward-v-fleet-bank-and-chase-manhattan-bank-na-trw-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span>, 618 (8th Cir.1997) (holding that three telephone calls and one letter within a seven month period were insufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction when the alleged injury did not arise directly from the contacts);  U.S.S. Yachts, Inc. v. Ocean Yachts, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535251\"><a href=\"/opinion/535251/uss-yachts-inc-v-ocean-yachts-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that three letters sent to Puerto Rico were insufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction in that venue).  Put another way, based on these exiguous contacts Ramsey could not reasonably have foreseen being haled into a Massachusetts court to answer allegations of a wide-ranging conspiracy.  We therefore conclude that the extension of personal jurisdiction to him would violate his due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, MSL laments that it did not have the opportunity to engage in jurisdictional discovery.  The docket contains no evidence, however, that MSL ever made a motion or other documented request for jurisdictional discovery in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Therefore, in accordance with firmly settled principles, we will not entertain its plaint now.  See Sunview Condo.  Ass'n v.

Because MSL neither alleged nor proffered sufficient facts to permit the exercise of jurisdiction over the Eight Individual Defendants, the district court did not err when it granted their motion to dismiss.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. THE ABA AND THE AALS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ABA and the AALS each present multiple grounds in support of the district court's grant of summary judgment.  The most striking of these is the defense of res judicata.  In its present iteration, this defense turns on whether the judgment entered in the previous litigation between the parties (MSL I ) bars the plaintiff from maintaining the instant action against these two institutional defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, both the potentially precluding suit and the potentially precluded suit were litigated in federal courts, federal law governs the res judicata effect of the prior judgment.  See Gonzalez v. Banco Central Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195467\"><a href=\"/opinion/195467/gonzalez-abreau-v-banco-central/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, 755 (1st Cir.1994).  The elements of federal res judicata are \"(1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier suit, (2) sufficient identicality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the parties in the two suits.\"  Id. In this instance, the first and third tines of the test are foregone conclusions.  Because the Supreme Court denied certiorari after the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's entry of final judgment in MSL I, the finality of the earlier judgment cannot be gainsaid.  By like token, MSL, the ABA, and the AALS were parties to the precursor litigation and thus satisfy the identicality requirement.  The question, then, is whether the state-law claims that MSL now advances against the ABA and the AALS are sufficiently related to the causes of action asserted in MSL I to warrant claim preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock.  To bring claim preclusion into play, a cause of action need not be a clone of the earlier cause of action.  \"Under res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\"  Allen v. McCurry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span> (1980).  We have adopted a transactional approach to determine whether causes of action are sufficiently related to support a res judicata defense.  See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555434\"><a href=\"/opinion/555434/carl-kale-v-combined-insurance-company-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1166 (1st Cir.1991).  \"Under this approach, a cause of action is defined as a set of facts which can be characterized as a single transaction or series of related transactions.\"  Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v.

This boils down to whether the causes of action arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts.  See Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 755.   In mounting this inquiry, we routinely ask \"whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations.\"  Aunyx Corp. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593290\"><a href=\"/opinion/593290/aunyx-corporation-v-canon-usa-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24 (1982)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles are dispositive here.  MSL's pending claims, though rooted in Massachusetts law, plainly arise from the same set of operative facts as its earlier antitrust claims.  Although MSL describes the later claims more colloquially and dresses them in different legal raiment, the conduct that underbraces the two sets of claims is strikingly similar in time, space, origin, and motivation.  Both suits stem from MSL's failed efforts in 1992 and 1993 to receive ABA accreditation.  In both cases, MSL alleges that the ABA and the AALS orchestrated a long-term scheme to accumulate power and money and a short-term scheme to deny accreditation unjustly to MSL because MSL dared to oppose their hegemony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to their common heritage, the two suits also are compatible in a practical sense.  It is settled \"that where the witnesses or proof needed in the second action overlap substantially with those used in the first action, the second action should ordinarily be precluded.\"  Porn v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196943\"><a href=\"/opinion/196943/porn-v-national-grange/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.1996).  Because neither MSL's antitrust claims nor its state-law claims survived summary disposition, we must make an informed prophecy as to what witnesses would have appeared and what proof would have emerged had the two cases been tried.  Here, the two suits' factual underpinnings are the same.  This unmistakable congruence strongly suggests that the same witnesses--largely ABA, AALS, and MSL personnel--and information--the evolution of the ABA accreditation procedures and the details of the MSL accreditation effort--would have been necessary to resolve both cases.  This substantial imbrication makes it apparent that the two cases would have formed a convenient trial unit and argues powerfully for claim preclusion.  See id. at 34;  see also King v. Union Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"155015\"><a href=\"/opinion/155015/king-v-union-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 445 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that reasonable expectations, objectively assayed, enter into the res judicata calculus, they augur here toward the same conclusion.  In the first place, since the two sets of claims arise in the same time frame out of similar facts, \"one would reasonably expect them to be brought together,\" Porn, 93 F.3d at 37.   In the second place, a party may be more readily presumed to expect that a court will treat multiple causes of action as a single trial unit when the plaintiff has all the facts necessary to bring the second claim at its disposal before or during the pendency of the first.  MSL does not identify any significant facts that were not within its ken before the antitrust action reached its climax.  We therefore conclude that the application of res judicata is an entirely predictable consequence of MSL's unilateral decision to split its claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, res judicata will not attach if the claim asserted in the second suit could not have been asserted in the first.  See In re Newport Harbor Assocs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362194\"><a href=\"/opinion/362194/bankr-l-rep-p-67014-in-the-matter-of-newport-harbor-associates-dba/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1978).  In an effort to avoid looming defeat, MSL tries to squeeze through this loophole by questioning whether it could have brought the instant claims in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  Insofar as this question relates to MSL's pursuit of the ABA and the AALS, it is easily answered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(a), a federal court that exercises federal question jurisdiction over a claim may also assert supplemental jurisdiction over all state-law claims that arise from the same operative facts.  See BIW Deceived, 132 F.3d at 833;  Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196161\"><a href=\"/opinion/196161/rodriguez-bruno-v-doral-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span>, 1175 (1st Cir.1995).  As we already have determined, the facts upon which MSL grounded its antitrust action concern MSL's efforts to receive ABA accreditation between 1992 and 1993.  This same trove of facts also provides the basis for MSL's state-law claims against the ABA and the AALS.  As a result, had MSL ventured to bring its current compendium of claims before the Pennsylvania federal district court as part and parcel of MSL I, that court could have entertained them in conjunction with the antitrust action then before it.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the fact that the Court has ceded the federal judiciary broad leeway to \"look to the common law or to the policies supporting res judicata ... in assessing the preclusive effect of decisions of other federal courts,\" Allen, 449 U.S. at 96, 101 S.Ct. at 415, MSL makes one last effort to undercut the district court's determination.  Res judicata cannot be applied against a plaintiff unless the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate all its claims in the original action.  See id. at 90, 101 S.Ct. at 412-13;  Kale, 924 F.2d at 1168.   Citing a series of adverse discovery rulings, MSL argues that it did not receive such an opportunity in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has not yet addressed the standard for determining the existence vel non of a full and fair opportunity in regard to a prior federal judgment.  The standard, however, is quite permissive as it pertains to prior state court judgments.  To meet this standard, a state court judgment need only \"satisfy the minimal procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\"  Kremer v. Chemical Constr.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110706\"><a href=\"/opinion/110706/kremer-v-chemical-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 481, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110706\"><a href=\"/opinion/110706/kremer-v-chemical-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span> (1982).  We do not envision a significantly less latitudinarian test for federal court judgments.  We hold, therefore, that as long as a prior federal court judgment is procured in a manner that satisfies due process concerns, the requisite \"full and fair opportunity\" existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, MSL points to its numerous failed efforts to obtain additional discovery in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and asseverates that draconian restrictions deprived it of an adequate chance to litigate its claims in MSL I. These allegations of discovery error are reheated for our consumption.  They previously were reviewed and rejected by the Third Circuit, see MSL I, 107 F.3d at 1033-34, and we see no reason to revisit that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, a full and fair opportunity to litigate cannot be equated with a license to do as a party pleases.  The adjudicative process operates pursuant to rules, and an opportunity to litigate is no less \"full\" or \"fair\" simply because the forum court enforces conventional limitations on pretrial discovery.  By any conceivable criterion, MSL had its full and fair opportunity to assert, in the Pennsylvania proceeding, the panoply of procedural and substantive rights guaranteed it by federal law.  Its first action therefore furnishes a proper predicate for the application of res judicata in its second action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, all roads lead to Rome.  MSL had an appropriate opportunity to litigate its first set of claims, and conveniently could have brought the second set as part of the same proceeding.  Its failure to do so dooms the instant action since MSL's two sets of allegations arise from a common nucleus of operative facts and fit together tongue and groove.  We conclude that, as a consequence of this road not taken, res judicata precludes MSL's state-law claims against the ABA and the AALS.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of these two institutional defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>VIII.

As MSL's complaint does not level a conspiracy charge against NESL, we limit our inquiry to the claims that MSL saw fit to plead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL's complaint asserts two causes of action against NESL:  tortious misrepresentation and violations of the Massachusetts statute governing unfair and deceptive trade practices (commonly known as Chapter 93A).  The complaint predicates these causes of action on an exchange of correspondence between NESL officials (specifically, James Lawton, the chair of NESL's board of trustees, and Ellen Wayne, NESL's placement director) and the ABA's consultant, James White.  We catalog these four pieces of correspondence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawton wrote to White on January 2, 1990, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Regents is former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas and he is for all intents and purposes the \"principal\" in the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover.  Mr. Tsongas has the solid support of the Boston Globe and the Board of Regents are under his complete control at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My guess is that any other, new or competing law schools, which may come into existence will not receive support from the Regents who are a rigidly controlled group of Dukakis loyalists who will only do what they are told by the present administration under Tsongas and [Governor] Dukakis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that year, Wayne informed White that Massachusetts authorities had authorized MSL to award J.D. degrees, and that its graduates henceforth could sit for the Massachusetts bar.  This missive, dated June 19, 1990, also mentioned that MSL had requested and received a table at a fair sponsored by the Northeast Association of Pre-Law Advisors (NAPLA).  Wayne reported that NAPLA's by-laws had compelled approval of MSL's request, but that the NAPLA board of directors would amend the by-laws to restrict participation in subsequent programs to \"ABA approved law school[s].\"  The complaint does not allege that NAPLA excluded MSL from any subsequent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eight days later, White wrote to Lawton and solicited his opinion as to the possibility of convincing the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) to amend its rules and require graduation from an ABA-accredited law school as a prerequisite to taking the Massachusetts bar examination.  Lawton's response, dated July 17, 1990, indicated his approbation and recommended that members of the bar petition for such an amendment.  The complaint does not allege that such a request was ever made or that the SJC revised its rules in the desired manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first letter from Lawton to White is plainly inaccurate insofar as it proclaims a Tsongas/MSL connection.  Senator Tsongas, who had ties to a different unaccredited law school, had none with MSL. MSL does not assert that the first letter contains any other inaccuracies and does not point to any misstatements in the remaining three epistles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this mise-en-scene, we turn to MSL's claim of tortious misrepresentation.  This strikes us as something of a misnomer (our canvass of Massachusetts case law does not reveal a single articulation of the elements of a particularized cause of action for tortious misrepresentation), but in all events, Massachusetts jurisprudence recognizes causes of action for both fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation.  See, e.g., Craig v. Everett M. Brooks Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008368/craig-v-everett-m-brooks-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008368/craig-v-everett-m-brooks-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 753 (1967) (fraudulent misrepresentation);  Nycal Corp. v. KPMG Peat Marwick, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1368</span></span>, 1371 (1998) (negligent misrepresentation).  MSL's complaint does not plead this claim with sufficient particularity to support a charge of fraud,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> see Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), and thus, we interpret the complaint as an attempt to articulate a claim for negligent misrepresentation.  The elements of such a cause of action are that the defendant falsely represented a past or existing material fact without any reasonable basis for thinking it to be true;  that he intended to euchre the plaintiff into relying on the representation;  that the plaintiff, unaware of the representation's falsity, justifiably relied on it;  and that the plaintiff suffered harm due to his reliance.  See 37 Am.Jur.2d, Fraud and Deceit &#167; 12 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim deserves short shrift.  To be sure, the comments about Senator Tsongas amount to a misrepresentation, but MSL does not plead that it relied on that misrepresentation to its detriment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and such reliance cannot plausibly be inferred from the complaint's other averments.  The general rule is that, without this necessary element, there can be no recovery for negligent misrepresentation under Massachusetts law.  See Romanoff v. Balcom, 4 Mass.App.Ct. 768, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></span>, 927 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an exception to this rule.  In the absence of detrimental reliance, a party still may be held liable under Massachusetts law for misrepresentation of information negligently supplied for the guidance of others.  See Fox v. F &amp; J Gattozzi Corp., 41 Mass.App.Ct. 581, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span>, 551 (1996) (stating that if a defendant \"in the course of his business ... supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,\" he \"is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to [third persons] by [the recipient's] justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information\") (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts &#167; 552(1) (1977)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSL's claim for tortious misrepresentation fails to qualify for this exception.  Even if we assume that Lawton's first letter to White occurred in the course of a \"business transaction\"--a fact that MSL does not allege--MSL pleads neither that it (or anyone else, for that matter) relied upon Lawton's faux pas nor that it suffered any harm as a result of the transmittal of the Tsongas-related (mis)information.  Hence, the district court did not err in granting NESL's motion to dismiss the tortious misrepresentation count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next engage MSL's Chapter 93A claim for \"unfair and deceptive acts.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 2.  By their nature, Chapter 93A claims tend to be case-specific.  Their general meter, however, is that the defendant's conduct must be not only wrong, but also egregiously wrong--and this standard calls for determinations of egregiousness well beyond what is required for most common law claims.  See Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1990558\"><a href=\"/opinion/1990558/whitinsville-plaza-inc-v-kotseas/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1990558\"><a href=\"/opinion/1990558/whitinsville-plaza-inc-v-kotseas/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, 251 (1979).

Its complaint attributes nothing to NESL beyond the latter's role in the exchange of correspondence described above.  MSL apparently means to asseverate that publication of the statements contained in the exchange of correspondence defamed or otherwise damaged it and thus transgressed Chapter 93A.  This asseveration cannot survive scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC recently has held that \"where allegedly defamatory statements do not support a cause of action for defamation, they also do not support a cause of action under [Chapter] 93A.\"  Dulgarian v.

Whether a statement is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning is a question of law for the court.  See Foley v. Lowell Sun Pub. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2132106\"><a href=\"/opinion/2132106/foley-v-lowell-sun-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2132106\"><a href=\"/opinion/2132106/foley-v-lowell-sun-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 197 (1989).  For a communication to qualify as defamatory, \"[t]he test is, whether, in the circumstances, the writing discredits the plaintiff in the minds of any considerable and respectable class in the community.\"  Smith v. Suburban Restaurants, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2015610\"><a href=\"/opinion/2015610/smith-v-suburban-restaurants-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2015610\"><a href=\"/opinion/2015610/smith-v-suburban-restaurants-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 217 (1978).  The core question, therefore, is not whether Lawton's demonstrated falsehood discredits somebody--it plainly denigrates the late senator--but whether it significantly discredits MSL. See New Eng.  Tractor-Trailer Training, Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146544/new-eng-tractor-trailer-training-v-globe-newspaper/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146544/new-eng-tractor-trailer-training-v-globe-newspaper/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1007 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our estimation, the misstatement contained in Lawton's January 2 letter does not sink to this level.  The senator enjoyed an enviable reputation as a public servant of the highest integrity.  MSL has failed utterly to suggest how any educational institution could be defamed by attributing to it a connection with him.  Absent such a link, no action lies.  See, e.g., Schwanbeck v. Federal-Mogul Corp., 31 Mass.App.Ct. 390, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2089045\"><a href=\"/opinion/2089045/schwanbeck-v-federal-mogul-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>, 804 (1991) (explaining that false statements must have adverse consequences for a plaintiff in order to be actionable under Chapter 93A).  Thus, the Tsongas-related comment, though untrue, is not defamatory of and concerning MSL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does MSL's complaint allege any other cognizable basis for Chapter 93A liability on NESL's part.  The four items of correspondence hint that NESL did not wish MSL well, but none of the matters which its representatives discussed with White suggest activities so scurrilous as to trigger liability under Chapter 93A.  Although we understand that a Chapter 93A violation need not rest on an independent common law tort, see Massachusetts Farm Bureau Fed'n, Inc. v. Blue Cross, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2030480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2030480/mass-farm-bureau-fedn-v-blue-cross-of-mass-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2030480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2030480/mass-farm-bureau-fedn-v-blue-cross-of-mass-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 664 (1989), the conduct must at least come within shouting distance of some established concept of unfairness.

Zayre Corp. v. Computer Sys. of Am., Inc., 24 Mass.App.Ct. 559, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062594\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062594/zayre-corp-v-computer-systems-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 30 n. 23 (1987).  Indeed, NESL's suspected (but unproven and unalleged) \"actions\"--e.g., asking NAPLA to amend its by-laws or petitioning the SJC to revise its rules--do not abridge any legal duty or bedrock concept of unfairness, and are not so \"unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous\" as to be actionable under Chapter 93A.  PMP Assocs., Inc. v.

What is more, MSL fails to allege how NESL's involvement in these activities actually caused any cognizable economic harm to it.  In itself, this is a fatal flaw.  See Zayre Corp., 511 N.E.2d at 30;  see also Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11 (explaining that, in a Chapter 93A claim, the complainant must show that she \"suffer[ed] a loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use ... of an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.

MSL's brief focuses mainly on the ABA and does not make any real attempt to construct a reasoned argument that would call into legitimate question the district court's rulings with regard to the Six Individual Defendants.  Of course, with a record appendix that boasts more than 6,500 pages, MSL has furnished a welter of paper, but it has not arrayed these plethoric evidentiary materials in any systematic way vis-a-vis these defendants.  Instead, MSL strives to bind together several mounds of proof, quasi-proof, and unsubstantiated allegations together with desultory rhetoric.  More is required to pass muster under Bongiorno and Zannino.   Accordingly, MSL has forfeited any objection to the lower court's entry of judgment in favor of the Six Individual Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>X.

The ABA and the Six Individual Defendants moved for dismissal on March 29, 1996.  The AALS filed a motion for summary judgment on the same date.  MSL opposed both motions and the court heard oral arguments on June 7. Three weeks later, while the district court still had the motions under advisement, MSL moved to defer their adjudication until it had obtained more discovery.  After conferring with all counsel, the district court denied the Rule 56(f) motion on August 28.  On September 26, 1996, the AALS filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment.  Four days later, the ABA and the Six Individual Defendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment.  MSL again filed oppositions, but did not renew its Rule 56(f) motion.  The district court granted the AALS's motion for brevis disposition on March 3, 1997, and granted the parallel motion brought on behalf of the ABA and the Six Individual Defendants on May 8, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, MSL ardently embraces Rule 56(f).

Moreover, the moving papers must contain a proffer which, at a bare minimum, articulates a plausible basis for the movant's belief that previously undisclosed or undocumented facts exist, that those facts can be secured by further discovery, and that, if obtained, there is some credible prospect that the new evidence will create a trialworthy issue.

It is firmly established that a Rule 56(f) motion must be made within a reasonable time following the receipt of a motion for summary judgment.  See Resolution Trust, 22 F.3d at 1204.   This means that a Rule 56(f) motion normally should precede or accompany the response to the summary judgment motion or follow as soon as practicable thereafter.  See Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 988.   Of course, there may be extenuating circumstances under which \"a party opposing a dispositive motion may not realize until the initial round of oral argument that he requires additional discovery time.\"  Id. But this is an outer limit, and a Rule 56(f) extension request made after the conclusion of oral argument on a summary judgment motion ordinarily comes too late.  See C.B. Trucking, Inc. v.

At the time it instituted this action, MSL had been at war with the ABA and the AALS for roughly two years.  It had received amplitudinous discovery in the antitrust case and knew--or should have known--immediately upon receipt of the defendants' dispositive motions whether it needed more information to oppose them.  There is no readily apparent reason why MSL procrastinated in deploying Rule 56(f), and MSL fails to offer any persuasive explanation for the delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we could affirm the district court's denial of Rule 56(f) relief on this basis alone, the ruling also rests on solid substantive grounds.  The plaintiff accompanied its motion with an affidavit, executed by Dean Velvel, that described the facts it hoped to unearth through further discovery.  By and large, these facts pertain to the existence and operation of the ostensible conspiracy between the ABA and the AALS.  But MSL did not suggest below, and does not suggest here, how these new materials would palliate the force of the ABA's and the AALS's res judicata defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That omission undermines MSL's position.  Whatever other issues originally may have lurked in the penumbra of the defendants' motions, the stark reality is that MSL's action founders because it could have raised its state-law claims in MSL I, but did not do so.  No additional discovery can alter that reality.  Thus, the short answer to MSL's protest about truncated discovery is that, as against the ABA and the AALS, the district court's refusal to grant a Rule 56(f) continuance was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantively speaking, there is yet another obstacle blocking MSL's path.  A party relying on Rule 56(f) must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing discovery.  See C.B. Trucking, 137 F.3d at 45;  Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726050\"><a href=\"/opinion/726050/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1398-35-fedrserv3d-395-miguel-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.1996).  The district court denied MSL's motion to remand on January 18, 1996.  Insofar as we can tell, MSL thereafter failed to take steps reasonably available to it to secure discovery.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District of Massachusetts operates under an \"automatic discovery\" paradigm.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1);  D. Mass.  Loc. R. 26.2 (1996).  The court's local rules provide that unless otherwise ordered by a judicial officer, a \"party must provide to other parties disclosure of the information and materials called for by [the automatic discovery rule]\" before that party can initiate further discovery.  D. Mass.  Loc. R. 26.2(A).  The record contains no evidence that MSL complied with its automatic discovery responsibilities, that it attempted to initiate any discovery, or that it sought permission from a judicial officer to do so.  What is more, Judge Lasker issued a scheduling order on February 28, 1996, in which he admonished all counsel that, if discovery could not be effectuated consensually, \"motions to compel discovery may be filed in accordance with the provisions of Local Rule 26.2(C).\"   MSL never filed any such motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Rule 56(f) is designed to \"minister[ ] to the vigilant, not to those who slumber upon perceptible rights.\"  Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 989 n. 5 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Given its lethargic approach to discovery, MSL cannot now be heard to complain about the district court's refusal to stay proceedings on the summary judgment motions.  See Mattoon, 980 F.2d at 8;  Hebert v. Wicklund, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"441974\"><a href=\"/opinion/441974/linda-l-hebert-v-cordelia-wicklund-dba-lake-farm/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this point, we have focused on the ABA and the AALS.  Nonetheless, the upshot is the same across the board.  With regard to the fourteen individual defendants, the affidavit that accompanied the Rule 56(f) motion mentions only one--Steven Smith--and only mentions him in the most inconsequential manner.  The affidavit does not refer to NESL.  Therefore, the record does not sustain a claim that discoverable materials actually existed that would have raised a trialworthy issue as to any of these fifteen defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

The ABA's financial straits are crucially important because ... the lawyers needed to defend serious lawsuits cost a small fortune.
