No\r\n\nresolution of the motion for reconsideration was issued, although\r\n\nthe  agency  and the  plaintiff  engaged  in negotiations.    The\r\n\nplaintiff  then filed  a  complaint  in  federal  court  alleging\r\n\nviolations of the Federal and State Constitutions and statutes in\r\n\nconnection with  the revocation of  his securities license.   The\r\n\ndistrict court granted  summary judgment to the defendants on the\r\n\ngrounds   that  the  claims   were  barred  by   the  statute  of\r\n\nlimitations.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment.\r\n\n                           Background1\r                                     Background\r                                               \r\n\n          The   plaintiff,  Jos    Rafael  Ben tez-Pons,   was  a\r\n\npracticing licensed securities broker  and licensed supervisor of\r\n\nother  securities  brokers.   In  April 1988,  he  co-founded and\r\n\nbecame   president  and  majority   owner  of  First  Continental\r\n\nCorporation  (FCC),  a  now  defunct  securities  brokerage firm.\r\n\nAfter suspecting improper  securities transactions by two  of the\r\n\nbrokers  at  FCC,  the  plaintiff filed  a  complaint  with OCFI.\r\n\nOCFI's investigation eventually included the plaintiff himself.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   The  facts recited herein  are either  not in dispute  or are\r\nalleged by the plaintiff.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          On January  27, 1992,  OCFI issued  a cease  and desist\r\n\norder to FCC, and ordered the plaintiff to show cause why further\r\n\naction should not be taken against him.  On January 30, 1992, the\r\n\nplaintiff entered into  a consent decree with OCFI.   The consent\r\n\ndecree provided, inter alia, that  the plaintiff was to cease all\r                                     \r\n\nsupervisory and  administrative functions  at FCC  for one  year,\r\n\nthat FCC  would  name another  person  to supervise  and  perform\r\n\nadministrative  functions  at  FCC, that  FCC  would  comply with\r\n\ncertain filing requirements, that the plaintiff and FCC would pay\r\n\ncertain fines,  and that the plaintiff  would supply a copy  of a\r\n\nresolution of the FCC Board of Directors ratifying such measures.\r\n\n          The plaintiff and FCC failed to comply with the consent\r\n\ndecree.   On March 13,  1992, Peter Smith and  other governmental\r\n\nemployees  or agents  of  OCFI  entered  FCC's  premises.    They\r\n\nconducted a warrantless search of the premises which included, in\r\n\npart,  downloading  computer  information  and  seizing  computer\r\n\nprograms  and disks,  accounting books,  a registry,  shareholder\r\n\ncontracts, and security boxes.  \r\n\n          On  March 19, 1992,  OCFI issued another  order against\r\n\nthe  plaintiff and  FCC  finding, inter  alia,  that the  consent\r                                                       \r\n\ndecree  had not  been complied  with and  that the  plaintiff had\r\n\nengaged in  other  misconduct.   In  the order,  OCFI  ultimately\r\n\nconcluded that  the situation  at FCC  placed  investors and  the\r\n\nsecurities  industry  in  Puerto  Rico  at risk.    It  summarily\r\n\nsuspended  the plaintiff's license, ordered him to show cause why\r\n\nfurther actions should not be taken against him, and informed him\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof his right  to seek an administrative hearing.2   The plaintiff\r\n\nexercised his right to an administrative hearing.\r\n\n          On  September 28, 1992,  the plaintiff was  afforded an\r\n\nadministrative hearing  on  the issue  of the  revocation of  his\r\n\nlicense.   There  is no  evidence that  the plaintiff  raised any\r\n\nsearch and seizure  claims, privacy claims, or  illegal detention\r\n\nclaims  during the administrative hearing.  On December 28, 1992,\r\n\nOCFI  issued a  resolution and  ordered  the plaintiff's  license\r\n\npermanently revoked.  On January  19, 1993, the plaintiff filed a\r\n\ntimely motion  for reconsideration  with OCFI.   This step  was a\r\n\nprocedural  prerequisite  to  seeking judicial  review.    In the\r\n\nplaintiff's motion  for reconsideration,  the plaintiff  asserted\r\n\nthat the proceedings had violated his constitutional rights.3 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   The record does not make clear  whether the plaintiff in fact\r\nheld multiple licenses,  or one license authorizing  both broking\r\nsecurities and supervising other securities brokers.   \r\n\n3   The motion for reconsideration asserted constitutional claims\r\nas follows:\r\n\n            The proceedings carried in this case led to\r\n          a violation  of the due process of law and of\r\n          the  constitutional and  civil rights  of the\r\n          Defendant.  This is so because all or some of\r\n          the  charges made to  the Defendant are  of a\r\n          penal   character  that   entail  fines,   as\r\n          expressed in the Order  and Resolution, which\r\n          clearly reveals that the burden of proof fell\r\n          on the Office of the Commissioner.\r\n\n            For   this  reason   the   Office  of   the\r\n          Commissioner  was  obliged   to  present  its\r\n          evidence first  and convince  the judge  that\r\n          the   Defendant  had   committed  tha   [sic]\r\n          violations   he  was   being  charged   with.\r\n          Nevertheless, despite  the opposition  of the\r\n          Defendant,  in this case  the burden of proof\r\n          was inverted and the Defendant was obliged to\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          OCFI responded to the  motion for reconsideration  with\r\n\nan  interlocutory  order  issued January  28,  1992,  pursuant to\r\n\nsection 3.15  of Puerto Rico's Uniform  Administrative Procedures\r\n\nAct (codified at 3 L.P.R.A.   2165).  See P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 3,\r                                                   \r\n\n  2165  (1994)  (hereinafter  section  2165).4   The  plaintiff's\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          prove  that he  is  innocent  of the  alleged\r\n          charges.   This is clearly a violation of the\r\n          rights  recognized  to  an  \"accused\" by  the\r\n          Constitution  of  the Commonwealth  of  P.R.,\r\n          which adulterates  with absolute  nullity the\r\n          whole proceeding and  converts the Order  and\r\n          Resolution into a  nullity.  Much more  so in\r\n          this case, by which the Defendant is deprived\r\n          of   his   right   to   his   agent   license\r\n          permanently.   The license already  issued or\r\n          granted  is an  acquired  right,  and  not  a\r\n          privilege as is erroneously  indicated in the\r\n          Resolution and Order.  (See Article 402(d) of\r\n          the Securities Law about the burden of proof,\r\n          which clearly shows that  the burden of proof\r\n          fell  in this  case  on  the  Office  of  the\r\n          Commissioner.)\r\n            . . . .\r\n            . . .  Due  process  of  law  has not  been\r\n          followed  in the  proceedings  carried on  to\r\n          deprive him permanently of his agent license,\r\n          which is an  acquired right and not  merely a\r\n          privilege.\r\n\n4  Section 2165 was amended  in 1994.  See Uniform Administrative\r                                                    \r\nProcedures Act --  Judicature Act of 1994, 1995  Puerto Rico Laws\r\nAct No. 247 (H.B. No. 1684)   4.   The amendments do not directly\r\naffect our analysis as they are not applicable to the plaintiffs'\r\ncase.  All references to section 2165 are therefore references to\r\nsection 2165 as  it existed prior to the Judicature  Act of 1994,\r\nunless otherwise noted. \r\n\nSection 2165 provided that:\r\n\n            The   party   adversely   affected   by   a\r\n          resolution  or  partial or  final  order may,\r\n          within  twenty (20) days of the filing of the\r\n          resolution  or  order,  present a  motion  to\r\n          reconsider  the  resolution  or  order.

OCFI  never   issued  a   decision  by   the\r\n\nCommissioner  on the motion for reconsideration within the ninety\r\n\nday period as required by section 2165.  \r\n\n          Following  OCFI's interlocutory  order  of January  28,\r\n\n1993, attorneys for OCFI and the plaintiff  met to try to resolve\r\n\nthe issue.  The plaintiff asserts that during the months of March\r\n\nand April  1993, letters  and telephone calls  were exchanged  to\r\n\nthis end.   The record  indicates that the  plaintiff's attorneys\r\n\nsent  OCFI settlement  proposals which  were evidently  rejected.\r\n\nThe plaintiff's intention  in the negotiations was  to relinquish\r\n\nhis  constitutional claims in  exchange for reinstatement  of his\r\n\nlicense.   The plaintiff  asserts that representations  were made\r\n\nthat the statute of limitations  was tolled, although there is no\r\n\nevidence  in the record that substantiates this allegation beyond\r\n\nthe interlocutory order.   During these interactions,  OCFI never\r\n\nindicated   that  it   was  not   considering   the  motion   for\r\n\nreconsideration.   In September  1993, the  Commissioner and  the\r\n\nplaintiff accidentally met, and in  response to an inquiry by the\r\n\nplaintiff, the Commissioner  indicated that he would  \"follow up\"\r\n\non the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.  In June 1994, the\r\n\nattorney for  the  plaintiff  filed a  motion  to  \"resign\"  from\r\n\nrepresenting him.  OCFI never responded to the motion.\r\n\n          In March and  April 1995, the plaintiff  contacted OCFI\r\n\nto inquire about the status of his case and request a copy of the\r\n\nexaminer's findings.  The plaintiff was told that no one  at OCFI\r\n\nhad any knowledge  regarding his case, and that no one could help\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nhim with his inquiry.   \r\n\n          On May 2, 1995, the  plaintiff filed a complaint in the\r\n\nfederal  district court of  Puerto Rico against  the defendants.5\r\n\nThe plaintiff sought  declaratory relief, injunctive relief,  and\r\n\ndamages pursuant  to 42  U.S.C.    1983 and  1988, and  28 U.S.C.\r\n\n  2201.  The plaintiff asserted that  the defendants violated his\r\n\nright to  be free  from unreasonable searches  and seizures,  his\r\n\nright to  be free from  illegal detention, his right  to privacy,\r\n\nhis property interest in his license, his liberty interest in his\r\n\ncareer, and  his liberty  interest in his  right to  contract for\r\n\nemployment.   He  also  asserted  claims under  the  Puerto  Rico\r\n\nConstitution, Article  II, sections  7, 8,  and 10, and  Articles\r\n\n1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.  \r\n\n          On  July 31,  1995, the  defendants filed a  motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment.  The  defendants argued that the  complaint was\r\n\nnot filed within one year of the constitutional deprivations, and\r\n\nwas therefore time  barred.  Furthermore, they  asserted that the\r\n\nplaintiff failed  to toll the statute of  limitations because (1)\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   Defendants are  the Office of  the Commissioner  of Financial\r\nInstitutions  of the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico;  Jos   Sosa\r\nLlor ns, in his  official and personal capacity, and his conjugal\r\npartnership;  Asdr bal  Aponte,  in  his  official  and  personal\r\ncapacity,  and  his  conjugal partnership;  Peter  Smith,  in his\r\nofficial and  personal  capacity, and  his conjugal  partnership;\r\nRafael Rosario,  in his official  and personal capacity,  and his\r\nconjugal  partnership; John  Doe, in  his  official and  personal\r\ncapacity,  and  his  conjugal partnership;  Richard  Doe,  in his\r\nofficial and personal capacity, and his conjugal partnership; and\r\nVirgilio Vega,  in his  official and personal  capacity, and  his\r\nconjugal partnership.   In light  of our conclusion, we  need not\r\ndistinguish between the defendants in addressing  the plaintiff's\r\nclaims and arguments. \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthe  plaintiff failed  to  satisfy  the  applicable  Puerto  Rico\r\n\ntolling statute, which requires that there be identity  of relief\r\n\nrequested,  and (2) equitable tolling was unavailable because the\r\n\nplaintiff could establish  neither excusable  ignorance nor  that\r\n\nthe defendant  actively misled  or prevented  the plaintiff  from\r\n\nasserting his rights.  Finally, the defendants argued that OCFI's\r\n\ndetermination was final  and unappealable because the  statute of\r\n\nlimitations had expired.\r\n\n          The district  court granted the defendants'  motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment.   The  court first determined  that a  one year\r\n\nstatute of  limitations controlled  the plaintiff's  claims.   It\r\n\nthen  determined  that  the last  alleged  violation  occurred on\r\n\nSeptember 28, 1992.   The complaint therefore had to  be filed by\r\n\nSeptember 29,  1993.   The court agreed  with the  defendants and\r\n\nfound  that  the  plaintiff   had  not  tolled  the   statute  of\r\n\nlimitations on either  of two bases: (1) the  plaintiff failed to\r\n\nseek the same remedies in the district court as it had before the\r\n\nagency, and  therefore failed to satisfy the  requirements of the\r\n\nPuerto  Rico statute  governing  the tolling  of  the statute  of\r\n\nlimitations through  extrajudicial claims, and  (2) the plaintiff\r\n\nfailed to establish that the statute of limitations was equitably\r\n\ntolled.    The  court  implicitly found  that  the  plaintiff was\r\n\nneither  excusably ignorant  of the  statute  of limitations  nor\r\n\nactively  misled  by  OCFI.     The  court  concluded   that  the\r\n\nadministrative order was final and unappealable.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff argues  on appeal  that  the ninety  day\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nreview period  under section 2165 is  waivable and was  tolled by\r\n\nOCFI.    The  plaintiff  also  asserts  that  the defendants  are\r\n\nequitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a\r\n\ndefense  in  this  case.   Finally,  the  plaintiff  asserts that\r\n\nsummary judgment  is  generally inapplicable  in actions  raising\r\n\nequitable  tolling or estoppel arguments, and that genuine issues\r\n\nof  material fact  in this  case precluded  the grant  of summary\r\n\njudgment.6  \r\n\n          We review motions  for summary judgment  de novo.

See, e.g., Torres v.  Superintendent of\r                                                                           \r\n\nPolice, 893  F.2d 404, 407 (1st Cir. 1990).

For the\r                                            \r\n\nreasons enumerated  below, we find  the plaintiff's claims  to be\r\n\nbarred by the statute of limitations.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n    I.  Fourth Amendment, Illegal Detention and Privacy Claims\r              I.  Fourth Amendment, Illegal Detention and Privacy Claims\r                                                                        \r\n\n          The  plaintiff alleges that he was subjected to illegal\r\n\nsearches  and seizures, illegal detentions, and violations of his\r\n\nright to privacy between March 13, 1992, and March 19, 1992.  The\r\n\nplaintiff had  until March 1993  to file his  complaint asserting\r\n\nthese  causes  of  action,  unless  he   tolled  the  statute  of\r\n\nlimitations.   As indicated above, the plaintiff waited until May\r\n\n1995 to file his federal complaint asserting these claims.  There\r\n\nis  no evidence  in the  record that  the plaintiff  raised these\r\n\nclaims  during the  administrative hearing.   He  did not  assert\r\n\nthese  claims in his motion for  reconsideration filed with OCFI.\r\n\nNor is  there evidence in  the record that these  specific claims\r\n\nwere  asserted during the  negotiations that transpired  in March\r\n\nand April 1993.7   In fact, from  the record it appears  that the\r\n\nplaintiff  raised these  specific constitutional  claims  for the\r\n\nfirst time when  he filed his federal complaint.   Therefore, the\r\n\ndistrict  court   properly  concluded  that  these   claims  were\r\n\nuntimely, and  that the plaintiff  had not tolled the  statute of\r\n\nlimitations under the Puerto Rico tolling statute.\r\n\n            II.  Federal and State Due Process Claims\r                      II.  Federal and State Due Process Claims\r                                                               \r\n\n          The plaintiff  asserts that  his  property and  liberty\r\n\ninterests  were violated when  he was  allegedly deprived  of his\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   In  his sworn  statement and  in his  statement of  contested\r\nfacts,   the  plaintiff   stated  that   he   \"asserted  in   the\r\nadministrative   proceedings   that   Defendants   violated   his\r\nconstitutional and  civil rights  complained of\"  in the  federal\r\ncomplaint.   This general statement  is supported by  evidence in\r\nthe record, but only as to the due process claims.  \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nlicense without due  process.  We assume arguendo  that his claim\r                                                           \r\n\naccrued at the latest possible date, December 28th, 1992, the day\r\n\nthe  plaintiff's  license  was   permanently  revoked,  allegedly\r\n\nwithout  due process.   Because  the plaintiff  did not  file his\r\n\ncomplaint in  federal court until  May 2, 1995, these  claims are\r\n\nalso time barred by the statute of limitations unless the statute\r\n\nwas tolled under Puerto Rico law.  Unlike the search and seizure,\r\n\nillegal  detention,  and  privacy  claims  discussed  above,  the\r\n\nplaintiff  asserted  in  his   motion  for  reconsideration,  and\r\n\nallegedly  in his negotiations with OCFI, that the administrative\r\n\nproceedings  failed to afford him due  process.  In his motion he\r\n\nargued that his license was a right and not a privilege, and that\r\n\nhe  was not  accorded due  process of  law in  the administrative\r\n\nproceedings because  the  burden  of  proof  was  inappropriately\r\n\nshifted to him.  The plaintiff's argument can, if read liberally,\r\n\nbe understood  to assert that  the plaintiff was deprived  of his\r\n\nproperty  and liberty  interests  without  due  process  of  law.\r\n\nHowever, despite the plaintiff's assertion of these claims in the\r\n\nadministrative proceeding, they  are not preserved by  the Puerto\r\n\nRico tolling statute.\r\n\n          As we held in  Torres, if a party seeks a  remedy in an\r                                         \r\n\nextrajudicial  claim  that  is different  from  the  remedy later\r\n\nsought in  a judicial proceeding,  the statute of  limitations is\r\n\nnot tolled.   In Torres, the plaintiffs had  been discharged from\r                                 \r\n\ntheir positions  as police officers.  See 893  F.2d at 406.  They\r                                                   \r\n\nfiled  an administrative action within the statute of limitations\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nseeking reinstatement.  After  their administrative claim  proved\r\n\nunsuccessful,  they filed  a   1983  action  in federal  district\r\n\ncourt  seeking  damages,  reinstatement,  and  the  expunging  of\r\n\nphotographs and  fingerprints  filed with  the police.   By  this\r\n\ntime, the  statute of  limitations for  their  federal claim  had\r\n\nexpired.\r\n\n          In Torres, we found that because the remedies sought by\r                             \r\n\nthe  plaintiffs in the  district court were not  the same as they\r\n\nwere in the  administrative proceeding, there  was no tolling  of\r\n\nthe  statute of limitations  by their extrajudicial  assertion in\r\n\nthe  administrative action.  In concluding  that the   1983 claim\r\n\nwas time barred, we stated in Torres: \r                                              \r\n\n          [T]he district court  correctly held that the\r\n          extrajudicial  claim  must   claim  the  same\r\n          relief later  requested in the  federal suit.\r\n          The statute  of limitations for  Section 1983\r\n          claim  [sic] is  not  tolled  if  the  remedy\r\n          requested in  both suits  is different. . . .\r\n          The  record  supports  the  district  court's\r\n          finding  that  the  plaintiff  requested  two\r\n          distinct  remedies. . . .   Given that  these\r\n          remedies  were not  identical,  there was  no\r\n          tolling and  the prescription  period expired\r\n          . . . .\r\n\nId. at 407.  The case at  hand presents similar facts.  Here, the\r             \r\n\nplaintiff    asserted    constitutional   claims    before    the\r\n\nadministrative  agency,  which   could  have  functioned  as   an\r\n\nextrajudicial claim under Puerto Rico law, tolling the statute of\r\n\nlimitations.   However,  the plaintiff  failed to  seek the  same\r\n\nremedies  in  the  district  court   as  he  had  sought  in  the\r\n\nadministrative proceedings.  In the administrative proceedings he\r\n\nsought  only  the  reinstatement  of his  license,  while  in the\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ndistrict court he sought declaratory and monetary relief, as well\r\n\nas the reinstatement of his license.8\r\n\n               III.  Equitable Estoppel and Tolling\r                         III.  Equitable Estoppel and Tolling\r                                                             \r\n\n          The  plaintiff  also  argues  that the  defendants  are\r\n\nequitably  estopped  from  raising the  time  bar  defense.   The\r\n\nplaintiff's argument muddles the doctrines of equitable  estoppel\r\n\nand equitable tolling.  Because the plaintiff asserts elements of\r\n\nboth doctrines,  we will  analyze the  equitable arguments  under\r\n\nboth estoppel and tolling theories.\r\n\n          The first issue to be determined in analyzing equitable\r\n\ntolling is  its applicability to  the case  at hand.   In  Torres\r                                                                           \r\n\nRam rez  v. Berm dez Garc a, we  noted without resolution that it\r                                     \r\n\nwas   unclear  whether   the   federal  doctrine   of  fraudulent\r\n\nconcealment  (equitable  tolling) continues  to  apply to    1983\r\n\nactions,  or  whether state  law governs  the issue  of equitable\r\n\ntolling.   See Torres Ram rez  v. Berm dez Garc a, 898  F.2d 224,\r                                                           \r\n\n229 &amp; n.2 (1st Cir. 1990).  We need not decide the issue here, as\r\n\nwe find that under  either the federal or the state doctrine, the\r\n\nplaintiff has failed to establish that the statute of limitations\r\n\nshould be equitably tolled.  \r\n\n          We have  previously addressed  equitable tolling  under\r\n\nPuerto  Rico law in   1983 cases.   \"Puerto Rico law provides for\r\n\nequitable tolling in a  case of 'damage willfully and  wrongfully\r\n\n(dolosamente) concealed by  the author  of the  same.'\"   Ram rez\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  For the same  reasons, the plaintiff's claims asserting Puerto\r\nRico causes of action are time barred. \r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nMorales  v.

Equitable  tolling is  unavailable where  a\r\n\nparty fails to exercise reasonable diligence.  Moreover, \"[i]t is\r\n\naxiomatic that 'the  grounds for tolling statutes  of limitations\r\n\nare  more limited  in  suits  against  the  government  . . . .'\"\r\n\nKelley  v.

See Ram rez Morales, 815 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n4 (finding equitable  tolling inappropriate in   1983  case under\r\n\neither federal or Puerto Rico doctrines  where defendants did not\r\n\nprevent  or  discourage  plaintiff  from viewing  agency  records\r\n\nregarding  unlawful police shooting, and there was no concealment\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nof material facts) overruled on other grounds by Carreras-Rosa v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAlves-Cruz, 127 F.3d 172 (1st Cir. 1997).  Instead, the plaintiff\r                    \r\n\nargues  that equitable tolling is appropriate because OCFI misled\r\n\nhim regarding the tolling of the statute of limitations under the\r\n\nPuerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.  \r\n\n          The facts and  arguments in  this case  are similar  to\r\n\nthose presented by Kelley.  See 79 F.3d at 1242-43, 1247-50.   In\r                                         \r\n\nKelley, the  plaintiff failed to  serve process on  the defendant\r                \r\n\nwithin  the time  period  mandated  by a  federal  statute.   The\r\n\nplaintiff  relied  on  a National  Labor  Relations  Board (NLRB)\r\n\nemployee  who informed  the plaintiff's  attorney  that the  NLRB\r\n\nwould serve  the defendant and  that the plaintiff should  not do\r\n\nso.  The employee neglected  to inform the plaintiff, however, of\r\n\nan NLRB regulation  stating that the ultimate  responsibility for\r\n\nserving notice  was on  the charging party.   The service  by the\r\n\nNLRB was  one day late.   In rejecting the  plaintiff's equitable\r\n\ntolling   argument,  we   held  that   although  the   employee's\r\n\ninformation was \"incomplete and perhaps misleading,\" the delay in\r\n\nservice could not \"be wholly  attributed to an error on the  part\r\n\nof the [NLRB].\"  See Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1249.   We found that the\r                                     \r\n\nplaintiff  had  constructive  notice of  the  regulation  and its\r\n\nrequirements because the plaintiff was represented by counsel for\r\n\na long  duration, and counsel had access to the regulations.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at 1249  (\"Courts generally impute constructive  knowledge to\r             \r\n\nplaintiffs  who, like appellant, consult with an attorney.\").  We\r\n\nalso determined that it was plain that the attorney's reliance on\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nthe  employee's representations  was unreasonable.    See id.  at\r                                                                       \r\n\n1249. The  information \"almost by  definition, is  not nearly  as\r\n\nreliable as simply looking up the text  of a regulation.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1250.   \r\n\n          Here, the interlocutory order issued by  OCFI indicated\r\n\nthat the statute of limitations was tolled until a copy of OCFI's\r\n\nresolution addressing the  motion for reconsideration  was \"filed\r\n\nand notified.\"   In this  regard it was incomplete  and therefore\r\n\ninaccurate.   However, the  order  expressly stated  that it  was\r\n\nissued  pursuant  to section  3.15  of  the Puerto  Rico  Uniform\r\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act,  which clarifies  the ambiguity  of\r\n\nthe interlocutory  order.   Pursuant to  section 3.15, \"[i]f  the\r\n\nagency  fails to take  action on  the motion  for reconsideration\r\n\nwithin the ninety  (90) days of the filing of the motion it shall\r\n\nlose jurisdiction over the same and the term in which to petition\r\n\nfor  judicial review shall  commence upon the  expiration of said\r\n\nninety  (90) day  term unless  the court,  for good  cause shown,\r\n\ngrants the agency an extension of time.\"   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3,\r\n\n  2165 (1994).  In short, the statute was tolled either until the\r\n\nOCFI's  resolution of  the motion  was issued  or until  the time\r\n\nperiod in which to issue the resolution expired. \r\n\n          The plaintiff had  notice of the statute  governing the\r\n\ntime limitations but relied on the agency's summation of the law.\r\n\n\"The general rule is that 'those who deal with the Government are\r\n\nexpected to  know the  law and  may not  rely on  the conduct  of\r\n\nGovernment agents  contrary to  law.'\"  Kelley,  79 F.3d  at 1249\r                                                        \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n(quoting  Heckler v.  Community Health  Servs., 467  U.S. 51,  63\r                                                        \r\n\n(1984)).  Moreover, the plaintiff had constructive notice  of the\r\n\nfiling  requirement; he was represented by counsel throughout his\r\n\ndealings with OCFI;  and he had access to the Puerto Rico Uniform\r\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act.  See Kelley, 79  F.3d at 1249.  Nor\r                                                   \r\n\ncan  we say  that  the  plaintiff was  diligent  in pursuing  his\r\n\nrights.   Between June 21, 1993, and  March 1995, the only action\r\n\nthe plaintiff  took to pursue  his rights was when  he approached\r\n\nthe  Commissioner at an unidentified meeting and the Commissioner\r\n\nindicated he would \"follow up\"  on the plaintiff's petition.  The\r\n\nplaintiff's  counsel acknowledged in oral argument that even this\r\n\nmeeting  was entirely  accidental.   The  plaintiff initiated  no\r\n\nother contact with the agency  to resolve his dispute  throughout\r\n\nthis  period.     Given  the  fact  that  the   plaintiff  was  a\r\n\nsophisticated businessman  represented by  counsel, and that  the\r\n\nplaintiff was directed to the specific section of the Puerto Rico\r\n\nUniform  Administrative  Procedure  Act that  governed  the  time\r\n\nlimitations for his  motion, we cannot  say that the  plaintiff's\r\n\nfailure to  ascertain the timeliness  of his cause of  action was\r\n\nreasonable.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff has referred to the OCFI Regulation Rule\r\n\n19, see Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico, Office of the  Commissioner\r                 \r\n\nof Financial Institutions, Regulation # 3920, Rule 19 (1989), and\r\n\nRule 3.16  of the  Puerto Rico  Uniform Administrative  Procedure\r\n\nAct,  see P.R.  Laws Ann. tit.  3,   2166  (1994), both  of which\r                   \r\n\nrequire that  notice be  sent when  an adjudicative  procedure is\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nterminated.   However,  the  plaintiff has  also  cited the  OCFI\r\n\nRegulation Rule 18.1, see Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,  Office of\r                                   \r\n\nthe Commissioner  of Financial  Institutions, Regulation  # 3920,\r\n\nRule  18.1 (1989),  and  Rule  3.15 of  the  Puerto Rico  Uniform\r\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act, see  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3,    2165\r                                           \r\n\n(1994), which provide that OCFI's  failure to decide a motion for\r\n\nreconsideration  within a  designated time period  either renders\r\n\nthe motion and case dismissed by the agency, or strips the agency\r\n\nof its  jurisdiction over  the case.    In such  a situation,  we\r\n\ncannot agree that  the plaintiff's reliance on  selected portions\r\n\nof  the regulations (i.e. OCFI's failure  to notify the plaintiff\r\n\nas to  the termination of his  case) and his  disregard for other\r\n\nportions  of  the   regulations  that  indicated  his   case  was\r\n\ndismissed, was  reasonable.   The regulations must  be read  as a\r\n\nwhole, and cannot be read selectively.  See O'Connell v. Shalala,\r                                                                          \r\n\n79 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[A] court engaged in  the task\r\n\nof statutory interpretation must examine  the statute as a whole,\r\n\ngiving due weight to design, structure, and purpose as well as to\r\n\naggregate language.\").  Furthermore, the plaintiff's ignorance of\r\n\nthe  time limitations was  unreasonable particularly in  light of\r\n\nthe fact that these tolling provisions are uniform for all of the\r\n\nPuerto Rico agencies.  Because lack of prejudice alone  is not an\r\n\nadequate  basis for invoking equitable tolling, and the plaintiff\r\n\nhas not met  the other requirements of the doctrine,  we find the\r\n\nequitable tolling  doctrine to  be inapplicable  on these  facts.\r\n\nSee Kelley, 79  F.3d at 1250.  The plaintiff fails in his attempt\r                    \r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nto  distinguish this  case from  Kelley on  the grounds  that the\r                                                 \r\n\nCommissioner  issued  the  interlocutory  order.    Reliance  was\r\n\nunreasonable  in  light of  the  order's clear  reference  to the\r\n\nstatute under  which  it was  authorized, the  uniformity of  the\r\n\nprovisions for  all Puerto Rico  agencies, and the notice  in the\r\n\nregulations and statute indicating the pending time  limitations,\r\n\namong other factors. \r\n\n          Equitable estoppel has  a similar origin and  effect as\r\n\nequitable tolling, although it is a distinct doctrine.  See Kale,\r                                                                          \r\n\n861  F.2d at  752.   Equitable  estoppel is  available in    1983\r\n\nactions.  See Smith v. City of Chicago Heights, 951 F.2d 834, 839\r                                                        \r\n\n(7th  Cir. 1992).   Even when  a federal court  borrows a state's\r\n\nstatute  of  limitations,  the  court  applies  federal equitable\r\n\nestoppel principles.   See  id. at  841.   \"(1) The  party to  be\r                                         \r\n\nestopped must know the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct\r\n\nshall  be acted on  or must so  act that the  party asserting the\r\n\nestoppel has a right to believe it is so intended; (3) the latter\r\n\nmust be  ignorant of the true facts; and  (4) he must rely on the\r\n\nformer's conduct to his injury.\"  Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660,\r                                                            \r\n\n661  (1st Cir. 1987).  The \"reliance must have been reasonable in\r\n\nthat the party  claiming the estoppel did not know  nor should it\r\n\nhave  known  that  its   adversary's  conduct  was   misleading.\"\r\n\nHeckler, 467 U.S. at 59.   \"'If, at the time when he acted,  such\r                 \r\n\nparty  had  knowledge  of the  truth,  or  . . . with  reasonable\r\n\ndiligence he could acquire the knowledge . . . he cannot claim to\r\n\nhave  been  misled  by  relying  upon  the  misrepresentation  or\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nconcealment.'\"  Id.

Indeed, \"the conduct of the\r\n\ndefendant  must  be so  misleading  as to  cause  the plaintiff's\r\n\nfailure to file suit.\"  S nchez v. Loffland Bros., 626 F.2d 1228,\r                                                           \r\n\n1231 (5th Cir. 1980) (footnote omitted).\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n          The  flaw  in  the plaintiff's  argument,  as discussed\r\n\nabove, is that the plaintiff's  reliance was not reasonable.  The\r\n\ninterlocutory  order explicitly  cited  the  statute pursuant  to\r\n\nwhich  it was  issued.   The statute  in turn indicated  the time\r\n\nperiod after  which OCFI lost jurisdiction.  The OCFI regulations\r\n\nalso  indicated  that  the motion  for  reconsideration  would be\r\n\nconsidered  \"WITHOUT   CAUSE/CASE  DISMISSED\"  without   an  OCFI\r\n\nresolution in 30  days.  See Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico, Office\r                                      \r\n\nof the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, Regulation # 3920,\r\n\nRule  18.1  (1989).   In  the  face  of  a conflict  between  the\r\n\ninterlocutory order and the statute it expressly referred to, and\r\n\nanother  conflict between regulations that indicated the case was\r\n\ndismissed but  that also indicated  notice would be given  in the\r\n\nevent of  termination, it was  unreasonable for the  plaintiff to\r\n\nchoose  to rely  upon the  interlocutory  order.   In this  case,\r\n\nOCFI's conduct was not so  misleading as to cause the plaintiff's\r\n\nfailure  to  file  on  time   without  the  plaintiff's  lack  of\r\n\ndiligence.   Nor  are  the  plaintiff's  negotiations  with  OCFI\r\n\nadequate to equitably toll the statute of limitations.  See Bomba\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  W.L. Belvidere,  Inc., 579  F.2d 1067,  1071 (7th  Cir. 1978)\r                                   \r\n\n(\"[I]t  is  widely  held  that  mere  negotiations  concerning  a\r\n\ndisputed  claim, without more,  is [sic] insufficient  to warrant\r\n\nthe application of equitable estoppel . . . .\").  The plaintiff's\r\n\nequitable estoppel argument must therefore fail.\r\n\n          The plaintiff also argues that the Commissioner had the\r\n\nauthority to waive  the time periods at issue, and because he did\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nin  fact waive  them, the  statute of  limitations was  tolled by\r\n\nOCFI.    At the  time  of  this  case,  the Commissioner  had  no\r\n\nauthority to waive the time periods of section 2165.  \r\n\n          The plaintiff's reference to language  in sections 2163\r\n\nand  2164 is  without  merit.9   Section  2163  provides that  an\r\n\nadjudicatory procedure before an agency shall  be resolved in six\r\n\nmonths, absent  exceptional circumstances.   See  P.R. Laws  Ann.\r                                                          \r\n\ntit. 3,   2163 (1994).  Section 2164 provides  that a final order\r\n\nor  resolution shall  be  issued  within  ninety days  after  the\r\n\nconclusion of a hearing, unless waived in writing by the parties,\r\n\nor for just cause.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3,   2164 (1994).    \r                                 \r\n\n          The  Uniform Administrative Procedure  Act is,  for the\r\n\nmost part, arranged chronologically.   Section 2163 deals in  its\r\n\nentirety with the procedure of  the actual hearing.  Section 2164\r\n\naddresses  only issues pertaining to final orders or resolutions,\r\n\nincluding their timing,  content, or notice.  It  is not relevant\r\n\nto  motions for  reconsideration.    In  contrast,  section  2165\r\n\ngoverns  reconsideration and the applicable timing issues in this\r\n\ncase.  Section   2165  provides   that  an   agency  shall   lose\r\n\njurisdiction if  it  fails  to  take action  within  ninety  days\r\n\n\"unless the  court, for  good cause shown,  grants the  agency an\r\n\nextension of time.\"  The  agency therefore lacks the authority to\r\n\nwaive this requirement.   The requirement is not  affected by the\r\n\ndiscretion afforded the agency in other sections, nor by reliance\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9  We also reject plaintiff's arguments premised on public policy\r\nfavoring economical, fair,  and rapid proceedings, and  on OCFI's\r\nconduct.\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\non OCFI's representations  or conduct by the plaintiff.   We find\r\n\nthe  statute to  be unambiguous  and decline  to read  into it  a\r\n\nmeaning   that  directly  conflicts   with  the  intent   of  the\r\n\nlegislature.10   See Pag n  Ramos v.

OCFI's administrative order is therefore final, and as\r\n\ntimely review was not sought, unappealable.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff finally argues  that summary judgment is\r\n\ninappropriate in this case because it involves equitable estoppel\r\n\nor  equitable  tolling  issues, and  because  there  were genuine\r\n\nissues of material fact unresolved.   The mere fact that a  party\r\n\nasserts  such  equitable  claims does  not  foreclose  granting a\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment.  See, e.g., Bell v.

No resolution of the motion for reconsideration was issued, although the agency and the plaintiff engaged in negotiations.  The plaintiff then filed a complaint in federal court alleging violations of the Federal and State Constitutions and statutes in connection with the revocation of his securities license.  The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the grounds that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff, Jose Rafael Bentez-Pons, was a practicing licensed securities broker and licensed supervisor of other securities brokers.  In April 1988, he co-founded and became president and majority owner of First Continental Corporation (FCC), a now defunct securities brokerage firm.  After suspecting improper securities transactions by two of the brokers at FCC, the plaintiff filed a complaint with OCFI.  OCFI's investigation eventually included the plaintiff himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 1992, OCFI issued a cease and desist order to FCC, and ordered the plaintiff to show cause why further action should not be taken against him.  On January 30, 1992, the plaintiff entered into a consent decree with OCFI.  The consent decree provided, inter alia, that the plaintiff was to cease all supervisory and administrative functions at FCC for one year, that FCC would name another person to supervise and perform administrative functions at FCC, that FCC would comply with certain filing requirements, that the plaintiff and FCC would pay certain fines, and that the plaintiff would supply a copy of a resolution of the FCC Board of Directors ratifying such measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff and FCC failed to comply with the consent decree.  On March 13, 1992, Peter Smith and other governmental employees or agents of OCFI entered FCC's premises. They conducted a warrantless search of the premises which included, in part, downloading computer information and seizing computer programs and disks, accounting books, a registry, shareholder contracts, and security boxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 19, 1992, OCFI issued another order against the plaintiff and FCC finding, inter alia, that the consent decree had not been complied with and that the plaintiff had engaged in other misconduct.  In the order, OCFI ultimately concluded that the situation at FCC placed investors and the securities industry in Puerto Rico at risk.  It summarily suspended the plaintiff's license, ordered him to show cause why further actions should not be taken against him, and informed him of his right to seek an administrative hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The plaintiff exercised his right to an administrative hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28, 1992, the plaintiff was afforded an administrative hearing on the issue of the revocation of his license.  There is no evidence that the plaintiff raised any search and seizure claims, privacy claims, or illegal detention claims during the administrative hearing.  On December 28, 1992, OCFI issued a resolution and ordered the plaintiff's license permanently revoked.  On January 19, 1993, the plaintiff filed a timely motion for reconsideration with OCFI.  This step was a procedural prerequisite to seeking judicial review.  In the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, the plaintiff asserted that the proceedings had violated his constitutional rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OCFI responded to the motion for reconsideration with an interlocutory order issued January 28, 1992, pursuant to section 3.15 of Puerto Rico's Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (codified at 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 2165).  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2165 (1994) (hereinafter section 2165).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The plaintiff's translation of OCFI's interlocutory order states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That upon review of the Motion for Reconsideration of January 19, 1993, filed by the Respondant [sic], the Commissioner orders that it be considered and resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to section 3.15 of Law Number 170 of August 12, 1988 (Uniforme [sic] Administrative Procedures Act) supra, the thirty (30) day period in which to seek review is tolled and will begin to run again from the date in which a copy of the Resolution resolving the Motion for Reconsideration is filed and notified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Docket and Notify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In San Juan, Puerto Rico, on January 28, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 10, 1993, OCFI filed its opposition to the motion for reconsideration.  OCFI never issued a decision by the Commissioner on the motion for reconsideration within the ninety day period as required by section 2165.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following OCFI's interlocutory order of January 28, 1993, attorneys for OCFI and the plaintiff met to try to resolve the issue.  The plaintiff asserts that during the months of March and April 1993, letters and telephone calls were exchanged to this end.  The record indicates that the plaintiff's attorneys sent OCFI settlement proposals which were evidently rejected.  The plaintiff's intention in the negotiations was to relinquish his constitutional claims in exchange for reinstatement of his license.  The plaintiff asserts that representations were made that the statute of limitations was tolled, although there is no evidence in the record that substantiates this allegation beyond the interlocutory order.  During these interactions, OCFI never indicated that it was not considering the motion for reconsideration.  In September 1993, the Commissioner and the plaintiff accidentally met, and in response to an inquiry by the plaintiff, the Commissioner indicated that he would \"follow up\" on the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.  In June 1994, the attorney for the plaintiff filed a motion to \"resign\" from representing him.  OCFI never responded to the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March and April 1995, the plaintiff contacted OCFI to inquire about the status of his case and request a copy of the examiner's findings.  The plaintiff was told that no one at OCFI had any knowledge regarding his case, and that no one could help him with his inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1995, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the federal district court of Puerto Rico against the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The plaintiff sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1988, and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201.  The plaintiff asserted that the defendants violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, his right to be free from illegal detention, his right to privacy, his property interest in his license, his liberty interest in his career, and his liberty interest in his right to contract for employment.  He also asserted claims under the Puerto Rico Constitution, Article II, sections 7, 8, and 10, and Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, 1995, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  The defendants argued that the complaint was not filed within one year of the constitutional deprivations, and was therefore time barred.  Furthermore, they asserted that the plaintiff failed to toll the statute of limitations because (1) the plaintiff failed to satisfy the applicable Puerto Rico tolling statute, which requires that there be identity of relief requested, and (2) equitable tolling was unavailable because the plaintiff could establish neither excusable ignorance nor that the defendant actively misled or prevented the plaintiff from asserting his rights.  Finally, the defendants argued that OCFI's determination was final and unappealable because the statute of limitations had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The court first determined that a one year statute of limitations controlled the plaintiff's claims.  It then determined that the last alleged violation occurred on September 28, 1992.  The complaint therefore had to be filed by September 29, 1993.  The court agreed with the defendants and found that the plaintiff had not tolled the statute of limitations on either of two bases:  (1) the plaintiff failed to seek the same remedies in the district court as it had before the agency, and therefore failed to satisfy the requirements of the Puerto Rico statute governing the tolling of the statute of limitations through extrajudicial claims, and (2) the plaintiff failed to establish that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled.  The court implicitly found that the plaintiff was neither excusably ignorant of the statute of limitations nor actively misled by OCFI.  The court concluded that the administrative order was final and unappealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff argues on appeal that the ninety day review period under section 2165 is waivable and was tolled by OCFI.  The plaintiff also asserts that the defendants are equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense in this case.  Finally, the plaintiff asserts that summary judgment is generally inapplicable in actions raising equitable tolling or estoppel arguments, and that genuine issues of material fact in this case precluded the grant of summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review motions for summary judgment de novo.

See Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U.S. 478, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980).  In Wilson v. Garcia, the Supreme Court determined that the state statute of limitations applicable in tort actions for personal injuries governs &#167; 1983 claims.  See 471 U.S. 261, 276-80, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1947-49, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff does not dispute that Puerto Rico law establishes a one year prescription period for the claims in this case.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5298 (1994);  Rodriguez Narvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41-42 (1st Cir.1990).  The one year period begins running one day after the date of accrual, which is the date plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the injury.  See Carreras-Rosa v. Alves-Cruz, 127 F.3d 172 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tolling of the statute of limitations is also governed by state law.  See, e.g., Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893 F.2d 404, 407 (1st Cir.1990).  Article 1873 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico provides that extrajudicial claims will toll the one-year statute of limitations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>Prescription of actions is interrupted by their institution before the courts, [or] by extrajudicial claims of the creditor....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5303 (1994).  \"[T]he tolling is effective with regard only to identical causes of action.  The statute of limitations is not tolled for all claims arising out of the same facts....\"  Rodriguez Narvaez, 895 F.2d at 43 (citations omitted).  Moreover, the relief requested in the extrajudicial claim must be the same relief that is later requested in court.  See Riofrio Anda v. Ralston Purina, Co., 959 F.2d 1149, 1154 (1st Cir.1992);  Rodriguez Narvaez, 895 F.2d at 44;  Torres, 893 F.2d at 407;  Hernandez Del Valle v. Santa Aponte, 575 F.2d 321, 323-24 (1st Cir.1978).  In other words, \"to toll the statute the action must be the case at bar, and not merely a somewhat related action arising from the same facts,\" Ramirez de Arellano v. Alvarez de Choudens, 575 F.2d 315, 320 (1st Cir.1978), and if the remedies in both the claims are not the same, the earlier claim will fail to toll the statute of limitations for the later claim, see Torres, 893 F.2d at 407.   For the reasons enumerated below, we find the plaintiff's claims to be barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>I. Fourth Amendment, Illegal Detention and Privacy Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff alleges that he was subjected to illegal searches and seizures, illegal detentions, and violations of his right to privacy between March 13, 1992, and March 19, 1992.  The plaintiff had until March 1993 to file his complaint asserting these causes of action, unless he tolled the statute of limitations.  As indicated above, the plaintiff waited until May 1995 to file his federal complaint asserting these claims.  There is no evidence in the record that the plaintiff raised these claims during the administrative hearing.  He did not assert these claims in his motion for reconsideration filed with OCFI.  Nor is there evidence in the record that these specific claims were asserted during the negotiations that transpired in March and April 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In fact, from the record it appears that the plaintiff raised these specific constitutional claims for the first time when he filed his federal complaint.  Therefore, the district court properly concluded that these claims were untimely, and that the plaintiff had not tolled the statute of limitations under the Puerto Rico tolling statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Federal and State Due Process Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff asserts that his property and liberty interests were violated when he was allegedly deprived of his license without due process.  We assume arguendo that his claim accrued at the latest possible date, December 28th, 1992, the day the plaintiff's license was permanently revoked, allegedly without due process.  Because the plaintiff did not file his complaint in federal court until May 2, 1995, these claims are also time barred by the statute of limitations unless the statute was tolled under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the search and seizure, illegal detention, and privacy claims discussed above, the plaintiff asserted in his motion for reconsideration, and allegedly in his negotiations with OCFI, that the administrative proceedings failed to afford him due process.  In his motion he argued that his license was a right and not a privilege, and that he was not accorded due process of law in the administrative proceedings because the burden of proof was inappropriately shifted to him.  The plaintiff's argument can, if read liberally, be understood to assert that the plaintiff was deprived of his property and liberty interests without due process of law.  However, despite the plaintiff's assertion of these claims in the administrative proceeding, they are not preserved by the Puerto Rico tolling statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we held in Torres, if a party seeks a remedy in an extrajudicial claim that is different from the remedy later sought in a judicial proceeding, the statute of limitations is not tolled.  In Torres, the plaintiffs had been discharged from their positions as police officers.  See 893 F.2d at 406.   They filed an administrative action within the statute of limitations seeking reinstatement.  After their administrative claim proved unsuccessful, they filed a &#167; 1983 action in federal district court seeking damages, reinstatement, and the expunging of photographs and fingerprints filed with the police.  By this time, the statute of limitations for their federal claim had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Torres, we found that because the remedies sought by the plaintiffs in the district court were not the same as they were in the administrative proceeding, there was no tolling of the statute of limitations by their extrajudicial assertion in the administrative action.  In concluding that the &#167; 1983 claim was time barred, we stated in Torres:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>[T]he district court correctly held that the extrajudicial claim must claim the same relief later requested in the federal suit.  The statute of limitations for Section 1983 claim [sic] is not tolled if the remedy requested in both suits is different....  The record supports the district court's finding that the plaintiff requested two distinct remedies....  Given that these remedies were not identical, there was no tolling and the prescription period expired....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 407.   The case at hand presents similar facts.  Here, the plaintiff asserted constitutional claims before the administrative agency, which could have functioned as an extrajudicial claim under Puerto Rico law, tolling the statute of limitations.  However, the plaintiff failed to seek the same remedies in the district court as he had sought in the administrative proceedings.  In the administrative proceedings he sought only the reinstatement of his license, while in the district court he sought declaratory and monetary relief, as well as the reinstatement of his license.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Equitable Estoppel and Tolling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also argues that the defendants are equitably estopped from raising the time bar defense.  The plaintiff's argument muddles the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.  Because the plaintiff asserts elements of both doctrines, we will analyze the equitable arguments under both estoppel and tolling theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue to be determined in analyzing equitable tolling is its applicability to the case at hand.  In Torres Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia, we noted without resolution that it was unclear whether the federal doctrine of fraudulent concealment (equitable tolling) continues to apply to &#167; 1983 actions, or whether state law governs the issue of equitable tolling.  See Torres Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia, 898 F.2d 224, 229 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1990).  We need not decide the issue here, as we find that under either the federal or the state doctrine, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously addressed equitable tolling under Puerto Rico law in &#167; 1983 cases.  \"Puerto Rico law provides for equitable tolling in a case of 'damage willfully and wrongfully (dolosamente ) concealed by the author of the same.' \"  Ramirez Morales v. Rosa Viera, 815 F.2d 2, 4 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting Rivera Encarnacion v. Estado Libre Asociado De Puerto Rico, 113 D.P.R. 383, 386, 1982 WL 210553 (1982)).  Similarly, under federal law, the plaintiff must show \"excusable ignorance of the statute of limitations caused by some misconduct of the defendant.\"  Torres, 893 F.2d at 407 (quotations and citations omitted).  Equitable tolling is unavailable where a party fails to exercise reasonable diligence.  Moreover, \"[i]t is axiomatic that 'the grounds for tolling statutes of limitations are more limited in suits against the government....' \"  Kelley v. NLRB, 79 F.3d 1238, 1248 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Swietlik v. United States, 779 F.2d 1306, 1311 (7th Cir.1985)).  Courts weigh five factors in assessing claims of equitable tolling:  (1) the lack of actual notice of the filing requirement;  (2) the lack of constructive notice of the filing requirement;  (3) the diligence in pursuing one's rights;  (4) the absence of prejudice to the defendant;  and (5) the plaintiff's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the filing requirement.  See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of America, 861 F.2d 746, 752 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiff does not allege that the defendants concealed material facts regarding the plaintiff's cause of action or the damages incurred.  See Ramirez Morales, 815 F.2d at 4 (finding equitable tolling inappropriate in &#167; 1983 case under either federal or Puerto Rico doctrines where defendants did not prevent or discourage plaintiff from viewing agency records regarding unlawful police shooting, and there was no concealment of material facts) overruled on other grounds by Carreras-Rosa v. Alves-Cruz, 127 F.3d 172 (1st Cir.1997).  Instead, the plaintiff argues that equitable tolling is appropriate because OCFI misled him regarding the tolling of the statute of limitations under the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts and arguments in this case are similar to those presented by Kelley.   See 79 F.3d at 1242-43, 1247-50.   In Kelley, the plaintiff failed to serve process on the defendant within the time period mandated by a federal statute.  The plaintiff relied on a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) employee who informed the plaintiff's attorney that the NLRB would serve the defendant and that the plaintiff should not do so.  The employee neglected to inform the plaintiff, however, of an NLRB regulation stating that the ultimate responsibility for serving notice was on the charging party.  The service by the NLRB was one day late.  In rejecting the plaintiff's equitable tolling argument, we held that although the employee's information was \"incomplete and perhaps misleading,\" the delay in service could not \"be wholly attributed to an error on the part of the [NLRB].\"  See Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1249.   We found that the plaintiff had constructive notice of the regulation and its requirements because the plaintiff was represented by counsel for a long duration, and counsel had access to the regulations.  See id. at 1249 (\"Courts generally impute constructive knowledge to plaintiffs who, like appellant, consult with an attorney.\").  We also determined that it was plain that the attorney's reliance on the employee's representations was unreasonable.  See id. at 1249.   The information \"almost by definition, is not nearly as reliable as simply looking up the text of a regulation.\"  Id. at 1250.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the interlocutory order issued by OCFI indicated that the statute of limitations was tolled until a copy of OCFI's resolution addressing the motion for reconsideration was \"filed and notified.\"   In this regard it was incomplete and therefore inaccurate.  However, the order expressly stated that it was issued pursuant to section 3.15 of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, which clarifies the ambiguity of the interlocutory order.  Pursuant to section 3.15, \"[i]f the agency fails to take action on the motion for reconsideration within the ninety (90) days of the filing of the motion it shall lose jurisdiction over the same and the term in which to petition for judicial review shall commence upon the expiration of said ninety (90) day term unless the court, for good cause shown, grants the agency an extension of time.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2165 (1994).  In short, the statute was tolled either until the OCFI's resolution of the motion was issued or until the time period in which to issue the resolution expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff had notice of the statute governing the time limitations but relied on the agency's summation of the law.  \"The general rule is that 'those who deal with the Government are expected to know the law and may not rely on the conduct of Government agents contrary to law.' \"  Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1249 (quoting Heckler v. Community Health Servs., 467 U.S. 51, 63, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 2225, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984)).  Moreover, the plaintiff had constructive notice of the filing requirement;  he was represented by counsel throughout his dealings with OCFI;  and he had access to the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.  See Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1249.   Nor can we say that the plaintiff was diligent in pursuing his rights.  Between June 21, 1993, and March 1995, the only action the plaintiff took to pursue his rights was when he approached the Commissioner at an unidentified meeting and the Commissioner indicated he would \"follow up\" on the plaintiff's petition.  The plaintiff's counsel acknowledged in oral argument that even this meeting was entirely accidental.  The plaintiff initiated no other contact with the agency to resolve his dispute throughout this period.  Given the fact that the plaintiff was a sophisticated businessman represented by counsel, and that the plaintiff was directed to the specific section of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act that governed the time limitations for his motion, we cannot say that the plaintiff's failure to ascertain the timeliness of his cause of action was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff has referred to the OCFI Regulation Rule 19, see Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, Regulation # 3920, Rule 19 (1989), and Rule 3.16 of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2166 (1994), both of which require that notice be sent when an adjudicative procedure is terminated.  However, the plaintiff has also cited the OCFI Regulation Rule 18.1, see Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, Regulation # 3920, Rule 18.1 (1989), and Rule 3.15 of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2165 (1994), which provide that OCFI's failure to decide a motion for reconsideration within a designated time period either renders the motion and case dismissed by the agency, or strips the agency of its jurisdiction over the case.  In such a situation, we cannot agree that the plaintiff's reliance on selected portions of the regulations (i.e. OCFI's failure to notify the plaintiff as to the termination of his case) and his disregard for other portions of the regulations that indicated his case was dismissed, was reasonable.  The regulations must be read as a whole, and cannot be read selectively.  See O'Connell v. Shalala, 79 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[A] court engaged in the task of statutory interpretation must examine the statute as a whole, giving due weight to design, structure, and purpose as well as to aggregate language.\").  Furthermore, the plaintiff's ignorance of the time limitations was unreasonable particularly in light of the fact that these tolling provisions are uniform for all of the Puerto Rico agencies.  Because lack of prejudice alone is not an adequate basis for invoking equitable tolling, and the plaintiff has not met the other requirements of the doctrine, we find the equitable tolling doctrine to be inapplicable on these facts.  See Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1250.   The plaintiff fails in his attempt to distinguish this case from Kelley on the grounds that the Commissioner issued the interlocutory order.  Reliance was unreasonable in light of the order's clear reference to the statute under which it was authorized, the uniformity of the provisions for all Puerto Rico agencies, and the notice in the regulations and statute indicating the pending time limitations, among other factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equitable estoppel has a similar origin and effect as equitable tolling, although it is a distinct doctrine.  See Kale, 861 F.2d at 752.   Equitable estoppel is available in &#167; 1983 actions.  See Smith v. City of Chicago Heights, 951 F.2d 834, 839 (7th Cir.1992).  Even when a federal court borrows a state's statute of limitations, the court applies federal equitable estoppel principles.  See id. at 841.  \"(1) The party to be estopped must know the facts;  (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it is so intended;  (3) the latter must be ignorant of the true facts;  and (4) he must rely on the former's conduct to his injury.\"  Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 661 (1st Cir.1987).  The \"reliance must have been reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have known that its adversary's conduct was misleading.\"  Heckler, 467 U.S. at 59, 104 S.Ct. at 2223.  \" 'If, at the time when he acted, such party had knowledge of the truth, or ... with reasonable diligence he could acquire the knowledge ... he cannot claim to have been misled by relying upon the misrepresentation or concealment.' \"  Id. (quoting 3 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence &#167; 810, at 219 (S. Symons ed.1941)).  Indeed, \"the conduct of the defendant must be so misleading as to cause the plaintiff's failure to file suit.\"  Sanchez v. Loffland Bros., 626 F.2d 1228, 1231 (5th Cir.1980) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in the plaintiff's argument, as discussed above, is that the plaintiff's reliance was not reasonable.  The interlocutory order explicitly cited the statute pursuant to which it was issued.  The statute in turn indicated the time period after which OCFI lost jurisdiction.  The OCFI regulations also indicated that the motion for reconsideration would be considered \"WITHOUT CAUSE/CASE DISMISSED\" without an OCFI resolution in 30 days.  See Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, Regulation # 3920, Rule 18.1 (1989).  In the face of a conflict between the interlocutory order and the statute it expressly referred to, and another conflict between regulations that indicated the case was dismissed but that also indicated notice would be given in the event of termination, it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to choose to rely upon the interlocutory order.  In this case, OCFI's conduct was not so misleading as to cause the plaintiff's failure to file on time without the plaintiff's lack of diligence.  Nor are the plaintiff's negotiations with OCFI adequate to equitably toll the statute of limitations.  See Bomba v. W.L. Belvidere, Inc., 579 F.2d 1067, 1071 (7th Cir.1978) (\"[I]t is widely held that mere negotiations concerning a disputed claim, without more, is [sic] insufficient to warrant the application of equitable estoppel....\").  The plaintiff's equitable estoppel argument must therefore fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also argues that the Commissioner had the authority to waive the time periods at issue, and because he did in fact waive them, the statute of limitations was tolled by OCFI.  At the time of this case, the Commissioner had no authority to waive the time periods of section 2165.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's reference to language in sections 2163 and 2164 is without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Section 2163 provides that an adjudicatory procedure before an agency shall be resolved in six months, absent exceptional circumstances.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2163 (1994).  Section 2164 provides that a final order or resolution shall be issued within ninety days after the conclusion of a hearing, unless waived in writing by the parties, or for just cause.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2164 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Uniform Administrative Procedure Act is, for the most part, arranged chronologically.  Section 2163 deals in its entirety with the procedure of the actual hearing.  Section 2164 addresses only issues pertaining to final orders or resolutions, including their timing, content, or notice.  It is not relevant to motions for reconsideration.  In contrast, section 2165 governs reconsideration and the applicable timing issues in this case.  Section 2165 provides that an agency shall lose jurisdiction if it fails to take action within ninety days \"unless the court, for good cause shown, grants the agency an extension of time.\"   The agency therefore lacks the authority to waive this requirement.  The requirement is not affected by the discretion afforded the agency in other sections, nor by reliance on OCFI's representations or conduct by the plaintiff.  We find the statute to be unambiguous and decline to read into it a meaning that directly conflicts with the intent of the legislature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Pagan Ramos v. State Ins. Fund, 92 JTS 13 (1992) (stating in dicta \"[o]nly through judicial authorization and 'for just cause can that term be extended for a reasonable period of time.' \")  (quoting P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2165 (1994));  Rivera Rivera v. Municipality of Carolina, 96 JTS 28 (1996) (stating in dicta that there is no ambiguity in the statute).  OCFI's administrative order is therefore final, and as timely review was not sought, unappealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff finally argues that summary judgment is inappropriate in this case because it involves equitable estoppel or equitable tolling issues, and because there were genuine issues of material fact unresolved.  The mere fact that a party asserts such equitable claims does not foreclose granting a motion for summary judgment.  See, e.g., Bell v. Fowler, 99 F.3d 262 (8th Cir.1996) (equitable estoppel);  Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F.2d 446 (7th Cir.1990) (equitable tolling);  Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517 (1st Cir.1990) (equitable tolling);  Dillman v. Combustion Eng'g, Inc., 784 F.2d 57 (2d Cir.1986) (equitable estoppel and equitable tolling).  Moreover, we find that the facts alleged by the plaintiff, as they are discussed throughout this opinion, fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact requiring a trial.  The district court's grant of summary judgment is therefore appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Nevertheless, despite the opposition of the Defendant, in this case the burden of proof was inverted and the Defendant was obliged to prove that he is innocent of the alleged charges.  This is clearly a violation of the rights recognized to an \"accused\" by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of P.R., which adulterates with absolute nullity the whole proceeding and converts the Order and Resolution into a nullity.  Much more so in this case, by which the Defendant is deprived of his right to his agent license permanently.  The license already issued or granted is an acquired right, and not a privilege as is erroneously indicated in the Resolution and Order.  (See Article 402(d) of the Securities Law about the burden of proof, which clearly shows that the burden of proof fell in this case on the Office of the Commissioner.)</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>...

No resolution of the motion for reconsideration was issued, although the agency and the plaintiff engaged in negotiations.  The plaintiff then filed a complaint in federal court alleging violations of the Federal and State Constitutions and statutes in connection with the revocation of his securities license.  The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the grounds that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff, Jose Rafael Bentez-Pons, was a practicing licensed securities broker and licensed supervisor of other securities brokers.  In April 1988, he co-founded and became president and majority owner of First Continental Corporation (FCC), a now defunct securities brokerage firm.  After suspecting improper securities transactions by two of the brokers at FCC, the plaintiff filed a complaint with OCFI.  OCFI's investigation eventually included the plaintiff himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 1992, OCFI issued a cease and desist order to FCC, and ordered the plaintiff to show cause why further action should not be taken against him.  On January 30, 1992, the plaintiff entered into a consent decree with OCFI.  The consent decree provided, inter alia, that the plaintiff was to cease all supervisory and administrative functions at FCC for one year, that FCC would name another person to supervise and perform administrative functions at FCC, that FCC would comply with certain filing requirements, that the plaintiff and FCC would pay certain fines, and that the plaintiff would supply a copy of a resolution of the FCC Board of Directors ratifying such measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff and FCC failed to comply with the consent decree.  On March 13, 1992, Peter Smith and other governmental employees or agents of OCFI entered FCC's premises. They conducted a warrantless search of the premises which included, in part, downloading computer information and seizing computer programs and disks, accounting books, a registry, shareholder contracts, and security boxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 19, 1992, OCFI issued another order against the plaintiff and FCC finding, inter alia, that the consent decree had not been complied with and that the plaintiff had engaged in other misconduct.  In the order, OCFI ultimately concluded that the situation at FCC placed investors and the securities industry in Puerto Rico at risk.  It summarily suspended the plaintiff's license, ordered him to show cause why further actions should not be taken against him, and informed him of his right to seek an administrative hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The plaintiff exercised his right to an administrative hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28, 1992, the plaintiff was afforded an administrative hearing on the issue of the revocation of his license.  There is no evidence that the plaintiff raised any search and seizure claims, privacy claims, or illegal detention claims during the administrative hearing.  On December 28, 1992, OCFI issued a resolution and ordered the plaintiff's license permanently revoked.  On January 19, 1993, the plaintiff filed a timely motion for reconsideration with OCFI.  This step was a procedural prerequisite to seeking judicial review.  In the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, the plaintiff asserted that the proceedings had violated his constitutional rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OCFI responded to the motion for reconsideration with an interlocutory order issued January 28, 1992, pursuant to section 3.15 of Puerto Rico's Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (codified at 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 2165).  See P.R.

OCFI never issued a decision by the Commissioner on the motion for reconsideration within the ninety day period as required by section 2165.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following OCFI's interlocutory order of January 28, 1993, attorneys for OCFI and the plaintiff met to try to resolve the issue.  The plaintiff asserts that during the months of March and April 1993, letters and telephone calls were exchanged to this end.  The record indicates that the plaintiff's attorneys sent OCFI settlement proposals which were evidently rejected.  The plaintiff's intention in the negotiations was to relinquish his constitutional claims in exchange for reinstatement of his license.  The plaintiff asserts that representations were made that the statute of limitations was tolled, although there is no evidence in the record that substantiates this allegation beyond the interlocutory order.  During these interactions, OCFI never indicated that it was not considering the motion for reconsideration.  In September 1993, the Commissioner and the plaintiff accidentally met, and in response to an inquiry by the plaintiff, the Commissioner indicated that he would \"follow up\" on the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.  In June 1994, the attorney for the plaintiff filed a motion to \"resign\" from representing him.  OCFI never responded to the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March and April 1995, the plaintiff contacted OCFI to inquire about the status of his case and request a copy of the examiner's findings.  The plaintiff was told that no one at OCFI had any knowledge regarding his case, and that no one could help him with his inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1995, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the federal district court of Puerto Rico against the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The plaintiff sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1988, and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201.  The plaintiff asserted that the defendants violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, his right to be free from illegal detention, his right to privacy, his property interest in his license, his liberty interest in his career, and his liberty interest in his right to contract for employment.  He also asserted claims under the Puerto Rico Constitution, Article II, sections 7, 8, and 10, and Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, 1995, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.  The defendants argued that the complaint was not filed within one year of the constitutional deprivations, and was therefore time barred.  Furthermore, they asserted that the plaintiff failed to toll the statute of limitations because (1) the plaintiff failed to satisfy the applicable Puerto Rico tolling statute, which requires that there be identity of relief requested, and (2) equitable tolling was unavailable because the plaintiff could establish neither excusable ignorance nor that the defendant actively misled or prevented the plaintiff from asserting his rights.  Finally, the defendants argued that OCFI's determination was final and unappealable because the statute of limitations had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The court first determined that a one year statute of limitations controlled the plaintiff's claims.  It then determined that the last alleged violation occurred on September 28, 1992.  The complaint therefore had to be filed by September 29, 1993.  The court agreed with the defendants and found that the plaintiff had not tolled the statute of limitations on either of two bases:  (1) the plaintiff failed to seek the same remedies in the district court as it had before the agency, and therefore failed to satisfy the requirements of the Puerto Rico statute governing the tolling of the statute of limitations through extrajudicial claims, and (2) the plaintiff failed to establish that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled.  The court implicitly found that the plaintiff was neither excusably ignorant of the statute of limitations nor actively misled by OCFI.  The court concluded that the administrative order was final and unappealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff argues on appeal that the ninety day review period under section 2165 is waivable and was tolled by OCFI.  The plaintiff also asserts that the defendants are equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense in this case.  Finally, the plaintiff asserts that summary judgment is generally inapplicable in actions raising equitable tolling or estoppel arguments, and that genuine issues of material fact in this case precluded the grant of summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review motions for summary judgment de novo.

The one year period begins running one day after the date of accrual, which is the date plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the injury.  See Carreras-Rosa v.

See, e.g., Torres v. Superintendent of Police, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534774\"><a href=\"/opinion/534774/jose-antonio-torres-v-superintendent-of-the-police-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, 407 (1st Cir.1990).  Article 1873 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico provides that extrajudicial claims will toll the one-year statute of limitations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>Prescription of actions is interrupted by their institution before the courts, [or] by extrajudicial claims of the creditor....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.

The statute of limitations is not tolled for all claims arising out of the same facts....\"  Rodriguez Narvaez, 895 F.2d at 43 (citations omitted).  Moreover, the relief requested in the extrajudicial claim must be the same relief that is later requested in court.  See Riofrio Anda v. Ralston Purina, Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580297\"><a href=\"/opinion/580297/luis-riofrio-anda-v-ralston-purina-co-luis-riofrio-anda-v-ralston/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span>, 1154 (1st Cir.1992);  Rodriguez Narvaez, 895 F.2d at 44;  Torres, 893 F.2d at 407;  Hernandez Del Valle v.

In other words, \"to toll the statute the action must be the case at bar, and not merely a somewhat related action arising from the same facts,\" Ramirez de Arellano v. Alvarez de Choudens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355491\"><a href=\"/opinion/355491/matilde-r-ramirez-de-arellano-v-jose-a-alvarez-de-choudens-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 320 (1st Cir.1978), and if the remedies in both the claims are not the same, the earlier claim will fail to toll the statute of limitations for the later claim, see Torres, 893 F.2d at 407.   For the reasons enumerated below, we find the plaintiff's claims to be barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>I. Fourth Amendment, Illegal Detention and Privacy Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff alleges that he was subjected to illegal searches and seizures, illegal detentions, and violations of his right to privacy between March 13, 1992, and March 19, 1992.  The plaintiff had until March 1993 to file his complaint asserting these causes of action, unless he tolled the statute of limitations.  As indicated above, the plaintiff waited until May 1995 to file his federal complaint asserting these claims.  There is no evidence in the record that the plaintiff raised these claims during the administrative hearing.  He did not assert these claims in his motion for reconsideration filed with OCFI.  Nor is there evidence in the record that these specific claims were asserted during the negotiations that transpired in March and April 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In fact, from the record it appears that the plaintiff raised these specific constitutional claims for the first time when he filed his federal complaint.  Therefore, the district court properly concluded that these claims were untimely, and that the plaintiff had not tolled the statute of limitations under the Puerto Rico tolling statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Federal and State Due Process Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff asserts that his property and liberty interests were violated when he was allegedly deprived of his license without due process.  We assume arguendo that his claim accrued at the latest possible date, December 28th, 1992, the day the plaintiff's license was permanently revoked, allegedly without due process.  Because the plaintiff did not file his complaint in federal court until May 2, 1995, these claims are also time barred by the statute of limitations unless the statute was tolled under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the search and seizure, illegal detention, and privacy claims discussed above, the plaintiff asserted in his motion for reconsideration, and allegedly in his negotiations with OCFI, that the administrative proceedings failed to afford him due process.  In his motion he argued that his license was a right and not a privilege, and that he was not accorded due process of law in the administrative proceedings because the burden of proof was inappropriately shifted to him.  The plaintiff's argument can, if read liberally, be understood to assert that the plaintiff was deprived of his property and liberty interests without due process of law.  However, despite the plaintiff's assertion of these claims in the administrative proceeding, they are not preserved by the Puerto Rico tolling statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we held in Torres, if a party seeks a remedy in an extrajudicial claim that is different from the remedy later sought in a judicial proceeding, the statute of limitations is not tolled.  In Torres, the plaintiffs had been discharged from their positions as police officers.  See 893 F.2d at 406.   They filed an administrative action within the statute of limitations seeking reinstatement.  After their administrative claim proved unsuccessful, they filed a &#167; 1983 action in federal district court seeking damages, reinstatement, and the expunging of photographs and fingerprints filed with the police.  By this time, the statute of limitations for their federal claim had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Torres, we found that because the remedies sought by the plaintiffs in the district court were not the same as they were in the administrative proceeding, there was no tolling of the statute of limitations by their extrajudicial assertion in the administrative action.  In concluding that the &#167; 1983 claim was time barred, we stated in Torres:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>[T]he district court correctly held that the extrajudicial claim must claim the same relief later requested in the federal suit.  The statute of limitations for Section 1983 claim [sic] is not tolled if the remedy requested in both suits is different....  The record supports the district court's finding that the plaintiff requested two distinct remedies....  Given that these remedies were not identical, there was no tolling and the prescription period expired....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 407.   The case at hand presents similar facts.  Here, the plaintiff asserted constitutional claims before the administrative agency, which could have functioned as an extrajudicial claim under Puerto Rico law, tolling the statute of limitations.  However, the plaintiff failed to seek the same remedies in the district court as he had sought in the administrative proceedings.  In the administrative proceedings he sought only the reinstatement of his license, while in the district court he sought declaratory and monetary relief, as well as the reinstatement of his license.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Equitable Estoppel and Tolling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also argues that the defendants are equitably estopped from raising the time bar defense.  The plaintiff's argument muddles the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.  Because the plaintiff asserts elements of both doctrines, we will analyze the equitable arguments under both estoppel and tolling theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue to be determined in analyzing equitable tolling is its applicability to the case at hand.  In Torres Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia, we noted without resolution that it was unclear whether the federal doctrine of fraudulent concealment (equitable tolling) continues to apply to &#167; 1983 actions, or whether state law governs the issue of equitable tolling.  See Torres Ramirez v. Bermudez Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538368\"><a href=\"/opinion/538368/rafael-torres-ramirez-v-juan-bermudez-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 229 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1990).  We need not decide the issue here, as we find that under either the federal or the state doctrine, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously addressed equitable tolling under Puerto Rico law in &#167; 1983 cases.  \"Puerto Rico law provides for equitable tolling in a case of 'damage willfully and wrongfully (dolosamente ) concealed by the author of the same.' \"  Ramirez Morales v.

Similarly, under federal law, the plaintiff must show \"excusable ignorance of the statute of limitations caused by some misconduct of the defendant.\"  Torres, 893 F.2d at 407 (quotations and citations omitted).  Equitable tolling is unavailable where a party fails to exercise reasonable diligence.

Courts weigh five factors in assessing claims of equitable tolling:  (1) the lack of actual notice of the filing requirement;  (2) the lack of constructive notice of the filing requirement;  (3) the diligence in pursuing one's rights;  (4) the absence of prejudice to the defendant;  and (5) the plaintiff's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the filing requirement.  See Kale v. Combined Ins.

See Ramirez Morales, 815 F.2d at 4 (finding equitable tolling inappropriate in &#167; 1983 case under either federal or Puerto Rico doctrines where defendants did not prevent or discourage plaintiff from viewing agency records regarding unlawful police shooting, and there was no concealment of material facts) overruled on other grounds by Carreras-Rosa v.

Instead, the plaintiff argues that equitable tolling is appropriate because OCFI misled him regarding the tolling of the statute of limitations under the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts and arguments in this case are similar to those presented by Kelley.   See 79 F.3d at 1242-43, 1247-50.   In Kelley, the plaintiff failed to serve process on the defendant within the time period mandated by a federal statute.  The plaintiff relied on a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) employee who informed the plaintiff's attorney that the NLRB would serve the defendant and that the plaintiff should not do so.  The employee neglected to inform the plaintiff, however, of an NLRB regulation stating that the ultimate responsibility for serving notice was on the charging party.  The service by the NLRB was one day late.  In rejecting the plaintiff's equitable tolling argument, we held that although the employee's information was \"incomplete and perhaps misleading,\" the delay in service could not \"be wholly attributed to an error on the part of the [NLRB].\"  See Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1249.   We found that the plaintiff had constructive notice of the regulation and its requirements because the plaintiff was represented by counsel for a long duration, and counsel had access to the regulations.  See id. at 1249 (\"Courts generally impute constructive knowledge to plaintiffs who, like appellant, consult with an attorney.\").  We also determined that it was plain that the attorney's reliance on the employee's representations was unreasonable.  See id. at 1249.   The information \"almost by definition, is not nearly as reliable as simply looking up the text of a regulation.\"  Id. at 1250.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the interlocutory order issued by OCFI indicated that the statute of limitations was tolled until a copy of OCFI's resolution addressing the motion for reconsideration was \"filed and notified.\"   In this regard it was incomplete and therefore inaccurate.  However, the order expressly stated that it was issued pursuant to section 3.15 of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, which clarifies the ambiguity of the interlocutory order.  Pursuant to section 3.15, \"[i]f the agency fails to take action on the motion for reconsideration within the ninety (90) days of the filing of the motion it shall lose jurisdiction over the same and the term in which to petition for judicial review shall commence upon the expiration of said ninety (90) day term unless the court, for good cause shown, grants the agency an extension of time.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2165 (1994).  In short, the statute was tolled either until the OCFI's resolution of the motion was issued or until the time period in which to issue the resolution expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff had notice of the statute governing the time limitations but relied on the agency's summation of the law.  \"The general rule is that 'those who deal with the Government are expected to know the law and may not rely on the conduct of Government agents contrary to law.' \"  Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1249 (quoting Heckler v. Community Health Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111187\"><a href=\"/opinion/111187/heckler-v-community-health-services-of-crawford-cty-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111187\"><a href=\"/opinion/111187/heckler-v-community-health-services-of-crawford-cty-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span> (1984)).  Moreover, the plaintiff had constructive notice of the filing requirement;  he was represented by counsel throughout his dealings with OCFI;  and he had access to the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.  See Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1249.   Nor can we say that the plaintiff was diligent in pursuing his rights.  Between June 21, 1993, and March 1995, the only action the plaintiff took to pursue his rights was when he approached the Commissioner at an unidentified meeting and the Commissioner indicated he would \"follow up\" on the plaintiff's petition.  The plaintiff's counsel acknowledged in oral argument that even this meeting was entirely accidental.  The plaintiff initiated no other contact with the agency to resolve his dispute throughout this period.  Given the fact that the plaintiff was a sophisticated businessman represented by counsel, and that the plaintiff was directed to the specific section of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act that governed the time limitations for his motion, we cannot say that the plaintiff's failure to ascertain the timeliness of his cause of action was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff has referred to the OCFI Regulation Rule 19, see Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, Regulation # 3920, Rule 19 (1989), and Rule 3.16 of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2166 (1994), both of which require that notice be sent when an adjudicative procedure is terminated.  However, the plaintiff has also cited the OCFI Regulation Rule 18.1, see Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, Regulation # 3920, Rule 18.1 (1989), and Rule 3.15 of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2165 (1994), which provide that OCFI's failure to decide a motion for reconsideration within a designated time period either renders the motion and case dismissed by the agency, or strips the agency of its jurisdiction over the case.  In such a situation, we cannot agree that the plaintiff's reliance on selected portions of the regulations (i.e. OCFI's failure to notify the plaintiff as to the termination of his case) and his disregard for other portions of the regulations that indicated his case was dismissed, was reasonable.  The regulations must be read as a whole, and cannot be read selectively.  See O'Connell v. Shalala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196624\"><a href=\"/opinion/196624/oconnell-v-shhs/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 176 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[A] court engaged in the task of statutory interpretation must examine the statute as a whole, giving due weight to design, structure, and purpose as well as to aggregate language.\").  Furthermore, the plaintiff's ignorance of the time limitations was unreasonable particularly in light of the fact that these tolling provisions are uniform for all of the Puerto Rico agencies.  Because lack of prejudice alone is not an adequate basis for invoking equitable tolling, and the plaintiff has not met the other requirements of the doctrine, we find the equitable tolling doctrine to be inapplicable on these facts.  See Kelley, 79 F.3d at 1250.   The plaintiff fails in his attempt to distinguish this case from Kelley on the grounds that the Commissioner issued the interlocutory order.  Reliance was unreasonable in light of the order's clear reference to the statute under which it was authorized, the uniformity of the provisions for all Puerto Rico agencies, and the notice in the regulations and statute indicating the pending time limitations, among other factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equitable estoppel has a similar origin and effect as equitable tolling, although it is a distinct doctrine.  See Kale, 861 F.2d at 752.   Equitable estoppel is available in &#167; 1983 actions.  See Smith v. City of Chicago Heights, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573935\"><a href=\"/opinion/573935/king-smith-jr-v-city-of-chicago-heights-a-body-politic-and-municipal/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span>, 839 (7th Cir.1992).  Even when a federal court borrows a state's statute of limitations, the court applies federal equitable estoppel principles.  See id. at 841.  \"(1) The party to be estopped must know the facts;  (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it is so intended;  (3) the latter must be ignorant of the true facts;  and (4) he must rely on the former's conduct to his injury.\"  Clauson v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491456\"><a href=\"/opinion/491456/charles-clauson-v-robert-d-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 661 (1st Cir.1987).  The \"reliance must have been reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have known that its adversary's conduct was misleading.\"  Heckler, 467 U.S. at 59, 104 S.Ct. at 2223.  \" 'If, at the time when he acted, such party had knowledge of the truth, or ... with reasonable diligence he could acquire the knowledge ... he cannot claim to have been misled by relying upon the misrepresentation or concealment.' \"  Id. (quoting 3 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence &#167; 810, at 219 (S. Symons ed.1941)).  Indeed, \"the conduct of the defendant must be so misleading as to cause the plaintiff's failure to file suit.\"  Sanchez v. Loffland Bros., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380785\"><a href=\"/opinion/380785/heli-ramon-sanchez-and-aida-de-sanchez-individually-and-as-representative/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></a></span>, 1231 (5th Cir.1980) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in the plaintiff's argument, as discussed above, is that the plaintiff's reliance was not reasonable.  The interlocutory order explicitly cited the statute pursuant to which it was issued.  The statute in turn indicated the time period after which OCFI lost jurisdiction.  The OCFI regulations also indicated that the motion for reconsideration would be considered \"WITHOUT CAUSE/CASE DISMISSED\" without an OCFI resolution in 30 days.  See Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, Regulation # 3920, Rule 18.1 (1989).  In the face of a conflict between the interlocutory order and the statute it expressly referred to, and another conflict between regulations that indicated the case was dismissed but that also indicated notice would be given in the event of termination, it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to choose to rely upon the interlocutory order.  In this case, OCFI's conduct was not so misleading as to cause the plaintiff's failure to file on time without the plaintiff's lack of diligence.  Nor are the plaintiff's negotiations with OCFI adequate to equitably toll the statute of limitations.  See Bomba v. W.L. Belvidere, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358099\"><a href=\"/opinion/358099/robert-bomba-and-annamarie-p-bomba-v-w-l-belvidere-inc-a-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></a></span>, 1071 (7th Cir.1978) (\"[I]t is widely held that mere negotiations concerning a disputed claim, without more, is [sic] insufficient to warrant the application of equitable estoppel....\").  The plaintiff's equitable estoppel argument must therefore fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also argues that the Commissioner had the authority to waive the time periods at issue, and because he did in fact waive them, the statute of limitations was tolled by OCFI.  At the time of this case, the Commissioner had no authority to waive the time periods of section 2165.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's reference to language in sections 2163 and 2164 is without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Section 2163 provides that an adjudicatory procedure before an agency shall be resolved in six months, absent exceptional circumstances.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2163 (1994).  Section 2164 provides that a final order or resolution shall be issued within ninety days after the conclusion of a hearing, unless waived in writing by the parties, or for just cause.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2164 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Uniform Administrative Procedure Act is, for the most part, arranged chronologically.  Section 2163 deals in its entirety with the procedure of the actual hearing.  Section 2164 addresses only issues pertaining to final orders or resolutions, including their timing, content, or notice.  It is not relevant to motions for reconsideration.  In contrast, section 2165 governs reconsideration and the applicable timing issues in this case.  Section 2165 provides that an agency shall lose jurisdiction if it fails to take action within ninety days \"unless the court, for good cause shown, grants the agency an extension of time.\"   The agency therefore lacks the authority to waive this requirement.  The requirement is not affected by the discretion afforded the agency in other sections, nor by reliance on OCFI's representations or conduct by the plaintiff.  We find the statute to be unambiguous and decline to read into it a meaning that directly conflicts with the intent of the legislature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Pagan Ramos v. State Ins. Fund, 92 JTS 13 (1992) (stating in dicta \"[o]nly through judicial authorization and 'for just cause can that term be extended for a reasonable period of time.' \")  (quoting P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2165 (1994));  Rivera Rivera v. Municipality of Carolina, 96 JTS 28 (1996) (stating in dicta that there is no ambiguity in the statute).  OCFI's administrative order is therefore final, and as timely review was not sought, unappealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff finally argues that summary judgment is inappropriate in this case because it involves equitable estoppel or equitable tolling issues, and because there were genuine issues of material fact unresolved.  The mere fact that a party asserts such equitable claims does not foreclose granting a motion for summary judgment.  See, e.g., Bell v.

Moreover, we find that the facts alleged by the plaintiff, as they are discussed throughout this opinion, fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact requiring a trial.  The district court's grant of summary judgment is therefore appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

This is clearly a violation of the rights recognized to an \"accused\" by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of P.R., which adulterates with absolute nullity the whole proceeding and converts the Order and Resolution into a nullity.  Much more so in this case, by which the Defendant is deprived of his right to his agent license permanently.  The license already issued or granted is an acquired right, and not a privilege as is erroneously indicated in the Resolution and Order.

This general statement is supported by evidence in the record, but only as to the due process claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> For the same reasons, the plaintiff's claims asserting Puerto Rico causes of action are time barred</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We also reject plaintiff's arguments premised on public policy favoring economical, fair, and rapid proceedings, and on OCFI's conduct</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> We note that the legislature has since amended section 2165 to provide for the agency discretion that the plaintiff argues we should read into the statute.  Pursuant to section 2165, as amended, the agency loses jurisdiction after ninety days \"unless the agency, for just cause and within those ninety days, extends the term\" for at most another thirty days.
