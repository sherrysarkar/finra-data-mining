The Shipway Place Condominium\n\n(\"Shipway\") suffered extensive roof damage which appellants1 attribute\n\nto a particularly heavy snowstorm that fell in the Boston area on\n\nApril 1, 1997. Appellee St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company\n\n(St. Paul) denied coverage after concluding that: (i) no \"collapse\" had\n\noccurred, as required by the insurance policy; and (ii) any collapse\n\nthat did occur was not caused by the heavy snow, but resulted from\n\ncorrosion damage explicitly excluded by the policy. Appellants brought\n\nsuit for breach of contract.     The district court granted summary\n\njudgment to St. Paul. Dreiblatt v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co.,\n\nNo. 99-11334-DPW, at 27 (D. Mass. Dec. 7, 2000). This appeal followed.\n\nWe agree with the district court's determination that no \"collapse\"\n\noccurred under Massachusetts law, and affirm on that basis.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, with the facts\n\ntaken in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Coyne v.\n\nTaber Partners I , 53 F.3d 454, 457 (1st Cir. 1995).     The material\n\nfacts, which we review here, are essentially undisputed.2\n\n\n\n\n1 Appellants are individual trustees of the Shipway Place Condominium\nAssociation. Throughout the opinion, we refer interchangeably to the\ncondominium and the appellants as \"Shipway.\"\n2 In their brief to this Court, appellants rely on the facts as set\nforth by the district court in its memorandum and order.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          Shipway Place is a nine building condominium complex in\n\nCharlestown, Massachusetts. The roofs of all nine buildings are flat,\n\nwith a structure consisting of wood trusses supported by wood and metal\n\nwebs and covered with plywood sheathing. The roof exterior is covered\n\nwith a rubber membrane weighed down by stones for ballast. The ceiling\n\nof the top unit in each apartment building is made of plaster attached\n\ndirectly to the roof structure.\n\n          Shipway's insurance policy is provided by St. Paul. The\n\npolicy insures \"against the risk of direct physical loss or damage\n\ninvolving collapse of a building or any part of a building\" due to\n\ncauses including the \"weight of ice and snow or sleet.\" The policy\n\ndoes not define the term \"collapse,\" but provides that \"[c]ollapse\n\ndoesn't include settling, cracking, bulging, shrinking, or expansion.\"\n\nThe policy also specifically denies coverage for loss \"caused or made\n\nworse\" by \"wear and tear\" or \"deterioration, mold, wet or dry rot, rust\n\nor corrosion.\"\n\n          On April 1, 1997, a heavy snow fell on Boston. Following the\n\nstorm, the owners of Shipway Unit 33 returned to their condominium to\n\ndiscover that their living room ceiling was \"hanging down a couple of\n\ninches.\" The ceiling was repaired in September 1997 and St. Paul paid\n\nfor the damage.3\n\n3 There is some dispute over whether this payment was to cover damages\ncaused by the April snowstorm. Dreiblatt, No. 99-11334-DPW, at 2-3.\nThe district court assumed that it was for purposes of summary\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          During the course of repairing the roof to Unit 33, Shipway\n\ndiscovered extensive damage to its internal support structure. The\n\nengineering firm of Simpson, Gumpertz & Heger (SGH) was hired to\n\ninvestigate the problem further. In the course of its investigation,\n\nSGH found that several of the metal trusses in the roof to Unit 33 were\n\n\"failed and severely corroded,\" and that the problem extended to roof\n\nsupports in many of the other units. In a November 18, 1997 report,\n\nSGH warned that \"a collapse of the roof structure is possible.\" Based\n\non further study, in July 1998, Shipway gave notice to St. Paul that it\n\nsought to claim damage to all nine buildings based on the April 1997\n\nsnowstorm.   St. Paul denied the claim.\n\n          Four other entities evaluated Shipway's roof damage after\n\nSGH. In November 1998, city inspector Jay Duca evaluated the ceilings\n\nof Units 32 and 34. He concluded that at least some parts of the roof\n\nsystem had rusted and deteriorated, and issued a citation warning the\n\nunit owners that the ceilings needed to be repaired. In deposition\n\ntestimony, Duca indicated that he did not feel that a collapse had\n\noccurred prior to his visit; however, he testified that he had warned\n\nowners that \"there was a danger of a collapse of the roof.\" He also\n\nnoted that \"it looked like there was some deflection [in the roof], but\n\n[that the deflection] could have been normal.\"\n\n\n\n\njudgment, id. at 3, and we do the same.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Also in November 1998, Shipway hired engineering firm C.I.D.\n\nAssociates (CID) to provide a second opinion. A CID report indicated\n\nfindings of deterioration, collapse, flaking and de-lamination of metal\n\nwebbing, sagging or failure of the plywood roof deck, and collapse of\n\nthe ceiling onto the floor in various units.4 The report's author, Paul\n\nO'Connor, testified only that he observed puddles of water on some of\n\nthe roofs, and that such \"ponding\" may suggest a sagging roof\n\nstructure.\n\n          In January 1999, Medeiros Property Management Consulting\n\nconducted \"deflection readings\" on all of the Shipway units.5 A number\n\nof the deflections measured exceeded that allowable under the\n\nMassachusetts Building Code (3/16 of an inch) but none of the\n\nmeasurements showed deflection of greater than one inch. Based on\n\nthese deflection readings, expert Rene Mugnier testified that one could\n\nconclude from the deflection readings that there had been a complete\n\ncollapse of the plywood deck resulting from the snowstorm. Mugnier did\n\nnot base his deduction on any legal definition of the word \"collapse.\"\n\n\n\n\n4 Appellants have submitted no other evidence indicating that any\nceilings had collapsed to the floor. The district court held that, to\nthe extent the CID report was offered to support factual allegations\nabout the physical state of the building, it was inadmissible hearsay.\nDreiblatt, No. 99-11334-DPW, at 5. Appellants have not challenged this\nconclusion, and do not rely on the report in their appeal.\n5  A \"deflection reading\" indicates the amount of sag in a roof\nstructure.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           Lastly, Wiss, Janney and Elster Associates (WJE), an\n\nengineering firm retained by St. Paul, examined the roof systems in\n\n1999 while they were being repaired.       In a May 14, 1999 report\n\nevaluating three of the units, WJE determined that although there had\n\nbeen differing amounts of corrosion within the roof, and \"some\n\ndeflection of the roof system\" due to load redistribution, the \"load\n\nredistribution and the associated deflections do not constitute a\n\ncollapse.\" In later reports, WJE indicated that its evaluation of the\n\nremaining units was \"generally consistent\" with this conclusion.\n\n           The district court, relying on Clendenning v. Worcester Ins.\n\nCo., 700 N.E.2d 846 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998), concluded that there had\n\nbeen no collapse under Massachusetts law. Dreiblatt, No. 99-11334-DPW,\n\nat 17.   The court held that a collapse \"must include a sudden and\n\ncompleted event that results in a noticeably altered appearance.\" Id.\n\nat 16. In other words, under Massachusetts law, a collapse has three\n\nelements: suddenness, a perceptible change in appearance, and\n\ncompleteness.    The court also held that evidence of internal\n\ndeterioration within the roof structure was insufficient under\n\nClendenning, given that the roof still performed its basic functions:\n\n           [A collapse] must result in some significant\n           primary . . . element of the structure becoming\n           disengaged or falling down so that it no longer\n           is performing its characteristic function in the\n           building. The requirements of a \"collapse\"\n           cannot be satisfied by mere \"flaking\" or\n           \"bending,\" nor may it be satisfied by\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f            compression, shifting, sagging, or \"deflection\"\n            of a few inches. The breakdown of subsidiary\n            elements such as several metal webs is not in\n            itself sufficient to constitute a collapse.\n\nId.   at    16-17;   see   also   id.    at   12   (\"[T]he   Clendenning\n\nopinion . . . cannot support the proposition that an arguably sagging\n\nroof, or deteriorating support system that had become structurally\n\nunsound but had not fallen in or become detached from the pertinent\n\nstructures, is a 'collapse.'\").\n\n            The court also determined that St. Paul had not abandoned the\n\npolicy's definition of \"collapse\" by either evidentiary admission or\n\nestoppel, id. at 17-21,6 and that even if there had been a collapse, it\n\nresulted not from the heavy snowstorm but from long-term wear and tear\n\n(corrosion) explicitly excluded by the St. Paul policy, id. at 27.7\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n            Appellants do not challenge the facts recited by the district\n\ncourt in making its determination, nor do they argue with the district\n\ncourt's use of Clendenning as the source of the Massachusetts law of\n\ncollapse.    Instead, they make a two-prong argument.        First, they\n\nsuggest that the district court's refusal to consider an unseen failure\n\nof structural elements within an enclosed roof system to be a potential\n\n\"collapse\" was erroneous. Appellants argue that \"a loss of structural\n\n\n6   Appellants do not challenge this holding on appeal.\n7 Appellants also challenge this aspect of the district court's\nholding. We affirm without having to reach the question of causation.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fintegrity coupled with some movement or alteration of the appearance of\n\na portion of the building\" could indeed be a collapse under\n\nMassachusetts law.    Second, they argue that under this revised\n\ndefinition, they introduced sufficient facts to survive summary\n\njudgment: (i) that structural elements within the Shipway roof failed\n\nand in some instances became detached; (ii) that ceilings sagged\n\nperceptibly; (iii) that there were measurable deflection readings; and\n\n(iv) that there was \"ponding\" on roof surfaces.\n\n          We are not persuaded.     Appellants do not challenge the\n\ndistrict court's requirement that the collapse result in a \"noticeably\n\naltered physical appearance.\" Id. at 16; see also Clendenning, 700\n\nN.E.2d at 660 (requiring \"a visual element of altered appearance that\n\ncomprises a structural collapse, distinct from the degenerative process\n\ncausing the collapse\").      In fact, appellants' own definition\n\ncontemplates that there be \"some movement or alteration of the\n\nappearance of a portion of the building\" (emphasis added). Moreover,\n\nin support of their position, they claim that there was \"a clear visual\n\nelement of altered appearance.\"        The district court found that\n\nappellants had adduced no evidence of externally observable changes in\n\nthe roof's appearance, and our review of the record confirms this\n\ndetermination.\n\n          First, there is no evidence that any roof (other than that\n\nof Unit 33) sagged perceptibly to the naked eye.        Not only have\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fappellants not pointed us towards any testimony of perceptible sagging\n\nin their appellate brief, but our careful review of the various\n\nengineering reports in the record has not discerned any such testimony.\n\nAs the district court pointed out, with the exception of Unit 33,\n\n\"there is no evidence that any resident complained of, or even noticed,\n\nany damage to a ceiling.\" Second, although the roof deflection was\n\nmeasurable using a specialized apparatus called a \"story pole,\" and was\n\nsignificant enough in some cases to violate the Massachusetts building\n\ncode, appellants have not suggested that a deflection of less than one\n\ninch can be perceived without engineering knowledge and equipment. We\n\nagree with the district court that, as a matter of law, a deflection of\n\nless than one inch is insufficient to create a \"noticeably altered\n\nphysical appearance\" in the building.      The policy's exclusion of\n\n\"settling, cracking, bulging, shrinking or expansion\" from the\n\ndefinition of a collapse further supports the determination that de\n\nminimus deflection does not meet the legal definition of collapse.\n\nThird, although there may have been observable post-snowstorm \"ponding\"\n\non the Shipway roofs, appellants have introduced no evidence that the\n\n\"ponding\" is a post-collapse phenomenon. A collapse requires that\n\nthere have been a change in appearance; lacking any evidence that the\n\n\"ponding\" observed in 1999 had not always occurred on the allegedly\n\n\"previously flat\" roofs, this evidentiary requirement is not met.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          Appellants also argue that under Clendenning, the relevant\n\nchanges to the roof's appearance may occur within the space between the\n\nceiling and the outer roof. To this end, appellants point to evidence\n\nof observable damage to the roof's internal support structure not\n\nrevealed until workers entered that space to make repairs. We can\n\nposit a situation in which the elements of Clendenning are satisfied,\n\nbut no damage is visible either from within the apartment itself or\n\nfrom outside the building: for example, if many of the metal pieces\n\ncomprising the roof's internal support structure detached from one\n\nanother, yet somehow the outer roof and ceiling remained intact as an\n\napparently unchanged \"shell\" with no ability to support any weight.\n\nSuch was not the case here. At best, appellants introduced evidence\n\nthat several of the metal supports had become detached, and that others\n\nwere corroded, but that most remained in place.         Moreover, the\n\nevidence, even when viewed in the most favorable light to the\n\nappellant, indicates that the outer roof and ceiling were more than a\n\n\"shell,\" and were in fact capable of supporting normal roof loads.\n\nEven if Clendenning allows hidden changes such as these as sufficient\n\nvisual evidence of a collapse, it requires a more complete\n\ndeterioration than is revealed in the evidence submitted here. Id. at\n\n661 (\"The hidden destructive process must run its full course to be\n\ninsurable. . . .    There are no degrees of collapse.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          This concludes our analysis. Even if the district court\n\noffered a narrower definition of collapse than that provided for by\n\nMassachusetts law in Clendenning, appellants have not introduced\n\nsufficient evidence to satisfy that aspect of the definition with which\n\nthey agree, nor have they placed any material facts sufficiently at\n\nissue to require a jury trial.      Summary judgment was therefore\n\nappropriate.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

The court held that a collapse \"must include a sudden and  completed event that results in a noticeably altered appearance.\"  Id. at 16.  In other words, under Massachusetts law, a collapse has three  elements: suddenness, a perceptible change in appearance, and  completeness.  The court also held that evidence of internal  deterioration within the roof structure was insufficient under Clendenning, given that the roof still performed its basic functions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A collapse] must result in some significant  primary . . . element of the structure becoming  disengaged or falling down so that it no longer  is performing its characteristic function in the  building.

The breakdown of subsidiary  elements such as several metal webs is not in  itself sufficient to constitute a collapse. Id. at 16-17; see also id. at 12 (\"[T]he Clendenning opinion . . . cannot support the proposition that an arguably sagging  roof, or deteriorating support system that had become structurally  unsound but had not fallen in or become detached from the pertinent  structures, is a 'collapse.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also determined that St. Paul had not abandoned the  policy's definition of \"collapse\" by either evidentiary admission or  estoppel, id. at 17-21,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and that even if there had been a collapse, it  resulted not from the heavy snowstorm but from long-term wear and tear  (corrosion) explicitly excluded by the St. Paul policy, id. at 27.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants do not challenge the facts recited by the district  court in making its determination, nor do they argue with the district  court's use of Clendenning as the source of the Massachusetts law of  collapse.  Instead, they make a two-prong argument.  First, they  suggest that the district court's refusal to consider an unseen failure  of structural elements within an enclosed roof system to be a potential  \"collapse\" was erroneous.  Appellants argue that \"a loss of structural  integrity coupled with some movement or alteration of the appearance of  a portion of the building\" could indeed be a collapse under  Massachusetts law.  Second, they argue that under this revised  definition, they introduced sufficient facts to survive summary  judgment: (i) that structural elements within the Shipway roof failed  and in some instances became detached; (ii) that ceilings sagged  perceptibly; (iii) that there were measurable deflection readings; and  (iv) that there was \"ponding\" on roof surfaces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded.  Appellants do not challenge the  district court's requirement that the collapse result in a \"noticeably  altered physical appearance.\"  Id. at 16; see also Clendenning, 700  N.E.2d at 660 (requiring \"a visual element of altered appearance that  comprises a structural collapse, distinct from the degenerative process  causing the collapse\").  In fact, appellants' own definition  contemplates that there be \"some movement or alteration of the appearance of a portion of the building\" (emphasis added).  Moreover,  in support of their position, they claim that there was \"a clear visual  element of altered appearance.\"  The district court found that  appellants had adduced no evidence of externally observable changes in  the roof's appearance, and our review of the record confirms this  determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there is no evidence that any roof (other than that  of Unit 33) sagged perceptibly to the naked eye.  Not only have  appellants not pointed us towards any testimony of perceptible sagging  in their appellate brief, but our careful review of the various  engineering reports in the record has not discerned any such testimony. As the district court pointed out, with the exception of Unit 33,  \"there is no evidence that any resident complained of, or even noticed,  any damage to a ceiling.\"  Second, although the roof deflection was  measurable using a specialized apparatus called a \"story pole,\" and was  significant enough in some cases to violate the Massachusetts building  code, appellants have not suggested that a deflection of less than one  inch can be perceived without engineering knowledge and equipment.  We  agree with the district court that, as a matter of law, a deflection of  less than one inch is insufficient to create a \"noticeably altered  physical appearance\" in the building.  The policy's exclusion of  \"settling, cracking, bulging, shrinking or expansion\" from the  definition of a collapse further supports the determination that deminimus deflection does not meet the legal definition of collapse. Third, although there may have been observable post-snowstorm \"ponding\"  on the Shipway roofs, appellants have introduced no evidence that the  \"ponding\" is a post-collapse phenomenon.  A collapse requires that  there have been a change in appearance; lacking any evidence that the  \"ponding\" observed in 1999 had not always occurred on the allegedly  \"previously flat\" roofs, this evidentiary requirement is not met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that under Clendenning, the relevant  changes to the roof's appearance may occur within the space between the  ceiling and the outer roof.  To this end, appellants point to evidence  of observable damage to the roof's internal support structure not  revealed until workers entered that space to make repairs.  We can  posit a situation in which the elements of Clendenning are satisfied,  but no damage is visible either from within the apartment itself or  from outside the building: for example, if many of the metal pieces  comprising the roof's internal support structure detached from one  another, yet somehow the outer roof and ceiling remained intact as an  apparently unchanged \"shell\" with no ability to support any weight. Such was not the case here.  At best, appellants introduced evidence  that several of the metal supports had become detached, and that others  were corroded, but that most remained in place.  Moreover, the  evidence, even when viewed in the most favorable light to the  appellant, indicates that the outer roof and ceiling were more than a  \"shell,\" and were in fact capable of supporting normal roof loads. Even if Clendenning allows hidden changes such as these as sufficient  visual evidence of a collapse, it requires a more complete  deterioration than is revealed in the evidence submitted here.  Id. at  661 (\"The hidden destructive process must run its full course to be  insurable. . . .  There are no degrees of collapse.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This concludes our analysis.  Even if the district court  offered a narrower definition of collapse than that provided for by  Massachusetts law in Clendenning, appellants have not introduced  sufficient evidence to satisfy that aspect of the definition with which  they agree, nor have they placed any material facts sufficiently at  issue to require a jury trial.

Appellee St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company  (St. Paul) denied coverage after concluding that: (i) no \"collapse\" had  occurred, as required by the insurance policy; and (ii) any collapse  that did occur was not caused by the heavy snow, but resulted from  corrosion damage explicitly excluded by the policy.  Appellants brought  suit for breach of contract.  The district court granted summary  judgment to St. Paul.  Dreiblatt v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,  No. 99-11334-DPW, at 27 (D. Mass.

The material  facts, which we review here, are essentially undisputed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shipway Place is a nine building condominium complex in  Charlestown, Massachusetts.  The roofs of all nine buildings are flat,  with a structure consisting of wood trusses supported by wood and metal  webs and covered with plywood sheathing.  The roof exterior is covered  with a rubber membrane weighed down by stones for ballast.  The ceiling  of the top unit in each apartment building is made of plaster attached  directly to the roof structure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shipway's insurance policy is provided by St. Paul.  The policy insures \"against the risk of direct physical loss or damage  involving collapse of a building or any part of a building\" due to  causes including the \"weight of ice and snow or sleet.\"  The policy  does not define the term \"collapse,\" but provides that \"[c]ollapse  doesn't include settling, cracking, bulging, shrinking, or expansion.\" The policy also specifically denies coverage for loss \"caused or made  worse\" by \"wear and tear\" or \"deterioration, mold, wet or dry rot, rust  or corrosion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, 1997, a heavy snow fell on Boston.  Following the  storm, the owners of Shipway Unit 33 returned to their condominium to  discover that their living room ceiling was \"hanging down a couple of  inches.\"  The ceiling was repaired in September 1997 and St. Paul paid  for the damage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of repairing the roof to Unit 33, Shipway  discovered extensive damage to its internal support structure.  The  engineering firm of Simpson, Gumpertz &amp; Heger (SGH) was hired to  investigate the problem further.  In the course of its investigation,  SGH found that several of the metal trusses in the roof to Unit 33 were  \"failed and severely corroded,\" and that the problem extended to roof  supports in many of the other units.  In a November 18, 1997 report,  SGH warned that \"a collapse of the roof structure is possible.\"  Based  on further study, in July 1998, Shipway gave notice to St. Paul that it  sought to claim damage to all nine buildings based on the April 1997  snowstorm.  St. Paul denied the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four other entities evaluated Shipway's roof damage after  SGH.  In November 1998, city inspector Jay Duca evaluated the ceilings  of Units 32 and 34.  He concluded that at least some parts of the roof  system had rusted and deteriorated, and issued a citation warning the  unit owners that the ceilings needed to be repaired.  In deposition  testimony, Duca indicated that he did not feel that a collapse had  occurred prior to his visit; however, he testified that he had warned  owners that \"there was a danger of a collapse of the roof.\"  He also  noted that \"it looked like there was some deflection [in the roof], but  [that the deflection] could have been normal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in November 1998, Shipway hired engineering firm C.I.D.  Associates (CID) to provide a second opinion.  A CID report indicated  findings of deterioration, collapse, flaking and de-lamination of metal  webbing, sagging or failure of the plywood roof deck, and collapse of  the ceiling onto the floor in various units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The report's author, Paul  O'Connor, testified only that he observed puddles of water on some of  the roofs, and that such \"ponding\" may suggest a sagging roof  structure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1999, Medeiros Property Management Consulting  conducted \"deflection readings\" on all of the Shipway units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  A number  of the deflections measured exceeded that allowable under the  Massachusetts Building Code (3/16 of an inch) but none of the  measurements showed deflection of greater than one inch.  Based on  these deflection readings, expert Rene Mugnier testified that one could  conclude from the deflection readings that there had been a complete  collapse of the plywood deck resulting from the snowstorm.  Mugnier did  not base his deduction on any legal definition of the word \"collapse.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Wiss, Janney and Elster Associates (WJE), an  engineering firm retained by St. Paul, examined the roof systems in  1999 while they were being repaired.

Summary judgment was therefore  appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>   Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   Appellants are individual trustees of the Shipway Place Condominium  Association.
