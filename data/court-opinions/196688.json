Robert  Randazzo was  president\r                                      \r\n\nand majority shareholder of  New England Shrimp Company (\"the\r\n\nCompany\"),   a   Massachusetts  corporation   that  imported,\r\n\nprocessed,  and  distributed shrimp.    In  February 1994,  a\r\n\nfederal grand  jury returned a 101-count indictment, charging\r\n\nRandazzo--and  in most  counts the  Company as  well--with an\r\n\narray  of offenses.   The  offenses fell  into  two different\r\n\ncategories:  97 \"shrimp\" charges and four \"tax\" charges.  \r\n\n     The shrimp  charges, counts  1 through 97,  alleged that\r\n\nRandazzo and the Company used certain substances in producing\r\n\nshrimp  that  were  prohibited  or  at  least  needed  to  be\r\n\ndisclosed  on labels.   The  substances increased  profits by\r\n\naltering the weight or color of the shrimp, which was sold to\r\n\nthe Department of Defense  and various commercial purchasers.\r\n\nThese allegations underpinned four charges  of conspiracy, 18\r\n\nU.S.C.     371, and  93  substantive counts  of  making false\r\n\nstatements to and claims against the United States, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  287,  and introducing  misbranded or adulterated  food into\r\n\ninterstate commerce, 21 U.S.C.    331(a), (k) and 333(a)(2).\r\n\n     The  tax charges,  counts 98  through 101,  were brought\r\n\nagainst Randazzo  alone and  alleged that  he had  caused the\r\n\nCompany to file  false corporate  tax returns.   26 U.S.C.   \r\n\n7206(1).    Specifically,  the  government  claimed  Randazzo\r\n\nmisreported as  sales expenses cash  sums that he  was taking\r\n\nweekly from the Company for personal use and that the Company\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nreturns listed as  corporate expenses the  wages of a  person\r\n\nwho worked  exclusively for  the Randazzo family  on personal\r\n\nmatters.       After  a 10-day  jury  trial in  October 1994,\r\n\nRandazzo was convicted on all counts.  He was sentenced to 36\r\n\nmonths in prison, reflecting a significant downward departure\r\n\nfrom the  Sentencing Guidelines range.   He now  appeals from\r\n\nhis  conviction but  not  his sentence,  contending that  the\r\n\ntrial  court erred  as  to joinder,  alleged multiplicity  of\r\n\ncharges, and instructions.  The pertinent facts are set forth\r\n\nas necessary in discussing the separate claims of error.\r\n\n                  I.  JOINDER OF COUNTS     \r\n\n     Randazzo claims  that joining the 97  shrimp counts with\r\n\nthe four  tax counts  was improper.   Fed. R.  Crim. P.  8(a)\r\n\npermits joinder of counts against  a single defendant only if\r\n\nthe  offenses \"are of the same or similar character,\" or \"are\r\n\nbased  on the same act or transaction  or on two or more acts\r\n\nor transactions connected together or constituting parts of a\r\n\ncommon  scheme  or  plan.\"     The  district  court  rejected\r\n\nRandazzo's  motion to sever based  on Rule 8(a),  and, as the\r\n\nissue  turns on  a construction  of the  rule, we  review the\r\n\ndecision de novo.  United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 895\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993). \r\n\n     Rule 8(a)'s joinder provision is generously construed in\r\n\nfavor  of joinder, United States v.  Robichaux, 995 F.2d 565,\r                                                          \r\n\n569 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 114  S. Ct. 322 (1993), in part\r                                        \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nbecause  Fed. R.  Crim. P.  14 provides  a separate  layer of\r\n\nprotection where it is most needed.  Under Rule 14, the trial\r\n\njudge has  discretion to order  severance of counts,  even if\r\n\nproperly joined  under Rule  8(a), to avoid  undue prejudice.\r\n\nHere,  the   district  court  denied  Randazzo's  motion  for\r\n\nseverance  under Rule 14 and he has not appealed that ruling.\r\n\nNevertheless, Rule 8(a) does forbid joinder unless the counts\r\n\nmeet  one  of  the   conditions  already  quoted,  and  those\r\n\nconditions,  although  phrased  in  general  terms,  are  not\r\n\ninfinitely elastic.\r\n\n     One basis  for joinder, invoked by  the government here,\r\n\nis  where the  counts  involve acts  comprising  parts of  \"a\r\n\ncommon scheme or plan.\"   As the government points  out, this\r\n\nrubric  is often used to join false statement claims with tax\r\n\nfraud charges where the tax fraud involves failure  to report\r\n\nspecific  income obtained  by  the false  statements.   E.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States v. Whitworth,  856 F.2d  1268, 1277  (9th Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1988),  cert. denied,  489  U.S. 1084  (1989).   Indeed,  the\r                                \r\n\nfailure to report may help conceal the fraud.  \r\n\n     The present case  is quite different and offers  no such\r\n\nconnection  between  the shrimp  and  tax  counts.   Randazzo\r\n\nreduced   the  Company's  reportable  income  by  overstating\r\n\ncorporate expenses.  But it was pure happenstance whether the\r\n\noverstated  expenses  happened  to  reduce  legal  income  or\r\n\nillegal income of the Company.  The misconduct underlying the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nshrimp counts and  the improper claiming  of expenses on  the\r\n\nreturns  were not  part of the  same \"scheme or  plan\" in any\r\n\nsense of the  phrase.   Accord United States  v. Halper,  590\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 422, 429-30 (2d Cir. 1978) (rejecting a similar argument\r\n\nby the government).   \r\n\n     Alternatively, the  government says that the  shrimp and\r\n\ntax charges are  of the \"same  or similar character\"  because\r\n\n(ignoring sales  to commercial buyers) both  sets of offenses\r\n\ninvolved  the use of falsehoods or omissions to profit at the\r\n\nexpense of the  federal government.   Further, it notes  that\r\n\nmany facts are common to both  sets of charges:  for example,\r\n\nthey  occurred  during  overlapping time  frames;  Randazzo's\r\n\ncontrol  over the  Company  was  a  common element;  and  the\r\n\nCompany's  sagging  financial  condition  provided  a  common\r\n\nmotive.  \r\n\n     It  is  obvious why  Congress  provided  for joinder  of\r\n\ncounts that  grow out of related  transactions--ones that are\r\n\n\"connected\"  or \"part of a common scheme or plan\"; the reason\r\n\nfor allowing joinder of offenses having  \"the same or similar\r\n\ncharacter\"  is less clear.1   But whatever  the rationale, we\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The \"same  or similar\" language was  drawn from earlier\r\nlaw without  explanation. 1  C. Wright, Federal  Practice and\r                                                                         \r\nProcedure: Criminal    141 (2d ed. 1982).  About the best one\r                               \r\ncan say  is that in such  cases the evidence of  one crime is\r\nmore  likely to  be  independently  admissible,  on  theories\r\nreflected  in  Fed. R.  Evid. 404(b),  in proving  the other,\r\n\"similar\" crime.  E.g., United States v. Shue, 766 F.2d 1122,\r                                                         \r\n1134 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 956 (1987).  See\r                                                                         \r\nalso McElroy v. United  States, 164 U.S. 76 (1896)(discussing\r                                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nthink  that  it  is very  hard  to  describe adulterating  or\r\n\nmislabeling shrimp as offenses \"similar\" to tax fraud--except\r\n\nat a level of  generality so high as to drain the term of any\r\n\nreal  content.   Even  the  government's best  case  does not\r\n\nstretch  as far  as  the present  facts.   United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nLevine, 983 F.2d 165, 167-68 (10th Cir. 1992) (bank fraud and\r                  \r\n\nmail fraud).\r\n\n     As  to the presence of  evidence common to  both sets of\r\n\ncounts, we agree that  the extent of common evidence  plays a\r\n\nrole  in implementing Rule 8(a).  United States v. Taylor, 54\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir. 1995).   But Congress did not provide\r\n\nfor joinder  for unrelated transactions and dissimilar crimes\r\n\nmerely  because some evidence might  be common to  all of the\r\n\ncounts.    Indeed, looking  to  the  important evidence,  the\r                                                          \r\n\nshrimp and tax  counts in  this case seem  to revolve  around\r\n\nquite different facts.    \r\n\n     But all  this  is largely  for the  benefit of  district\r\n\ncourts  in  future cases,  because  the  misjoinder here  was\r\n\npatently  harmless.  United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449\r                                                      \r\n\n(1986).   The evidence against Randazzo on the tax counts was\r\n\noverwhelming.   Randazzo does  not seriously  claim otherwise\r\n\nbut  argues that the evidence  on the shrimp  counts was thin\r\n\nand that the jury was, or may well have been, swayed on those\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n\"same class of crime\" provision).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\ncounts by  the evidence  (inadmissible save for  the joinder)\r\n\nthat Randazzo was cheating on taxes.  \r\n\n     We disagree,  concluding that the  government has  amply\r\n\ncarried  its  burden   to  show  that   the  error  did   not\r\n\n\"substantially influence[] the jury's  decision.\"  O'Neal  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMcAninch, 115 S. Ct. 992, 995 (1995).  As to each of the four\r                    \r\n\nconspiracies charged in the shrimp counts, at least one high-\r\n\nranking Company official testified that he had discussed with\r\n\nRandazzo the fact that the given ingredient was prohibited or\r\n\nhad to be  disclosed, and  each testified  that Randazzo  had\r\n\nnevertheless ordered  that the  ingredient  be added,  making\r\n\nclear in several cases the aim was higher profits. \r\n\n     Other  evidence showed  that Randazzo  kept close  watch\r\n\nover  production  and  had the  final  say  over  the mix  of\r\n\ningredients.   In one instance Randazzo  learned that another\r\n\nproducer  had been told to  stop using an  ingredient and, on\r\n\ninvestigating  the  report,  Randazzo  discovered   that  the\r\n\ningredient could be used to change the color of the shrimp to\r\n\nresemble a more expensive variety; he then ordered its use in\r\n\nhis  own  shrimp.   Randazzo  also  played  a  major role  in\r\n\narranging for  the destruction of  evidence.  The  tax counts\r\n\nsimply did not matter.\r\n\n                      II.  MULTIPLICITY\r\n\n     Randazzo's second  claim of error, relating  both to the\r\n\nindictment and  to the  jury instructions,  is that the  four\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nalleged conspiracies should  have been  charged as  one.   He\r\n\nargues   that,  when  coupled   with  the   misjoinder,  this\r\n\nmultiplicity  contributed  to  the  impression  that  he  was\r\n\ncriminally disposed.   Briefly,  these were the  four alleged\r\n\nconspiracies:\r\n\n     1.   Count  1  charged that  Randazzo conspired  to make\r\n\nfalse statements  to, and  claims against, the  government by\r\n\nselling  the  Department  of  Defense shrimp  containing  the\r\n\nchemical  sodium tripolyphosphate  (\"STP\"),  in violation  of\r\n\ncontract obligations.  STP causes shrimp to absorb and retain\r\n\nmoisture, which in turn boosts profits because the shrimp was\r\n\nsold by weight.  \r\n\n     2.   Count 52 charged that Randazzo conspired to sell to\r\n\nthe  public  shrimp  that  had  been  adulterated  by  adding\r\n\nsaccharin,  an additive  prohibited  by federal  regulations.\r\n\nThe government  alleged that  the Company added  saccharin to\r\n\nmask the taste of the STP. \r\n\n     3.   Count 65 charged that Randazzo conspired to add the\r\n\nchemical sodium hydroxide to certain types of shrimp in order\r\n\nto give them a pinkish  color.  Randazzo then passed off  the\r\n\naltered shrimp  to customers as naturally  pink shrimp, which\r\n\nis rarer than other varieties and commands higher prices.    \r\n\n     4.   Count  79 charged  that Randazzo  added STP  to the\r\n\nCompany's  line  of  frozen   raw  breaded  shrimp,  sold  to\r\n\nwholesalers and the public, contrary to federal regulations. \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     It is  a recurring question in  conspiracy cases whether\r\n\nrelated   illegal  agreements  comprise   one  conspiracy  or\r\n\nseveral.  Because  the agreements are often  not explicit and\r\n\nare  regularly inferred  from conduct, the  courts ordinarily\r\n\ntreat the issue  as one  of fact and  offer various  criteria\r\n\nthat might  help the  factfinder distinguish:   these include\r\n\ncommonality   vel  non   of  the   nature,  motive,   design,\r                                  \r\n\nimplementation, and logistics  of the illegal activities,  as\r\n\nwell  as  the scope  of  co-conspirator  involvement.   E.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 241 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 498 U.S. 849 (1990).\r                  \r\n\n     Each of  the conspiracies in  this case had  a different\r\n\nspecific purpose;  each involved  different conduct;  and the\r\n\ntime  periods  covered were  different.    Randazzo makes  no\r\n\neffort whatever  to dispute  these differences in  his brief.\r\n\nRather,  he says  that all  of the  agreements  concerned the\r\n\nCompany's   production  of  shrimp   and  alleged  fraudulent\r\n\nconcealment,  and he  points to  some common  elements (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthat  two of the conspiracies  related to use  of STP--one on\r\n\nmilitary sales and the other on sales to the public).\r\n\n       We will assume  arguendo that a jury  might have found\r                                           \r\n\nthat  there  was an  overarching  conspiracy  to sell  shrimp\r\n\nthrough  various deceptive practices  that were  altered from\r\n\ntime to  time.  But on  the evidence presented,  the jury was\r\n\nnot compelled to so find, and that is enough.  As it happens,\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nsuch  an overarching  conspiracy,  if it  existed, might  not\r\n\npreclude  the  conviction  of  Randazzo  for  the  individual\r\n\nsubsumed   conspiracies   if   they  were   also   proved--an\r\n\ninteresting  problem  that need  not  be decided  here.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

He  points  out that  each  conspiracy count  alleged\r\n\nseveral  different illegal  purposes  (e.g., count  1 alleged\r                                                       \r\n\nviolations of  18 U.S.C.     287, 1001,  and 1516).   And, he\r\n\nconcludes,   the   conspiracy   counts    together   involved\r\n\ninstructions  on 17  different  offenses.   The result,  says\r\n\nRandazzo,   was   \"a   lengthy   and   confusing   [set   of]\r\n\ninstruction[s] that the jury could not reasonably be expected\r\n\nto apply.\" \r\n\n     Jury confusion is a legitimate concern in this case, but\r\n\nit  cannot be proved by simply noting the number of offenses.\r\n\nThere  is  no  automatic   ban  on  multiple  counts   in  an\r\n\nindictment, or on charging  a conspiratorial agreement having\r\n\nmultiple unlawful purposes.   Braverman v. United States, 317\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 49, 54  (1942).  Randazzo  had a chance  to show us  how\r\n\nspecific language or organization of the  instructions misled\r\n\nthe jury; but his brief points to nothing specific, let alone\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nto  any  properly preserved  objection or  request concerning\r\n\nthis issue.\r\n\n                III.  \"OTHER CRIMES\" EVIDENCE\r\n\n     At   trial  the  prosecution  introduced  some  evidence\r\n\nsuggesting  Randazzo's  involvement  in  previous,  uncharged\r\n\nmisbranding, adulteration and tax  fraud offenses.  On appeal\r\n\nRandazzo does  not challenge the admission  of this evidence.\r\n\nBut  he claims  that  the trial  court  should have  given  a\r\n\nrequested  standard instruction  that  evidence of  uncharged\r\n\ncrimes may not be considered as evidence of his propensity to\r\n\ncommit  crimes.

E.g.,  United States v.  Santagata, 924 F.2d  391,\r                                                         \r\n\n393-95  (1st Cir.  1991).   Although  its soundness  has been\r\n\nquestioned, E. Imwinkelried,  Uncharged Misconduct Evidence  \r                                                                       \r\n\n9.62 (1995), we are not free to disregard circuit  precedent.\r\n\nBut in  reality \"direct evidence\" and  \"Rule 404(b) evidence\"\r\n\nare not mutually exclusive  categories, but loose labels that\r\n\ncan sometimes plausibly be applied to the same conduct.  And,\r                                                          \r\n\nas  usual, below the surface there are problems of policy and\r\n\nof degree.\r\n\n     The general rule is that evidence of the defendant's bad\r\n\nacts or crimes,  other than those charged in  the indictment,\r\n\nis admissible, subject to conditions, if relevant in some way\r\n\napart  from the  forbidden  inference that  the defendant  is\r\n\ncriminally inclined.  Rule 404;  see People v. Zackowitz, 172\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E. 466, 468 (1930) (Cardozo, J.).  The  standard conditions\r\n\ninclude  the usual balancing  of relevance against prejudice,\r\n\nFed.  R. Evid. 403, and use of a limiting instruction telling\r\n\nthe jury not to draw the forbidden inference,  Fed. R.  Evid.\r\n\n105.  See Huddleston  v. United States, 485 U.S.  681, 691-92\r                                                  \r\n\n(1988).\r\n\n     The  general rule,  and  the conditions,  may be  easily\r\n\napplied  where  the \"other\"  crimes  are  reasonably distinct\r\n\n(e.g.,  in  time and  place) from  the  crime charged  in the\r                 \r\n\nindictment.   But where the  \"other\" crimes are  more closely\r\n\nentangled with the events  that comprise the charged offense,\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\na number of courts  have declined to apply the  label \"other\"\r\n\nor to require the limiting instruction.  E.g., Santagata, 924\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 395,  (evidence that those charged  with drug dealing\r\n\nhad been carrying guns).\r\n\n       The argument  for the  distinction made by  cases like\r\n\nSantagata is that where  the \"other\" (i.e., uncharged) crimes\r                                                      \r\n\nare closely  entangled with the crimes  charged, the strength\r\n\nof the permitted inference--e.g., that guns are often used to\r                                            \r\n\nprotect  drugs--may effectively  submerge the  forbidden one.\r\n\nSee Rossetti v. Curran, No. 95-1978, slip op. at 13 (1st Cir.\r                                  \r\n\nMarch 21,  1996).   The argument against  the distinction  is\r\n\nthat  sometimes  the   forbidden  \"bad  character\"  inference\r                           \r\n\nremains  a potential  menace  even in  cases like  Santagata.\r                                                                        \r\n\nObviously  much depends  on the  crimes involved  and on  the\r\n\nfacts of the individual case.\r\n\n     In the present case,  at least one or two  categories of\r\n\nthe \"other\"  crimes described  in the appendix  were distinct\r\n\nenough from  the crimes actually  charged that it  would have\r\n\nmade sense  to include a single  general limiting instruction\r\n\nin  the final charge  to the jury.2   Nothing more was sought\r\n\nin  this case.  Perhaps the safe course for a district court,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2The  proof of  personal  income tax  violations is  the\r\nclearest  case.  The use of sugar,  to the extent it appeared\r\nto be a separate  wrong, could also be regarded  as distinct.\r\nThe other categories of alleged \"other\"  crimes listed in the\r\nappendix  are more  debatable  since  they primarily  involve\r\naspects of  the  same charged  crime  that happened  to  fall\r\noutside the limitations period.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nwherever  the matter is in doubt,  is (where asked) to give a\r\n\nclosing  general  instruction that  bad  character  is not  a\r\n\npermissible inference.\r\n\n     But here  a limiting instruction could  not have altered\r\n\nthe  result and  omitting  it was  at  worst harmless  error.\r\n\nUnited States v.  King, 897  F.2d 911, 915  (7th Cir.  1990).\r                                  \r\n\nThe most potent \"other crimes\" evidence related to Randazzo's\r\n\npersonal tax  offenses; but the evidence  against Randazzo on\r\n\nthe corporate tax offenses was overwhelming.  Conversely, the\r\n\narguable \"other crimes\" evidence bearing on the shrimp counts\r\n\nwas either very mild  or so similar and closely  connected to\r\n\nthe  actual  crimes  charged as  largely  to  rob  it of  the\r\n\nindependent \"bad character\" sting which the instruction means\r\n\nto forestall.\r\n\n                       IV.  MATERIALITY\r\n\n     Randazzo claims that on  six counts, each involving some\r\n\nform  of false  representation or  omission, the  trial judge\r\n\nerred  in  deciding that  the  statements  or omissions  were\r\n\n\"material\" instead of submitting the materiality issue to the\r\n\njury.  Two  counts (counts  1 and 65)  charged Randazzo  with\r\n\nconspiring  inter  alia  to  make  false  statements  to  the\r                                   \r\n\ngovernment in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1001; and the four tax\r\n\ncounts  (counts  98-101)  alleged  that   Randazzo  willfully\r\n\noverstated expenses on the corporate tax returns in violation\r\n\nof 26 U.S.C.   7601(1).    \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\n     At  the  pre-charge conference  Randazzo  said  that the\r\n\nmateriality issue in count 1 was an issue for the jury.  But,\r\n\nas was then common  in most circuits, e.g., United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nArcadipane, 41 F.3d  1, 7  (1st Cir. 1994),  the trial  judge\r                      \r\n\nruled  that materiality was for  the court and  held that the\r\n\nmateriality  requirement was  satisfied  as to  count 1.   We\r\n\nthink that she also decided the materiality issue on the four\r\n\ntax  counts.  As to count 65,  the judge did (for unexplained\r\n\nreasons) submit the issue of materiality to the jury.\r\n\n     Following  Randazzo's  conviction in  October  1994, the\r\n\nSupreme Court in  June 1995 decided United States  v. Gaudin,\r                                                                        \r\n\n115 S. Ct. 2310 (1995), and held that where materiality is an\r\n\nelement of a crime,  it must be submitted to  the jury.    In\r\n\nthis circuit, both of the offenses in question have been read\r\n\nto  include  a  materiality  requirement.3   Accordingly,  as\r\n\nRandazzo  is entitled to the benefit of the law prevailing at\r\n\nthe time of his  appeal, Griffith v. Kentucky, 479  U.S. 314,\r                                                         \r\n\n328 (1987),  it was \"error\" as  to five of the  six counts in\r\n\nquestion (counts 1 and 98-101) not  to submit the materiality\r\n\nissue to the jury.\r\n\n     If the harmless error  test were applied, Randazzo would\r\n\narguably be entitled  to a  new trial on  these counts,  even\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3Arcadipane, 41 F.3d at  7 (section 1001); United States\r                                                                         \r\nv.

This is so;  but the question  is whether these\r\n\ncircumstances  make  any difference.    In  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCollins,  60 F.3d 4 (1st Cir. 1995), this court squarely held\r                   \r\n\nthat it  does not  make any  difference, and  the post-Gaudin\r                                                                         \r\n\ncases in other circuits imply the same view.\r\n\n     This result  might at  first be  surprising, but we  are\r\n\ndealing  with  an  accommodation  of   conflicting  concerns.\r\n\nRandazzo  is not  charged  with a  deliberate  waiver of  the\r\n\nobjection, which  might preclude its  consideration under any\r\n\nstandard.   E.g., United States  v. Marder, 48  F.3d 564 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir.),  cert. denied, 115 S.

And, although the trial  judge in this\r\n\ncase acted  properly under  then prevailing law,  Randazzo is\r\n\ngiven the benefit on direct review of a later change in law--\r\n\nif he can  meet the  customary plain error  tests that  Olano\r                                                                         \r\n\nsets forth  for  unpreserved error.

Although Randazzo's\r\n\nbrief struggles  imaginatively to find  a doubt based  on the\r\n\namount   of  the  misreported  expenses  in  comparison  with\r\n\ncorporate  income, the  amount (between  $45,000  and $60,000\r\n\neach  year)  was not  trivial  or  immaterial, even  assuming\r\n\ndubitante that  amount matters  in the  case of a  deliberate\r                     \r\n\nfalsification.  Compare United  States v. Greenberg, 735 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n29, 31 (2d Cir. 1984).\r\n\n     As  for  the  use of  STP  in  shrimp--forbidden by  the\r\n\nCompany's   government  contracts--the   prosecution  offered\r\n\nevidence  that  STP  increased   the  weight  of  the  shrimp\r\n\n(apparently by more than five percent) and therefore the cost\r\n\nto the government.   In fact, the prosecution showed  that in\r\n\none  instance where  the  presence of  STP was  revealed, the\r\n\ngovernment  rejected  the  Company's  shipment.    Given  the\r\n\ncontract  ban and the  increased cost, the  failure to reveal\r\n\nthe use of STP was patently material.\r\n\n                     V.  PROCESSING AID  \r\n\n     The last issue concerns  Randazzo's claim that the court\r\n\nmisinstructed the jury on the definition of \"processing aid,\"\r\n\na  term pertinent  to the misbranding  offense in  this case.\r\n\nCount 65 charged Randazzo with conspiring to sell, and counts\r\n\n66-78 with  selling, shrimp that  was misbranded; and  one of\r\n\nthe three forms  of misbranding charged (any one sufficed for\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nconviction) was  that the  label inaccurately failed  to list\r\n\nsodium hydroxide as an ingredient.   The statute, 21 U.S.C.  \r\n\n343(i)(2),  provides  that  failure  to  list  an  ingredient\r\n\nconstitutes  misbranding unless  the omission is  exempted by\r\n\nregulation.\r\n\n     Sodium hydroxide had clearly been added to the shrimp in\r\n\nquestion, but it was Randazzo's position that this ingredient\r\n\ndid no more than  bring out or restore the  allegedly natural\r\n\npink color of the shrimp and that the ingredient was exempted\r\n\nfrom listing as a \"processing aid.\"  The regulation exempting\r\n\n\"processing aids\" defines them to include the following:\r\n\n          Substances that are added  to a food  for\r\n          their technical or  functional effect  in\r\n          the  processing  but are  present  in the\r\n          finished food at insignificant levels and\r\n          do  not have any  technical or functional\r\n          effect in that food.\r\n\n21 C.F.R.   101.100(a)(3)(ii)(c).\r                                           \r\n\n     In  charging the jury, the trial court did not read this\r\n\nquoted  language verbatim,  although Randazzo  had asked  for\r\n\nsuch an instruction.   Instead, the court told the  jury that\r\n\nthe jury could find  misbranding if the label failed  to list\r\n\neach ingredient but, \"if an ingredient is merely a processing\r\n\naid,  it  does  not  have  to be  listed.    However,  if the\r\n\ningredient  has  a  functional  or technical  effect  on  the\r\n\nproduct, such as changing  its color, it is not  a processing\r\n\naid and it must be listed as an ingredient.\"\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\n     Following  the charge,  the  court  invited  objections.\r\n\nRandazzo did not object  to the failure to read  the verbatim\r\n\ndefinition of processing aid, and  the omission was not plain\r\n\nerror.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 30.  But his counsel did say: \"I\r                       \r\n\nobject  to  the use  of the  phrase  `changing its  color' in\r\n\nconnection  with  the standard  of  identity.\"   Despite  the\r\n\ngarble  (the  \"standard of  identity\"  concept  related to  a\r\n\ndifferent set of counts not  involving color), we think  that\r\n\nthe  district  court  likely  understood the  thrust  of  the\r\n\nobjection. \r\n\n     This takes us to the question whether the district court\r\n\nwas  right in  glossing the  regulation to  exclude from  the\r\n\ndefinition of \"processing aid\"  an ingredient that \"change[s]\r\n\n[the food's]  color.\"   However, Randazzo  offers nothing--by\r\n\nway   of   textual   analysis,    precedent,   administrative\r\n\ninterpretation, policy argument, or anything else--to support\r\n\nhis  underlying position,  namely,  that an  ingredient  that\r\n\nmerely brings  out a supposedly natural color is a processing\r\n\naid.\r\n\n     The government's reading of the regulations is not self-\r\n\nevidently wrong; indeed, the government now suggests that the\r\n\n\"change of  color\" instruction was actually  too favorable to\r\n\nthe defense (but the government  proposed the language).6  In\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     6The  government  relies  for its  new  contention  upon\r\nanother  regulation  describing  \"the  physical  or technical\r\nfunctional effects\"  for which  \"ingredients may be  added to\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\nall events, it is the appellant's responsibility to make some\r\n\nshowing that an error  has been committed.

There was evidence  that the Company  used sugar in\r\n\nprocessing  shrimp for  an unspecified  period before  it was\r\n\ndiscontinued in favor of saccharin in 1989.  No one testified\r\n\nexpressly that this use of sugar was illegal,  but this was a\r\n\nlikely inference,  given that  the evidence showed  the sugar\r\n\nwas  not identified on the  product label and  that sugar was\r\n\namong the ingredients concealed by falsified brine charts.   \r\n\n     2.   Testimony showed that STP was used in the Company's\r\n\nfrozen breaded shrimp from the 1970s, in violation of federal\r\n\nregulations and government contract provisions.  This conduct\r\n\nclearly  preceded the  indictment period  for count  1, which\r\n\nbegan  in 1989, although  the government  argues that  it was\r\n\nwithin the scope of the allegations in count 79, which stated\r\n\nthat the additive had  been used in commercially  sold shrimp\r\n\n\"from a  time not known to  the grand jury but  at least June\r\n\n1983.\"  \r\n\n     3.  There was evidence that, during the years alleged in\r\n\nthe  tax counts, Randazzo failed  to report as  income on his\r\n\npersonal tax  returns both the  cash sums  he allegedly  took\r\n\nfrom  the Company's  retail store  and the  personal services\r\n\nprovided by an assistant at Company expense. \r\r\n\n     4.  Testimony  by a  Company accountant  tended to  show\r\n\nthat  Randazzo engaged  in the  corporate tax  count offenses\r\n\nprior to the indictment period.  Specifically, the accountant\r\n\ntold  Randazzo  in a  1985  conversation  that something  was\r\n\nsuspect about  the bookkeeping for  the cash retail  sales of\r\n\nshrimp, and  also inquired as  to what Company  services were\r\n\nbeing performed  by the Randazzo family  assistant.  Randazzo\r\n\nallegedly told him it was none of his business.\r\r\n",

In February 1994, a federal grand jury returned a 101-count indictment, charging Randazzo--and in most counts the Company as well--with an array of offenses.  The offenses fell into two different categories:  97 \"shrimp\" charges and four \"tax\" charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The shrimp charges, counts 1 through 97, alleged that Randazzo and the Company used certain substances in producing shrimp that were prohibited or at least needed to be disclosed on labels.  The substances increased profits by altering the weight or color of the shrimp, which was sold to the Department of Defense and various commercial purchasers.  These allegations underpinned four charges of conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, and 93 substantive counts of making false statements to and claims against the United States, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 287, and introducing misbranded or adulterated food into interstate commerce, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 331(a), (k) and 333(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax charges, counts 98 through 101, were brought against Randazzo alone and alleged that he had caused the Company to file false corporate tax returns.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(1).  Specifically, the government claimed Randazzo misreported as sales expenses cash sums that he was taking weekly from the Company for personal use and that the Company returns listed as corporate expenses the wages of a person who worked exclusively for the Randazzo family on personal matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a 10-day jury trial in October 1994, Randazzo was convicted on all counts.  He was sentenced to 36 months in prison, reflecting a significant downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines range.  He now appeals from his conviction but not his sentence, contending that the trial court erred as to joinder, alleged multiplicity of charges, and instructions.  The pertinent facts are set forth as necessary in discussing the separate claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. JOINDER OF COUNTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randazzo claims that joining the 97 shrimp counts with the four tax counts was improper.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a) permits joinder of counts against a single defendant only if the offenses \"are of the same or similar character,\" or \"are based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\"   The district court rejected Randazzo's motion to sever based on Rule 8(a), and, as the issue turns on a construction of the rule, we review the decision de novo.  United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 895 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 8(a)'s joinder provision is generously construed in favor of joinder, United States v. Robichaux, hex F.2d 565, 569 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S.  922, 114 S.Ct. 322, 126 L.Ed.2d 268 (1993), in part because Fed.R.Crim.P. 14 provides a separate layer of protection where it is most needed.  Under Rule 14, the trial judge has discretion to order severance of counts, even if properly joined under Rule 8(a), to avoid undue prejudice.  Here, the district court denied Randazzo's motion for severance under Rule 14 and he has not appealed that ruling.  Nevertheless, Rule 8(a) does forbid joinder unless the counts meet one of the conditions already quoted, and those conditions, although phrased in general terms, are not infinitely elastic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One basis for joinder, invoked by the government here, is where the counts involve acts comprising parts of \"a common scheme or plan.\"   As the government points out, this rubric is often used to join false statement claims with tax fraud charges where the tax fraud involves failure to report specific income obtained by the false statements.  E.g., United States v. Whitworth, 856 F.2d 1268, 1277 (9th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1084, 109 S.Ct. 1541, 103 L.Ed.2d 846 (1989).  Indeed, the failure to report may help conceal the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present case is quite different and offers no such connection between the shrimp and tax counts.  Randazzo reduced the Company's reportable income by overstating corporate expenses.  But it was pure happenstance whether the overstated expenses happened to reduce legal income or illegal income of the Company.  The misconduct underlying the shrimp counts and the improper claiming of expenses on the returns were not part of the same \"scheme or plan\" in any sense of the phrase.  Accord United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d 422, 429-30 (2d Cir.1978) (rejecting a similar argument by the government).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the government says that the shrimp and tax charges are of the \"same or similar character\" because (ignoring sales to commercial buyers) both sets of offenses involved the use of falsehoods or omissions to profit at the expense of the federal government.  Further, it notes that many facts are common to both sets of charges:  for example, they occurred during overlapping time frames;  Randazzo's control over the Company was a common element;  and the Company's sagging financial condition provided a common motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious why Congress provided for joinder of counts that grow out of related transactions--ones that are \"connected\" or \"part of a common scheme or plan\";  the reason for allowing joinder of offenses having \"the same or similar character\" is less clear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But whatever the rationale, we think that it is very hard to describe adulterating or mislabeling shrimp as offenses \"similar\" to tax fraud--except at a level of generality so high as to drain the term of any real content.  Even the government's best case does not stretch as far as the present facts.  United States v. Levine, 983 F.2d 165, 167-68 (10th Cir.1992) (bank fraud and mail fraud).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the presence of evidence common to both sets of counts, we agree that the extent of common evidence plays a role in implementing Rule 8(a).  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir.1995).  But Congress did not provide for joinder for unrelated transactions and dissimilar crimes merely because some evidence might be common to all of the counts.  Indeed, looking to the important evidence, the shrimp and tax counts in this case seem to revolve around quite different facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But all this is largely for the benefit of district courts in future cases, because the misjoinder here was patently harmless.  United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449, 106 S.Ct. 725, 732, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986).  The evidence against Randazzo on the tax counts was overwhelming.  Randazzo does not seriously claim otherwise but argues that the evidence on the shrimp counts was thin and that the jury was, or may well have been, swayed on those counts by the evidence (inadmissible save for the joinder) that Randazzo was cheating on taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree, concluding that the government has amply carried its burden to show that the error did not \"substantially influence[ ] the jury's decision.\"  O'Neal v. McAninch, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, 995, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995).  As to each of the four conspiracies charged in the shrimp counts, at least one high-ranking Company official testified that he had discussed with Randazzo the fact that the given ingredient was prohibited or had to be disclosed, and each testified that Randazzo had nevertheless ordered that the ingredient be added, making clear in several cases the aim was higher profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other evidence showed that Randazzo kept close watch over production and had the final say over the mix of ingredients.  In one instance Randazzo learned that another producer had been told to stop using an ingredient and, on investigating the report, Randazzo discovered that the ingredient could be used to change the color of the shrimp to resemble a more expensive variety;  he then ordered its use in his own shrimp.  Randazzo also played a major role in arranging for the destruction of evidence.  The tax counts simply did not matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. MULTIPLICITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randazzo's second claim of error, relating both to the indictment and to the jury instructions, is that the four alleged conspiracies should have been charged as one.  He argues that, when coupled with the misjoinder, this multiplicity contributed to the impression that he was criminally disposed.  Briefly, these were the four alleged conspiracies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Count 1 charged that Randazzo conspired to make false statements to, and claims against, the government by selling the Department of Defense shrimp containing the chemical sodium tripolyphosphate (\"STP\"), in violation of contract obligations.  STP causes shrimp to absorb and retain moisture, which in turn boosts profits because the shrimp was sold by weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Count 52 charged that Randazzo conspired to sell to the public shrimp that had been adulterated by adding saccharin, an additive prohibited by federal regulations.  The government alleged that the Company added saccharin to mask the taste of the STP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Count 65 charged that Randazzo conspired to add the chemical sodium hydroxide to certain types of shrimp in order to give them a pinkish color.  Randazzo then passed off the altered shrimp to customers as naturally pink shrimp, which is rarer than other varieties and commands higher prices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Count 79 charged that Randazzo added STP to the Company's line of frozen raw breaded shrimp, sold to wholesalers and the public, contrary to federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a recurring question in conspiracy cases whether related illegal agreements comprise one conspiracy or several.  Because the agreements are often not explicit and are regularly inferred from conduct, the courts ordinarily treat the issue as one of fact and offer various criteria that might help the factfinder distinguish:  these include commonality vel non of the nature, motive, design, implementation, and logistics of the illegal activities, as well as the scope of co-conspirator involvement.  E.g., United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 241 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849, 111 S.Ct. 139, 112 L.Ed.2d 106 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the conspiracies in this case had a different specific purpose;  each involved different conduct;  and the time periods covered were different.  Randazzo makes no effort whatever to dispute these differences in his brief.  Rather, he says that all of the agreements concerned the Company's production of shrimp and alleged fraudulent concealment, and he points to some common elements (e.g., that two of the conspiracies related to use of STP--one on military sales and the other on sales to the public).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume arguendo that a jury might have found that there was an overarching conspiracy to sell shrimp through various deceptive practices that were altered from time to time.  But on the evidence presented, the jury was not compelled to so find, and that is enough.  As it happens, such an overarching conspiracy, if it existed, might not preclude the conviction of Randazzo for the individual subsumed conspiracies if they were also proved--an interesting problem that need not be decided here.  See United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 580-81, 109 S.Ct. 757, 767-68, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randazzo continues by arguing that the four charged \"overlapping conspiracies\" worked special prejudice in this case.  He points out that each conspiracy count alleged several different illegal purposes (e.g., count 1 alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 287, 1001, and 1516).  And, he concludes, the conspiracy counts together involved instructions on 17 different offenses.  The result, says Randazzo, was \"a lengthy and confusing [set of] instruction[s] that the jury could not reasonably be expected to apply.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury confusion is a legitimate concern in this case, but it cannot be proved by simply noting the number of offenses.  There is no automatic ban on multiple counts in an indictment, or on charging a conspiratorial agreement having multiple unlawful purposes.  Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 54, 63 S.Ct. 99, 102, 87 L.Ed. 23 (1942).  Randazzo had a chance to show us how specific language or organization of the instructions misled the jury;  but his brief points to nothing specific, let alone to any properly preserved objection or request concerning this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. \"OTHER CRIMES\" EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial the prosecution introduced some evidence suggesting Randazzo's involvement in previous, uncharged misbranding, adulteration and tax fraud offenses.  On appeal Randazzo does not challenge the admission of this evidence.  But he claims that the trial court should have given a requested standard instruction that evidence of uncharged crimes may not be considered as evidence of his propensity to commit crimes.  Fed.R.Evid. 105, 404;  see 3 L. Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions &#167; 74.03 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's response is that most of the evidence characterized by Randazzo as \"other uncharged conduct\" was \"direct evidence of the crimes charged, not Rule 404(b) evidence at all, and thus did not require the limiting instruction defendant proposed.\"   The government includes in this \"direct evidence\" category the Company's use of sugar and STP in shrimp in years prior to the indictment and evidence of Randazzo's failure to report income (e.g., the cash he took from the Company) on his personal tax returns.  In an appendix to this opinion, we set forth the episodes that are arguably in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law does contain such a distinction between \"direct evidence\" and \"other crimes\" or \"Rule 404(b)\" evidence.  E.g., United States v. Santagata, 924 F.2d 391, 393-95 (1st Cir.1991).  Although its soundness has been questioned, E. Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence &#167; 9.62 (1995), we are not free to disregard circuit precedent.  But in reality \"direct evidence\" and \"Rule 404(b) evidence\" are not mutually exclusive categories, but loose labels that can sometimes plausibly be applied to the same conduct.  And, as usual, below the surface there are problems of policy and of degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule is that evidence of the defendant's bad acts or crimes, other than those charged in the indictment, is admissible, subject to conditions, if relevant in some way apart from the forbidden inference that the defendant is criminally inclined.  Rule 404;  see People v. Zackowitz, 254 N.Y. 192, 172 N.E. 466, 468 (1930) (Cardozo, J.).  The standard conditions include the usual balancing of relevance against prejudice, Fed.R.Evid. 403, and use of a limiting instruction telling the jury not to draw the forbidden inference, Fed.R.Evid. 105.  See Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 691-92, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1502, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule, and the conditions, may be easily applied where the \"other\" crimes are reasonably distinct (e.g., in time and place) from the crime charged in the indictment.  But where the \"other\" crimes are more closely entangled with the events that comprise the charged offense, a number of courts have declined to apply the label \"other\" or to require the limiting instruction.  E.g., Santagata, 924 F.2d at 395, (evidence that those charged with drug dealing had been carrying guns).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument for the distinction made by cases like Santagata is that where the \"other\" (i.e., uncharged) crimes are closely entangled with the crimes charged, the strength of the permitted inference--e.g., that guns are often used to protect drugs--may effectively submerge the forbidden one.  See Rossetti v. Curran, 80 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1996).  The argument against the distinction is that sometimes the forbidden \"bad character\" inference remains a potential menace even in cases like Santagata.   Obviously much depends on the crimes involved and on the facts of the individual case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, at least one or two categories of the \"other\" crimes described in the appendix were distinct enough from the crimes actually charged that it would have made sense to include a single general limiting instruction in the final charge to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Nothing more was sought in this case.  Perhaps the safe course for a district court, wherever the matter is in doubt, is (where asked) to give a closing general instruction that bad character is not a permissible inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But here a limiting instruction could not have altered the result and omitting it was at worst harmless error.  United States v. King, 897 F.2d 911, 915 (7th Cir.1990).  The most potent \"other crimes\" evidence related to Randazzo's personal tax offenses;  but the evidence against Randazzo on the corporate tax offenses was overwhelming.  Conversely, the arguable \"other crimes\" evidence bearing on the shrimp counts was either very mild or so similar and closely connected to the actual crimes charged as largely to rob it of the independent \"bad character\" sting which the instruction means to forestall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. MATERIALITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randazzo claims that on six counts, each involving some form of false representation or omission, the trial judge erred in deciding that the statements or omissions were \"material\" instead of submitting the materiality issue to the jury.  Two counts (counts 1 and 65) charged Randazzo with conspiring inter alia to make false statements to the government in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001;  and the four tax counts (counts 98-101) alleged that Randazzo willfully overstated expenses on the corporate tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the pre-charge conference Randazzo said that the materiality issue in count 1 was an issue for the jury.  But, as was then common in most circuits, e.g., United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994), the trial judge ruled that materiality was for the court and held that the materiality requirement was satisfied as to count 1.  We think that she also decided the materiality issue on the four tax counts.  As to count 65, the judge did (for unexplained reasons) submit the issue of materiality to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Randazzo's conviction in October 1994, the Supreme Court in June 1995 decided United States v. Gaudin, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995), and held that where materiality is an element of a crime, it must be submitted to the jury.  In this circuit, both of the offenses in question have been read to include a materiality requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Accordingly, as Randazzo is entitled to the benefit of the law prevailing at the time of his appeal, Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 716, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987), it was \"error\" as to five of the six counts in question (counts 1 and 98-101) not to submit the materiality issue to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the harmless error test were applied, Randazzo would arguably be entitled to a new trial on these counts, even though the error did not affect the outcome.  This court has held that the failure to submit an entire element to the jury, when a properly preserved request is made, is treated as \"structural\" and is reversible error without regard to harm.  United States v. Lopez, 71 F.3d 954, 960 (1st Cir.1995) (reading Supreme Court precedent to point in this direction).  Accord, DiRico, slip op. at 12, 78 F.3d at 737.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, this court observed in Lopez that a Gaudin error would not require automatic reversal if the defendant had failed to preserve the objection at trial.  Rather, we said that the test on review would be the customary \"plain error\" standard under United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993);  Lopez, 71 F.3d at 960.  Significantly, every post-Gaudin case we can find in other circuits does apply the plain error test, not the harmless error test, to a failure to submit materiality to the jury (assuming that the objection was not properly preserved).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Randazzo did not preserve the objection because he failed to object to the instructions on this point after they were given and before the jury retired.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.  Randazzo says that it was reasonable not to object since First Circuit precedent was dead against him and Gaudin was unexpected.  This is so;  but the question is whether these circumstances make any difference.  In United States v. Collins, 60 F.3d 4 (1st Cir.1995), this court squarely held that it does not make any difference, and the post-Gaudin cases in other circuits imply the same view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result might at first be surprising, but we are dealing with an accommodation of conflicting concerns.  Randazzo is not charged with a deliberate waiver of the objection, which might preclude its consideration under any standard.  E.g., United States v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1441, 131 L.Ed.2d 320 (1995);  see also Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.  And, although the trial judge in this case acted properly under then prevailing law, Randazzo is given the benefit on direct review of a later change in law--if he can meet the customary plain error tests that Olano sets forth for unpreserved error.  In any event, Collins controls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, even assuming the error was \"plain\" and \"affected substantial rights,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), it did not cause a \"miscarriage of justice\" or seriously affect the integrity or impair \"public confidence\" in the proceedings.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 736-37, 113 S.Ct. at 1779;  Keys, 67 F.3d at 811.  On the tax counts, the convictions were inevitable.  Although Randazzo's brief struggles imaginatively to find a doubt based on the amount of the misreported expenses in comparison with corporate income, the amount (between $45,000 and $60,000 each year) was not trivial or immaterial, even assuming dubitante that amount matters in the case of a deliberate falsification.  Compare United States v. Greenberg, 735 F.2d 29, 31 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the use of STP in shrimp--forbidden by the Company's government contracts--the prosecution offered evidence that STP increased the weight of the shrimp (apparently by more than five percent) and therefore the cost to the government.  In fact, the prosecution showed that in one instance where the presence of STP was revealed, the government rejected the Company's shipment.  Given the contract ban and the increased cost, the failure to reveal the use of STP was patently material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. PROCESSING AID</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last issue concerns Randazzo's claim that the court misinstructed the jury on the definition of \"processing aid,\" a term pertinent to the misbranding offense in this case.  Count 65 charged Randazzo with conspiring to sell, and counts 66-78 with selling, shrimp that was misbranded;  and one of the three forms of misbranding charged (any one sufficed for conviction) was that the label inaccurately failed to list sodium hydroxide as an ingredient.  The statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 343(i)(2), provides that failure to list an ingredient constitutes misbranding unless the omission is exempted by regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sodium hydroxide had clearly been added to the shrimp in question, but it was Randazzo's position that this ingredient did no more than bring out or restore the allegedly natural pink color of the shrimp and that the ingredient was exempted from listing as a \"processing aid.\"   The regulation exempting \"processing aids\" defines them to include the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 C.F.R. &#167; 101.100(a)(3)(ii)(c ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In charging the jury, the trial court did not read this quoted language verbatim, although Randazzo had asked for such an instruction.  Instead, the court told the jury that the jury could find misbranding if the label failed to list each ingredient but, \"if an ingredient is merely a processing aid, it does not have to be listed.  However, if the ingredient has a functional or technical effect on the product, such as changing its color, it is not a processing aid and it must be listed as an ingredient.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the charge, the court invited objections.  Randazzo did not object to the failure to read the verbatim definition of processing aid, and the omission was not plain error.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.  But his counsel did say:  \"I object to the use of the phrase 'changing its color' in connection with the standard of identity.\"   Despite the garble (the \"standard of identity\" concept related to a different set of counts not involving color), we think that the district court likely understood the thrust of the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This takes us to the question whether the district court was right in glossing the regulation to exclude from the definition of \"processing aid\" an ingredient that \"change[s] [the food's] color.\"   However, Randazzo offers nothing--by way of textual analysis, precedent, administrative interpretation, policy argument, or anything else--to support his underlying position, namely, that an ingredient that merely brings out a supposedly natural color is a processing aid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's reading of the regulations is not self-evidently wrong;  indeed, the government now suggests that the \"change of color\" instruction was actually too favorable to the defense (but the government proposed the language).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In all events, it is the appellant's responsibility to make some showing that an error has been committed.  United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, Saccoccia v. U.S., --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996).  We have no basis here for finding that the instruction was error and that is enough to decide this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following briefly describes the evidence of uncharged wrongs admitted at trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. There was evidence that the Company used sugar in processing shrimp for an unspecified period before it was discontinued in favor of saccharin in 1989.  No one testified expressly that this use of sugar was illegal, but this was a likely inference, given that the evidence showed the sugar was not identified on the product label and that sugar was among the ingredients concealed by falsified brine charts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Testimony showed that STP was used in the Company's frozen breaded shrimp from the 1970s, in violation of federal regulations and government contract provisions.  This conduct clearly preceded the indictment period for count 1, which began in 1989, although the government argues that it was within the scope of the allegations in count 79, which stated that the additive had been used in commercially sold shrimp \"from a time not known to the grand jury but at least June 1983.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. There was evidence that, during the years alleged in the tax counts, Randazzo failed to report as income on his personal tax returns both the cash sums he allegedly took from the Company's retail store and the personal services provided by an assistant at Company expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Testimony by a Company accountant tended to show that Randazzo engaged in the corporate tax count offenses prior to the indictment period.  Specifically, the accountant told Randazzo in a 1985 conversation that something was suspect about the bookkeeping for the cash retail sales of shrimp, and also inquired as to what Company services were being performed by the Randazzo family assistant.

In February 1994, a federal grand jury returned a 101-count indictment, charging Randazzo--and in most counts the Company as well--with an array of offenses.  The offenses fell into two different categories:  97 \"shrimp\" charges and four \"tax\" charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The shrimp charges, counts 1 through 97, alleged that Randazzo and the Company used certain substances in producing shrimp that were prohibited or at least needed to be disclosed on labels.  The substances increased profits by altering the weight or color of the shrimp, which was sold to the Department of Defense and various commercial purchasers.  These allegations underpinned four charges of conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, and 93 substantive counts of making false statements to and claims against the United States, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 287, and introducing misbranded or adulterated food into interstate commerce, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 331(a), (k) and 333(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax charges, counts 98 through 101, were brought against Randazzo alone and alleged that he had caused the Company to file false corporate tax returns.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(1).  Specifically, the government claimed Randazzo misreported as sales expenses cash sums that he was taking weekly from the Company for personal use and that the Company returns listed as corporate expenses the wages of a person who worked exclusively for the Randazzo family on personal matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a 10-day jury trial in October 1994, Randazzo was convicted on all counts.  He was sentenced to 36 months in prison, reflecting a significant downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines range.  He now appeals from his conviction but not his sentence, contending that the trial court erred as to joinder, alleged multiplicity of charges, and instructions.  The pertinent facts are set forth as necessary in discussing the separate claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. JOINDER OF COUNTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randazzo claims that joining the 97 shrimp counts with the four tax counts was improper.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a) permits joinder of counts against a single defendant only if the offenses \"are of the same or similar character,\" or \"are based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\"   The district court rejected Randazzo's motion to sever based on Rule 8(a), and, as the issue turns on a construction of the rule, we review the decision de novo.  United States v. Yefsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608076\"><a href=\"/opinion/608076/united-states-v-sheldon-arthur-yefsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 895 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 8(a)'s joinder provision is generously construed in favor of joinder, United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></span> (1993), in part because Fed.R.Crim.P. 14 provides a separate layer of protection where it is most needed.  Under Rule 14, the trial judge has discretion to order severance of counts, even if properly joined under Rule 8(a), to avoid undue prejudice.  Here, the district court denied Randazzo's motion for severance under Rule 14 and he has not appealed that ruling.  Nevertheless, Rule 8(a) does forbid joinder unless the counts meet one of the conditions already quoted, and those conditions, although phrased in general terms, are not infinitely elastic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One basis for joinder, invoked by the government here, is where the counts involve acts comprising parts of \"a common scheme or plan.\"   As the government points out, this rubric is often used to join false statement claims with tax fraud charges where the tax fraud involves failure to report specific income obtained by the false statements.  E.g., United States v. Whitworth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511695\"><a href=\"/opinion/511695/united-states-v-jerry-alfred-whitworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></a></span>, 1277 (9th Cir.1988), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></span> (1989).  Indeed, the failure to report may help conceal the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present case is quite different and offers no such connection between the shrimp and tax counts.  Randazzo reduced the Company's reportable income by overstating corporate expenses.  But it was pure happenstance whether the overstated expenses happened to reduce legal income or illegal income of the Company.  The misconduct underlying the shrimp counts and the improper claiming of expenses on the returns were not part of the same \"scheme or plan\" in any sense of the phrase.  Accord United States v. Halper, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362781\"><a href=\"/opinion/362781/united-states-v-irwin-halper/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 429-30 (2d Cir.1978) (rejecting a similar argument by the government).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the government says that the shrimp and tax charges are of the \"same or similar character\" because (ignoring sales to commercial buyers) both sets of offenses involved the use of falsehoods or omissions to profit at the expense of the federal government.  Further, it notes that many facts are common to both sets of charges:  for example, they occurred during overlapping time frames;  Randazzo's control over the Company was a common element;  and the Company's sagging financial condition provided a common motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious why Congress provided for joinder of counts that grow out of related transactions--ones that are \"connected\" or \"part of a common scheme or plan\";  the reason for allowing joinder of offenses having \"the same or similar character\" is less clear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But whatever the rationale, we think that it is very hard to describe adulterating or mislabeling shrimp as offenses \"similar\" to tax fraud--except at a level of generality so high as to drain the term of any real content.  Even the government's best case does not stretch as far as the present facts.  United States v. Levine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597566\"><a href=\"/opinion/597566/united-states-v-michael-levine/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 167-68 (10th Cir.1992) (bank fraud and mail fraud).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the presence of evidence common to both sets of counts, we agree that the extent of common evidence plays a role in implementing Rule 8(a).  United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 973 (1st Cir.1995).  But Congress did not provide for joinder for unrelated transactions and dissimilar crimes merely because some evidence might be common to all of the counts.  Indeed, looking to the important evidence, the shrimp and tax counts in this case seem to revolve around quite different facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But all this is largely for the benefit of district courts in future cases, because the misjoinder here was patently harmless.  United States v. Lane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111560\"><a href=\"/opinion/111560/united-states-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 449, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111560\"><a href=\"/opinion/111560/united-states-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span> (1986).  The evidence against Randazzo on the tax counts was overwhelming.  Randazzo does not seriously claim otherwise but argues that the evidence on the shrimp counts was thin and that the jury was, or may well have been, swayed on those counts by the evidence (inadmissible save for the joinder) that Randazzo was cheating on taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree, concluding that the government has amply carried its burden to show that the error did not \"substantially influence[ ] the jury's decision.\"  O'Neal v. McAninch, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 995, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span> (1995).  As to each of the four conspiracies charged in the shrimp counts, at least one high-ranking Company official testified that he had discussed with Randazzo the fact that the given ingredient was prohibited or had to be disclosed, and each testified that Randazzo had nevertheless ordered that the ingredient be added, making clear in several cases the aim was higher profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other evidence showed that Randazzo kept close watch over production and had the final say over the mix of ingredients.  In one instance Randazzo learned that another producer had been told to stop using an ingredient and, on investigating the report, Randazzo discovered that the ingredient could be used to change the color of the shrimp to resemble a more expensive variety;  he then ordered its use in his own shrimp.  Randazzo also played a major role in arranging for the destruction of evidence.  The tax counts simply did not matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. MULTIPLICITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randazzo's second claim of error, relating both to the indictment and to the jury instructions, is that the four alleged conspiracies should have been charged as one.  He argues that, when coupled with the misjoinder, this multiplicity contributed to the impression that he was criminally disposed.  Briefly, these were the four alleged conspiracies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Count 1 charged that Randazzo conspired to make false statements to, and claims against, the government by selling the Department of Defense shrimp containing the chemical sodium tripolyphosphate (\"STP\"), in violation of contract obligations.  STP causes shrimp to absorb and retain moisture, which in turn boosts profits because the shrimp was sold by weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Count 52 charged that Randazzo conspired to sell to the public shrimp that had been adulterated by adding saccharin, an additive prohibited by federal regulations.  The government alleged that the Company added saccharin to mask the taste of the STP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Count 65 charged that Randazzo conspired to add the chemical sodium hydroxide to certain types of shrimp in order to give them a pinkish color.  Randazzo then passed off the altered shrimp to customers as naturally pink shrimp, which is rarer than other varieties and commands higher prices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Count 79 charged that Randazzo added STP to the Company's line of frozen raw breaded shrimp, sold to wholesalers and the public, contrary to federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a recurring question in conspiracy cases whether related illegal agreements comprise one conspiracy or several.  Because the agreements are often not explicit and are regularly inferred from conduct, the courts ordinarily treat the issue as one of fact and offer various criteria that might help the factfinder distinguish:  these include commonality vel non of the nature, motive, design, implementation, and logistics of the illegal activities, as well as the scope of co-conspirator involvement.  E.g., United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 241 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span> (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the conspiracies in this case had a different specific purpose;  each involved different conduct;  and the time periods covered were different.  Randazzo makes no effort whatever to dispute these differences in his brief.  Rather, he says that all of the agreements concerned the Company's production of shrimp and alleged fraudulent concealment, and he points to some common elements (e.g., that two of the conspiracies related to use of STP--one on military sales and the other on sales to the public).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume arguendo that a jury might have found that there was an overarching conspiracy to sell shrimp through various deceptive practices that were altered from time to time.  But on the evidence presented, the jury was not compelled to so find, and that is enough.  As it happens, such an overarching conspiracy, if it existed, might not preclude the conviction of Randazzo for the individual subsumed conspiracies if they were also proved--an interesting problem that need not be decided here.  See United States v. Broce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112177\"><a href=\"/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 580-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112177\"><a href=\"/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span>, 767-68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112177\"><a href=\"/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span> (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randazzo continues by arguing that the four charged \"overlapping conspiracies\" worked special prejudice in this case.  He points out that each conspiracy count alleged several different illegal purposes (e.g., count 1 alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 287, 1001, and 1516).  And, he concludes, the conspiracy counts together involved instructions on 17 different offenses.  The result, says Randazzo, was \"a lengthy and confusing [set of] instruction[s] that the jury could not reasonably be expected to apply.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury confusion is a legitimate concern in this case, but it cannot be proved by simply noting the number of offenses.  There is no automatic ban on multiple counts in an indictment, or on charging a conspiratorial agreement having multiple unlawful purposes.  Braverman v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103708\"><a href=\"/opinion/103708/braverman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103708\"><a href=\"/opinion/103708/braverman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span> (1942).  Randazzo had a chance to show us how specific language or organization of the instructions misled the jury;  but his brief points to nothing specific, let alone to any properly preserved objection or request concerning this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. \"OTHER CRIMES\" EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial the prosecution introduced some evidence suggesting Randazzo's involvement in previous, uncharged misbranding, adulteration and tax fraud offenses.  On appeal Randazzo does not challenge the admission of this evidence.  But he claims that the trial court should have given a requested standard instruction that evidence of uncharged crimes may not be considered as evidence of his propensity to commit crimes.  Fed.R.Evid. 105, 404;  see 3 L. Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions &#167; 74.03 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's response is that most of the evidence characterized by Randazzo as \"other uncharged conduct\" was \"direct evidence of the crimes charged, not Rule 404(b) evidence at all, and thus did not require the limiting instruction defendant proposed.\"   The government includes in this \"direct evidence\" category the Company's use of sugar and STP in shrimp in years prior to the indictment and evidence of Randazzo's failure to report income (e.g., the cash he took from the Company) on his personal tax returns.  In an appendix to this opinion, we set forth the episodes that are arguably in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law does contain such a distinction between \"direct evidence\" and \"other crimes\" or \"Rule 404(b)\" evidence.  E.g., United States v. Santagata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555052\"><a href=\"/opinion/555052/united-states-v-donald-santagata/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 393-95 (1st Cir.1991).  Although its soundness has been questioned, E. Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence &#167; 9.62 (1995), we are not free to disregard circuit precedent.  But in reality \"direct evidence\" and \"Rule 404(b) evidence\" are not mutually exclusive categories, but loose labels that can sometimes plausibly be applied to the same conduct.  And, as usual, below the surface there are problems of policy and of degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule is that evidence of the defendant's bad acts or crimes, other than those charged in the indictment, is admissible, subject to conditions, if relevant in some way apart from the forbidden inference that the defendant is criminally inclined.  Rule 404;  see People v. Zackowitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3586129\"><a href=\"/opinion/3604518/people-v-zackowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3586129\"><a href=\"/opinion/3604518/people-v-zackowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 468 (1930) (Cardozo, J.).  The standard conditions include the usual balancing of relevance against prejudice, Fed.R.Evid. 403, and use of a limiting instruction telling the jury not to draw the forbidden inference, Fed.R.Evid. 105.  See Huddleston v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112049\"><a href=\"/opinion/112049/huddleston-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span>, 691-92, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112049\"><a href=\"/opinion/112049/huddleston-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1496</span></a></span>, 1502, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112049\"><a href=\"/opinion/112049/huddleston-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span> (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule, and the conditions, may be easily applied where the \"other\" crimes are reasonably distinct (e.g., in time and place) from the crime charged in the indictment.  But where the \"other\" crimes are more closely entangled with the events that comprise the charged offense, a number of courts have declined to apply the label \"other\" or to require the limiting instruction.  E.g., Santagata, 924 F.2d at 395, (evidence that those charged with drug dealing had been carrying guns).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument for the distinction made by cases like Santagata is that where the \"other\" (i.e., uncharged) crimes are closely entangled with the crimes charged, the strength of the permitted inference--e.g., that guns are often used to protect drugs--may effectively submerge the forbidden one.  See Rossetti v. Curran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196645\"><a href=\"/opinion/196645/rossetti-v-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1996).  The argument against the distinction is that sometimes the forbidden \"bad character\" inference remains a potential menace even in cases like Santagata.   Obviously much depends on the crimes involved and on the facts of the individual case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, at least one or two categories of the \"other\" crimes described in the appendix were distinct enough from the crimes actually charged that it would have made sense to include a single general limiting instruction in the final charge to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Nothing more was sought in this case.  Perhaps the safe course for a district court, wherever the matter is in doubt, is (where asked) to give a closing general instruction that bad character is not a permissible inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But here a limiting instruction could not have altered the result and omitting it was at worst harmless error.  United States v. King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537666\"><a href=\"/opinion/537666/united-states-v-charles-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span>, 915 (7th Cir.1990).  The most potent \"other crimes\" evidence related to Randazzo's personal tax offenses;  but the evidence against Randazzo on the corporate tax offenses was overwhelming.  Conversely, the arguable \"other crimes\" evidence bearing on the shrimp counts was either very mild or so similar and closely connected to the actual crimes charged as largely to rob it of the independent \"bad character\" sting which the instruction means to forestall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. MATERIALITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Randazzo claims that on six counts, each involving some form of false representation or omission, the trial judge erred in deciding that the statements or omissions were \"material\" instead of submitting the materiality issue to the jury.  Two counts (counts 1 and 65) charged Randazzo with conspiring inter alia to make false statements to the government in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001;  and the four tax counts (counts 98-101) alleged that Randazzo willfully overstated expenses on the corporate tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the pre-charge conference Randazzo said that the materiality issue in count 1 was an issue for the jury.  But, as was then common in most circuits, e.g., United States v. Arcadipane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195748\"><a href=\"/opinion/195748/united-states-v-arcadipane/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1994), the trial judge ruled that materiality was for the court and held that the materiality requirement was satisfied as to count 1.  We think that she also decided the materiality issue on the four tax counts.  As to count 65, the judge did (for unexplained reasons) submit the issue of materiality to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Randazzo's conviction in October 1994, the Supreme Court in June 1995 decided United States v. Gaudin, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span> (1995), and held that where materiality is an element of a crime, it must be submitted to the jury.  In this circuit, both of the offenses in question have been read to include a materiality requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Accordingly, as Randazzo is entitled to the benefit of the law prevailing at the time of his appeal, Griffith v. Kentucky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 328, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 716, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span> (1987), it was \"error\" as to five of the six counts in question (counts 1 and 98-101) not to submit the materiality issue to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the harmless error test were applied, Randazzo would arguably be entitled to a new trial on these counts, even though the error did not affect the outcome.  This court has held that the failure to submit an entire element to the jury, when a properly preserved request is made, is treated as \"structural\" and is reversible error without regard to harm.  United States v. Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196473\"><a href=\"/opinion/196473/united-states-v-delano-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 960 (1st Cir.1995) (reading Supreme Court precedent to point in this direction).  Accord, DiRico, slip op. at 12, 78 F.3d at 737.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, this court observed in Lopez that a Gaudin error would not require automatic reversal if the defendant had failed to preserve the objection at trial.  Rather, we said that the test on review would be the customary \"plain error\" standard under United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993);  Lopez, 71 F.3d at 960.  Significantly, every post-Gaudin case we can find in other circuits does apply the plain error test, not the harmless error test, to a failure to submit materiality to the jury (assuming that the objection was not properly preserved).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Randazzo did not preserve the objection because he failed to object to the instructions on this point after they were given and before the jury retired.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.  Randazzo says that it was reasonable not to object since First Circuit precedent was dead against him and Gaudin was unexpected.  This is so;  but the question is whether these circumstances make any difference.  In United States v. Collins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196189\"><a href=\"/opinion/196189/united-states-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), this court squarely held that it does not make any difference, and the post-Gaudin cases in other circuits imply the same view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result might at first be surprising, but we are dealing with an accommodation of conflicting concerns.  Randazzo is not charged with a deliberate waiver of the objection, which might preclude its consideration under any standard.  E.g., United States v. Marder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195887\"><a href=\"/opinion/195887/united-states-v-marder/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span> (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></span> (1995);  see also Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.  And, although the trial judge in this case acted properly under then prevailing law, Randazzo is given the benefit on direct review of a later change in law--if he can meet the customary plain error tests that Olano sets forth for unpreserved error.  In any event, Collins controls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, even assuming the error was \"plain\" and \"affected substantial rights,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), it did not cause a \"miscarriage of justice\" or seriously affect the integrity or impair \"public confidence\" in the proceedings.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 736-37, 113 S.Ct. at 1779;  Keys, 67 F.3d at 811.  On the tax counts, the convictions were inevitable.  Although Randazzo's brief struggles imaginatively to find a doubt based on the amount of the misreported expenses in comparison with corporate income, the amount (between $45,000 and $60,000 each year) was not trivial or immaterial, even assuming dubitante that amount matters in the case of a deliberate falsification.  Compare United States v. Greenberg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"436099\"><a href=\"/opinion/436099/united-states-v-jack-greenberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 31 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the use of STP in shrimp--forbidden by the Company's government contracts--the prosecution offered evidence that STP increased the weight of the shrimp (apparently by more than five percent) and therefore the cost to the government.  In fact, the prosecution showed that in one instance where the presence of STP was revealed, the government rejected the Company's shipment.  Given the contract ban and the increased cost, the failure to reveal the use of STP was patently material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. PROCESSING AID</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last issue concerns Randazzo's claim that the court misinstructed the jury on the definition of \"processing aid,\" a term pertinent to the misbranding offense in this case.  Count 65 charged Randazzo with conspiring to sell, and counts 66-78 with selling, shrimp that was misbranded;  and one of the three forms of misbranding charged (any one sufficed for conviction) was that the label inaccurately failed to list sodium hydroxide as an ingredient.  The statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 343(i)(2), provides that failure to list an ingredient constitutes misbranding unless the omission is exempted by regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sodium hydroxide had clearly been added to the shrimp in question, but it was Randazzo's position that this ingredient did no more than bring out or restore the allegedly natural pink color of the shrimp and that the ingredient was exempted from listing as a \"processing aid.\"   The regulation exempting \"processing aids\" defines them to include the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 C.F.R. &#167; 101.100(a)(3)(ii)(c ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In charging the jury, the trial court did not read this quoted language verbatim, although Randazzo had asked for such an instruction.  Instead, the court told the jury that the jury could find misbranding if the label failed to list each ingredient but, \"if an ingredient is merely a processing aid, it does not have to be listed.  However, if the ingredient has a functional or technical effect on the product, such as changing its color, it is not a processing aid and it must be listed as an ingredient.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the charge, the court invited objections.  Randazzo did not object to the failure to read the verbatim definition of processing aid, and the omission was not plain error.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.  But his counsel did say:  \"I object to the use of the phrase 'changing its color' in connection with the standard of identity.\"   Despite the garble (the \"standard of identity\" concept related to a different set of counts not involving color), we think that the district court likely understood the thrust of the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This takes us to the question whether the district court was right in glossing the regulation to exclude from the definition of \"processing aid\" an ingredient that \"change[s] [the food's] color.\"   However, Randazzo offers nothing--by way of textual analysis, precedent, administrative interpretation, policy argument, or anything else--to support his underlying position, namely, that an ingredient that merely brings out a supposedly natural color is a processing aid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's reading of the regulations is not self-evidently wrong;  indeed, the government now suggests that the \"change of color\" instruction was actually too favorable to the defense (but the government proposed the language).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In all events, it is the appellant's responsibility to make some showing that an error has been committed.

There was evidence that the Company used sugar in processing shrimp for an unspecified period before it was discontinued in favor of saccharin in 1989.  No one testified expressly that this use of sugar was illegal, but this was a likely inference, given that the evidence showed the sugar was not identified on the product label and that sugar was among the ingredients concealed by falsified brine charts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Testimony showed that STP was used in the Company's frozen breaded shrimp from the 1970s, in violation of federal regulations and government contract provisions.  This conduct clearly preceded the indictment period for count 1, which began in 1989, although the government argues that it was within the scope of the allegations in count 79, which stated that the additive had been used in commercially sold shrimp \"from a time not known to the grand jury but at least June 1983.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. There was evidence that, during the years alleged in the tax counts, Randazzo failed to report as income on his personal tax returns both the cash sums he allegedly took from the Company's retail store and the personal services provided by an assistant at Company expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Testimony by a Company accountant tended to show that Randazzo engaged in the corporate tax count offenses prior to the indictment period.  Specifically, the accountant told Randazzo in a 1985 conversation that something was suspect about the bookkeeping for the cash retail sales of shrimp, and also inquired as to what Company services were being performed by the Randazzo family assistant.  Randazzo allegedly told him it was none of his business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The \"same or similar\" language was drawn from earlier law without explanation.  1 Charles A.
