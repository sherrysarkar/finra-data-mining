Having carefully  reviewed the  record in\r                            \r\r\n\nthis case, including the briefs of the parties, we affirm the\r\n\ngrant of summary judgment to defendant/appellee Confederation\r\n\nLife Insurance Company of Canada.\r\n\n     According  to  the undisputed  statement  of facts,  the\r\n\ndecedent made  material misstatements as to  the condition of\r\n\nher health  in her August 1992  application for reinstatement\r\n\nof her life insurance  policy.  By  the terms of the  policy,\r\n\nsuch material  misstatements made the policy  voidable at the\r\n\noption  of Confederation during  the two  year contestability\r\n\nperiod,  which option  Confederation  exercised  in  February\r\n\n1993.   Moreover,  according to  the  clear language  of  the\r\n\napplication, no  statement relative  to the insured's  health\r\n\ncould be deemed communicated  to Confederation unless set out\r\n\nin   the  evidence   of  insurability   submitted  with   the\r\n\napplication  itself.   Consequently,  even  if  appellant did\r\n\norally communicate the state of decedent's health to an agent\r\n\nof  Confederation in  1991, Confederation  would have  had no\r\n\nduty to investigate, absent  some evidence submitted with the\r\n\napplication.     Since  no   such  evidence  was   submitted,\r\n\nConfederation was  within its  legal right in  rescinding the\r\n\npolicy.1\r                   1\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Appellant's  claim that  Confederation  was reluctant  to\r               1\r\nprovide  him with  all  relevant discovery  material was  not\r\nraised below and thus will not be heard on appeal.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
