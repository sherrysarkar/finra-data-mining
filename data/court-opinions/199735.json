Appellants-defendants were\n\nconvicted of trespassing onto a United States military installation.\n\nOn appeal, appellants collectively and separately challenge several\n\nrulings made by the district court at trial. Because we find no error\n\nin the district court's rulings, we affirm.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          On October 18, 2000, appellants Juan Silva-Rosa, Justino\n\nLópez-Ortiz, Emilio García-Cordero, Angel Guadalupe-Ortiz, Radamés\n\nTirado, Agapito Belardo Salgado, José Cedric Morales, and Robert Rabin\n\nwere arrested for trespassing at Camp García, a military installation\n\non the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico. Appellants were each charged\n\nwith violating 18 U.S.C. § 1382, which prohibits entry onto military or\n\nnaval property for any unlawful purpose. Upon the government's motion,\n\nthe district court consolidated the cases, and a bench trial was set\n\nfor February 1, 2001.\n\n          Before trial, appellants Guadalupe-Ortiz, Morales, López-\n\nOrtiz, and Rabin filed motions seeking to disqualify United States Navy\n\nofficers from prosecuting the case. Appellants argued that the Navy\n\nofficers, appointed as Special Assistant United States Attorneys to\n\nprosecute the case, had an institutional conflict. More specifically,\n\nthe ongoing controversy between the Navy and local residents over the\n\nbombing exercises at Camp García prevented Navy personnel from serving\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fas disinterested prosecutors. The district court denied appellants'\n\nmotions, and the government was represented at trial by Navy officers.\n\n          In another pretrial motion, appellants Guadalupe-Ortiz,\n\nRabin, López-Ortiz, and Morales sought to exclude a document entitled\n\n\"Certificate of Non-existence of Record.\"       Signed by Lieutenant\n\nCommander Neftalí Pagán, the document stated that Navy personnel\n\nsearched through government records and did not find appellants' names\n\namong those authorized to enter Camp García. The district court denied\n\nthe motion in limine, and the certificate was admitted at trial over\n\nappellants' objection.1\n\n          At trial, appellants tried several times to present a defense\n\nof necessity. They proffered evidence to show that their presence at\n\nCamp García was justified based on their reasonable belief that\n\ntrespassing would prevent the Navy from conducting military exercises\n\nthat allegedly threaten the lives of Vieques residents and the\n\nenvironment on the island. After listening to the proffer, however,\n\nthe district court excluded the evidence.\n\n          Towards the end of the trial, appellants Tirado, García-\n\nCordero, and López-Ortiz each took the stand and attempted to testify\n\nas to their state of mind. In particular, appellants were prepared to\n\ntestify that their political, religious, and moral beliefs compelled\n\n1 Because the district court ruled that an objection made on behalf of\none defendant would serve as an objection for all of the defendants, we\nimpute the appeal of the certificate's admission to all appellants.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthem to disobey the law. The district court excluded this portion of\n\ntheir testimony, as it was \"part and parcel of the defense of\n\nnecessity.\"\n\n          The district court found appellants guilty of violating 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1382. Appellants were sentenced to one year of unsupervised\n\nprobation, forced to pay a monetary fine of ten dollars, and instructed\n\nnot to enter Camp García during the period of probation.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          Appellants collectively and separately challenge several\n\nrulings made by the district court. First, appellants Guadalupe-Ortiz,\n\nMorales, López-Ortiz, and Rabin challenge the district court's denial\n\nof their motion to disqualify Navy officers from prosecuting their\n\ncase. Second, appellants collectively argue that the district court\n\nerred in admitting the Certificate of Non-Existence of Record. Third,\n\nall of the defendants appeal the district court's denial of their right\n\nto present a defense of necessity. Fourth, Tirado, García-Cordero, and\n\nLópez-Ortiz appeal the district court's refusal to allow them to\n\ntestify as to their state of mind. Because we find no reversible error\n\nin any of the district court's rulings, we affirm.\n\nA.   Failure to Disqualify Navy Officers\n\n          Appellants Guadalupe-Ortiz, Morales, López-Ortiz, and Rabin\n\nargue that the district court erred by not disqualifying Navy officers\n\nfrom serving as the prosecuting attorneys.       In support of their\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fargument, appellants rely exclusively on Young v. United States ex rel.\n\nVuitton et Fils S.A., 481 U.S. 787 (1987). In Young, petitioners were\n\nfound guilty of criminal contempt for violating the district court's\n\ninjunction prohibiting trademark infringement. To prosecute the\n\ncriminal contempt action, the district court appointed the attorney of\n\nthe party whose trademark had been infringed.       The Supreme Court\n\nexercised its supervisory power to reverse the convictions, holding\n\nthat \"counsel for a party that is the beneficiary of a court order may\n\nnot be appointed to undertake contempt prosecutions for alleged\n\nviolations of that order.\" Id. at 790. In reaching its conclusion,\n\nthe Supreme Court stated that a private attorney appointed by the court\n\nto prosecute a criminal contempt action \"should be as disinterested as\n\na public prosecutor who undertakes such a prosecution.\"         Id. at 804.\n\n          Appellants argue that the Navy officers assigned to prosecute\n\ntheir case did not possess the requisite amount of disinterestedness.\n\nAt the time of trial, several of the defendants had been actively\n\ninvolved in political and legal efforts to enjoin the Navy from\n\nconducting its military exercises in Vieques. Appellants claim that\n\ntheir repeated conflicts with the Navy vested the prosecuting officers\n\nwith a passionate resolve to convict appellants that violated the\n\ndisinterestedness requirement set forth in Young.\n\n          Notwithstanding appellants' assertions to the contrary, Young\n\nis inapposite for at least one conspicuous and significant reason: the\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fYoung Court challenged the propriety of a court-appointed prosecutor.\n\nIn contrast, the instant case involves prosecutors whom the Attorney\n\nGeneral appointed to serve as Special Assistant United States\n\nAttorneys.     The Attorney General is authorized to make these\n\nappointments under 28 U.S.C. § 543(a), and \"[t]his authorization\n\ncontains no limitation on the persons whom the Attorney General may\n\nappoint.\" United States v. Allred, 867 F.2d 856, 871 (5th Cir. 1989).\n\n          In essence, then, appellants are asking this Court to dictate\n\nto the executive branch whom it can appoint to serve as its\n\nprosecutors.    Such a position would expand the power of judicial\n\nofficials to such a degree as to trigger weighty separation of powers\n\nconcerns. Appellant’s argument thus takes us far outside the scope of\n\nYoung, where the doctrine of separation of powers was not even\n\nimplicated. We, therefore, find appellants' reliance on Young to be\n\nmisguided and decline their invitation to over-extend our authority and\n\ntrample on the executive branch's seemingly exclusive discretion.2\n\nB.   Admission of Certificate of Non-Existence of Record\n\n          Appellants collectively argue that the district court erred\n\nin admitting the Certificate of Non-Existence of Record. For our\n\nanalysis on this issue, see United States v. Ventura-Meléndez, No. 01-\n\n2 This case does not present, and we do not reach, any question of an\nappointment under 28 U.S.C. § 543(a) of a prosecutor so interested in\nthe outcome of a case as to raise the \"serious constitutional\nquestions\" discussed in Marshall v. Jerrico, 446 U.S. 238, 249-50\n(1980).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f1400, slip op. at 7-8 (1st Cir. Dec. __, 2001).3 On the basis of the\n\nanalysis set forth in Ventura-Meléndez, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt was well within its discretion in admitting the certificate.4\n\nC.   Exclusion of the Necessity Defense\n\n          Appellants collectively assert that the district court erred\n\nby finding the defense of necessity irrelevant to their trespassing\n\nconvictions and therefore barring its presentation at trial. For our\n\nanalysis on this issue, see United States v. Sued-Jiménez, No. 00-2146,\n\nslip op. at 5 (1st Cir. Dec. __ 2001).5 Based on the analysis set forth\n\nin Sued-Jiménez, we conclude that the district court properly precluded\n\nthe defense.\n\nD.   Exclusion of State of Mind Testimony\n\n\n3  The Ventura-Meléndez case also involved an appellant who was\nconvicted of trespassing onto Camp García in 2000. In her appeal,\nVentura argued that the district court erred in admitting a Certificate\nof Non-Existence of Record. Because the certificate in Ventura-\nMeléndez is identical to the one that appellants challenge here, we\nhave decided to dispose of this issue by referencing the Ventura-\nMeléndez case rather than repeating its contents.\n4 Because the Certificate of Non-Existence of Record is admissible, we\nfind that there is sufficient evidence for the district court to have\nfound that appellants were not authorized to enter Camp García. Thus,\nappellants' perfunctory and conclusory claim that there was\ninsufficient evidence to support their conviction necessarily fails.\n5  Sued-Jiménez also involved appellants who were convicted of\ntrespassing onto Camp García in 2000. Appellants in that case argued\nthat the district court erred in excluding their presentation of a\nnecessity defense. Because appellants in both cases shared the same\ncircumstances and set forth identical arguments regarding the necessity\ndefense, we have decided to dispose of this issue by referencing the\nSued-Jiménez case rather than repeating its contents.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f           Appellants Tirado, García-Cordero, and López-Ortiz challenge\n\nthe district court's refusal to allow them to testify as to their state\n\nof mind. Appellants were prepared to testify that their actions were\n\njustified based on their political, religious, and moral beliefs. They\n\nargue that as criminal defendants, they have an unbridled right to\n\npresent evidence related to their state of mind.\n\n           Though a criminal defendant is granted much latitude in\n\npresenting a defense, In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273-74 (1978), he\n\ndoes not have the right to present irrelevant testimony. United States\n\nv. Maxwell, 254 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001).     Therefore, when the\n\n\"proffer in support of an anticipated affirmative defense is\n\ninsufficient as a matter of law to create a triable issue, a district\n\ncourt may preclude the presentation of that defense entirely.\" Id.; see\n\nalso United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 414-15 (1980) (finding it\n\n\"essential\" that defendant's proffered evidence on a defense meet a\n\nminimum standard    as to each element before that defense may be\n\nsubmitted to the jury).\n\n           In the instant case, appellants were prevented from\n\ntestifying as to the political and religious reasons that motivated\n\nthem to trespass on Navy property. This testimony is relevant, as the\n\ndistrict court noted, only insofar as it pertains to the necessity\n\ndefense.   Because the district court correctly determined        that\n\nappellants could not make out a necessity defense, we find no error in\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe district court's excluding \"the presentation of that defense\n\nentirely.\"   Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 26.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n         For these reasons, the convictions are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

The district court excluded this portion of\n\ntheir testimony, as it was \"part and parcel of the defense of\n\nnecessity.\"\n\n          The district court found appellants guilty of violating 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1382. Appellants were sentenced to one year of unsupervised\n\nprobation, forced to pay a monetary fine of ten dollars, and instructed\n\nnot to enter Camp García during the period of probation.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          Appellants collectively and separately challenge several\n\nrulings made by the district court. First, appellants Guadalupe-Ortiz,\n\nMorales, López-Ortiz, and Rabin challenge the district court's denial\n\nof their motion to disqualify Navy officers from prosecuting their\n\ncase. Second, appellants collectively argue that the district court\n\nerred in admitting the Certificate of Non-Existence of Record. Third,\n\nall of the defendants appeal the district court's denial of their right\n\nto present a defense of necessity. Fourth, Tirado, García-Cordero, and\n\nLópez-Ortiz appeal the district court's refusal to allow them to\n\ntestify as to their state of mind. Because we find no reversible error\n\nin any of the district court's rulings, we affirm.\n\nA.   Failure to Disqualify Navy Officers\n\n          Appellants Guadalupe-Ortiz, Morales, López-Ortiz, and Rabin\n\nargue that the district court erred by not disqualifying Navy officers\n\nfrom serving as the prosecuting attorneys.       In support of their\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fargument, appellants rely exclusively on Young v. United States ex rel.\n\nVuitton et Fils S.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111893\"><a href=\"/opinion/111893/young-v-united-states-ex-rel-vuitton-et-fils-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987). In Young, petitioners were\n\nfound guilty of criminal contempt for violating the district court's\n\ninjunction prohibiting trademark infringement. To prosecute the\n\ncriminal contempt action, the district court appointed the attorney of\n\nthe party whose trademark had been infringed.       The Supreme Court\n\nexercised its supervisory power to reverse the convictions, holding\n\nthat \"counsel for a party that is the beneficiary of a court order may\n\nnot be appointed to undertake contempt prosecutions for alleged\n\nviolations of that order.\" Id. at 790. In reaching its conclusion,\n\nthe Supreme Court stated that a private attorney appointed by the court\n\nto prosecute a criminal contempt action \"should be as disinterested as\n\na public prosecutor who undertakes such a prosecution.\"         Id. at 804.\n\n          Appellants argue that the Navy officers assigned to prosecute\n\ntheir case did not possess the requisite amount of disinterestedness.\n\nAt the time of trial, several of the defendants had been actively\n\ninvolved in political and legal efforts to enjoin the Navy from\n\nconducting its military exercises in Vieques. Appellants claim that\n\ntheir repeated conflicts with the Navy vested the prosecuting officers\n\nwith a passionate resolve to convict appellants that violated the\n\ndisinterestedness requirement set forth in Young.\n\n          Notwithstanding appellants' assertions to the contrary, Young\n\nis inapposite for at least one conspicuous and significant reason: the\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fYoung Court challenged the propriety of a court-appointed prosecutor.\n\nIn contrast, the instant case involves prosecutors whom the Attorney\n\nGeneral appointed to serve as Special Assistant United States\n\nAttorneys.     The Attorney General is authorized to make these\n\nappointments under 28 U.S.C. § 543(a), and \"[t]his authorization\n\ncontains no limitation on the persons whom the Attorney General may\n\nappoint.\" United States v. Allred, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518416\"><a href=\"/opinion/518416/united-states-v-william-allred-antoine-haddad-lou-milhous-soren-hansen/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871 (5th Cir. 1989).\n\n          In essence, then, appellants are asking this Court to dictate\n\nto the executive branch whom it can appoint to serve as its\n\nprosecutors.    Such a position would expand the power of judicial\n\nofficials to such a degree as to trigger weighty separation of powers\n\nconcerns. Appellant’s argument thus takes us far outside the scope of\n\nYoung, where the doctrine of separation of powers was not even\n\nimplicated. We, therefore, find appellants' reliance on Young to be\n\nmisguided and decline their invitation to over-extend our authority and\n\ntrample on the executive branch's seemingly exclusive discretion.2\n\nB.   Admission of Certificate of Non-Existence of Record\n\n          Appellants collectively argue that the district court erred\n\nin admitting the Certificate of Non-Existence of Record. For our\n\nanalysis on this issue, see United States v. Ventura-Meléndez, No. 01-\n\n2 This case does not present, and we do not reach, any question of an\nappointment under 28 U.S.C. § 543(a) of a prosecutor so interested in\nthe outcome of a case as to raise the \"serious constitutional\nquestions\" discussed in Marshall v. Jerrico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110251\"><a href=\"/opinion/110251/marshall-v-jerrico-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249-50\n(1980).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f1400, slip op. at 7-8 (1st Cir. Dec. __, 2001).3 On the basis of the\n\nanalysis set forth in Ventura-Meléndez, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt was well within its discretion in admitting the certificate.4\n\nC.   Exclusion of the Necessity Defense\n\n          Appellants collectively assert that the district court erred\n\nby finding the defense of necessity irrelevant to their trespassing\n\nconvictions and therefore barring its presentation at trial. For our\n\nanalysis on this issue, see United States v. Sued-Jiménez, No. 00-2146,\n\nslip op. at 5 (1st Cir. Dec. __ 2001).5 Based on the analysis set forth\n\nin Sued-Jiménez, we conclude that the district court properly precluded\n\nthe defense.\n\nD.   Exclusion of State of Mind Testimony\n\n\n3  The Ventura-Meléndez case also involved an appellant who was\nconvicted of trespassing onto Camp García in 2000. In her appeal,\nVentura argued that the district court erred in admitting a Certificate\nof Non-Existence of Record. Because the certificate in Ventura-\nMeléndez is identical to the one that appellants challenge here, we\nhave decided to dispose of this issue by referencing the Ventura-\nMeléndez case rather than repeating its contents.\n4 Because the Certificate of Non-Existence of Record is admissible, we\nfind that there is sufficient evidence for the district court to have\nfound that appellants were not authorized to enter Camp García. Thus,\nappellants' perfunctory and conclusory claim that there was\ninsufficient evidence to support their conviction necessarily fails.\n5  Sued-Jiménez also involved appellants who were convicted of\ntrespassing onto Camp García in 2000. Appellants in that case argued\nthat the district court erred in excluding their presentation of a\nnecessity defense. Because appellants in both cases shared the same\ncircumstances and set forth identical arguments regarding the necessity\ndefense, we have decided to dispose of this issue by referencing the\nSued-Jiménez case rather than repeating its contents.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f           Appellants Tirado, García-Cordero, and López-Ortiz challenge\n\nthe district court's refusal to allow them to testify as to their state\n\nof mind. Appellants were prepared to testify that their actions were\n\njustified based on their political, religious, and moral beliefs. They\n\nargue that as criminal defendants, they have an unbridled right to\n\npresent evidence related to their state of mind.\n\n           Though a criminal defendant is granted much latitude in\n\npresenting a defense, In re Oliver, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273-74 (1978), he\n\ndoes not have the right to present irrelevant testimony.

Therefore, when the\n\n\"proffer in support of an anticipated affirmative defense is\n\ninsufficient as a matter of law to create a triable issue, a district\n\ncourt may preclude the presentation of that defense entirely.\" Id.; see\n\nalso United States v. Bailey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110175\"><a href=\"/opinion/110175/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414-15 (1980) (finding it\n\n\"essential\" that defendant's proffered evidence on a defense meet a\n\nminimum standard    as to each element before that defense may be\n\nsubmitted to the jury).\n\n           In the instant case, appellants were prevented from\n\ntestifying as to the political and religious reasons that motivated\n\nthem to trespass on Navy property. This testimony is relevant, as the\n\ndistrict court noted, only insofar as it pertains to the necessity\n\ndefense.   Because the district court correctly determined        that\n\nappellants could not make out a necessity defense, we find no error in\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe district court's excluding \"the presentation of that defense\n\nentirely.\"   Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 26.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n         For these reasons, the convictions are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f</pre>",
