ALBANESE,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\r\n\n         [Hon. Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Robert G. Levitt and Christopher T. Braddock on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\n Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney and James H.\r\nLeavey, Assistant United States Attorney on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 16, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs, appendices,\r\nand record, we conclude that the district court properly\r\ndenied defendant's motion nominally brought under 18 U.S.C. \r\n3582(c)(2).\r\n     As a threshold matter, the district court lacked\r\nauthority under  3582(c)(2) to grant the relief sought by\r\ndefendant, namely vacation of his conviction under 18 U.S.C.\r\n 924(c)(1).  The district court's authority to reduce a\r\nsentence under  3582(c)(2) is strictly limited.  See United\r\nStates v. Jordan,     F.3d    , 1998 WL 804788 (1st Cir.\r\nNovember 25, 1998).  Accordingly, we may uphold the denial of\r\ndefendant's motion, even without considering its merits.  Seeid. at *1.\r\n     Nonetheless, even were we to consider the merits, the\r\nresult would be no different.  To the extent that the district\r\ncourt might have had authority to entertain defendant's\r\nmotion, whether under 28 U.S.C.  2255 or otherwise, still the\r\ndenial would have been proper, essentially for the reasons\r\nstated in the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation\r\ndated March 5, 1998.  The district court's conclusion   that\r\ndefendant \"carried\" a firearm during and in relation to his\r\ndrug trafficking offense, so that his conviction under \r\n924(c)(1) should be upheld even in light of Bailey v. United\r\nStates, 516 U.S. 137 (1995)   also was not inconsistent with\r\nMuscarello v. United States, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 1913-18 (1998),\r\ndecided after the district court issued its ruling.\r\n\n     We decline to consider defendant's new argument about\r\njury instructions, which argument was not clearly developed\r\nbefore the district court and is not supported by a record\r\nadequate for appellate review before this court.\r\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
