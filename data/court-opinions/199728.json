Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Kathleen J. Hill, by appointment of the court, with whom Law\nOffice of Kathleen J. Hill was on brief for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Zechariah\nChafee, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\f                            December 13, 2001\n\n\n\n\n             Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Manuel Regla Lara-Cruz\n\nwas charged in federal district court as an alien who had been\n\npreviously deported and was then found in the United States on\n\nor   about   June   20,   2000,   without     having    first    obtained     the\n\nconsent of the Attorney General to seek readmission.                     See 8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1326(a)(2), (b)(2) (1994).             Lara-Cruz pled guilty to\n\nthe charge.     Following a presentence report, the district court\n\nsentenced Lara-Cruz to 41 months' imprisonment.\n\n             On this appeal, Lara-Cruz raises two issues.                First,\n\nhe   objects   that   the   district     court   erred    in    computing     his\n\ncriminal history by including two criminal history points for\n\nhis June 4, 1990, state court conviction and sentence on drug\n\ncharges.     Concededly, the two points were properly added unless\n\nthe sentence was imposed \"more than ten years prior to the\n\ndefendant's     commencement      of    the   instant    offense.    .    .    .\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(b) & cmt. n.2 (2000).                 No objection to the\n\ncriminal history points was made at the time of sentencing, so\n\nour review is for plain error.\n\n             The claim of plain error rests on Lara-Cruz's accurate\n\nassertion that he pled guilty to having been found in the United\n\n                                       -2-\n\fStates on or about June 20, 2000, slightly more than ten years\n\nafter the June 4, 1990, date on which he had originally been\n\nconvicted and sentenced in state court on drug charges.                     The\n\nshort   answer   is   that   the    presentence      report,   to   which    no\n\nobjection was taken, shows that Lara-Cruz originally reentered\n\nthe   United   States   in   1997   and    resided   in   Providence    until\n\narrested in June 2000.         Whether or not the offense of being\n\n\"found in\" the United States is completed upon illegal entry or\n\nonly upon arrest, Lara-Cruz's entry into the United States in\n\n1997 was certainly the \"commencement of the instance offense,\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.1, cmt. n.2, the defendant's illegal entry being\n\na first step in thereafter being \"found in\" the United States.\n\nSee United States v. Castrillon-Gonzalez, 77 F.3d 403, 406 (11th\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n           Lara-Cruz's other objection stems from the fact that\n\nat sentencing, the district judge specified the sentence and\n\nthen observed:    \"And I will make a recommendation to the Bureau\n\nof Prisons, if it is at all possible, to place the Defendant in\n\na facility near where his family resides.\"                 Apparently, the\n\njudgment of conviction omits such a recommendation.                 Lara-Cruz\n\nargues that this oral comment was a part of the sentence which\n\ncontrols any subsequent deviation in the written document, see\n\nUnited States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 41-42 (1st Cir. 1995), and\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthat the district court should be instructed to incorporate the\n\noral recommendation in the judgment.\n\n          After questioning whether this court has any authority\n\nto review the district court's making or refusing to make a\n\nnonbinding recommendation concerning the place of confinement,\n\nsee United States v. Serafini, 233 F.3d 758, 778 (3d Cir. 2000),\n\nthe government points out that the district court's own language\n\nreflected only a conditional intention and not an outright\n\ncommitment.   We agree that the district judge may have concluded\n\nthat the recommendation was not feasible--a judgment we would\n\nhave no basis for disturbing even if the matter were reviewable\n\nat all.   Alternatively, the district court may simply have\n\noverlooked the matter.\n\n          Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt   but invite counsel for Lara-Cruz to call the district\n\ncourt's attention to the discrepancy so the district can if it\n\nso chooses, make the recommendation as to place of confinement.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
