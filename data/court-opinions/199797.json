Hopkins was on\nbrief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                       January 29. 2002\n\f\f       COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.          Dana Richardson appeals the\n\ndistrict court's denial of attorney's fees in his civil rights\n\ncase     against the City of Boston (\"the City\").                Finding no\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n\n                              I.     Background\n\n       On January 25, 2000, appellant was a passenger in a vehicle\n\ndriven by Angela Howell.           A police officer stopped the vehicle\n\nand    requested    a   driver's    license    from   Howell,   who   instead\n\nproduced a State of Michigan photo identification of \"Donald\n\nBeane.\" Appellant's picture was on Beane's identification.                  The\n\nofficer asked appellant to identify himself.            The officer became\n\nsuspicious and requested further identification when appellant\n\ntold him he was Dana Richardson.              In appellant's wallet were\n\ncredit cards and picture identifications, all in Beane's name.\n\nRichardson also possessed some personal papers, including his\n\nmother's death certificate and mortgage papers.                 The officer\n\nseized all of the papers, credit cards and identifications.\n\n       Appellant repeatedly and unsuccessfully sought return of the\n\nseized items and ultimately filed a lawsuit in state court\n\nseeking to have the items returned and the government enjoined\n\nfrom using the materials in any criminal investigation of him.\n\nThe City removed the case to federal court, and the district\n\ncourt    heard     oral   argument     on     appellant's   motion    for     a\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\frestraining order.       During the hearing, at the district court's\n\nnudging, the parties agreed that the City would return some of\n\nthe seized materials to appellant.                Because of the continuing\n\ninvestigation, however, most of the returned materials were to\n\nbe photocopies rather than originals. The district court then\n\ndenied as moot appellant's motion.               After continued negotiation\n\nbetween the parties, the City returned appellant's wallet and\n\nsome of his personal papers.             It never returned the so-called\n\n\"Beane    documents\"     because       they   pertained     to    the   criminal\n\ninvestigation.        Appellant      was    arrested     soon    thereafter     and\n\ncharged with four counts of credit card fraud, but the charges\n\nwere later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence.\n\n    After the materials were returned, appellant offered several\n\ntimes    to   dismiss   the    case.       The   parties   could    not   agree,\n\nhowever,      on   whether    the   case    would   be   dismissed      with,    or\n\nwithout, prejudice.          Appellant eventually moved to voluntarily\n\ndismiss and filed a petition for attorney's fees and costs as a\n\nprevailing party under the Attorney's Fee Awards Act of 1976\n\n(\"the Fees Act\"), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, and its state analogue,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, ยง 11I.             The district court dismissed the\n\ncase, with prejudice, but denied the fee petition, reasoning\n\nthat appellant was not a prevailing party as contemplated by the\n\nstatutes because the court did not issue any substantive rulings\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fand the case did not proceed to trial.                Appellant appeals from\n\nthat order.1\n\n                        II.    Standard of Review\n\n     We have long held that we are highly deferential to a\n\ndistrict court's decision whether to award attorney's fees, and\n\nthus will      set aside its ruling only if that ruling constituted\n\na \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" Gay Officers Action League v.\n\nPuerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Foley\n\nv. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 18 (1st Cir. 2001).              Our strict,\n\nbut sensible, standard        reflects the fact that only the district\n\ncourt    has   the   \"intimate       knowledge   of    the   nuances   of    the\n\nunderlying case.\"      Gay Officers Action League, 247 F.3d at 292.\n\nWe therefore confine our review to whether the district court\n\nhas made a mistake of law or incorrectly weighed (or failed to\n\nweigh) a factor in its decision.             See Foster v. Mydas Assoc.,\n\nInc., 943 F.2d 139, 143 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                              III.    Discussion\n\nA.   \"Prevailing Party\" Status Under               the   Fees   Act    and   the\n     Massachusetts Civil Rights Law\n\n\n\n\n     1  Appellant also conclusorily states that he is appealing\nthe district court's denial of his motion to vacate the order of\ndismissal. Appellant failed to develop that argument and it is\ntherefore waived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n(1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                       -5-\n\f     Under the Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, the district court may\n\naward reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing party in a\n\ncivil rights case brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.                     Like many\n\nothers before it, the key to this case is whether the plaintiff\n\nachieved \"prevailing party\" status.             Typically, a plaintiff is\n\ndeemed to have prevailed if he can show that he \"succeeded on an\n\nimportant issue in the case, thereby gaining at least some of\n\nthe benefit he sought in bringing suit.\"               Gay Officers Action\n\nLeague, 247 F.3d at 293 (citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S.\n\n424, 433 (1983)).       To be sure, a plaintiff need not prevail on\n\nevery   claim    and   obtain    all   relief    sought   to     qualify   as   a\n\nprevailing party.         E.g., Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111\n\n(1992);    Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987).                  Even so,\n\n\"[r]espect      for   ordinary   language     requires    that    a   plaintiff\n\nreceive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before\n\nhe can be said to prevail.\"            Hewitt, 482 U.S. at 760 (citing\n\nHanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 757 (1980)).\n\n     Here, although some of appellant's materials were returned\n\nto   him   (namely,     the   mortgage       papers,   his   mother's      death\n\ncertificate and a few other documents), most of the returned\n\nmaterials were copies rather than originals, and the police\n\nnever returned the Beane documents.             Appellant argues that all\n\nof \"his\" possessions were returned, and that he never sought the\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\freturn of the Beane documents.                   However, that proposition is\n\nclearly refuted by the complaint, which seeks the return of \"all\n\nmaterials seized.\"\n\n       Moreover, and more fundamentally, the crux of the complaint\n\nis that the seizure of the materials should have been deemed\n\nunlawful and unconstitutional, and that the City thus should\n\nhave       been    enjoined        from    using     the    materials         in    its\n\ninvestigation.            The return of the documents, however, did not\n\nprevent the City from continuing its investigation.2                           To the\n\ncontrary, the parties agreed that all but a few of the returned\n\nmaterials         would     be   photocopied       so   that    law        enforcement\n\nauthorities        could    continue      their    investigation.           Given   the\n\nlimited nature of the plaintiff's success, neither the district\n\ncourt's finding that appellant was not a prevailing party, nor\n\nits    refusal      to     award    attorney's      fees,      was    an    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion, let alone a manifest one.                   See, e.g., Gay Officers\n\nAction League, 247 F.3d at 294 (a court is \"well within its\n\nrights to deny prevailing party status\" if plaintiff's success\n\nwas    \"purely      technical       or    de   minimis\")    (internal        citation\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       The government's later termination of criminal charges is\nimmaterial because its decision was not based on the return of\nthe seized materials.\n\n                                           -7-\n\f       Appellant also argues that he achieved his goals in this\n\nlawsuit by receiving something akin to a consent decree. See\n\nMaher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129 (1980) (permitting attorney's\n\nfees in judicially approved settlements).                    He concedes that the\n\ndistrict court neither ordered the parties to comply, nor ruled\n\non    the   merits,      yet   he   contends         that   the    district    court's\n\nbrokering     of    the    deal     was   a     de    facto,      if   not   de   jure,\n\nsettlement.      The district court, however, found to the contrary\n\nand concluded that its involvement in the case \"in no way\n\nrepresent[ed] the Court's adjudication of the parties' claims.\"\n\nThe district court is obviously in the best position to evaluate\n\nits own actions and their weight.                     Cf. Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816\n\nF.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1997) (explaining that \"uncertainty as to\n\nthe    meaning     and    intendment      of    a     district     court     order   can\n\nsometimes best be dispelled by deference to the views of the\n\nwriting judge\").           The record provides no basis for second-\n\nguessing the court's conclusion that its intervention was not\n\nthe equivalent of a consent decree, and we therefore find no\n\nabuse of discretion in the court's determination that appellant\n\ndid not prevail in his lawsuit.\n\n       Likewise, appellant is not a prevailing party under section\n\n11I of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Law.                        Appellant contends\n\nthat he is entitled to attorney's fees under the Massachusetts\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\flaw    because,    unlike    the     federal       Fees    Act,   which      permits    a\n\ndistrict court to exercise discretion in awarding attorney's\n\nfees, the phrasing of the Massachusetts statute is absolute:\n\n\"Any    aggrieved    person     or    persons       who    prevail     in    an   action\n\nauthorized by this section shall be entitled to an award of the\n\ncosts of the litigation and reasonable attorneys' fees in an\n\namount to be fixed by the court.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, ยง 11\n\n(emphasis added).          Thus, appellant argues, he is automatically\n\nentitled to attorney's fees.                     However, our conclusion that\n\nappellant was not a prevailing party applies to both the state\n\nand    federal    statutes.          The    Massachusetts         attorney's        fees\n\nprovision is therefore inapplicable.\n\nB.     The Catalyst Theory\n\n       Until recently, a plaintiff in a civil rights dispute could\n\nalso achieve prevailing party status under the catalyst theory.\n\nThis theory permitted attorney's fees if a lawsuit acted as a\n\n\"'catalyst' in prompting defendants to take action to meet\n\nplaintiff's       claims    .   .     .    despite        the   lack    of    judicial\n\ninvolvement in the result.\"               Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275,\n\n279 (1st Cir. 1978). In other words, a plaintiff would be deemed\n\nto have \"prevailed\" in a lawsuit \"even if there [was] no award\n\nor injunction, so long as the lawsuit effectively achieved a\n\nfavorable    result    sought        by   the     plaintiff.\"        Stanton      v.   S.\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fBerkshire Regional Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 574, 577 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n    The Supreme Court, however, has expressly rejected the\n\ncatalyst theory.       See Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc. v. W.\n\nVa. Dep't of Health and Human Res., 121 S. Ct. 1835 (2001).\n\nAlthough Buckhannon applied to the Fair Housing Amendments Act\n\nand the Americans with Disabilities Act,           the Court specifically\n\nnoted    that    the   fee-shifting       provisions   of    several   other\n\nstatutes,       including    the   Fees   Act,    should    be   interpreted\n\nconsistently.       See id. at 1839 n.4.         Although we approved the\n\ncatalyst theory in the past, see, e.g., Nadeau, 581 F.2d at 279,\n\nwe are constrained to follow the Court's broad directive and\n\njoin several of our sister circuits in concluding that the\n\ncatalyst theory may no longer be used to award attorney's fees\n\nunder the Fees Act.         See, e.g., Chambers v. Ohio Dep't of Human\n\nServs., 273 F.3d 690, 691-93 (6th Cir. 2001); Johnson v. ITT\n\nAerospace/Communications Div. of ITT Indus., Inc., 272 F.3d 498,\n\n500 (7th Cir. 2001); N.Y. State Fed'n of Taxi Drivers, Inc. v.\n\nWestchester County Taxi and Limousine Comm'n, 272 F.3d 154, 158\n\n(2d Cir. 2001); Griffin v. Steeltek, Inc., 261 F.3d 1026, 1029\n\n(10th Cir. 2001); Johnson v. Rodriguez, 260 F.3d 493, 495 (5th\n\nCir. 2001); Bennett v. Yoshina, 259 F.3d 1097, 1100-01 (9th Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f      Appellant argues that the theory is still viable under\n\nMassachusetts law, and reasons that the lawsuit was a catalyst\n\nfor change because the City voluntarily agreed to return the\n\nseized property.    However, he does not cite (nor have we found)\n\na single   case in which Massachusetts ever has recognized the\n\ntheory as a basis for recovery under the state civil rights\n\nstatute.   To the contrary, it appears that the Massachusetts\n\ncourts have applied the catalyst theory only in awarding fees\n\nunder the Fees Act.\n\n      Even assuming arguendo that Massachusetts recognizes the\n\ncatalyst   doctrine,      appellant's       claim    nevertheless      fails.\n\nRegardless of the return of some of the seized materials, the\n\nCity was still able to undertake its criminal investigation of\n\nappellant and the City never returned many of the seized items.\n\nThus, the district court concluded that \"in the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, it is obvious that Richardson did not prevail in\n\nany   plausible   sense   of   the    word.\"        We   find   no   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion in that determination.           See, e.g., Pearson v. Fair,\n\n980 F.2d 37, 44 (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that party seeking\n\nfees under catalyst theory must show that \"whatever changes\n\n[his] lawsuit caused . . . were not de minimis.\").\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f",

He concedes that the district court neither ordered the parties to comply, nor ruled on the merits, yet he contends that the district court's brokering of the deal was a de facto, if not de jure, settlement. The district court, however, found to the contrary and concluded that its involvement in the case \"in no way represent[ed] the Court's adjudication of the parties' claims.\" The district court is obviously in the best position to evaluate its own actions and their weight. <i>Cf.

This theory permitted attorney's fees if a lawsuit acted as a \"`catalyst' in prompting defendants to take action to meet plaintiff's claims ... despite the lack of judicial involvement in the result.\" <i>Nadeau v. Helgemoe,</i> 581 F.2d 275, 279 (1st Cir.1978). In other words, a plaintiff would be deemed to have \"prevailed\" in a lawsuit \"even if there [was] no award or injunction, so long as the lawsuit effectively achieved a favorable result sought by the plaintiff.\" <i>Stanton v. S. Berkshire Regional Sch. Dist.,</i> 197 F.3d 574, 577 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, however, has expressly rejected the catalyst theory. <i>See Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health and Human Res.,</i> 532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). Although <i>Buckhannon</i> applied to the Fair Housing Amendments Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Court specifically noted that the fee-shifting provisions of several other statutes, including the Fees Act, should be interpreted consistently. <i>See id.</i> at 1839 n. 4. Although we approved the catalyst theory in the past, <i>see, e.g., Nadeau,</i> 581 F.2d at 279, we are constrained to follow the Court's broad directive and join several of our sister circuits in concluding that the catalyst theory may no longer be used to award attorney's fees under the Fees Act. <i>See, e.g., Chambers v. Ohio Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> 273 F.3d 690, 691-93 (6th Cir.2001); <i>Johnson v. ITT Aerospace/Communications Div. of ITT Indus., Inc.,</i> 272 F.3d 498, 500 (7th Cir.2001); <i>N.Y.

However, he does not cite (nor have we found) a single case in which Massachusetts ever has recognized the theory as a basis for recovery under the state civil rights statute. To the contrary, it appears that the Massachusetts courts have applied the catalyst theory only in awarding fees under the Fees Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Massachusetts recognizes the catalyst doctrine, appellant's claim nevertheless fails. Regardless of the return of some of the seized materials, the City was still able to undertake its criminal investigation of appellant and the City never returned many of the seized items. Thus, the district court concluded that \"in the totality of the circumstances, it is obvious that Richardson did not prevail in any plausible sense of the word.\" We find no abuse of discretion in that determination. <i>See, e.g., Pearson v. Fair,</i> 980 F.2d 37, 44 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that party seeking fees under catalyst theory must show that \"whatever changes [his] lawsuit caused ... were not <i>de minimis.</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellant also conclusorily states that he is appealing the district court's denial of his motion to vacate the order of dismissal.

A police officer stopped the vehicle and requested a driver's license from Howell, who instead produced a State of Michigan photo identification of \"Donald Beane.\" Appellant's picture was on Beane's identification. The officer asked appellant to identify himself. The officer became suspicious and requested further identification when appellant told him he was Dana Richardson. In appellant's wallet were credit cards and picture identifications, all in Beane's name. Richardson also possessed some personal papers, including his mother's death certificate and mortgage papers. The officer seized all of the papers, credit cards and identifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant repeatedly and unsuccessfully sought return of the seized items and ultimately filed a lawsuit in state court seeking to have the items returned and the government enjoined from using the materials in any criminal investigation of him. The City removed the case to federal court, and the district court heard oral argument on appellant's motion for a restraining order. During the hearing, at the district court's nudging, the parties agreed that the City would return some of the seized materials to appellant. Because of the continuing investigation, however, most of the returned materials were to be photocopies rather than originals. The district court then denied as moot appellant's motion. After continued negotiation between the parties, the City returned appellant's wallet and some of his personal papers. It never returned the so-called \"Beane documents\" because they pertained to the criminal investigation. Appellant was arrested soon thereafter and charged with four counts of credit card fraud, but the charges were later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the materials were returned, appellant offered several times to dismiss the case. The parties could not agree, however, on whether the case would be dismissed with, or without, prejudice. Appellant eventually moved to voluntarily dismiss and filed a petition for attorney's fees and costs as a prevailing party under the Attorney's Fee Awards Act of 1976 (\"the Fees Act\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988, and its state analogue, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167; 11I. The district court dismissed the case, with prejudice, but denied the fee petition, reasoning that appellant was not a prevailing party as contemplated by the statutes because the court did not issue any substantive rulings and the case did not proceed to trial. Appellant appeals from that order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have long held that we are highly deferential to a district court's decision whether to award attorney's fees, and thus will set aside its ruling only if that ruling constituted a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gay Officers Action League v.

This theory permitted attorney's fees if a lawsuit acted as a \"`catalyst' in prompting defendants to take action to meet plaintiff's claims ... despite the lack of judicial involvement in the result.\" <i>Nadeau v. Helgemoe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358671\"><a href=\"/opinion/358671/larry-nadeau-v-raymond-a-helgemoe-warden-new-hampshire-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 279 (1st Cir.1978). In other words, a plaintiff would be deemed to have \"prevailed\" in a lawsuit \"even if there [was] no award or injunction, so long as the lawsuit effectively achieved a favorable result sought by the plaintiff.\" <i>Stanton v. S. Berkshire Regional Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198739\"><a href=\"/opinion/198739/stanton-v-southern-berkshire-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span>, 577 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, however, has expressly rejected the catalyst theory. <i>See Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health and Human Res.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although <i>Buckhannon</i> applied to the Fair Housing Amendments Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Court specifically noted that the fee-shifting provisions of several other statutes, including the Fees Act, should be interpreted consistently. <i>See id.</i> at 1839 n. 4. Although we approved the catalyst theory in the past, <i>see, e.g., Nadeau,</i> 581 F.2d at 279, we are constrained to follow the Court's broad directive and join several of our sister circuits in concluding that the catalyst theory may no longer be used to award attorney's fees under the Fees Act. <i>See, e.g., Chambers v. Ohio Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775804\"><a href=\"/opinion/775804/robert-chambers-jean-chambers-lauren-holland-sarah-holland-state-of-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 691-93 (6th Cir.2001); <i>Johnson v.

However, he does not cite (nor have we found) a single case in which Massachusetts ever has recognized the theory as a basis for recovery under the state civil rights statute. To the contrary, it appears that the Massachusetts courts have applied the catalyst theory only in awarding fees under the Fees Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Massachusetts recognizes the catalyst doctrine, appellant's claim nevertheless fails. Regardless of the return of some of the seized materials, the City was still able to undertake its criminal investigation of appellant and the City never returned many of the seized items. Thus, the district court concluded that \"in the totality of the circumstances, it is obvious that Richardson did not prevail in any plausible sense of the word.\" We find no abuse of discretion in that determination. <i>See, e.g., Pearson v. Fair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595484\"><a href=\"/opinion/595484/donald-pearson-v-michael-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that party seeking fees under catalyst theory must show that \"whatever changes [his] lawsuit caused ... were not <i>de minimis.</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellant also conclusorily states that he is appealing the district court's denial of his motion to vacate the order of dismissal.
