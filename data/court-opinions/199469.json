Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Peter Díaz Santiago, with whom Woods & Woods was on brief,\nfor appellants.\n     Carl Schuster, with whom María Santiago Ramos and Schuster,\nUsera, Aguilló & Santiago LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         June 13, 2001\n\f\f           Per Curiam.     In this case, the principal plaintiff, a\n\nformer managerial employee who ostensibly lost his post with\n\nBlack & Decker (PR) as part of a reduction in force, claims that\n\nhis age was the real reason behind his ouster.                 The plaintiffs\n\n— the former employee, his wife, and their conjugal partnership\n\n— sued under, inter alia, the Age Discrimination in Employment\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., and in due course, the employer\n\nmoved   for   summary   judgment,    Fed.    R.   Civ.    P.    56(c).    The\n\nplaintiffs failed to file an opposition.               The district court\n\nnonetheless studied the matter, wrote a thoughtful opinion, and\n\ngranted the motion for brevis disposition.               Jimenez Colon v.\n\nBlack & Decker (PR) LLC, Civ. No. 99-1871 (D.P.R. Aug. 9, 2000).\n\n           Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a motion for\n\nrelief from judgment, Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), in which they\n\ninvoked   subsection    (1)   of   the    rule   and   claimed    that   their\n\nfailure to oppose the summary judgment motion resulted from\n\nexcusable neglect.      They averred that they (mistakenly) believed\n\nthat they had filed a motion to reopen discovery — the motion\n\nhad, in fact, been filed in a different case — and that this\n\nmotion would have assured deferral of any consideration of\n\nsummary judgment.       The defendant objected to the Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           The district court wrote a second opinion, finding\n\nneglect,     but   also   finding     an    absence   of   excusatory\n\ncircumstances.     Jimenez Colon v. Black & Decker (PR) LLC, Civ.\n\nNo. 99-1871 (D.P.R. Oct. 3, 2000).         For that reason, the court\n\nrefused to set aside its earlier judgment.       See id.   This appeal\n\nensued.    In it, the plaintiffs challenge only the court's denial\n\nof their Rule 60(b) motion.\n\n           We need not tarry.       We previously have acknowledged\n\nthat when a trial judge adroitly takes the measure of a case,\n\napplies correct legal standards, and formulates a convincing\n\nrationale, \"an appellate court should refrain from writing at\n\nlength to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\"\n\nLawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); accord Cruz-Ramos v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co., 202\n\nF.3d 381, 383 (1st Cir. 2000); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas,\n\nLocal 901, 74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); Holders Capital\n\nCorp. v. California Union Ins. Co. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza\n\nHotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).          This is\n\nsuch an instance.    The district court's lucid opinion refusing\n\nto relieve the plaintiffs from the judgment is unimpugnable.\n\nConsequently, we affirm the judgment below substantially on the\n\nbasis of that opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f           We add only a few brief comments.        First, contrary to\n\nthe plaintiffs' importunings, the district court followed the\n\nappropriate    legal   regime,   see    Pioneer   Inv.   Servs.   Co.   v.\n\nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P'shp, 507 U.S. 380, 393-94 (1993);\n\nMirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc., 212 F.3d 624, 630-31 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\nand, for aught that appears, applied that regime in a sensible\n\nfashion.   Second, given the many shortcomings in the plaintiffs'\n\nposition — they took a lackadaisical approach toward discovery;\n\nsat for several weeks on the documents that they now say justify\n\nfurther discovery; filed nothing within the allotted period for\n\nresponding to the defendant's summary judgment motion; and, when\n\nthey belatedly prepared the motion to reopen discovery, failed\n\nto file it in the papers of this case — we scarcely can fault\n\nthe district court's conclusion that the plaintiffs' neglect was\n\ninexcusable.\n\n           If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\nstandard of review applicable to the denial of a motion which\n\ninvokes Rule 60(b)(1) is for abuse of discretion.             Lepore v.\n\nVidockler, 792 F.2d 272, 273-74 (1st Cir. 1986).          In this area,\n\nthe scope of the court's discretion is considerable.              Even if\n\none concedes, favorably to the plaintiffs, that a factfinder\n\nmight consider their neglect pardonable, there is nothing in the\n\nrecord that either compels such a finding or that undermines the\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fdistrict court's contrary assessment.      There was, therefore, no\n\nabuse of the court's wide discretion.\n\n            We need go no further.    The plaintiffs have not shown\n\nan entitlement to relief from the judgment.      The order appealed\n\nfrom is, therefore, affirmed.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
