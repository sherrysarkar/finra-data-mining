Busconi's  putative\r\n\nintent  to  defraud  Williamson  in  a  substantial  real  estate\r\n\ntransaction.   In  due course  Williamson commenced  an adversary\r\n\nproceeding in the bankruptcy  court to except his claim  from the\r\n\nchapter 7  discharge on the ground that the debt had been induced\r\n\nby  fraud.   See  Bankruptcy Code     523(a)(2)(A), 11  U.S.C.   \r                          \r\n\n523(a)(2)(A)  (1994).   Following  careful review  of the  entire\r\n\nrecord,  we  conclude  that   the  bankruptcy  court  abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion  by excluding  the  proffered evidence,  but that  the\r\n\nerror did not affect substantial rights. \r\n\n          At the bench trial, Williamson unsuccessfully attempted\r\n\nto introduce  evidence as to various  events, including Busconi's\r\n\nconduct,  subsequent   to  the  closing  of   their  real  estate\r\n\ntransaction,  from  which  a  factfinder  reasonably  could  have\r\n\ninferred that  Busconi had not  intended to pay  the note  at the\r\n\ntime it was executed.   The evidence was excluded  as irrelevant.\r\n\nNonetheless,  after hearing  the testimony  of both  parties, the\r\n\nbankruptcy  judge expressly  credited Busconi's  testimony, found\r\n\nthat Williamson had failed  to establish the requisite fraudulent\r\n\nintent,  and  ruled  the   Williamson  debt  dischargeable.

Evidentiary rulings  by  the\r                                          \r\nbankruptcy  court  are  subject  to  the  \"abuse  of  discretion\"\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          As  direct evidence  is  seldom  available,  fraudulent\r\n\nintent  normally   is  determined   from  the  totality   of  the\r\n\ncircumstances.  Charlie Kelton's Pontiac,  Cadillac, Oldsmobile &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nIsuzu  Truck, Inc. v.

And  since  \"subsequent  conduct may\r\n\nreflect back  to the promisor's  state of  mind and  thus may  be\r\n\nconsidered in ascertaining whether  there was fraudulent  intent\"\r\n\nat  the  time the  promise was  made,  proper application  of the\r\n\n\"totality\"   test  in   the   instant   context  often   warrants\r\n\nconsideration  of post-transaction  conduct and  consequences, as\r\n\nwell as pre-transaction conduct  and contemporaneous events.

In  sum, the  bankruptcy court  ruling excluding\r\n\nBusconi's relevant  post-closing conduct constituted an  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n          Williamson   must   also   show,  however,   that   the\r\n\nevidentiary ruling adversely  affected his \"substantial  rights.\"\r\n\nSee Fed.

At a minimum, Williamson would  need\r\n\nto demonstrate clear  error in the  ultimate assessment that  the\r\n\ntestimony given by Busconi  was more credible than that  given by\r\n\nWilliamson.
