Upon careful review of the briefs and record, we find\r\nno basis for defendant's contention that she was not afforded her right\r\nof allocution.  As required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(C), \"before\r\nimposing sentence,\" the district court gave defendant an opportunity \"to\r\nmake a statement and to present any information in mitigation of the\r\nsentence.\"  The district court did not violate Rule 32 by considering\r\ndefendant's motion for a downward departure before hearing allocution. \r\nSee United States v. Diaz-Alvarez, 46 F.3d 784, 785 (8th Cir. 1995). \r\nFurther, nothing in the record suggests to us that the district court\r\nfailed to give due consideration to defendant's statement.  See United\r\nStates v. Mata-Grullon, 887 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                             -2-\n",
