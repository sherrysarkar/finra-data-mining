We affirm the district court judgment.\r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND1\r                                     BACKGROUND\r                                               \r\n\n          Approximately   two  years   after  LaRou   joined  the\r\n\nCumberland  County Sheriff's  Department (\"Department\")  in April\r\n\n1989,  he was  designated \"Lieutenant,  Programs Coordinator\"  by\r\n\nSheriff  Ridlon.  Previously, Ridlon  had told LaRou  that one of\r\n\nhis new  responsibilities would be to  gather adverse information\r\n\nthat might enable Ridlon to fire Sergeant Christopher  Muse, whom\r\n\nRidlon considered a  political rival.2   LaRou responded that  he\r\n\nwould  keep his eyes  open, but would not  participate in a witch\r\n\nhunt.  Despite repeated  requests from Ridlon, LaRou reported  no\r\n\nadverse information  about Muse.   Ridlon  nevertheless appointed\r\n\nLaRou to a captaincy and made him the Administrative Aide respon-\r\n\nsible  for inmate programs  and officer  training (Administrative\r\n\nAide/Programs) in October 1991.         In November 1993,  howev-\r\n\ner, all three  captains in the Department,  including LaRou, were\r\n\nreassigned  to newly-created  \"shift commander\"  positions.   The\r\n\ntransfer memo stated that the shift commander assignments were to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The material  facts in genuine  dispute are related  in the\r\nlight  most favorable to LaRou.   Velez-Gomez v.  SMA Life Assur.\r                                                                           \r\nCo., 8 F.3d 873, 875 (1st Cir. 1993).  \r             \r\n\n     2In 1990, Muse had  gone to Ridlon and informed  him that he\r\nplanned to run against Ridlon in 1994.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nremain  in effect until further  notice.  LaRou  regarded his new\r\n\nnight shift  commander assignment  as a temporary  demotion, even\r\n\nthough he had been relieved of all training  program duties and a\r\n\nRidlon  political supporter had been  appointed to succeed him as\r\n\nAdministrative Aide/Programs.  LaRou was never told that he would\r\n\nor would not be redesignated Administrative Aide/Programs.  \r\n\n          In December  1993, Sergeant  Muse first informed  LaRou\r\n\nthat he intended to run against Ridlon for the Democratic nomina-\r\n\ntion for  Sheriff.  Although LaRou  thereafter actively supported\r\n\nthe  Muse campaign,  Ridlon  ultimately won  both the  Democratic\r\n\nnomination and, on June 14, 1994, a second term as Sheriff.  \r\n\n          In January 1995, while still serving as the night shift\r\n\ncommander,  LaRou saw  a posting  for the  position  of \"Programs\r\n\nManager,\"  which he believed  to be essentially  identical to his\r\n\nprevious position of Administrative Aide/Programs.  LaRou prompt-\r\n\nly contacted the Cumberland County Personnel Manager, who advised\r\n\nthat  as far as Cumberland  County was concerned  LaRou was still\r\n\nthe Administrative  Aide/Programs.  LaRou  did not apply  for the\r\n\nnewly-posted position, however, because  he felt that it remained\r\n\nhis  by  right and  that he  was being  forced  out by  Ridlon in\r\n\nretaliation for supporting Muse in the 1994 political campaign.\r\n\n          The district court  rejected LaRou's retaliation  claim\r\n\nrelating to the November 1993 \"demotion\" to night shift commander\r\n\nas a  \"chronological impossibility,\" given the  statement by Muse\r\n\nthat  LaRou had been  the first person in  the department whom he\r\n\nhad  told (in December 1993)  about his plan  to run for Sheriff,\r                                \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwhich was  after LaRou's November 1993 \"demotion\"  to night shift\r                                           \r\n\ncommander.3  Second,  the district court ruled  that the retalia-\r\n\ntion  claim  based  on  the wrongful  permanent  elimination,  in\r\n\nJanuary   1995,  of  the  Administrative  Aide/Programs  position\r\n\npreviously held by LaRou,  amounted to a mere restatement  of the\r\n\nNovember  1993 retaliatory  \"demotion\" claim,  and hence  was not\r\n\nactionable. \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n1.

The 1993 Retaliation Claim\r                                         \r\n\n          LaRou  claims  on  appeal  that Ridlon  (i)  knew  Muse\r\n\nplanned to oppose Ridlon in  the 1994 primary, see supra note  2,\r                                                                  \r\n\n(ii) Ridlon  originally promoted LaRou with  instructions to find\r\n\ngrounds  for  dismissing Muse,  and  (iii)  LaRou ultimately  was\r\n\n\"demoted\" for failing to  provide Ridlon with adverse information\r\n\nabout Muse and for forming instead a successful working relation-\r\n\nship  with Muse.  The 1993 retaliation claim fails, however, even\r\n\nassuming  Ridlon caused LaRou to be \"demoted\" based on a retalia-\r\n\ntory motive, since  LaRou was engaged  in no protected  political\r\n\nactivity at the time.

Monroig, 963 F.2d 2, 5 (1st Cir. 1992) (plain-\r                                    \r\n\ntiff-employee must show causal  connection between his  political\r\n\naffiliation and the adverse treatment). \r\n\n          LaRou claims he was  \"demoted\" to night shift commander\r\n\nbecause  he did  not  abide by  Ridlon's  instructions to  gather\r\n\ninformation which would enable  Ridlon to fire Muse.   LaRou does\r\n\nnot  claim, however,  nor does  the  record indicate,  that LaRou\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nprovided Muse with political support prior to his alleged  \"demo-\r\n\ntion\" in November 1993.  Although Ridlon and Muse had had politi-\r\n\ncal differences as early as 1990, as of  November 1993 Ridlon and\r\n\nLaRou had  not; and LaRou does  not claim that he  then knew Muse\r\n\nintended to oppose Ridlon.4  Thus,  for aught that appears in the\r\n\nrecord, LaRou's relationship with  Muse in November 1993 was  not\r\n\npolitical.          LaRou himself  asserts that  he chose not  to\r\n\nprovide Ridlon with adverse information about Muse because he and\r\n\nMuse had developed a  successful professional relationship, which\r\n\nresulted in many  noteworthy advances in officer-training  proce-\r\n\ndures.   Conspicuously absent  is any  suggestion that  LaRou was\r\n\nmotivated by  Muse's political plans,  affiliation, or  beliefs.5\r\n\nSince the record does  not disclose that LaRou was engaged in any\r\n\nprotected political  activity, the alleged \"demotion\" in November\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4At  his deposition, LaRou was asked whether he and Muse had\r\never discussed Muse's political  campaign prior to LaRou's \"demo-\r\ntion\" in November, 1993.  After stating that it was \"most likely\"\r\nthat such a conversation occurred, LaRou explained:\r\n\n          I was moved out in  November of '93 and  that\r\n          was very early  - very early.   And if  there\r\n          was  ever any  mention  of  it, it  certainly\r\n          wasn't a strategic  mentioning because  there\r\n          was no  strategy at  that time.   That's very\r\n          early.   So  there may  have been  a sideline\r\n          comment,  there may have been a joke made.  I\r\n          really couldn't say.   Nothing jumps up at me\r\n          of a conversation or anything, but I wouldn't\r\n          doubt that  it happened.

Up  until that  time,  LaRou says,  he  had\r\n\nbelieved that  his November 1993  \"demotion\" to night  shift com-\r\n\nmander was merely temporary, and that he would be returned to his\r\n\nformer position some  day.  He adds  that the position title  was\r\n\nchanged at the time of the posting in January 1995 to justify his\r\n\nfinal removal, and that  his \"permanent\" loss of the  position in\r\n\n1995  was in retaliation  for his support of  Muse's 1994 bid for\r\n\nSheriff.   The 1995  retaliation claim nonetheless  fails because\r\n\nLaRou was subjected to no cognizable adverse employment action as\r\n\na result of the simple posting of the \"Programs Manager\" position\r\n\nin January 1995.   See Connell v. Bank of  Boston, 924 F.2d 1169,\r                                                           \r\n\n1179 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1218 (1991)6 (\"Most cases\r                                       \r\n\ninvolving a retaliation  claim are based on  an employment action\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Although Connell  involved ADEA claims rather  than   1983,\r                                \r\nits analysis is  persuasive.

Simi-\r\n\nlarly,  he  proffers no  evidentiary  foundation  for the  stated\r\n\nbelief  that his transfer to shift commander in November 1993 was\r\n\ntemporary. \r\n\n          LaRou baldly attests in his  affidavit that he was told\r\n\nthe transfer  to shift  commander  was to  be temporary,  without\r\n\nidentifying,  either  by name  or  position,  the source  of  the\r\n\nhearsay statement.  Thus,  the unattributed statement is incompe-\r\n\ntent, see Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56(e) (affidavit \"shall set forth such\r                   \r\n\nfacts  as would be admissible in evidence\"), since it is inadmis-\r\n\nsible hearsay,  see Fed. R.

See  also  Woodman  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHaemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1094 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                           \r\n\n          The only  competent record evidence  indicates that the\r\n\nNovember  1993  \"demotion\" was  permanent.    According to  Frank\r\n\nAmoroso, Cumberland  County Jail Administrator, the 1993 realign-\r\n\nment of the three captains was part of an overarching  plan.  The\r\n\nAdministrative Aide/Programs position was to be eliminated    and\r\n\nwith it one  captaincy     and replaced with  a Programs  Manager\r\n\nposition.    Moreover, Amoroso  explained the  plan to  the three\r\n\ncaptains,  including LaRou,  at  a staff  meeting, and  requested\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\ntheir  input.   Thus,  LaRou  proffers no  competent  evidence to\r\n\nremove the 1995 job posting claim from \"the realm of speculative,\r\n\ngeneral allegations.\"  See Kauffman v. Puerto Rico Telephone Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n841 F.2d 1169, 1173 n.5 (1st Cir. 1988). \r\n\n          LaRou  asserts that  he  called the  personnel director\r\n\nafter seeing  the Programs Manager position posting, and was told\r\n\nthat, as far as Cumberland County was concerned, he was still the\r\n\nAdministrative Aide/Programs.  This  statement cannot help LaRou,\r\n\nhowever, since he concededly knew  that the newly posted Programs\r                                                                           \r\n\nManager position encompassed  his former position of  Administra-\r                                                           \r\n\ntive Aide/Programs, yet  he elected  not to apply  for the  newly\r                                                           \r\n\nposted position.  In these circumstances, reliance on the person-\r\n\nnel  director's  statement, indicating  merely  that no  official\r\n\nchange of status  had been  noted in LaRou's  personnel file,  is\r\n\npatently insufficient to generate a trialworthy issue.  \r\n\n          Absent some competent evidentiary  basis for the stated\r\n\nbelief that the 1993  transfer was merely temporary, at  the very\r\n\nleast  LaRou plainly  bore the  responsibility to  apply for  the\r\n\nposted position  which he  knew encompassed his  former position.\r\n\nFailing  which,  we are  at  a loss  to  understand how  the 1995\r\n\nposting  alone could be found  to have been  \"retaliatory.\"  Even\r\n\nassuming the newly posted position were LaRou's by right, he does\r\n\nnot explain  how Ridlon could  be found  to have acted  out of  a\r\n\nretaliatory motive simply in posting the position in 1995, absent\r\n\nany evidence that Ridlon  knew LaRou claimed his  former position\r\n\nor was interested  in the  newly posted position.   Without  such\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nevidence, it was  incumbent upon LaRou  to alert the  appropriate\r\n\ndecisionmakers  to  his interest  in,  or  claim to,  the  posted\r\n\nposition.8   Thus, LaRou failed  to generate a  trialworthy claim\r\n\nthat Ridlon harbored an  actionable retaliatory motive in posting\r\n\nthe programs manager position in 1995. \r\n\n          Finally,  given the  unchallenged  evidence that  LaRou\r\n\nelected not  to apply for the  newly posted position  in 1995, he\r\n\ncannot point to  a plausible  dispute that Ridlon  engaged in  an\r\n\n\"adverse  employment  action\"  simply  by  posting  the  programs\r\n\nmanager position.

Previously, Ridlon had told LaRou that one of his new responsibilities would be to gather adverse information that might enable Ridlon to fire Sergeant Christopher Muse, whom Ridlon considered a political rival.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  LaRou responded that he would keep his eyes open, but would not participate in a witch hunt.  Despite repeated requests from Ridlon, LaRou reported no adverse information about Muse.  Ridlon nevertheless appointed LaRou to a captaincy and made him the Administrative Aide responsible for inmate programs and officer training (Administrative Aide/Programs) in October 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1993, however, all three captains in the Department, including LaRou, were reassigned to newly-created \"shift commander\" positions.  The transfer memo stated that the shift commander assignments were to remain in effect until further notice.  LaRou regarded his new night shift commander assignment as a temporary demotion, even though he had been relieved of all training program duties and a Ridlon political supporter had been appointed to succeed him as Administrative Aide/Programs.  LaRou was never told that he would or would not be redesignated Administrative Aide/Programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1993, Sergeant Muse first informed LaRou that he intended to run against Ridlon for the Democratic nomination for Sheriff.

LaRou promptly contacted the Cumberland County Personnel Manager, who advised that as far as Cumberland County was concerned LaRou was still the Administrative Aide/Programs.  LaRou did not apply for the newly-posted position, however, because he felt that it remained his by right and that he was being forced out by Ridlon in retaliation for supporting Muse in the 1994 political campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected LaRou's retaliation claim relating to the November 1993 \"demotion\" to night shift commander as a \"chronological impossibility,\" given the statement by Muse that LaRou had been the first person in the department whom he had told (in December 1993) about his plan to run for Sheriff, which was after LaRou's November 1993 \"demotion\" to night shift commander.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Second, the district court ruled that the retaliation claim based on the wrongful permanent elimination, in January 1995, of the Administrative Aide/Programs position previously held by LaRou, amounted to a mere restatement of the November 1993 retaliatory \"demotion\" claim, and hence was not actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>1.

Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49 (1st Cir.1990), we rejected a political discrimination claim that an administrator had been constructively discharged from the judicial branch of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico due to his prior association with a former judge who held political views at odds with the defendant officials.  We explained that--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>a politically charged atmosphere ..., without more, provide[s] no basis for a reasonable inference that defendants' employment decisions about plaintiff were tainted by their disregard of plaintiff's first amendment rights.

LaRou does not claim, however, nor does the record indicate, that LaRou provided Muse with political support prior to his alleged \"demotion\" in November 1993.  Although Ridlon and Muse had had political differences as early as 1990, as of November 1993 Ridlon and LaRou had not;  and LaRou does not claim that he then knew Muse intended to oppose Ridlon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, for aught that appears in the record, LaRou's relationship with Muse in November 1993 was not political.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRou himself asserts that he chose not to provide Ridlon with adverse information about Muse because he and Muse had developed a successful professional relationship, which resulted in many noteworthy advances in officer-training procedures.  Conspicuously absent is any suggestion that LaRou was motivated by Muse's political plans, affiliation, or beliefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Since the record does not disclose that LaRou was engaged in any protected political activity, the alleged \"demotion\" in November 1993 did not give rise to a cognizable political discrimination claim even assuming Ridlon's adverse employment action was based on his political differences with Muse, and he took those differences out on LaRou.  See Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. The 1995 Job Posting</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRou attempts to assert a discrete retaliation claim in connection with the January 1995 posting of the \"Programs Manager\" position.  Up until that time, LaRou says, he had believed that his November 1993 \"demotion\" to night shift commander was merely temporary, and that he would be returned to his former position some day.  He adds that the position title was changed at the time of the posting in January 1995 to justify his final removal, and that his \"permanent\" loss of the position in 1995 was in retaliation for his support of Muse's 1994 bid for Sheriff.  The 1995 retaliation claim nonetheless fails because LaRou was subjected to no cognizable adverse employment action as a result of the simple posting of the \"Programs Manager\" position in January 1995.  See Connell v. Bank of Boston, 924 F.2d 1169, 1179 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1218, 111 S.Ct. 2828, 115 L.Ed.2d 997 (1991)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> (\"Most cases involving a retaliation claim are based on an employment action which has an adverse impact on the employee, i.e., discharge, demotion, or failure to promote.\");   see also Rutan v.

Id.;  cf. also Blackie v. State of Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 725 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that \"determining whether an action is materially adverse necessarily requires a case-by-case inquiry.\")  (Fair Labor Standards Act case).  Even assuming, without deciding, that the generous definition of \"adverse employment action\" propounded in Blackie likewise applies here, LaRou cannot bring the present claim within it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Under Blackie, LaRou might make out a retaliation claim were he to demonstrate that Ridlon had refused to promote (or transfer) him to the Programs Manager position posted in 1995, or refused to consider him for the position despite a duty to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although LaRou contends that the mere posting of the Programs Manager position in 1995 adversely affected his employment because at the time he still \"believed\" he would be returned to his prior position as Administrative Aide/Programs, he offers no evidence which would enable a rational trier of fact to find that this \"belief\" was based on anything but conjecture.  Similarly, he proffers no evidentiary foundation for the stated belief that his transfer to shift commander in November 1993 was temporary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRou baldly attests in his affidavit that he was told the transfer to shift commander was to be temporary, without identifying, either by name or position, the source of the hearsay statement.  Thus, the unattributed statement is incompetent, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (affidavit \"shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence\"), since it is inadmissible hearsay, see Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2) (out-of-court statement offered for truth of matter asserted not hearsay if attributable to party-opponent or agent).  See also Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1094 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only competent record evidence indicates that the November 1993 \"demotion\" was permanent.  According to Frank Amoroso, Cumberland County Jail Administrator, the 1993 realignment of the three captains was part of an overarching plan.  The Administrative Aide/Programs position was to be eliminated--and with it one captaincy--and replaced with a Programs Manager position.  Moreover, Amoroso explained the plan to the three captains, including LaRou, at a staff meeting, and requested their input.  Thus, LaRou proffers no competent evidence to remove the 1995 job posting claim from \"the realm of speculative, general allegations.\"   See Kauffman v. Puerto Rico Telephone Co., 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 n. 5 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRou asserts that he called the personnel director after seeing the Programs Manager position posting, and was told that, as far as Cumberland County was concerned, he was still the Administrative Aide/Programs.  This statement cannot help LaRou, however, since he concededly knew that the newly posted Programs Manager position encompassed his former position of Administrative Aide/Programs, yet he elected not to apply for the newly posted position.  In these circumstances, reliance on the personnel director's statement, indicating merely that no official change of status had been noted in LaRou's personnel file, is patently insufficient to generate a trialworthy issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent some competent evidentiary basis for the stated belief that the 1993 transfer was merely temporary, at the very least LaRou plainly bore the responsibility to apply for the posted position which he knew encompassed his former position.  Failing which, we are at a loss to understand how the 1995 posting alone could be found to have been \"retaliatory.\"   Even assuming the newly posted position were LaRou's by right, he does not explain how Ridlon could be found to have acted out of a retaliatory motive simply in posting the position in 1995, absent any evidence that Ridlon knew LaRou claimed his former position or was interested in the newly posted position.  Without such evidence, it was incumbent upon LaRou to alert the appropriate decisionmakers to his interest in, or claim to, the posted position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Thus, LaRou failed to generate a trialworthy claim that Ridlon harbored an actionable retaliatory motive in posting the programs manager position in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, given the unchallenged evidence that LaRou elected not to apply for the newly posted position in 1995, he cannot point to a plausible dispute that Ridlon engaged in an \"adverse employment action\" simply by posting the programs manager position.  See Boarman v. Sullivan, 769 F.Supp. 904, 910-11 (D.Md.1991);  cf. also Sinai v. New England Tel. and Tel. Co., 3 F.3d 471, 474 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1025, 115 S.Ct. 597, 130 L.Ed.2d 509 (1994) (Title VII);  Sherpell v. Humnoke Sch. Dist.

We accordingly hold that the mere posting of a position does not constitute an \"adverse employment action\" even though the position posted is known to encompass a prior position from which the plaintiff was demoted or transferred, provided the plaintiff received proper notice of the posted position and elected not to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The material facts in genuine dispute are related in the light most favorable to LaRou.

State of Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 725 (1st Cir.1996), a case involving the Fair Labor Standards Act, this court observed generally that \"[i]n a retaliation case, as in virtually any other discrimination case premised on disparate treatment, it is essential for the plaintiff to show that the employer took a materially adverse employment action against him.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In Blackie, we stated:</p>\n        <p>Typically, the employer must (1) take something of consequence from the employee, say, by discharging or demoting her, reducing her salary, or divesting her of significant responsibilities;  or (2) withhold from the employee an accoutrement of the employment relationship, say, by failing to follow a customary practice of considering her for promotion after a particular period of service.</p>\n        <p>Id.

Previously, Ridlon had told LaRou that one of his new responsibilities would be to gather adverse information that might enable Ridlon to fire Sergeant Christopher Muse, whom Ridlon considered a political rival.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  LaRou responded that he would keep his eyes open, but would not participate in a witch hunt.  Despite repeated requests from Ridlon, LaRou reported no adverse information about Muse.  Ridlon nevertheless appointed LaRou to a captaincy and made him the Administrative Aide responsible for inmate programs and officer training (Administrative Aide/Programs) in October 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1993, however, all three captains in the Department, including LaRou, were reassigned to newly-created \"shift commander\" positions.  The transfer memo stated that the shift commander assignments were to remain in effect until further notice.  LaRou regarded his new night shift commander assignment as a temporary demotion, even though he had been relieved of all training program duties and a Ridlon political supporter had been appointed to succeed him as Administrative Aide/Programs.  LaRou was never told that he would or would not be redesignated Administrative Aide/Programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1993, Sergeant Muse first informed LaRou that he intended to run against Ridlon for the Democratic nomination for Sheriff.

LaRou promptly contacted the Cumberland County Personnel Manager, who advised that as far as Cumberland County was concerned LaRou was still the Administrative Aide/Programs.  LaRou did not apply for the newly-posted position, however, because he felt that it remained his by right and that he was being forced out by Ridlon in retaliation for supporting Muse in the 1994 political campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected LaRou's retaliation claim relating to the November 1993 \"demotion\" to night shift commander as a \"chronological impossibility,\" given the statement by Muse that LaRou had been the first person in the department whom he had told (in December 1993) about his plan to run for Sheriff, which was after LaRou's November 1993 \"demotion\" to night shift commander.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Second, the district court ruled that the retaliation claim based on the wrongful permanent elimination, in January 1995, of the Administrative Aide/Programs position previously held by LaRou, amounted to a mere restatement of the November 1993 retaliatory \"demotion\" claim, and hence was not actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>1.

LaRou does not claim, however, nor does the record indicate, that LaRou provided Muse with political support prior to his alleged \"demotion\" in November 1993.  Although Ridlon and Muse had had political differences as early as 1990, as of November 1993 Ridlon and LaRou had not;  and LaRou does not claim that he then knew Muse intended to oppose Ridlon.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, for aught that appears in the record, LaRou's relationship with Muse in November 1993 was not political.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRou himself asserts that he chose not to provide Ridlon with adverse information about Muse because he and Muse had developed a successful professional relationship, which resulted in many noteworthy advances in officer-training procedures.  Conspicuously absent is any suggestion that LaRou was motivated by Muse's political plans, affiliation, or beliefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Since the record does not disclose that LaRou was engaged in any protected political activity, the alleged \"demotion\" in November 1993 did not give rise to a cognizable political discrimination claim even assuming Ridlon's adverse employment action was based on his political differences with Muse, and he took those differences out on LaRou.  See Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. The 1995 Job Posting</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRou attempts to assert a discrete retaliation claim in connection with the January 1995 posting of the \"Programs Manager\" position.  Up until that time, LaRou says, he had believed that his November 1993 \"demotion\" to night shift commander was merely temporary, and that he would be returned to his former position some day.  He adds that the position title was changed at the time of the posting in January 1995 to justify his final removal, and that his \"permanent\" loss of the position in 1995 was in retaliation for his support of Muse's 1994 bid for Sheriff.  The 1995 retaliation claim nonetheless fails because LaRou was subjected to no cognizable adverse employment action as a result of the simple posting of the \"Programs Manager\" position in January 1995.

Id.;  cf. also Blackie v.

Even assuming, without deciding, that the generous definition of \"adverse employment action\" propounded in Blackie likewise applies here, LaRou cannot bring the present claim within it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Under Blackie, LaRou might make out a retaliation claim were he to demonstrate that Ridlon had refused to promote (or transfer) him to the Programs Manager position posted in 1995, or refused to consider him for the position despite a duty to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although LaRou contends that the mere posting of the Programs Manager position in 1995 adversely affected his employment because at the time he still \"believed\" he would be returned to his prior position as Administrative Aide/Programs, he offers no evidence which would enable a rational trier of fact to find that this \"belief\" was based on anything but conjecture.  Similarly, he proffers no evidentiary foundation for the stated belief that his transfer to shift commander in November 1993 was temporary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRou baldly attests in his affidavit that he was told the transfer to shift commander was to be temporary, without identifying, either by name or position, the source of the hearsay statement.  Thus, the unattributed statement is incompetent, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (affidavit \"shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence\"), since it is inadmissible hearsay, see Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2) (out-of-court statement offered for truth of matter asserted not hearsay if attributable to party-opponent or agent).  See also Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span>, 1094 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only competent record evidence indicates that the November 1993 \"demotion\" was permanent.  According to Frank Amoroso, Cumberland County Jail Administrator, the 1993 realignment of the three captains was part of an overarching plan.  The Administrative Aide/Programs position was to be eliminated--and with it one captaincy--and replaced with a Programs Manager position.  Moreover, Amoroso explained the plan to the three captains, including LaRou, at a staff meeting, and requested their input.  Thus, LaRou proffers no competent evidence to remove the 1995 job posting claim from \"the realm of speculative, general allegations.\"   See Kauffman v. Puerto Rico Telephone Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503066\"><a href=\"/opinion/503066/bessie-a-kauffman-v-puerto-rico-telephone-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1173 n. 5 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRou asserts that he called the personnel director after seeing the Programs Manager position posting, and was told that, as far as Cumberland County was concerned, he was still the Administrative Aide/Programs.  This statement cannot help LaRou, however, since he concededly knew that the newly posted Programs Manager position encompassed his former position of Administrative Aide/Programs, yet he elected not to apply for the newly posted position.  In these circumstances, reliance on the personnel director's statement, indicating merely that no official change of status had been noted in LaRou's personnel file, is patently insufficient to generate a trialworthy issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent some competent evidentiary basis for the stated belief that the 1993 transfer was merely temporary, at the very least LaRou plainly bore the responsibility to apply for the posted position which he knew encompassed his former position.  Failing which, we are at a loss to understand how the 1995 posting alone could be found to have been \"retaliatory.\"   Even assuming the newly posted position were LaRou's by right, he does not explain how Ridlon could be found to have acted out of a retaliatory motive simply in posting the position in 1995, absent any evidence that Ridlon knew LaRou claimed his former position or was interested in the newly posted position.  Without such evidence, it was incumbent upon LaRou to alert the appropriate decisionmakers to his interest in, or claim to, the posted position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Thus, LaRou failed to generate a trialworthy claim that Ridlon harbored an actionable retaliatory motive in posting the programs manager position in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, given the unchallenged evidence that LaRou elected not to apply for the newly posted position in 1995, he cannot point to a plausible dispute that Ridlon engaged in an \"adverse employment action\" simply by posting the programs manager position.
