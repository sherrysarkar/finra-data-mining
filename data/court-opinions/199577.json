Richard Rogers appeals from the\n\nsummary disposition of his federal and state law claims against the\n\nUnited States, IRS agents Sophia Vicuna and Thomas Kilmartin, and\n\nNorthborough, Massachusetts, police officers Sergeant Thomas Martin,\n\nSergeant Michael Edmonds and Officer Frederick Perry. Finding no\n\nerror, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The facts of this case are straightforward. On March 5,\n\n1998, Agents Vicuna and Kilmartin arrived at Rogers's home to seize his\n\ntwo vehicles pursuant to a levy. Rogers, a resident of Northborough,\n\nMassachusetts, had been involved with the IRS in a dispute over taxes\n\nthat the IRS claimed he owed for the 1992 and 1993 tax years.1 Between\n\nNovember, 1996 and the arrival of the agents on March 5, 1998, the IRS\n\nsent Rogers various notices informing him of his delinquency and\n\nindicating its intention to levy against his property if the\n\ndelinquency was not resolved. Agent Vicuna also made at least one\n\npersonal visit to the property. Although Rogers refused to have any\n\nsubstantive conversation with Vicuna and instead summarily ordered her\n\noff his property, he later admitted that he received the notices\n\ninforming him of the intention to levy. Nonetheless, he took no action\n\n\n\n\n     1    According to the IRS, Rogers owed $10,606.68 for the 1992 tax\nyear and $17,643.44 for the 1993 tax year.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fbefore either the tax court or the district court to prevent the\n\nimposition of the levy.\n\n          When the agents arrived on March 5th, they were accompanied\n\nby Sergeant Martin and a tow truck. The agents rang the doorbell and,\n\nwhen Rogers answered, informed him they were there to seize his two\n\nvehicles, a Jeep and a van, that were parked in one of Rogers's two\n\ndriveways. This driveway was located at the north side of the house,\n\nand the cars were completely visible from the street. There were no\n\nsigns on the property, no gates, and no other obstructions that could\n\nhave prevented the agents from either seeing the vehicles from the\n\npublic street or from reaching the vehicles.\n\n          The agents handed Rogers a Notice of Seizure--listing his two\n\nvehicles--as well as a Notice of Levy. Rogers, however, demanded that\n\nthe agents produce a warrant or other document issued by a court. The\n\nagents did not have such a document, but nonetheless proceeded to seize\n\nthe two vehicles. Throughout the incident, Rogers informed the IRS\n\nagents and Martin that they were trespassing on his property because\n\nthey lacked a warrant, that he did not give them permission to be on\n\nhis property, and that they should immediately leave. The agents and\n\nMartin did not comply. Rogers then appealed to Sergeant Martin, asking\n\nMartin to intervene to prevent the cars from being \"stolen\" by the IRS\n\nagents. Martin, however, refused to intervene, responding that the IRS\n\nagents' paperwork appeared to be in order. Rogers then requested that\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fMartin summon the Worcester County Sheriff's office, but Martin again\n\nrefused, stating that the duties of the Sheriff's office did not extend\n\nbeyond transferring prisoners.\n\n          Faced with Martin's refusal to intervene, Rogers began to\n\nremove some of his personal items from the vehicle. The IRS agents\n\nthen requested the keys to the cars. Rogers gave them to Martin with\n\nthe instruction that Martin was to protect his property. Martin gave\n\nthe keys directly to the IRS agents. Agent Kilmartin then removed more\n\nof Rogers's personal items from the vehicle, putting them temporarily\n\non the roof in a \"provocative and insulting manner.\"             These\n\npreliminaries completed, the cars were towed away, the agents and\n\nMartin left the scene, and Rogers returned inside.\n\n          Aside from Kilmartin's actions in removing Rogers's personal\n\nitems, the entire scene was relatively nonconfrontational. Of all the\n\nparticipants, Martin was the only one armed, and then only with a\n\npistol that remained in his holster during the entire seizure.\n\nAlthough Rogers expressed a feeling of duress because Martin was armed\n\nand stated that this duress caused him to hand over the keys to his\n\ncars, Rogers agreed that Martin never mentioned the gun. Moreover,\n\nRogers also agreed that Martin had not acted out of personal animosity\n\ntowards Rogers and had not acted intentionally to harm him. The entry\n\nonto Rogers's land and the seizure of his vehicles did not result in\n\nany physical contact, altercation or violence.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          On March 7th, two days after the seizure, Rogers went to the\n\nNorthborough Police Station, with a witness, to file a stolen vehicle\n\nreport on the two vehicles. Officer Perry and Sergeant Edmonds met\n\nwith Rogers and listened to his complaint. They refused, however, to\n\naccept a stolen vehicle report, reasoning that Rogers's real complaint\n\nwas with the IRS. Rogers protested that the lack of a warrant or other\n\ndocument issued by a court necessarily meant that the cars were taken\n\nwithout the proper authority and were therefore stolen. Perry and\n\nEdmonds were unpersuaded and continued to refuse to accept a stolen\n\nvehicle report.\n\n          Approximately a month later, Rogers commenced an action\n\nagainst the IRS agents and the police officers in Massachusetts state\n\ncourt. That action was removed to federal court in late April of 1998.\n\nRogers subsequently amended his complaint, asserting, against the IRS\n\nagents and Martin, state law claims of trespass, trespass vi et armis,\n\nconversion, intentional infliction of emotional distress, misfeasance,\n\nand malfeasance, as well as § 1983 claims of violations of his civil\n\nrights, and a conspiracy to violate those rights. These claims arose\n\nsolely out of the defendants' actions on Rogers's property on March 5,\n\n1998. The amended complaint also alleged claims of nonfeasance, § 1983\n\nclaims of violations of Rogers's civil rights and a conspiracy to\n\nviolate those rights against Edmonds and Perry. Again, these legal\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fclaims were based only upon the refusal to allow Rogers to file a\n\nstolen vehicle report.\n\n           After Rogers filed his amended complaint, the United States\n\nAttorney for Massachusetts issued a certification that each IRS agent\n\nhad been acting \"within the scope of his or her employment and office\n\nas an employee of the United States at the time that the incidents out\n\nof which plaintiff's claims arose occurred.\"          Based upon this\n\ncertification and the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2679, the United States\n\nsought to have itself substituted as the party defendant on Rogers's\n\nstate law claims against the IRS agents. The district court granted\n\nthis motion on January 18, 2000, leaving Vicuna and Kilmartin named\n\npersonally as party defendants to Rogers's federal civil rights claims.2\n\n\n\n           The United States then filed a motion to dismiss the claims\n\nagainst it and Vicuna and Kilmartin. The district court granted this\n\nmotion, concluding that none of Rogers's state law claims fell under \"a\n\nstatute with respect to which the United States has waived its\n\nsovereign immunity,\" and that therefore they were barred. The district\n\ncourt also dismissed Rogers's federal civil rights claims against\n\nVicuna and Kilmartin on the ground that a remedy pursuant to Bivens v.\n\nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388\n\n(1971) was unavailable. Following this disposition, Martin, Edmonds,\n\n     2     Rogers has not appealed from this order.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fand Perry filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted this\n\nmotion, reasoning that, under established precedent, Rogers had failed\n\nto demonstrate any constitutional violation, or, indeed, any\n\nimpropriety on the part of the IRS agents that could form the basis of\n\nthe claims against Martin. Furthermore, because the cars were not\n\nstolen, Rogers's claims against Edmonds and Perry could not stand.\n\nRogers now appeals.\n\n\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We first note that Rogers has failed to make any developed\n\nargument challenging the district court's determination that his state\n\nlaw claims against the United States are barred by sovereign immunity.\n\nBy failing to develop such an argument, Rogers has abandoned any\n\nchallenge to the decision. Rose v. Yeaw, 214 F.3d 206, 211 n.2 (1st\n\nCir. 2000). Consequently, we turn to Rogers's claims against the\n\nindividual defendants.\n\nA. The claims against Vicuna and Kilmartin\n\n          Although Rogers's amended complaint specifically referenced\n\n§ 1983 in alleging that Vicuna and Kilmartin had violated Rogers's\n\ncivil rights, § 1983 cannot form the basis of an action against\n\nindividuals acting under color of federal law.       Chatman v. D.E.\n\nHernandez, 805 F.2d 453, 455 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Section 1983 applies to\n\npersons acting 'under color of state law' and not to persons acting\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fpursuant to federal law.\"); see also Rodriguez-Cirilo v. Garcia, 115\n\nF.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that a showing that defendant acted\n\nunder color of state law is an essential element of a § 1983 claim).\n\nThe district court looked past this error and instead read the\n\ncomplaint as making a claim against Vicuna and Kilmartin under the\n\nBivens doctrine. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau\n\nof Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971); Day v. Mass. Air Nat'l Guard, 167\n\nF.3d 678, 683 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that Bivens offers redress for\n\nconstitutional violation under color of federal law, while § 1983\n\noffers redress for constitutional violations under color of state law).\n\nThe court concluded, however, that even so read, the complaint failed\n\nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted.      \"Congress has\n\nestablished what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for\n\nconstitutional violations that may occur within the administration of\n\nthe tax laws.\" Under these circumstances, the court concluded that it\n\nshould not create a Bivens remedy.      Rogers takes issue with this\n\ndecision.\n\n            We have noted in dicta that \"we doubt that the creation of\n\na Bivens remedy would be an appropriate response\" to protect taxpayers\n\nfrom \"an overzealous officialdom.\" McMillan v. United States Dep't of\n\nTreasury, 960 F.2d 187, 190 (1st Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). At the same time, not all courts have agreed that a Bivens\n\nremedy is unavailable against individual IRS agents, with at least one\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fcircuit indicating that a taxpayer may have a Bivens remedy against\n\nindividual IRS agents for violations of first and fourth amendment\n\nrights. Nat'l Commodity and Barter Ass'n v. Gibbs, 886 F.2d 1240, 1248\n\n(10th Cir. 1989). We do not have to resolve this issue in this case\n\nbecause we can readily affirm the district court on a different ground.\n\nGeffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[C]ourt of\n\nappeals may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground supported\n\nby the record.\") (citing Burns v. State Police Ass'n of Mass., 230 F.3d\n\n8, 9 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n          In order to state a Bivens violation, Rogers must have pled\n\nfacts that \"rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\"\n\nMcMillen, 960 F.2d at 190. Rogers has not done so. The complaint\n\nreveals only that Vicuna and Kilmartin entered Rogers's property\n\nwithout a warrant or other document issued by a court authorizing that\n\nentry. As the district court correctly noted, however, the mere absence\n\nof a warrant is not automatically indicative of an impermissible\n\nsearch.\n\n          The touchstone of [Rogers's] claims is whether\n          Rogers had a reasonable expectation of privacy in\n          his driveway. The Supreme Court has continually\n          held that \"what a person exposes to the public,\n          even in his own home or office, is not a subject\n          of Fourth Amendment protection.\" Katz v. United\n          States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967). In the context\n          of IRS property seizures, the Court has stated\n          that warrantless seizures of vehicles parked on\n          public streets, parking lots or other open places\n          pursuant to tax liens are not a violation of the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable\n          seizures. G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States,\n          429 U.S. 338, 351-52 (1977).\n\nWe have previously held that a person does not have a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy in a driveway that was visible to \"the\n\noccasional passerby.\" United States v. Hensel, 699 F.2d 18, 32 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 823 (1983).\n\n          Even more to the point, United States v. Roccio, 981 F.2d 587\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), is on all fours with the present case. In Roccio, we\n\nheld that IRS agents, who had entered private property and seized a\n\ntaxpayer's vehicle pursuant to a levy, \"needed no warrant to seize the\n\nautomobile.\"   Id. at 591.   A warrant was not required because the\n\ntaxpayer's vehicle \"was clearly visible from the street on an\n\nunobstructed driveway.\" Id. In order to state a Fourth Amendment\n\nclaim, therefore, Rogers needed to plead facts that would distinguish\n\nthe IRS agents' seizure of his vehicles from the seizure in Roccio.\n\nHis complaint, however, is devoid of any such assertion.\n\n          Rogers attempts to distinguish Roccio on two grounds. First,\n\nhe notes that the taxpayer's car in Roccio was located in his\n\ngirlfriend's driveway, whereas Rogers's cars were located on his own\n\nproperty, a distinction that Rogers claims should make a difference in\n\nthe outcome. See Roccio, 981 F.2d at 589. This argument, which may be\n\na reference to the doctrine of Fourth Amendment standing, is singularly\n\nunpersuasive. Although it is true that citizens only have standing to\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fchallenge an infringement of their own Fourth Amendment rights, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(discussing Fourth Amendment standing in the context of a motion to\n\nsuppress evidence), the decision in Roccio was not predicated upon the\n\ntaxpayer's lack of standing. Instead, the court explicitly reached the\n\nmerits of the taxpayer's substantive Fourth Amendment contentions.\n\n            Second, Rogers advances a statutory argument aimed at\n\nundercutting the validity of the levy that formed the basis of the\n\nwarrantless seizure. This invalidity would distinguish his case from\n\nRoccio, but only if we could accept Rogers's argument. We cannot. A\n\nlevy is defined by the Internal Revenue Code as \"includ[ing] the power\n\nof distraint and seizure by any means.\" 26 U.S.C. § 6331(b). Rogers\n\nclaims that this broad grant of power is in fact limited by the\n\nlanguage in § 6331(a) that indicates that \"[l]evy may be made upon the\n\naccrued salary or wages of any officer, employee, or elected official,\n\nof the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or\n\ninstrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia . . .\"\n\n26 U.S.C. § 6331(a). According to Rogers, this provision means that\n\nthe power of levy only applies to the \"salary or wages\" of a federal\n\nemployee.\n\n            We reject this absurd contention. Such a ruling renders\n\nmeaningless the plain language of § 6331(b) indicating that the power\n\nto levy is broad. Moreover, § 6331(b) explicitly indicates that the\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fIRS may levy against multiple forms of property, including real or\n\npersonal as well as tangible and intangible property. 26 U.S.C. §\n\n6331(b). We decline to adopt a reading of one subsection that would\n\ncompletely nullify another.      Roccio controls this case.\n\nB. The claims against Martin\n\n          This same Fourth Amendment analysis is applicable to the\n\nclaims against Martin, who was present at the scene only at the request\n\nof the IRS agents.   Our disposition of the claims against the IRS\n\nagents, however, rests, in part, upon the absence of necessary factual\n\naverments in the complaint. The claims against Sergeant Martin were\n\ndisposed of at summary judgment, where the factual record was more\n\ndeveloped. We must therefore evaluate those claims in light of that\n\nrecord. Taking those facts in the light most favorable to Rogers\n\nreveals that the omissions in the complaint were not inadvertent.\n\nNothing in the summary judgment record indicates that the seizure here\n\nwas improper.\n\n          Rogers admitted in his deposition that his driveway could be\n\nseen from a public way. Service vehicles would occasionally make turns\n\nin the driveway and delivery personnel would sometimes pass through the\n\ndriveway to reach his door. Furthermore, his driveway was not posted\n\nwith any signs or obstructions that would hide his vehicles from public\n\nview. These facts conclusively indicate that Rogers did not have a\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy in his driveway and that therefore a\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fwarrant was not required. Roccio, 981 F.2d at 591; Hensel, 699 F.2d at\n\n32. Because Rogers does not allege any conduct by Martin that could\n\nform an independent factual basis for his claims, our conclusion\n\nregarding the propriety of the seizures by the IRS agents disposes of\n\nall the claims against Martin.\n\nC. The claims against Edmonds and Perry\n\n          Our conclusion that Rogers cannot maintain his claims against\n\nVicuna, Kilmartin and Martin is fatal to the claims against Edmonds and\n\nPerry as well. We can add nothing to the district court's analysis on\n\nthis point.\n\n          Rogers asserts constitutional claims of denial of\n          due process against Edmonds and Perry arising\n          from their refusal to permit Rogers to file a\n          stolen vehicle report for the two vehicles seized\n          by the IRS. As explained earlier, the IRS was\n          authorized to seize Rogers' [sic] vehicles and\n          they were seized in a lawful manner. The cars\n          were, therefore, not stolen. Thus, the actions\n          of Edmonds and Perry in refusing to accept a\n          stolen car report were proper.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f",

On March 5,  1998, Agents Vicuna and Kilmartin arrived at Rogers's home to seize his  two vehicles pursuant to a levy.  Rogers, a resident of Northborough,  Massachusetts, had been involved with the IRS in a dispute over taxes  that the IRS claimed he owed for the 1992 and 1993 tax years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Between  November, 1996 and the arrival of the agents on March 5, 1998, the IRS  sent Rogers various notices informing him of his delinquency and  indicating its intention to levy against his property if the  delinquency was not resolved.

Although Rogers refused to have any  substantive conversation with Vicuna and instead summarily ordered her  off his property, he later admitted that he received the notices  informing him of the intention to levy.

This driveway was located at the north side of the house,  and the cars were completely visible from the street.  There were no  signs on the property, no gates, and no other obstructions that could  have prevented the agents from either seeing the vehicles from the  public street or from reaching the vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents handed Rogers a Notice of Seizure--listing his two  vehicles--as well as a Notice of Levy.  Rogers, however, demanded that  the agents produce a warrant or other document issued by a court.  The  agents did not have such a document, but nonetheless proceeded to seize  the two vehicles.  Throughout the incident, Rogers informed the IRS  agents and Martin that they were trespassing on his property because  they lacked a warrant, that he did not give them permission to be on  his property, and that they should immediately leave.  The agents and  Martin did not comply.  Rogers then appealed to Sergeant Martin, asking  Martin to intervene to prevent the cars from being \"stolen\" by the IRS  agents.  Martin, however, refused to intervene, responding that the IRS agents' paperwork appeared to be in order.  Rogers then requested that  Martin summon the Worcester County Sheriff's office, but Martin again  refused, stating that the duties of the Sheriff's office did not extend  beyond transferring prisoners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with Martin's refusal to intervene, Rogers began to  remove some of his personal items from the vehicle.  The IRS agents  then requested the keys to the cars.  Rogers gave them to Martin with  the instruction that Martin was to protect his property.  Martin gave  the keys directly to the IRS agents.  Agent Kilmartin then removed more  of Rogers's personal items from the vehicle, putting them temporarily  on the roof in a \"provocative and insulting manner.\"  These  preliminaries completed, the cars were towed away, the agents and  Martin left the scene, and Rogers returned inside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from Kilmartin's actions in removing Rogers's personal  items, the entire scene was relatively nonconfrontational.  Of all the  participants, Martin was the only one armed, and then only with a  pistol that remained in his holster during the entire seizure. Although Rogers expressed a feeling of duress because Martin was armed  and stated that this duress caused him to hand over the keys to his  cars, Rogers agreed that Martin never mentioned the gun.  Moreover,  Rogers also agreed that Martin had not acted out of personal animosity  towards Rogers and had not acted intentionally to harm him.  The entry  onto Rogers's land and the seizure of his vehicles did not result in  any physical contact, altercation or violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7th, two days after the seizure, Rogers went to the  Northborough Police Station, with a witness, to file a stolen vehicle  report on the two vehicles.  Officer Perry and Sergeant Edmonds met  with Rogers and listened to his complaint.  They refused, however, to  accept a stolen vehicle report, reasoning that Rogers's real complaint  was with the IRS.  Rogers protested that the lack of a warrant or other  document issued by a court necessarily meant that the cars were taken  without the proper authority and were therefore stolen.  Perry and  Edmonds were unpersuaded and continued to refuse to accept a stolen  vehicle report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately a month later, Rogers commenced an action  against the IRS agents and the police officers in Massachusetts state  court.  That action was removed to federal court in late April of 1998. Rogers subsequently amended his complaint, asserting, against the IRS  agents and Martin, state law claims of trespass, trespass vi et armis,  conversion, intentional infliction of emotional distress, misfeasance,  and malfeasance, as well as &#167; 1983 claims of violations of his civil  rights, and a conspiracy to violate those rights.  These claims arose  solely out of the defendants' actions on Rogers's property on March 5,  1998.  The amended complaint also alleged claims of nonfeasance, &#167; 1983  claims of violations of Rogers's civil rights and a conspiracy to  violate those rights against Edmonds and Perry.  Again, these legal  claims were based only upon the refusal to allow Rogers to file a  stolen vehicle report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Rogers filed his amended complaint, the United States  Attorney for Massachusetts issued a certification that each IRS agent  had been acting \"within the scope of his or her employment and office  as an employee of the United States at the time that the incidents out  of which plaintiff's claims arose occurred.\"  Based upon this  certification and the provisions of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679, the United States  sought to have itself substituted as the party defendant on Rogers's  state law claims against the IRS agents.  The district court granted  this motion on January 18, 2000, leaving Vicuna and Kilmartin named  personally as party defendants to Rogers's federal civil rights claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States then filed a motion to dismiss the claims  against it and Vicuna and Kilmartin.  The district court granted this  motion, concluding that none of Rogers's state law claims fell under \"a  statute with respect to which the United States has waived its  sovereign immunity,\" and that therefore they were barred.  The district  court also dismissed Rogers's federal civil rights claims against  Vicuna and Kilmartin on the ground that a remedy pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388  (1971) was unavailable.  Following this disposition, Martin, Edmonds,  and Perry filed a motion for summary judgment.  The court granted this  motion, reasoning that, under established precedent, Rogers had failed  to demonstrate any constitutional violation, or, indeed, any  impropriety on the part of the IRS agents that could form the basis of  the claims against Martin.  Furthermore, because the cars were not  stolen, Rogers's claims against Edmonds and Perry could not stand. Rogers now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first note that Rogers has failed to make any developed  argument challenging the district court's determination that his state  law claims against the United States are barred by sovereign immunity. By failing to develop such an argument, Rogers has abandoned any  challenge to the decision.  Rose v. Yeaw, 214 F.3d 206, 211 n.2 (1st  Cir. 2000).  Consequently, we turn to Rogers's claims against the  individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The claims against Vicuna and Kilmartin</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rogers's amended complaint specifically referenced  &#167; 1983 in alleging that Vicuna and Kilmartin had violated Rogers's  civil rights, &#167; 1983 cannot form the basis of an action against  individuals acting under color of federal law.  Chatman v. D.E.  Hernandez, 805 F.2d 453, 455 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Section 1983 applies to  persons acting 'under color of state law' and not to persons acting  pursuant to federal law.\"); see also Rodriguez-Cirilo v. Garcia, 115  F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that a showing that defendant acted  under color of state law is an essential element of a &#167; 1983 claim). The district court looked past this error and instead read the  complaint as making a claim against Vicuna and Kilmartin under the Bivens doctrine.  Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau  of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971); Day v. Mass. Air Nat'l Guard, 167  F.3d 678, 683 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that Bivens offers redress for  constitutional violation under color of federal law, while &#167; 1983  offers redress for constitutional violations under color of state law). The court concluded, however, that even so read, the complaint failed  to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  \"Congress has  established what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for  constitutional violations that may occur within the administration of  the tax laws.\"  Under these circumstances, the court concluded that it  should not create a Bivens remedy.  Rogers takes issue with this  decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted in dicta that \"we doubt that the creation of  a Bivens remedy would be an appropriate response\" to protect taxpayers  from \"an overzealous officialdom.\" McMillan v. United States Dep't of  Treasury, 960 F.2d 187, 190 (1st Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks  omitted). At the same time, not all courts have agreed that a Bivens remedy is unavailable against individual IRS agents, with at least one  circuit indicating that a taxpayer may have a Bivens remedy against  individual IRS agents for violations of first and fourth amendment  rights.  Nat'l Commodity and Barter Ass'n v. Gibbs, 886 F.2d 1240, 1248  (10th Cir. 1989).  We do not have to resolve this issue in this case  because we can readily affirm the district court on a different ground. Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[C]ourt of  appeals may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground supported  by the record.\") (citing Burns v. State Police Ass'n of Mass., 230 F.3d  8, 9 (1st Cir. 2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to state a Bivens violation, Rogers must have pled  facts that \"rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\" McMillen, 960 F.2d at 190.  Rogers has not done so.  The complaint  reveals only that Vicuna and Kilmartin entered Rogers's property  without a warrant or other document issued by a court authorizing that  entry. As the district court correctly noted, however, the mere absence  of a warrant is not automatically indicative of an impermissible  search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The touchstone of [Rogers's] claims is whether  Rogers had a reasonable expectation of privacy in  his driveway.  The Supreme Court has continually  held that \"what a person exposes to the public,  even in his own home or office, is not a subject  of Fourth Amendment protection.\"  Katz v. United  States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967).  In the context  of IRS property seizures, the Court has stated  that warrantless seizures of vehicles parked on  public streets, parking lots or other open places  pursuant to tax liens are not a violation of the  Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable  seizures.  G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States,  429 U.S. 338, 351-52 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that a person does not have a reasonable  expectation of privacy in a driveway that was visible to \"the  occasional passerby.\"  United States v. Hensel, 699 F.2d 18, 32 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 823 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more to the point, United States v. Roccio, 981 F.2d 587  (1st Cir. 1992), is on all fours with the present case.  In Roccio, we  held that IRS agents, who had entered private property and seized a  taxpayer's vehicle pursuant to a levy, \"needed no warrant to seize the  automobile.\"  Id. at 591.  A warrant was not required because the  taxpayer's vehicle \"was clearly visible from the street on an  unobstructed driveway.\"  Id.  In order to state a Fourth Amendment  claim, therefore, Rogers needed to plead facts that would distinguish  the IRS agents' seizure of his vehicles from the seizure in Roccio. His complaint, however, is devoid of any such assertion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers attempts to distinguish Roccio on two grounds.  First,  he notes that the taxpayer's car in Roccio was located in his  girlfriend's driveway, whereas Rogers's cars were located on his own  property, a distinction that Rogers claims should make a difference in  the outcome.  See Roccio, 981 F.2d at 589.  This argument, which may be  a reference to the doctrine of Fourth Amendment standing, is singularly  unpersuasive.  Although it is true that citizens only have standing to  challenge an infringement of their own Fourth Amendment rights, see,  e.g., United States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994)  (discussing Fourth Amendment standing in the context of a motion to  suppress evidence), the decision in Roccio was not predicated upon the  taxpayer's lack of standing.  Instead, the court explicitly reached the  merits of the taxpayer's substantive Fourth Amendment contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Rogers advances a statutory argument aimed at  undercutting the validity of the levy that formed the basis of the  warrantless seizure.  This invalidity would distinguish his case from Roccio, but only if we could accept Rogers's argument.  We cannot.  A  levy is defined by the Internal Revenue Code as \"includ[ing] the power  of distraint and seizure by any means.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 6331(b).  Rogers  claims that this broad grant of power is in fact limited by the  language in &#167; 6331(a) that indicates that \"[l]evy may be made upon the  accrued salary or wages of any officer, employee, or elected official,  of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or  instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia . . .\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6331(a).  According to Rogers, this provision means that  the power of levy only applies to the \"salary or wages\" of a federal  employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this absurd contention.  Such a ruling renders  meaningless the plain language of &#167; 6331(b) indicating that the power  to levy is broad.  Moreover, &#167; 6331(b) explicitly indicates that the  IRS may levy against multiple forms of property, including real or  personal as well as tangible and intangible property.  26 U.S.C. &#167;  6331(b).  We decline to adopt a reading of one subsection that would  completely nullify another.  Roccio controls this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The claims against Martin</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same Fourth Amendment analysis is applicable to the  claims against Martin, who was present at the scene only at the request  of the IRS agents.  Our disposition of the claims against the IRS  agents, however, rests, in part, upon the absence of necessary factual  averments in the complaint.  The claims against Sergeant Martin were  disposed of at summary judgment, where the factual record was more  developed.  We must therefore evaluate those claims in light of that  record.  Taking those facts in the light most favorable to Rogers  reveals that the omissions in the complaint were not inadvertent. Nothing in the summary judgment record indicates that the seizure here  was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers admitted in his deposition that his driveway could be  seen from a public way.  Service vehicles would occasionally make turns  in the driveway and delivery personnel would sometimes pass through the  driveway to reach his door.  Furthermore, his driveway was not posted  with any signs or obstructions that would hide his vehicles from public  view.  These facts conclusively indicate that Rogers did not have a  reasonable expectation of privacy in his driveway and that therefore a  warrant was not required.  Roccio, 981 F.2d at 591; Hensel, 699 F.2d at  32.  Because Rogers does not allege any conduct by Martin that could  form an independent factual basis for his claims, our conclusion  regarding the propriety of the seizures by the IRS agents disposes of  all the claims against Martin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The claims against Edmonds and Perry</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Rogers cannot maintain his claims against  Vicuna, Kilmartin and Martin is fatal to the claims against Edmonds and  Perry as well.  We can add nothing to the district court's analysis on  this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers asserts constitutional claims of denial of  due process against Edmonds and Perry arising  from their refusal to permit Rogers to file a  stolen vehicle report for the two vehicles seized  by the IRS.  As explained earlier, the IRS was authorized to seize Rogers' [sic] vehicles and  they were seized in a lawful manner.  The cars  were, therefore, not stolen.  Thus, the actions  of Edmonds and Perry in refusing to accept a  stolen car report were proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  According to the IRS, Rogers owed $10,606.68 for the 1992 tax  year and $17,643.44 for the 1993 tax year.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Rogers has not appealed from this order.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Finding no  error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are straightforward.  On March 5,  1998, Agents Vicuna and Kilmartin arrived at Rogers's home to seize his  two vehicles pursuant to a levy.  Rogers, a resident of Northborough,  Massachusetts, had been involved with the IRS in a dispute over taxes  that the IRS claimed he owed for the 1992 and 1993 tax years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Between  November, 1996 and the arrival of the agents on March 5, 1998, the IRS  sent Rogers various notices informing him of his delinquency and  indicating its intention to levy against his property if the  delinquency was not resolved.  Agent Vicuna also made at least one  personal visit to the property.  Although Rogers refused to have any  substantive conversation with Vicuna and instead summarily ordered her  off his property, he later admitted that he received the notices  informing him of the intention to levy.  Nonetheless, he took no action  before either the tax court or the district court to prevent the  imposition of the levy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the agents arrived on March 5th, they were accompanied  by Sergeant Martin and a tow truck.  The agents rang the doorbell and,  when Rogers answered, informed him they were there to seize his two  vehicles, a Jeep and a van, that were parked in one of Rogers's two  driveways.  This driveway was located at the north side of the house,  and the cars were completely visible from the street.  There were no  signs on the property, no gates, and no other obstructions that could  have prevented the agents from either seeing the vehicles from the  public street or from reaching the vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents handed Rogers a Notice of Seizure--listing his two  vehicles--as well as a Notice of Levy.  Rogers, however, demanded that  the agents produce a warrant or other document issued by a court.  The  agents did not have such a document, but nonetheless proceeded to seize  the two vehicles.  Throughout the incident, Rogers informed the IRS  agents and Martin that they were trespassing on his property because  they lacked a warrant, that he did not give them permission to be on  his property, and that they should immediately leave.  The agents and  Martin did not comply.  Rogers then appealed to Sergeant Martin, asking  Martin to intervene to prevent the cars from being \"stolen\" by the IRS  agents.  Martin, however, refused to intervene, responding that the IRS agents' paperwork appeared to be in order.  Rogers then requested that  Martin summon the Worcester County Sheriff's office, but Martin again  refused, stating that the duties of the Sheriff's office did not extend  beyond transferring prisoners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with Martin's refusal to intervene, Rogers began to  remove some of his personal items from the vehicle.  The IRS agents  then requested the keys to the cars.  Rogers gave them to Martin with  the instruction that Martin was to protect his property.  Martin gave  the keys directly to the IRS agents.  Agent Kilmartin then removed more  of Rogers's personal items from the vehicle, putting them temporarily  on the roof in a \"provocative and insulting manner.\"  These  preliminaries completed, the cars were towed away, the agents and  Martin left the scene, and Rogers returned inside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from Kilmartin's actions in removing Rogers's personal  items, the entire scene was relatively nonconfrontational.  Of all the  participants, Martin was the only one armed, and then only with a  pistol that remained in his holster during the entire seizure. Although Rogers expressed a feeling of duress because Martin was armed  and stated that this duress caused him to hand over the keys to his  cars, Rogers agreed that Martin never mentioned the gun.  Moreover,  Rogers also agreed that Martin had not acted out of personal animosity  towards Rogers and had not acted intentionally to harm him.  The entry  onto Rogers's land and the seizure of his vehicles did not result in  any physical contact, altercation or violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7th, two days after the seizure, Rogers went to the  Northborough Police Station, with a witness, to file a stolen vehicle  report on the two vehicles.  Officer Perry and Sergeant Edmonds met  with Rogers and listened to his complaint.  They refused, however, to  accept a stolen vehicle report, reasoning that Rogers's real complaint  was with the IRS.  Rogers protested that the lack of a warrant or other  document issued by a court necessarily meant that the cars were taken  without the proper authority and were therefore stolen.  Perry and  Edmonds were unpersuaded and continued to refuse to accept a stolen  vehicle report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately a month later, Rogers commenced an action  against the IRS agents and the police officers in Massachusetts state  court.  That action was removed to federal court in late April of 1998. Rogers subsequently amended his complaint, asserting, against the IRS  agents and Martin, state law claims of trespass, trespass vi et armis,  conversion, intentional infliction of emotional distress, misfeasance,  and malfeasance, as well as &#167; 1983 claims of violations of his civil  rights, and a conspiracy to violate those rights.  These claims arose  solely out of the defendants' actions on Rogers's property on March 5,  1998.  The amended complaint also alleged claims of nonfeasance, &#167; 1983  claims of violations of Rogers's civil rights and a conspiracy to  violate those rights against Edmonds and Perry.  Again, these legal  claims were based only upon the refusal to allow Rogers to file a  stolen vehicle report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Rogers filed his amended complaint, the United States  Attorney for Massachusetts issued a certification that each IRS agent  had been acting \"within the scope of his or her employment and office  as an employee of the United States at the time that the incidents out  of which plaintiff's claims arose occurred.\"  Based upon this  certification and the provisions of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679, the United States  sought to have itself substituted as the party defendant on Rogers's  state law claims against the IRS agents.  The district court granted  this motion on January 18, 2000, leaving Vicuna and Kilmartin named  personally as party defendants to Rogers's federal civil rights claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States then filed a motion to dismiss the claims  against it and Vicuna and Kilmartin.  The district court granted this  motion, concluding that none of Rogers's state law claims fell under \"a  statute with respect to which the United States has waived its  sovereign immunity,\" and that therefore they were barred.  The district  court also dismissed Rogers's federal civil rights claims against  Vicuna and Kilmartin on the ground that a remedy pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>  (1971) was unavailable.  Following this disposition, Martin, Edmonds,  and Perry filed a motion for summary judgment.  The court granted this  motion, reasoning that, under established precedent, Rogers had failed  to demonstrate any constitutional violation, or, indeed, any  impropriety on the part of the IRS agents that could form the basis of  the claims against Martin.  Furthermore, because the cars were not  stolen, Rogers's claims against Edmonds and Perry could not stand. Rogers now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first note that Rogers has failed to make any developed  argument challenging the district court's determination that his state  law claims against the United States are barred by sovereign immunity. By failing to develop such an argument, Rogers has abandoned any  challenge to the decision.  Rose v. Yeaw, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198958\"><a href=\"/opinion/198958/rose-v-yeaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 211 n.2 (1st  Cir. 2000).  Consequently, we turn to Rogers's claims against the  individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The claims against Vicuna and Kilmartin</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rogers's amended complaint specifically referenced  &#167; 1983 in alleging that Vicuna and Kilmartin had violated Rogers's  civil rights, &#167; 1983 cannot form the basis of an action against  individuals acting under color of federal law.  Chatman v. D.E.  Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479377\"><a href=\"/opinion/479377/philip-roberts-chatman-jr-v-commodore-de-hernandez-usn/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 455 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Section 1983 applies to  persons acting 'under color of state law' and not to persons acting  pursuant to federal law.\"); see also Rodriguez-Cirilo v.

The district court looked past this error and instead read the  complaint as making a claim against Vicuna and Kilmartin under the Bivens doctrine.  Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau  of Narcotics, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span> (1971); Day v.

The court concluded, however, that even so read, the complaint failed  to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  \"Congress has  established what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for  constitutional violations that may occur within the administration of  the tax laws.\"  Under these circumstances, the court concluded that it  should not create a Bivens remedy.  Rogers takes issue with this  decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted in dicta that \"we doubt that the creation of  a Bivens remedy would be an appropriate response\" to protect taxpayers  from \"an overzealous officialdom.\" McMillan v.

At the same time, not all courts have agreed that a Bivens remedy is unavailable against individual IRS agents, with at least one  circuit indicating that a taxpayer may have a Bivens remedy against  individual IRS agents for violations of first and fourth amendment  rights.

We do not have to resolve this issue in this case  because we can readily affirm the district court on a different ground. Geffon v.

State Police Ass'n of Mass., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770832\"><a href=\"/opinion/770832/john-a-burns-v-state-police-association-of-massachusetts-and-dean-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir. 2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to state a Bivens violation, Rogers must have pled  facts that \"rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\" McMillen, 960 F.2d at 190.  Rogers has not done so.  The complaint  reveals only that Vicuna and Kilmartin entered Rogers's property  without a warrant or other document issued by a court authorizing that  entry. As the district court correctly noted, however, the mere absence  of a warrant is not automatically indicative of an impermissible  search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The touchstone of [Rogers's] claims is whether  Rogers had a reasonable expectation of privacy in  his driveway.  The Supreme Court has continually  held that \"what a person exposes to the public,  even in his own home or office, is not a subject  of Fourth Amendment protection.\"  Katz v. United  States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107564\"><a href=\"/opinion/107564/katz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 351 (1967).  In the context  of IRS property seizures, the Court has stated  that warrantless seizures of vehicles parked on  public streets, parking lots or other open places  pursuant to tax liens are not a violation of the  Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable  seizures.  G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States,  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109579\"><a href=\"/opinion/109579/gm-leasing-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 351-52 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that a person does not have a reasonable  expectation of privacy in a driveway that was visible to \"the  occasional passerby.\"  United States v. Hensel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414044\"><a href=\"/opinion/414044/united-states-v-david-keith-hensel-united-states-of-america-v-gerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 32 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></span> (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more to the point, United States v. Roccio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596484\"><a href=\"/opinion/596484/united-states-v-richard-roccio/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span>  (1st Cir. 1992), is on all fours with the present case.  In Roccio, we  held that IRS agents, who had entered private property and seized a  taxpayer's vehicle pursuant to a levy, \"needed no warrant to seize the  automobile.\"  Id. at 591.  A warrant was not required because the  taxpayer's vehicle \"was clearly visible from the street on an  unobstructed driveway.\"  Id.  In order to state a Fourth Amendment  claim, therefore, Rogers needed to plead facts that would distinguish  the IRS agents' seizure of his vehicles from the seizure in Roccio. His complaint, however, is devoid of any such assertion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers attempts to distinguish Roccio on two grounds.  First,  he notes that the taxpayer's car in Roccio was located in his  girlfriend's driveway, whereas Rogers's cars were located on his own  property, a distinction that Rogers claims should make a difference in  the outcome.  See Roccio, 981 F.2d at 589.  This argument, which may be  a reference to the doctrine of Fourth Amendment standing, is singularly  unpersuasive.  Although it is true that citizens only have standing to  challenge an infringement of their own Fourth Amendment rights, see,  e.g., United States v. Kimball, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195379\"><a href=\"/opinion/195379/united-states-v-kimball/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1994)  (discussing Fourth Amendment standing in the context of a motion to  suppress evidence), the decision in Roccio was not predicated upon the  taxpayer's lack of standing.  Instead, the court explicitly reached the  merits of the taxpayer's substantive Fourth Amendment contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Rogers advances a statutory argument aimed at  undercutting the validity of the levy that formed the basis of the  warrantless seizure.  This invalidity would distinguish his case from Roccio, but only if we could accept Rogers's argument.  We cannot.  A  levy is defined by the Internal Revenue Code as \"includ[ing] the power  of distraint and seizure by any means.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 6331(b).  Rogers  claims that this broad grant of power is in fact limited by the  language in &#167; 6331(a) that indicates that \"[l]evy may be made upon the  accrued salary or wages of any officer, employee, or elected official,  of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or  instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia . . .\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6331(a).  According to Rogers, this provision means that  the power of levy only applies to the \"salary or wages\" of a federal  employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this absurd contention.  Such a ruling renders  meaningless the plain language of &#167; 6331(b) indicating that the power  to levy is broad.  Moreover, &#167; 6331(b) explicitly indicates that the  IRS may levy against multiple forms of property, including real or  personal as well as tangible and intangible property.  26 U.S.C. &#167;  6331(b).  We decline to adopt a reading of one subsection that would  completely nullify another.  Roccio controls this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The claims against Martin</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same Fourth Amendment analysis is applicable to the  claims against Martin, who was present at the scene only at the request  of the IRS agents.  Our disposition of the claims against the IRS  agents, however, rests, in part, upon the absence of necessary factual  averments in the complaint.  The claims against Sergeant Martin were  disposed of at summary judgment, where the factual record was more  developed.  We must therefore evaluate those claims in light of that  record.  Taking those facts in the light most favorable to Rogers  reveals that the omissions in the complaint were not inadvertent. Nothing in the summary judgment record indicates that the seizure here  was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers admitted in his deposition that his driveway could be  seen from a public way.  Service vehicles would occasionally make turns  in the driveway and delivery personnel would sometimes pass through the  driveway to reach his door.  Furthermore, his driveway was not posted  with any signs or obstructions that would hide his vehicles from public  view.  These facts conclusively indicate that Rogers did not have a  reasonable expectation of privacy in his driveway and that therefore a  warrant was not required.  Roccio, 981 F.2d at 591; Hensel, 699 F.2d at  32.  Because Rogers does not allege any conduct by Martin that could  form an independent factual basis for his claims, our conclusion  regarding the propriety of the seizures by the IRS agents disposes of  all the claims against Martin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The claims against Edmonds and Perry</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Rogers cannot maintain his claims against  Vicuna, Kilmartin and Martin is fatal to the claims against Edmonds and  Perry as well.  We can add nothing to the district court's analysis on  this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers asserts constitutional claims of denial of  due process against Edmonds and Perry arising  from their refusal to permit Rogers to file a  stolen vehicle report for the two vehicles seized  by the IRS.  As explained earlier, the IRS was authorized to seize Rogers' [sic] vehicles and  they were seized in a lawful manner.  The cars  were, therefore, not stolen.  Thus, the actions  of Edmonds and Perry in refusing to accept a  stolen car report were proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  According to the IRS, Rogers owed $10,606.68 for the 1992 tax  year and $17,643.44 for the 1993 tax year.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Rogers has not appealed from this order.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
