For  example,  an onsite  sign may\r\n          simply identify a business  or agency (\"Joe's\r\n          Hardware\" or \"YMCA\"),  or it may  advertise a\r\n          product or service available at that location\r\n          (\"Budweiser Beer\" at  Parise's Cafe or  child\r\n          care at the Lutheran Church).  Depending upon\r\n          the business  or agency,  the message  on the\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n1991 to  require removal of  all signs meeting  certain objective\r                                  \r\n\ncriteria  relating to  dimension and  location.   See  Cambridge,\r                                                               \r\n\nMass., Ordinance 1123,   7.18.1 (June 10, 1991).\r\n\n          Under  the  amended  criteria, all  forty-six  Ackerley\r\n\nsigns carrying  off-site messages were  to be removed,  since the\r                                  \r\n\nordinance  contained no  \"grandfather\"  provision.   The relevant\r\n\nlegal environment  is further  complicated  by the  Massachusetts\r\n\nZoning  Enabling  Act  (\"MZEA\"),  however,  which  prohibits  any\r\n\nmunicipal  zoning  ordinance  provision  purporting  to  regulate\r\n\nexisting on-site  signage; that is,  any sign carrying  a message\r                          \r\n\nrelating to a  commercial or noncommercial activity  occurring at\r\n\nthe premises where the sign is located.  See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann.\r                                                      \r\n\nch. 40A,   6 (1995).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          sign may  be deemed either commercial or non-\r\n          commercial.   An  offsite sign--the  category\r\n          into  which  most billboards  fit--carries  a\r\n          message unrelated to its particular location.\r\n          These signs  also may display  either commer-\r\n          cial or noncommercial messages.  For example,\r\n          an offsite sign may advertise \"Great Gifts at\r\n          Kappy's Liquors,\" with  Kappy's Liquors being\r\n          located at some distance from the sign, or it\r\n          may say \"No  one should  be left  out in  the\r\n          cold.   Write:  Citizens  Energy Corp.\" Thus,\r\n          the onsite/offsite distinction  is not a dis-\r\n          tinction between signs  attached to buildings\r\n          and free standing signs.  An offsite sign may\r\n          be located on a building rooftop, but because\r\n          the product, good,  or service it  advertises\r\n          is not  available at the sign's  location, it\r\n          is  classified as offsite.  For example, if a\r\n          sign  advertising the  products available  at\r\n          Joe's  Hardware is  located  atop the  Parise\r\n          Cafe building, Joe's sign is offsite.\r\n\nAckerley Communications of Mass., Inc. v. City of Somerville, 878\r                                                                      \r\nF.2d 513, 513 n.1 (1st Cir. 1989) (Coffin, J.).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          The City  Council which  enacted section 7.18.1  under-\r\n\nstood from the start that its  effort to curb visual blight would\r\n\nbe thwarted, at least in part, by the MZEA.  Be that as it might,\r\n\nthe City Council  considered off-site signs, such  as Ackerley's,\r\n\nthe  greater aesthetic intrusion,  see Ordinance    7.11.1(F), in\r                                                \r\n\nthe sense that on-site signs at least serve a significant practi-\r\n\ncal purpose by  assisting consumers to locate a  particular busi-\r\n\nness  establishment  or  product (\"Joe's  Hardware\"),  see  id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n7.11.1(G).  Accordingly, and since  as a general matter the First\r\n\nAmendment does  not prefer  commercial speech  over noncommercial\r\n\n(e.g., political) speech, the Ordinance included a \"substitution\"\r               \r\n\nprovision  permitting the owner of a \"grandfathered\" on-site sign\r\n\nto  substitute a noncommercial message for the commercial message\r\n\npreviously displayed by its on-site sign (e.g., \"Smith for Mayor\"\r                                                        \r\n\nreplaces \"Joe's Hardware\").  See id.   7.17.  Finally, it includ-\r                                              \r\n\ned  a \"severability\" clause  saving all \"parts\"  of the Ordinance\r\n\nnot specifically held invalid.  See id.   7.30.\r                                                 \r\n\n          Until the Ordinance  was amended,  most off-site  signs\r\n\nowned by Ackerley carried commercial messages, such as advertise-\r\n\nments and  promotions concerning \"for-profit\"  business ventures.\r\n\nFollowing its amendment,  however, Ackerley's signs  have carried\r\n\nonly noncommercial  messages, such as election advertisements and\r\n\npublic service announcements.  Ultimately, since the MZEA \"grand-\r\n\nfather\" provision  does not  cover existing  off-site signs,  the\r\n\nCity directed  Ackerley to  remove all its  signs based  on their\r\n\nnonconforming physical characteristics, see Ordinance   7.18.1.\r                                                     \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          Ackerley  responded  by  filing the  present  action in\r\n\nfederal district court,  seeking a judicial declaration  that the\r\n\nOrdinance    on  its face and  as applied    infringed  its First\r\n\nAmendment  right to  free speech.    At the  same time,  Ackerley\r\n\ndemanded injunctive  relief from the  City order directing  it to\r\n\ndismantle its signs.\r\n\n          On appeal  we vacated  the  provisional district  court\r\n\nruling  declaring Ordinance   7.18.1 constitutional.  Ackerley I,\r                                                                          \r\n\n88 F.3d at 40.   First, we held that the  Ordinance and the MZEA,\r\n\noperating in tandem,  distinguished between two types  of noncom-\r\n\nmercial  speech     on-site  and off-site      (i) by  permitting\r\n\nnonprofit institutions to display on-site, noncommercial messages\r\n\non nonconforming signs located on their own premises, and (ii) by\r\n\nallowing  on-site sign  owners  to  convert  from  commercial  to\r\n\nnoncommercial messages, while denying off-site sign owners either\r\n\noption.   We  noted that  noncommercial  speech     for  example,\r\n\npolitical discourse     is  accorded the  highest level  of First\r\n\nAmendment  protection, yet the  distinction adopted by  the Ordi-\r\n\nnance     though predicated  on no  aesthetic difference  in sign\r\n\nappearance  (e.g.,  size)      plainly  imposed  unconstitutional\r                           \r\n\nrestrictions upon the  off-site noncommercial speech of  the sign\r\n\nowner, by countenancing only those political messages espoused by\r\n\nthe owner  or occupant  of the  site where the  sign is  located,\r\n\nwhile excluding other political views, such as those held by non-\r\n\nlandowners.  Thus,  we concluded, even though the  City might ban\r\n\nall noncommercial messages from aesthetically intrusive signs, it\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ncannot prefer one  particular category of political  speaker over\r\n\nanother.  Id. at 37-38.2\r                       \r\n\n          Furthermore,  because the  Ordinance and  the MZEA,  in\r\n\ntandem,  either  allowed  or denied  \"grandfathering\"  protection\r\n\nbased  on whether  the sign  carried  an on-site  or an  off-site\r\n\nmessage on the date the  Ordinance was enacted, we concluded that\r\n\nthe City had  chilled present speech impermissibly by  relying on\r\n\nmessage content to reward on-site speakers for their past speech,\r\n\nwhile penalizing off-site  speakers for their past speech.    Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 38-39 (citing  Ackerley Communications of Mass.,  Inc. v.

Instead, since  it  was the  Commonwealth,\r                  \r\n\nthrough  the  MZEA, rather  than  the  City through  Ordinance   \r\n\n7.18.1,  which  established the  distinction between  on-site and\r\n\noff-site  signs, we stated  that \"[r]elief   . . .  is beyond the\r\n\nscope of  this court's power  in this case[,]\"  id. at 39,  since\r                                                             \r\n\namendments  to the  MZEA \"must  be left  to the  workings of  the\r\n\npolitical process.\"  Id.

Rather,\r\n          because the constitutional problem stems from\r\n          the interplay of the ordinance  and the state\r\n          provision, we  hold only  that Cambridge  may\r\n          not require removal of signs displaying  non-\r\n          commercial messages based  on their exclusion\r\n          from  exemption  under the  state  provision.\r\n          Reversed and Remanded.\r                                         \r\n\nId. at 40.\r             \r\n\n          On  remand, Ackerley  requested a  judicial declaration\r\n\ndetermining section 7.18.1  invalid in its entirety,  which would\r                                                             \r\n\nmean that the  City could not order  the removal of any  off-site\r\n\nsign,   whether  it  carried  a  noncommercial  message,  as  did\r\n\nAckerley's, or  a commercial  message.   The City  responded that\r\n\nAckerley I conclusively  ruled out any such  wholesale rescission\r                    \r\n\nof Ordinance   7.18.1.  See id.

Law of the Case\r                              \r\n\n          First,  the City contends  that the district  court was\r\n\npowerless to  declare section 7.18.1  invalid in its  entirety on\r\n\nremand since Ackerley I expressly  stated that we were not ruling\r                                 \r\n\n\"unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.\"   Ackerley I,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n88 F.3d at 40.  In other words, the City proposes to construe the\r\n\nquoted statement  from Ackerley I  as a binding  pronouncement   \r                                           \r\n\nthe \"law of the case\"    that the unconstitutional effects of the\r\n\nMZEA \"grandfathering\" provision  cannot be redressed through  the\r\n\njudicial  process, and, therefore, that the only relief available\r\n\nto Ackerley in the present litigation would be an order enjoining\r\n\nany application of section 7.18.1 to its noncommercial signs.\r\n\n          We  begin our  analysis with  a review  of the  unusual\r\n\nprocedural posture in Ackerley I.  The Ackerley complaint  sought\r                                          \r\n\na judicial  declaration that section  7.18.1, on its face  and as\r\n\napplied, contravened  the First Amendment,  as well as  the Fifth\r\n\nAmendment  \"takings\"  clause.    Ackerley  requested  preliminary\r\n\ninjunctive relief only in relation to its  First Amendment claim.\r\n\nThe  district  court  thereafter  denied  preliminary  injunctive\r\n\nrelief, however,  based on  its determination  that Ackerley  had\r\n\nshown no \"likelihood of success\" on its First Amendment claim.\r\n\n          As both parties acknowledged  that no factfinding would\r\n\nbe required to resolve the purely legal issues controlling  their\r\n\nFirst Amendment dispute,  at their express request  we decided to\r\n\nbypass  the  provisional likelihood-of-success  inquiry  normally\r\n\nundertaken  in interlocutory appeals from orders denying prelimi-\r\n\nnary  injunctive  relief,  and instead  to  resolve  those issues\r\n\nfinally.  See  Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 35.  Accordingly, and since\r                                   \r\n\nneither party  had sought a  final determination as to  all other\r\n\nissues which would  have had to be decided  before final judgment\r\n\ncould be  entered, nor even  briefed the question  regarding what\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nremedies might be  available to Ackerley once it  had been deter-\r\n\nmined that the  City had violated the First  Amendment, we framed\r\n\nour  inquiry narrowly:   \"The  issue  we must  decide is  whether\r                                              \r\n\nCambridge may enforce its sign  ordinance to require Ackerley  to\r\n\nremove its billboards.\"   Id.  at 36  n.6 (emphasis  added).   We\r                                       \r\n\nresponded in the negative.\r\n\n          Although we found neither the MZEA nor the Ordinance to\r\n\nbe unconstitutional in isolation, we held that their operation in\r\n\ntandem  (i)  violated  the First  Amendment  by  favoring on-site\r\n\nnoncommercial speech over off-site  noncommercial speech and (ii)\r\n\npenalized off-site  speakers based on  the content of  their past\r\n\nspeech.

Moreover,  its context makes clear that  the Remedial Option\r                                                                           \r\n\ndiscussion  did not purport to treat with all judicial \"remedies\"\r\n\navailable upon entry  of final judgment, but with  the more prag-\r\n\nmatic and immediate concern as  to how the First Amendment infir-\r\n\nmity  might be  avoided, either  unilaterally by  the City  or by\r                                                       \r\n\n\"construct[ing]  a  justifiable,  content-neutral  grandfathering\r\n\nprovision\"  in cooperation with the  Commonwealth.  Id. at 39-40.\r                                                                 \r\n\nFinally, we  went on to  point out the awkward  legal position in\r\n\nwhich the City Council had been placed, in that though it unques-\r\n\ntionably  possessed a  legitimate interest  in curbing  unsightly\r\n\nsignage, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts alone had the power to\r\n\nprovide a unilateral  legislative remedy for the  First Amendment\r                                           \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\ninfirmity by  eliminating the discrepant  \"grandfathering\" treat-\r\n\nment accorded on-site and off-site  signs.  Thus, nothing we said\r\n\nin Section II.D  remotely suggested that recourse to the legisla-\r\n\ntive process was the only avenue open to Ackerley.3\r                                   \r\n\n          We repair once again to Ackerley I, where we prominent-\r                                                      \r\n\nly noted that the Ordinance contained a severability clause.  The\r\n\nvery next  sentence stated:   \"We  do not  in this decision  rule\r\n\nunlawful  any particular  section of  the ordinance.\"   Were  the\r\n\nquoted sentence to mean, as  the City implicitly insists, that no\r\n\nOrdinance  provision could be  determined invalid on  remand, our\r                                                                      \r\n\nexpress reference to the severability clause    in the immediate-\r\n\nly preceding sentence    would be rendered meaningless.\r\n\n          Instead, the  contextual focus in  the quoted  sentence\r\n\nfrom Ackerley I was  upon the word \"particular,\" whose  inclusion\r                         \r\n\nwas  a  clear  acknowledgement that  the  forthcoming factfinding\r\n\ninquiry on remand could lead the district  court to strike one or\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The contrary interpretation  proposed by the  City presumes\r\nthat  the thrust  of our  discussion  in Section  II.D is  fairly\r\nreflected in  the following line  of reasoning:  The  MZEA causes\r\nthe  unconstitutional effects; the  court is powerless  to strike\r\ndown  the  MZEA; therefore,  the  Ordinance must  be  immune from\r\njudicial invalidation in any part.\r\n     The City Council must take  Commonwealth law as it finds it;\r\nthe MZEA supersedes   7.18.1;  therefore, either the MZEA must be\r\nmodified through  \"the workings of  the political process,\"  or  \r\n7.18.1  must be declared  unconstitutional and void,  at least in\r\npart.\r\n     Unless at least part of   7.18.1 was rendered invalid by the\r\nMZEA, there can have  been no legal basis  whatever for the  dis-\r\ntrict court order enjoining  the City from directing  Ackerley to\r\nremove  its noncommercial signs.  Finally,  if the district court\r\ninjunction,  implicitly  and  necessarily,  was predicated  on  a\r\npartial invalidation of    7.18.1, then  the district court  must\r\nnecessarily  have  resolved  the  closely  related   severability\r\nquestion as well.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nmore portions  of the  Ordinance, but not  all.   As severability\r\n\ndisputes  usually turn on  fact-intensive inquiries best  left to\r\n\nthe trial court  in the first instance, see  infra Section II.B,4\r                                                            \r\n\nand no  factfinding had  occurred at  the preliminary  injunction\r\n\nstage  in Ackerley  I, we  accordingly  reemphasized the  limited\r                               \r\n\nnature of  our holding:   \"we hold  only that  Cambridge may  not\r                                                                           \r\n\nrequire  removal of signs displaying noncommercial messages based\r\n\non their  exclusion from  exemption under  the state  provision.\"\r\n\n(Emphasis added.)

Its contention  is beside  the point.\r\nWhether or not  Ackerley prevailed on the  severability question,\r\nit  had  already  achieved \"prevailing  party\"  status  following\r\nAckerley I by vindicating its constitutional claim and gaining at\r                    \r\nleast  the  right  to extraordinary  equitable  relief  (i.e., an\r                                                                       \r\ninjunction  against the  removal  of its  signs). See  Hensley v.\r                                                                        \r\nEckerhart,  461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983) (defining \"prevailing party\"\r                   \r\nas one  who \"succeed[s]  on any  significant issue in  litigation\r\nwhich achieves some of the benefit the part[y] sought in bringing\r\nsuit\"). \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nresponse to  Ackerley I,  the constitutional infirmity  persists.\r                                 \r\n\nTherefore,  permanent  injunctive  relief   may  not  be  granted\r\n\nAckerley without first  determining whether any, and if so which,\r\n\nportion(s) of the Ordinance may be unlawful.

Section 7.18.1 was  neither drafted nor\r\n\nenacted in  separate \"parts\"  which discretely banned  commercial\r\n\nand  noncommercial off-site  signs,  either  of  which  might  be\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Neither party contests the threshold severability  determi-\r\nnation  that Ordinance    7.18.1,  which  applies exclusively  to\r\nexisting signs, is  readily severable from the  remaining \"parts\"\r                  \r\nof the Ordinance prospectively regulating the  aesthetic features\r\nof future signs.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nstricken independently of the other.  Neither section 7.18.1, nor\r\n\nany  other \"part\"  of  the Ordinance,  alludes in  any  way to  a\r\n\nsubstantive  distinction  between  commercial  and  noncommercial\r\n\nmessages.7  Nor  can such a substantive distinction  be read into\r\n\nsection 7.18.1, without in effect gratuitously  supplementing its\r\n\nlanguage  with  the  phrase \"except  for  off-site  signs bearing\r\n\nnoncommercial  messages.\"   Therefore,  as  we  cannot  say  with\r\n\nconfidence that  the City  Council envisioned  section 7.18.1  as\r\n\nanything but a unitary \"part\" of the Ordinance, the  severability\r\n\nclause avails the City nothing.\r\n\n          Furthermore, although at first blush it may appear that\r\n\nsettled principles of  federalism and separation of  powers would\r\n\ncounsel that  the explicit severability  presumption contained in\r\n\nOrdinance    7.30 be given literal sway,  there is more here than\r\n\nmeets  the  eye.   The  severability  principles  controlling the\r\n\npresent decision  were intended  principally to  ensure that  the\r\n\ncourts,  state and federal,  not dissuade or  preempt legislative\r\n\nbodies  from  debating  and  determining the  appropriate  public\r\n\npolicy in the first instance, within constitutional limits.  See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g.,  Reno, 117  S. Ct.  at 2351 n.49  (\"'It would  certainly be\r                     \r\n\ndangerous  if the  Legislature could  set a  net large  enough to\r\n\ncatch  all possible offenders and leave  it to the courts to step\r\n\ninside and say who could rightfully be detained and who should be\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7Although Ordinance    7.17  allows on-site  sign owners  to\r\nreplace  their commercial  messages with  noncommercial messages,\r\nthis  provision is  merely permissive,  and  imposes no  policing\r                                                                           \r\nburden on the  City whatsoever, since on-site  signs were allowed\r\nwithout regard to their message content.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nset at large.  This  would, to some extent, substitute  the judi-\r\n\ncial  for the legislative department of the government.'\") (cita-\r\n\ntion omitted).    Thus,  proper respect  for  the  principles  of\r\n\nfederalism and separation  of powers counsels against  construing\r\n\nsection 7.30 as  a \"cure all\"  for the  severability ills in  the\r\n\npresent Ordinance. \r\n\n          The  City further contends that the Council enacted the\r\n\nOrdinance  to eliminate nonconforming signs to the maximum extent\r\n\nallowed  by law,  and that severance  would prevent  Ackerley and\r\n\nother sign owners from converting their off-site sign messages to\r\n\nmore lucrative commercial  messages, thereby  providing a  strong\r\n\nfinancial  disincentive to maintaining such signs in the future.8\r\n\nBe that  as  it might,  however, the  suggested distinction  also\r\n\nwould entail significant  administrative burdens and  expense for\r\n\nthe City, which  would be required  to police nonconforming  off-\r\n\nsite signs to  determine whether they carried only  the permitted\r\n\n\"noncommercial\"  messages,  articulate   objective  criteria  for\r\n\nmaking  the  often blurry  distinction  between  \"commercial\" and\r\n\n\"noncommercial\" speech, and  provide sign owners with  a forum in\r\n\nwhich  to address  their  challenges to,  and  appeals from,  any\r\n\nadverse City determination that a particular message was \"commer-\r\n\ncial.\"  See Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 649  P.2d 903,\r                                                           \r\n\n908 (Cal. 1982) (rejecting \"severability\" claim on same ground).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Since no factfinding occurred on remand, however, the intu-\r\nitive  premise advanced by the City finds no record support.  For\r\nexample,  the record  is devoid  of  evidence that  noncommercial\r\nmessages necessarily command less revenue.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          Moreover, nothing in the  Ordinance indicates that  the\r\n\nCouncil ever considered that the City would need to police, hear,\r\n\nor determine the commercial-noncommercial distinction in order to\r\n\nimplement its  chosen  aesthetic objectives.   Nor  has the  City\r\n\npointed to any  probative evidence of such  legislative consider-\r\n\nation  which might  be material  on remand.   Thus,  although the\r\n\nblurriness of the commercial-noncommercial distinction itself may\r\n\nnot render  the amended  ordinance unconstitutional, courts  con-\r\n\nfronted with severability questions clouded by serious uncertain-\r\n\nties  regarding whether  the  appropriate  legislative body  ever\r\n\nconsidered the effect of a severability provision in the relevant\r\n\ncontext, ought not be anxious to arrogate the legislative prerog-\r\n\native inherent  in determining  the preferred  or more  efficient\r\n\nmeans of  pursuing the particular goals chosen by the responsible\r\n\nlegislative body.9  \r\n\n          The  City  Council  may decide  to  adopt  less onerous\r\n\ninitiatives than the presumably burdensome and expensive adminis-\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9In a similar vein,  the City contends that Ackerley  waived\r\nany entitlement to wholesale invalidation  of   7.18.1 by conced-\r\ning, during  the Ackerley I appeal, that  the City would have had\r                                     \r\nthe authority to ban off-site commercial signs while allowing on-\r\nsite commercial signs.  See Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 37 n.8 (citing\r                                                \r\nMetromedia, 453 U.S. at 512).   Far from noting any such \"conces-\r                    \r\nsion\" by Ackerley, however, we simply observed that Ackerley \"did\r\nnot contest\" the  point.  Id.    Because the City  had enacted no\r                                       \r\nsuch  ordinance    i.e.,  one simply banning  off-site commercial\r                                 \r\nsigns while allowing on-site  commercial signs    but had  chosen\r\nto  ban  off-site  noncommercial signs  as  well,  Metromedia was\r                                                                       \r\nwholly  inapposite in  Ackerley's first  appeal.   Moreover,  for\r\npurposes of the present appeal,  the threshold issue no longer is\r\nwhether the City has the  authority to enact an ordinance banning\r\noff-site  commercial  signs  while  allowing  on-site  commercial\r\nsigns,  but whether  it  envisioned reverting  to  such a  regime\r\nshould its ban on off-site noncommercial signs be struck down.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ntrative procedures which would be required were we not to invali-\r\n\ndate section  7.18.1 in  toto.  For  example, it  might determine\r                                       \r\n\nthat  the  municipality's  interests would  be  better  served by\r\n\nattempting  to persuade the  state legislature to  approve a con-\r\n\ntent-neutral grandfathering  provision based  exclusively on  the\r\n\nphysical  characteristics of  existing  signs, rather  than their\r\n\ncontent.  See Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 39-40.  Thus, we  think such\r                                  \r\n\nimportant  policy decisions  are  for the  Council  in the  first\r\n\ninstance.\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          As the City points to no factual circumstance which, if\r\n\ndemonstrated on remand, would affect our severability  determina-\r\n\ntion,  we  can  discern no  substantial  benefit  from  a further\r\n\nremand.  Accordingly, the case  is remanded to the district court\r\n\nfor entry of  final judgment declaring section 7.18.1  invalid in\r                                                                           \r\n\ntoto, and  enjoining the City  from requiring Ackerley  to remove\r              \r\n\nsigns pursuant  to section  7.18.1  as presently  written.10   So\r                                                                         So\r                                                                           \r\n\nordered.\r          ordered.\r                 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10The  City further requests that we reconsider our holding,\r\nin  Ackerley I,  that  application of  the Ordinance  to Ackerley\r                        \r\nwould  be unconstitutional.

Ackerley Communications of Mass., Inc. v. City of Cambridge, 88 F.3d 33 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Ackerley I \").  Ackerley now appeals from the judgment entered following our remand, claiming that the district court erred by refusing to void the offending zoning provision in its entirety.  We vacate the district court judgment and remand with directions to enter judgment for Ackerley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley owns forty-six large advertising signs or billboards, located throughout Cambridge, which carry \"off-site\" messages, by which we mean signs whose content relates to no commercial or noncommercial activity occurring at the premises where the sign is located.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The City amended its ordinance in 1991 to require removal of all signs meeting certain objective criteria relating to dimension and location.  See Cambridge, Mass., Ordinance 1123, &#167; 7.18.1 (June 10, 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the amended criteria, all forty-six Ackerley signs carrying off-site messages were to be removed, since the ordinance contained no \"grandfather\" provision.  The relevant legal environment is further complicated by the Massachusetts Zoning Enabling Act (\"MZEA\"), however, which prohibits any municipal zoning ordinance provision purporting to regulate existing on-site signage;  that is, any sign carrying a message relating to a commercial or noncommercial activity occurring at the premises where the sign is located.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 40A, &#167; 6 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City Council which enacted section 7.18.1 understood from the start that its effort to curb visual blight would be thwarted, at least in part, by the MZEA.  Be that as it might, the City Council considered off-site signs, such as Ackerley's, the greater aesthetic intrusion, see Ordinance &#167; 7.11.1(F), in the sense that on-site signs at least serve a significant practical purpose by assisting consumers to locate a particular business establishment or product (\"Joe's Hardware\"), see id. &#167; 7.11.1(G).  Accordingly, and since as a general matter the First Amendment does not prefer commercial speech over noncommercial (e.g., political) speech, the Ordinance included a \"substitution\" provision permitting the owner of a \"grandfathered\" on-site sign to substitute a noncommercial message for the commercial message previously displayed by its on-site sign (e.g., \"Smith for Mayor\" replaces \"Joe's Hardware\").  See id. &#167; 7.17.  Finally, it included a \"severability\" clause saving all \"parts\" of the Ordinance not specifically held invalid.  See id. &#167; 7.30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until the Ordinance was amended, most off-site signs owned by Ackerley carried commercial messages, such as advertisements and promotions concerning \"for-profit\" business ventures.  Following its amendment, however, Ackerley's signs have carried only noncommercial messages, such as election advertisements and public service announcements.  Ultimately, since the MZEA \"grandfather\" provision does not cover existing off-site signs, the City directed Ackerley to remove all its signs based on their nonconforming physical characteristics, see Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley responded by filing the present action in federal district court, seeking a judicial declaration that the Ordinance--on its face and as applied--infringed its First Amendment right to free speech.  At the same time, Ackerley demanded injunctive relief from the City order directing it to dismantle its signs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal we vacated the provisional district court ruling declaring Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1 constitutional.  Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 40.   First, we held that the Ordinance and the MZEA, operating in tandem, distinguished between two types of noncommercial speech--on-site and off-site--(i) by permitting nonprofit institutions to display on-site, noncommercial messages on nonconforming signs located on their own premises, and (ii) by allowing on-site sign owners to convert from commercial to noncommercial messages, while denying off-site sign owners either option.  We noted that noncommercial speech--for example, political discourse--is accorded the highest level of First Amendment protection, yet the distinction adopted by the Ordinance--though predicated on no aesthetic difference in sign appearance (e.g., size)--plainly imposed unconstitutional restrictions upon the off-site noncommercial speech of the sign owner, by countenancing only those political messages espoused by the owner or occupant of the site where the sign is located, while excluding other political views, such as those held by non-landowners.  Thus, we concluded, even though the City might ban all noncommercial messages from aesthetically intrusive signs, it cannot prefer one particular category of political speaker over another.  Id. at 37-38.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, because the Ordinance and the MZEA, in tandem, either allowed or denied \"grandfathering\" protection based on whether the sign carried an on-site or an off-site message on the date the Ordinance was enacted, we concluded that the City had chilled present speech impermissibly by relying on message content to reward on-site speakers for their past speech, while penalizing off-site speakers for their past speech.  Id. at 38-39 (citing Ackerley Communications of Mass., Inc. v. City of Somerville, 878 F.2d 513, 519 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate discussion captioned \"Remedial Option,\" we went on to note that the City could not correct these unconstitutional effects unilaterally simply by eliminating the \"grandfathering\" distinction between on-site and off-site signs.  See id. at 39-40.   Instead, since it was the Commonwealth, through the MZEA, rather than the City through Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1, which established the distinction between on-site and off-site signs, we stated that \"[r]elief ... is beyond the scope of this court's power in this case[,]\" id. at 39, since amendments to the MZEA \"must be left to the workings of the political process.\"  Id. Accordingly, we concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>The Cambridge ordinance contains a severability provision stating that, in the event some portion of it is declared invalid, it is the City's intent that the remainder of the ordinance continue in full force and effect.  We do not in this decision rule unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.  Rather, because the constitutional problem stems from the interplay of the ordinance and the state provision, we hold only that Cambridge may not require removal of signs displaying noncommercial messages based on their exclusion from exemption under the state provision.  Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, Ackerley requested a judicial declaration determining section 7.18.1 invalid in its entirety, which would mean that the City could not order the removal of any off-site sign, whether it carried a noncommercial message, as did Ackerley's, or a commercial message.  The City responded that Ackerley I conclusively ruled out any such wholesale rescission of Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1.  See id.  (\"We do not in this decision rule unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.\").  The district court ultimately granted Ackerley declaratory relief \"consistent with the decision [in Ackerley I ]\" and enjoined the City from requiring Ackerley to remove signs displaying noncommercial messages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Law of the Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the City contends that the district court was powerless to declare section 7.18.1 invalid in its entirety on remand since Ackerley I expressly stated that we were not ruling \"unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.\"  Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 40.   In other words, the City proposes to construe the quoted statement from Ackerley I as a binding pronouncement--the \"law of the case\"--that the unconstitutional effects of the MZEA \"grandfathering\" provision cannot be redressed through the judicial process, and, therefore, that the only relief available to Ackerley in the present litigation would be an order enjoining any application of section 7.18.1 to its noncommercial signs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with a review of the unusual procedural posture in Ackerley I. The Ackerley complaint sought a judicial declaration that section 7.18.1, on its face and as applied, contravened the First Amendment, as well as the Fifth Amendment \"takings\" clause.  Ackerley requested preliminary injunctive relief only in relation to its First Amendment claim.  The district court thereafter denied preliminary injunctive relief, however, based on its determination that Ackerley had shown no \"likelihood of success\" on its First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As both parties acknowledged that no factfinding would be required to resolve the purely legal issues controlling their First Amendment dispute, at their express request we decided to bypass the provisional likelihood-of-success inquiry normally undertaken in interlocutory appeals from orders denying preliminary injunctive relief, and instead to resolve those issues finally.  See Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 35.   Accordingly, and since neither party had sought a final determination as to all other issues which would have had to be decided before final judgment could be entered, nor even briefed the question regarding what remedies might be available to Ackerley once it had been determined that the City had violated the First Amendment, we framed our inquiry narrowly:  \"The issue we must decide is whether Cambridge may enforce its sign ordinance to require Ackerley to remove its billboards.\"  Id. at 36 n. 6 (emphasis added).  We responded in the negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we found neither the MZEA nor the Ordinance to be unconstitutional in isolation, we held that their operation in tandem (i) violated the First Amendment by favoring on-site noncommercial speech over off-site noncommercial speech and (ii) penalized off-site speakers based on the content of their past speech.  Id. at 37-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, our Section II.D discussion in Ackerley I is captioned \"Remedial Option,\" not \"Remedial Options.\"  Id. at 39.   Moreover, its context makes clear that the Remedial Option discussion did not purport to treat with all judicial \"remedies\" available upon entry of final judgment, but with the more pragmatic and immediate concern as to how the First Amendment infirmity might be avoided, either unilaterally by the City or by \"construct[ing] a justifiable, content-neutral grandfathering provision\" in cooperation with the Commonwealth.  Id. at 39-40.   Finally, we went on to point out the awkward legal position in which the City Council had been placed, in that though it unquestionably possessed a legitimate interest in curbing unsightly signage, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts alone had the power to provide a unilateral legislative remedy for the First Amendment infirmity by eliminating the discrepant \"grandfathering\" treatment accorded on-site and off-site signs.  Thus, nothing we said in Section II.D remotely suggested that recourse to the legislative process was the only avenue open to Ackerley.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repair once again to Ackerley I, where we prominently noted that the Ordinance contained a severability clause.  The very next sentence stated:  \"We do not in this decision rule unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.\"   Were the quoted sentence to mean, as the City implicitly insists, that no Ordinance provision could be determined invalid on remand, our express reference to the severability clause--in the immediately preceding sentence--would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the contextual focus in the quoted sentence from Ackerley I was upon the word \"particular,\" whose inclusion was a clear acknowledgement that the forthcoming factfinding inquiry on remand could lead the district court to strike one or more portions of the Ordinance, but not all.  As severability disputes usually turn on fact-intensive inquiries best left to the trial court in the first instance, see infra Section II.B,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and no factfinding had occurred at the preliminary injunction stage in Ackerley I, we accordingly reemphasized the limited nature of our holding:  \"we hold only that Cambridge may not require removal of signs displaying noncommercial messages based on their exclusion from exemption under the state provision.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Thus, Ackerley I made no pronouncement on the law of the case with respect to the severability issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Severability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the MZEA grandfathering provision was not amended in response to Ackerley I, the constitutional infirmity persists.  Therefore, permanent injunctive relief may not be granted Ackerley without first determining whether any, and if so which, portion(s) of the Ordinance may be unlawful.  See, e.g., National Advertising Co. v. Town of Babylon, 900 F.2d 551, 554 (2d Cir.1990) (de facto effect of such a targeted injunction is \"to sever the unconstitutional portions of the ordinances and to leave the remainder intact\").  Since the district court did not address the severability issue on remand, the case must be returned for further proceedings, including any essential factfinding, unless we can make the severability determination now, with confidence, as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The severability vel non of a state statute or municipal ordinance is controlled by state law.  See Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 2068, 2069, 135 L.Ed.2d 443 (1996);  Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, 475 U.S. 355, 376, 106 S.Ct. 1103, 1116, 89 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986).  \" 'Where a statutory provision is unconstitutional, if it is in its nature separable from the other parts of the statute, so that they may well stand independently of it, and if there is no such connection between the valid and the invalid parts that the [legislative body] would not be expected to enact the valid part without the other, the statute will be held good, except in that part which is in conflict with the Constitution.' \"  Mayor of Boston v. Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., 384 Mass. 718, 429 N.E.2d 691, 695 (1981) (citation omitted).  On the other hand, \"[i]f the court is unable to know whether the Legislature would have enacted a particular bill without the unconstitutional provision, it will not sever the unconstitutional provision, but will strike the entire statute.\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the very least, Ackerley is entitled to a judicial declaration invalidating section 7.18.1 to the extent it would require removal of nonconforming off-site signs carrying noncommercial messages.  The severability issue thus devolves into an impressionistic inquiry into whether section 7.18.1 would have been enacted had the City Council known that it would require only the removal of nonconforming off-site signs carrying commercial messages.  As we cannot divine with confidence what the City Council would have done, Mayor of Boston, 429 N.E.2d at 695, the case must be remanded to the district court with directions to enter a final judgment invalidating section 7.18.1 in its entirety.  We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Severability clauses, though probative of legislative intent, are not conclusive.  See, e.g., Reno v. ACLU, --- U.S. ----, ---- n. 49, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 2351 n. 49, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997) (\"[A] severability clause is 'an aid merely;  not an inexorable command.' \")  (citation omitted).  Although Ordinance &#167; 7.30, see supra p. ----, only applies to invalidated \"parts\" of the Ordinance, that term begs the question in the present context.  Section 7.18.1 was neither drafted nor enacted in separate \"parts\" which discretely banned commercial and noncommercial off-site signs, either of which might be stricken independently of the other.  Neither section 7.18.1, nor any other \"part\" of the Ordinance, alludes in any way to a substantive distinction between commercial and noncommercial messages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Nor can such a substantive distinction be read into section 7.18.1, without in effect gratuitously supplementing its language with the phrase \"except for off-site signs bearing noncommercial messages.\"   Therefore, as we cannot say with confidence that the City Council envisioned section 7.18.1 as anything but a unitary \"part\" of the Ordinance, the severability clause avails the City nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, although at first blush it may appear that settled principles of federalism and separation of powers would counsel that the explicit severability presumption contained in Ordinance &#167; 7.30 be given literal sway, there is more here than meets the eye.  The severability principles controlling the present decision were intended principally to ensure that the courts, state and federal, not dissuade or preempt legislative bodies from debating and determining the appropriate public policy in the first instance, within constitutional limits.  See, e.g., Reno, at ---- n. 49, 117 S.Ct. at 2351 n. 49 (\" 'It would certainly be dangerous if the Legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could rightfully be detained and who should be set at large.  This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.' \")  (citation omitted).  Thus, proper respect for the principles of federalism and separation of powers counsels against construing section 7.30 as a \"cure all\" for the severability ills in the present Ordinance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City further contends that the Council enacted the Ordinance to eliminate nonconforming signs to the maximum extent allowed by law, and that severance would prevent Ackerley and other sign owners from converting their off-site sign messages to more lucrative commercial messages, thereby providing a strong financial disincentive to maintaining such signs in the future.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Be that as it might, however, the suggested distinction also would entail significant administrative burdens and expense for the City, which would be required to police nonconforming off-site signs to determine whether they carried only the permitted \"noncommercial\" messages, articulate objective criteria for making the often blurry distinction between \"commercial\" and \"noncommercial\" speech, and provide sign owners with a forum in which to address their challenges to, and appeals from, any adverse City determination that a particular message was \"commercial.\"   See Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 32 Cal.3d 180, 185 Cal.Rptr. 260, 649 P.2d 902, 908 (1982) (rejecting \"severability\" claim on same ground).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, nothing in the Ordinance indicates that the Council ever considered that the City would need to police, hear, or determine the commercial-noncommercial distinction in order to implement its chosen aesthetic objectives.  Nor has the City pointed to any probative evidence of such legislative consideration which might be material on remand.  Thus, although the blurriness of the commercial-noncommercial distinction itself may not render the amended ordinance unconstitutional, courts confronted with severability questions clouded by serious uncertainties regarding whether the appropriate legislative body ever considered the effect of a severability provision in the relevant context, ought not be anxious to arrogate the legislative prerogative inherent in determining the preferred or more efficient means of pursuing the particular goals chosen by the responsible legislative body.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City Council may decide to adopt less onerous initiatives than the presumably burdensome and expensive administrative procedures which would be required were we not to invalidate section 7.18.1 in toto.   For example, it might determine that the municipality's interests would be better served by attempting to persuade the state legislature to approve a content-neutral grandfathering provision based exclusively on the physical characteristics of existing signs, rather than their content.  See Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 39-40.   Thus, we think such important policy decisions are for the Council in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the City points to no factual circumstance which, if demonstrated on remand, would affect our severability determination, we can discern no substantial benefit from a further remand.  Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court for entry of final judgment declaring section 7.18.1 invalid in toto, and enjoining the City from requiring Ackerley to remove signs pursuant to section 7.18.1 as presently written.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We cannot improve upon an earlier explication of the off-site/on-site distinction:</p>\n        <p>An on-site sign carries a message that bears some relationship to the activities conducted on the premises where the sign is located.  For example, an on-site sign may simply identify a business or agency (\"Joe's Hardware\" or \"YMCA\"), or it may advertise a product or service available at that location (\"Budweiser Beer\" at Parise's Cafe or child care at the Lutheran Church).  Depending upon the business or agency, the message on the sign may be deemed either commercial or noncommercial.  An off-site sign--the category into which most billboards fit--carries a message unrelated to its particular location.  These signs also may display either commercial or noncommercial messages.  For example, an off-site sign may advertise \"Great Gifts at Kappy's Liquors,\" with Kappy's Liquors being located at some distance from the sign, or it may say \"No one should be left out in the cold.  Write:  Citizens Energy Corp.\" Thus, the on-site/off-site distinction is not a distinction between signs attached to buildings and free standing signs.  An off-site sign may be located on a building rooftop, but because the product, good, or service it advertises is not available at the sign's location, it is classified as off-site.  For example, if a sign advertising the products available at Joe's Hardware is located atop the Parise Cafe building, Joe's sign is off-site.</p>\n        <p>Ackerley Communications of Mass., Inc. v. City of Somerville, 878 F.2d 513, 513 n. 1 (1st Cir.1989) (Coffin, J.).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Our reliance on these grounds avoided any need to consider whether the MZEA \"grandfathering\" distinction between on-site and off-site signs amounted to a \"content-based\" speech restriction subject to strict-scrutiny review.

Finally, if the district court injunction, implicitly and necessarily, was predicated on a partial invalidation of &#167; 7.18.1, then the district court must necessarily have resolved the closely related severability question as well.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., Metromedia, Inc. v.

Its contention is beside the point.  Whether or not Ackerley prevailed on the severability question, it had already achieved \"prevailing party\" status following Ackerley I by vindicating its constitutional claim and gaining at least the right to extraordinary equitable relief (i.e., an injunction against the removal of its signs).  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (defining \"prevailing party\" as one who \"succeed[s] on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the part[y] sought in bringing suit\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Neither party contests the threshold severability determination that Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1, which applies exclusively to existing signs, is readily severable from the remaining \"parts\" of the Ordinance prospectively regulating the aesthetic features of future signs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although Ordinance &#167; 7.17 allows on-site sign owners to replace their commercial messages with noncommercial messages, this provision is merely permissive, and imposes no policing burden on the City whatsoever, since on-site signs were allowed without regard to their message content</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Since no factfinding occurred on remand, however, the intuitive premise advanced by the City finds no record support.  For example, the record is devoid of evidence that noncommercial messages necessarily command less revenue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In a similar vein, the City contends that Ackerley waived any entitlement to wholesale invalidation of &#167; 7.18.1 by conceding, during the Ackerley I appeal, that the City would have had the authority to ban off-site commercial signs while allowing on-site commercial signs.  See Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 37 n. 8 (citing Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 512, 101 S.Ct. at 2894-95).   Far from noting any such \"concession\" by Ackerley, however, we simply observed that Ackerley \"did not contest\" the point.  Id. Because the City had enacted no such ordinance--i.e., one simply banning off-site commercial signs while allowing on-site commercial signs--but had chosen to ban off-site noncommercial signs as well, Metromedia was wholly inapposite in Ackerley's first appeal.  Moreover, for purposes of the present appeal, the threshold issue no longer is whether the City has the authority to enact an ordinance banning off-site commercial signs while allowing on-site commercial signs, but whether it envisioned reverting to such a regime should its ban on off-site noncommercial signs be struck down</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The City further requests that we reconsider our holding, in Ackerley I, that application of the Ordinance to Ackerley would be unconstitutional.  Such relief is beyond our prerogatives.  See Williams v.

See Cambridge, Mass., Ordinance 1123, &#167; 7.18.1 (June 10, 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the amended criteria, all forty-six Ackerley signs carrying off-site messages were to be removed, since the ordinance contained no \"grandfather\" provision.  The relevant legal environment is further complicated by the Massachusetts Zoning Enabling Act (\"MZEA\"), however, which prohibits any municipal zoning ordinance provision purporting to regulate existing on-site signage;  that is, any sign carrying a message relating to a commercial or noncommercial activity occurring at the premises where the sign is located.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 40A, &#167; 6 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City Council which enacted section 7.18.1 understood from the start that its effort to curb visual blight would be thwarted, at least in part, by the MZEA.  Be that as it might, the City Council considered off-site signs, such as Ackerley's, the greater aesthetic intrusion, see Ordinance &#167; 7.11.1(F), in the sense that on-site signs at least serve a significant practical purpose by assisting consumers to locate a particular business establishment or product (\"Joe's Hardware\"), see id. &#167; 7.11.1(G).  Accordingly, and since as a general matter the First Amendment does not prefer commercial speech over noncommercial (e.g., political) speech, the Ordinance included a \"substitution\" provision permitting the owner of a \"grandfathered\" on-site sign to substitute a noncommercial message for the commercial message previously displayed by its on-site sign (e.g., \"Smith for Mayor\" replaces \"Joe's Hardware\").  See id. &#167; 7.17.  Finally, it included a \"severability\" clause saving all \"parts\" of the Ordinance not specifically held invalid.  See id. &#167; 7.30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until the Ordinance was amended, most off-site signs owned by Ackerley carried commercial messages, such as advertisements and promotions concerning \"for-profit\" business ventures.  Following its amendment, however, Ackerley's signs have carried only noncommercial messages, such as election advertisements and public service announcements.  Ultimately, since the MZEA \"grandfather\" provision does not cover existing off-site signs, the City directed Ackerley to remove all its signs based on their nonconforming physical characteristics, see Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley responded by filing the present action in federal district court, seeking a judicial declaration that the Ordinance--on its face and as applied--infringed its First Amendment right to free speech.  At the same time, Ackerley demanded injunctive relief from the City order directing it to dismantle its signs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal we vacated the provisional district court ruling declaring Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1 constitutional.  Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 40.   First, we held that the Ordinance and the MZEA, operating in tandem, distinguished between two types of noncommercial speech--on-site and off-site--(i) by permitting nonprofit institutions to display on-site, noncommercial messages on nonconforming signs located on their own premises, and (ii) by allowing on-site sign owners to convert from commercial to noncommercial messages, while denying off-site sign owners either option.  We noted that noncommercial speech--for example, political discourse--is accorded the highest level of First Amendment protection, yet the distinction adopted by the Ordinance--though predicated on no aesthetic difference in sign appearance (e.g., size)--plainly imposed unconstitutional restrictions upon the off-site noncommercial speech of the sign owner, by countenancing only those political messages espoused by the owner or occupant of the site where the sign is located, while excluding other political views, such as those held by non-landowners.  Thus, we concluded, even though the City might ban all noncommercial messages from aesthetically intrusive signs, it cannot prefer one particular category of political speaker over another.

Instead, since it was the Commonwealth, through the MZEA, rather than the City through Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1, which established the distinction between on-site and off-site signs, we stated that \"[r]elief ... is beyond the scope of this court's power in this case[,]\" id. at 39, since amendments to the MZEA \"must be left to the workings of the political process.\"  Id.

We do not in this decision rule unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.  Rather, because the constitutional problem stems from the interplay of the ordinance and the state provision, we hold only that Cambridge may not require removal of signs displaying noncommercial messages based on their exclusion from exemption under the state provision.

The City responded that Ackerley I conclusively ruled out any such wholesale rescission of Ordinance &#167; 7.18.1.  See id.  (\"We do not in this decision rule unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.\").  The district court ultimately granted Ackerley declaratory relief \"consistent with the decision [in Ackerley I ]\" and enjoined the City from requiring Ackerley to remove signs displaying noncommercial messages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Law of the Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the City contends that the district court was powerless to declare section 7.18.1 invalid in its entirety on remand since Ackerley I expressly stated that we were not ruling \"unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.\"  Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 40.   In other words, the City proposes to construe the quoted statement from Ackerley I as a binding pronouncement--the \"law of the case\"--that the unconstitutional effects of the MZEA \"grandfathering\" provision cannot be redressed through the judicial process, and, therefore, that the only relief available to Ackerley in the present litigation would be an order enjoining any application of section 7.18.1 to its noncommercial signs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with a review of the unusual procedural posture in Ackerley I. The Ackerley complaint sought a judicial declaration that section 7.18.1, on its face and as applied, contravened the First Amendment, as well as the Fifth Amendment \"takings\" clause.  Ackerley requested preliminary injunctive relief only in relation to its First Amendment claim.  The district court thereafter denied preliminary injunctive relief, however, based on its determination that Ackerley had shown no \"likelihood of success\" on its First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As both parties acknowledged that no factfinding would be required to resolve the purely legal issues controlling their First Amendment dispute, at their express request we decided to bypass the provisional likelihood-of-success inquiry normally undertaken in interlocutory appeals from orders denying preliminary injunctive relief, and instead to resolve those issues finally.  See Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 35.   Accordingly, and since neither party had sought a final determination as to all other issues which would have had to be decided before final judgment could be entered, nor even briefed the question regarding what remedies might be available to Ackerley once it had been determined that the City had violated the First Amendment, we framed our inquiry narrowly:  \"The issue we must decide is whether Cambridge may enforce its sign ordinance to require Ackerley to remove its billboards.\"  Id. at 36 n. 6 (emphasis added).  We responded in the negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we found neither the MZEA nor the Ordinance to be unconstitutional in isolation, we held that their operation in tandem (i) violated the First Amendment by favoring on-site noncommercial speech over off-site noncommercial speech and (ii) penalized off-site speakers based on the content of their past speech.  Id. at 37-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, our Section II.D discussion in Ackerley I is captioned \"Remedial Option,\" not \"Remedial Options.\"  Id. at 39.   Moreover, its context makes clear that the Remedial Option discussion did not purport to treat with all judicial \"remedies\" available upon entry of final judgment, but with the more pragmatic and immediate concern as to how the First Amendment infirmity might be avoided, either unilaterally by the City or by \"construct[ing] a justifiable, content-neutral grandfathering provision\" in cooperation with the Commonwealth.  Id. at 39-40.   Finally, we went on to point out the awkward legal position in which the City Council had been placed, in that though it unquestionably possessed a legitimate interest in curbing unsightly signage, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts alone had the power to provide a unilateral legislative remedy for the First Amendment infirmity by eliminating the discrepant \"grandfathering\" treatment accorded on-site and off-site signs.  Thus, nothing we said in Section II.D remotely suggested that recourse to the legislative process was the only avenue open to Ackerley.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repair once again to Ackerley I, where we prominently noted that the Ordinance contained a severability clause.  The very next sentence stated:  \"We do not in this decision rule unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.\"   Were the quoted sentence to mean, as the City implicitly insists, that no Ordinance provision could be determined invalid on remand, our express reference to the severability clause--in the immediately preceding sentence--would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the contextual focus in the quoted sentence from Ackerley I was upon the word \"particular,\" whose inclusion was a clear acknowledgement that the forthcoming factfinding inquiry on remand could lead the district court to strike one or more portions of the Ordinance, but not all.  As severability disputes usually turn on fact-intensive inquiries best left to the trial court in the first instance, see infra Section II.B,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and no factfinding had occurred at the preliminary injunction stage in Ackerley I, we accordingly reemphasized the limited nature of our holding:  \"we hold only that Cambridge may not require removal of signs displaying noncommercial messages based on their exclusion from exemption under the state provision.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Thus, Ackerley I made no pronouncement on the law of the case with respect to the severability issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Severability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the MZEA grandfathering provision was not amended in response to Ackerley I, the constitutional infirmity persists.  Therefore, permanent injunctive relief may not be granted Ackerley without first determining whether any, and if so which, portion(s) of the Ordinance may be unlawful.  See, e.g., National Advertising Co. v. Town of Babylon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539812\"><a href=\"/opinion/539812/national-advertising-company-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 554 (2d Cir.1990) (de facto effect of such a targeted injunction is \"to sever the unconstitutional portions of the ordinances and to leave the remainder intact\").  Since the district court did not address the severability issue on remand, the case must be returned for further proceedings, including any essential factfinding, unless we can make the severability determination now, with confidence, as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The severability vel non of a state statute or municipal ordinance is controlled by state law.

The severability issue thus devolves into an impressionistic inquiry into whether section 7.18.1 would have been enacted had the City Council known that it would require only the removal of nonconforming off-site signs carrying commercial messages.  As we cannot divine with confidence what the City Council would have done, Mayor of Boston, 429 N.E.2d at 695, the case must be remanded to the district court with directions to enter a final judgment invalidating section 7.18.1 in its entirety.  We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Severability clauses, though probative of legislative intent, are not conclusive.

Although Ordinance &#167; 7.30, see supra p. ----, only applies to invalidated \"parts\" of the Ordinance, that term begs the question in the present context.  Section 7.18.1 was neither drafted nor enacted in separate \"parts\" which discretely banned commercial and noncommercial off-site signs, either of which might be stricken independently of the other.  Neither section 7.18.1, nor any other \"part\" of the Ordinance, alludes in any way to a substantive distinction between commercial and noncommercial messages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Nor can such a substantive distinction be read into section 7.18.1, without in effect gratuitously supplementing its language with the phrase \"except for off-site signs bearing noncommercial messages.\"   Therefore, as we cannot say with confidence that the City Council envisioned section 7.18.1 as anything but a unitary \"part\" of the Ordinance, the severability clause avails the City nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, although at first blush it may appear that settled principles of federalism and separation of powers would counsel that the explicit severability presumption contained in Ordinance &#167; 7.30 be given literal sway, there is more here than meets the eye.  The severability principles controlling the present decision were intended principally to ensure that the courts, state and federal, not dissuade or preempt legislative bodies from debating and determining the appropriate public policy in the first instance, within constitutional limits.  See, e.g., Reno, at ---- n. 49, 117 S.Ct. at 2351 n. 49 (\" 'It would certainly be dangerous if the Legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could rightfully be detained and who should be set at large.  This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.' \")  (citation omitted).  Thus, proper respect for the principles of federalism and separation of powers counsels against construing section 7.30 as a \"cure all\" for the severability ills in the present Ordinance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City further contends that the Council enacted the Ordinance to eliminate nonconforming signs to the maximum extent allowed by law, and that severance would prevent Ackerley and other sign owners from converting their off-site sign messages to more lucrative commercial messages, thereby providing a strong financial disincentive to maintaining such signs in the future.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Be that as it might, however, the suggested distinction also would entail significant administrative burdens and expense for the City, which would be required to police nonconforming off-site signs to determine whether they carried only the permitted \"noncommercial\" messages, articulate objective criteria for making the often blurry distinction between \"commercial\" and \"noncommercial\" speech, and provide sign owners with a forum in which to address their challenges to, and appeals from, any adverse City determination that a particular message was \"commercial.\"   See Metromedia, Inc. v.

Nor has the City pointed to any probative evidence of such legislative consideration which might be material on remand.  Thus, although the blurriness of the commercial-noncommercial distinction itself may not render the amended ordinance unconstitutional, courts confronted with severability questions clouded by serious uncertainties regarding whether the appropriate legislative body ever considered the effect of a severability provision in the relevant context, ought not be anxious to arrogate the legislative prerogative inherent in determining the preferred or more efficient means of pursuing the particular goals chosen by the responsible legislative body.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City Council may decide to adopt less onerous initiatives than the presumably burdensome and expensive administrative procedures which would be required were we not to invalidate section 7.18.1 in toto.   For example, it might determine that the municipality's interests would be better served by attempting to persuade the state legislature to approve a content-neutral grandfathering provision based exclusively on the physical characteristics of existing signs, rather than their content.  See Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 39-40.   Thus, we think such important policy decisions are for the Council in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the City points to no factual circumstance which, if demonstrated on remand, would affect our severability determination, we can discern no substantial benefit from a further remand.  Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court for entry of final judgment declaring section 7.18.1 invalid in toto, and enjoining the City from requiring Ackerley to remove signs pursuant to section 7.18.1 as presently written.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We cannot improve upon an earlier explication of the off-site/on-site distinction:</p>\n        <p>An on-site sign carries a message that bears some relationship to the activities conducted on the premises where the sign is located.  For example, an on-site sign may simply identify a business or agency (\"Joe's Hardware\" or \"YMCA\"), or it may advertise a product or service available at that location (\"Budweiser Beer\" at Parise's Cafe or child care at the Lutheran Church).  Depending upon the business or agency, the message on the sign may be deemed either commercial or noncommercial.  An off-site sign--the category into which most billboards fit--carries a message unrelated to its particular location.  These signs also may display either commercial or noncommercial messages.  For example, an off-site sign may advertise \"Great Gifts at Kappy's Liquors,\" with Kappy's Liquors being located at some distance from the sign, or it may say \"No one should be left out in the cold.  Write:  Citizens Energy Corp.\" Thus, the on-site/off-site distinction is not a distinction between signs attached to buildings and free standing signs.  An off-site sign may be located on a building rooftop, but because the product, good, or service it advertises is not available at the sign's location, it is classified as off-site.  For example, if a sign advertising the products available at Joe's Hardware is located atop the Parise Cafe building, Joe's sign is off-site.</p>\n        <p>Ackerley Communications of Mass., Inc. v.

Its contention is beside the point.  Whether or not Ackerley prevailed on the severability question, it had already achieved \"prevailing party\" status following Ackerley I by vindicating its constitutional claim and gaining at least the right to extraordinary equitable relief (i.e., an injunction against the removal of its signs).  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 433, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For example, the record is devoid of evidence that noncommercial messages necessarily command less revenue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In a similar vein, the City contends that Ackerley waived any entitlement to wholesale invalidation of &#167; 7.18.1 by conceding, during the Ackerley I appeal, that the City would have had the authority to ban off-site commercial signs while allowing on-site commercial signs.  See Ackerley I, 88 F.3d at 37 n. 8 (citing Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 512, 101 S.Ct. at 2894-95).   Far from noting any such \"concession\" by Ackerley, however, we simply observed that Ackerley \"did not contest\" the point.  Id. Because the City had enacted no such ordinance--i.e., one simply banning off-site commercial signs while allowing on-site commercial signs--but had chosen to ban off-site noncommercial signs as well, Metromedia was wholly inapposite in Ackerley's first appeal.  Moreover, for purposes of the present appeal, the threshold issue no longer is whether the City has the authority to enact an ordinance banning off-site commercial signs while allowing on-site commercial signs, but whether it envisioned reverting to such a regime should its ban on off-site noncommercial signs be struck down</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The City further requests that we reconsider our holding, in Ackerley I, that application of the Ordinance to Ackerley would be unconstitutional.  Such relief is beyond our prerogatives.  See Williams v.
