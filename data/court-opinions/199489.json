Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Ignacio Fernandez de      Lahongrais   on   Anders   brief   for\nappellant.\n     Edwin Cotto Santiago on   brief pro se.\n     Guillermo Gil, United     States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United      States Attorney, and Thomas F.\nKlumper, Assistant United       States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\f                          July 10, 2001\n\n\n    Per Curiam. Defendant’s counsel has submitted an Anders\n\nbrief and motion to withdraw, asserting that there are no\n\nmeritorious issues to be raised on appeal. See Anders v.\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967); 1st Cir. Loc. R.\n\n46.4(a)(4).    Defendant Edwin Cotton Santiago has filed a pro\n\nse brief claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and\n\nsentencing error.    He seeks only to be re-sentenced, not to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea.    As required by Anders, we have\n\nconducted a full examination of the proceedings.    Based on\n\nthat examination, we conclude that this appeal is wholly\n\nfrivolous as it presents no issue having an arguable basis in\n\nlaw or fact.\n\n    This case was consolidated for purposes of briefing and\n\nargument with five appeals by co-defendants and the government\n\nhas filed a single brief in all six appeals.    However, this is\n\nthe only case in which defense counsel has filed a motion to\n\nwithdraw and an Anders brief.    Accordingly, we are issuing a\n\nseparate opinion in this case.\n\n    Santiago pled guilty to a single count of a multi-count\n\nindictment charging him and twenty co-defendants with\n\nconspiring “to possess with intent to distribute more than one\n\n                                -2-\n\fkilogram of heroin, and to distribute more than one kilogram\n\nof heroin,” in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & 846.        The\n\nstatutorily prescribed penalty for that quantity of heroin is\n\na mandatory minimum of ten years and a maximum of life\n\nimprisonment.   After pleading guilty, Santiago filed a pro se\n\nmotion seeking dismissal of his indictment on double jeopardy\n\ngrounds, which the court denied.     The probation department\n\ncalculated a guideline sentencing range of 121 to 151 months,\n\nas set forth in the presentence investigation report.\n\nSantiago received a ten-year sentence (the statutory mandatory\n\nminimum).\n\n    In his pro se brief, Santiago indicates that he does not\n\nseek to withdraw his guilty plea. In any event, we agree with\n\nappellant’s counsel that the change-of-plea hearing covered\n\nall of the necessary points.   Appellant’s counsel also\n\ncorrectly concluded that there was no meritorious issue\n\npursuant to Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).        “By\n\nits own terms, the holding in Apprendi applies only when the\n\ndisputed ‘fact’ enlarges the applicable statutory maximum and\n\nthe defendant’s sentence exceeds the original maximum.” United\n\nStates v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001).    Here, the\n\nstatutory maximum was dictated by Santiago’s guilty plea to a\n\ncount that specified a drug quantity of “one or more\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fkilograms” of heroin.    He received a sentence well below that\n\noriginal maximum.\n\n     Similarly, our review of the record indicates that the\n\ndistrict court did not err in denying Santiago’s motion to\n\ndismiss his indictment on double jeopardy grounds.    We focus\n\nonly on the counts to which Santiago pled guilty “because in\n\nthe taking of pleas jeopardy ordinarily does not attach to\n\ncounts which are dismissed and on which no finding of guilt is\n\nmade.” United States v. Rivera-Feliciano, 930 F.2d 951, 954\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).    Santiago pled guilty in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York to one\n\ncount of conspiracy to import heroin (encompassing the time\n\nperiod of the present conspiracy charge).    In this case,\n\nSantiago pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute and to distribute heroin.     Those\n\noffenses each contain an element not contained in the other.\n\nSee United States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 861-62 (1st\n\nCir. 1990). Therefore, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar\n\nthis prosecution. See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688,\n\n696 (1993).\n\n     In his pro se brief, Santiago claims ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel resulting in a sentencing error.       The\n\ncrux of his argument is that counsel was ineffective in\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fallowing him to agree to a guideline sentencing range (“GSR”)\n\nof 121 to 151 months.     He argues that the stipulated facts\n\nincorporated in the plea agreement supported a finding of a\n\ndrug quantity of only 375 grams of heroin, corresponding with\n\na base offense level (“BOL”) of 26.     That BOL would have\n\nyielded a GSR of 70 to 87 months.     “We do not normally\n\nconsider ineffective-assistance- of-counsel claims on direct\n\nappeal.” United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).   However, this case falls within the following\n\nexception to that rule:\n\n      [W]here the critical facts are not genuinely in\n\n      dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to\n\n      allow reasoned consideration of an ineffective\n\n      assistance claim, an appellate court may dispense\n\n      with the usual praxis and determine the merits of\n\n      such a contention on direct appeal.\n\n\nId.\n\n      Even if the applicable GSR should have been 70 to 87\n\nmonths (an issue that we need not decide), the sentencing\n\nguidelines would not permit imposition of a sentence below the\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum of 120 months. See U.S.S.G. §\n\n5G1.1(b) (“Where a statutorily required minimum sentence is\n\ngreater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range,\n\n                                -5-\n\fthe statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the\n\nguideline sentence.”).   Santiago does not dispute that he has\n\nmore than one criminal history point, which precludes\n\napplication of the safety valve provision and imposition of a\n\nsentence below the statutory minimum. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).\n\nTherefore, he cannot meet the prejudice prong of the\n\nineffective assistance of counsel test.     Santiago received the\n\nlowest sentence permitted by statute for the count to which he\n\npled guilty.1\n\n    Counsel’s motion to withdraw is granted and appellant’s\n\nconviction and sentence are affirmed.     See 1st Cir. Loc. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n    1 The only sentencing error that we detect is in Santiago’s\nfavor. It appears that the district court erred in imposing the\nstatutory mandatory minimum sentence even though that sentence\nwas below the GSR. See U.S.S.G. § 5G1.1. We do not correct that\nerror, however, because the government did not deign to file a\ncross-appeal.\n\n                              -6-\n\f",
