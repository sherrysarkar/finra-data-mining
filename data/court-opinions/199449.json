Martin Richey on brief for appellant.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Timothy Q.\nFeeley, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         May 31, 2001\n\f              Per Curiam. Defendant Roberto Fortes Neves appeals\n\nfrom the district court’s order revoking the magistrate\n\njudge’s pretrial release order.\n\n              I. Procedural Background\n\n              Neves   is    charged     with    illegal     reentry     after\n\ndeportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.                   Born in Cape\n\nVerde twenty-five years ago, Neves came to the United States\n\nwith his mother as an infant.                He remained here, without\n\nbecoming a U.S. citizen, until his deportation to Cape Verde\n\nin    1999.      Neves     was   deported      pursuant    to   8   U.S.C.     §\n\n1227(a)(2), following a state conviction for distributing\n\ncocaine.      He returned to this country and was arrested in\n\nNew   Bedford,     Massachusetts        on   February     13,   2001.        The\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) reinstated\n\nits prior order of removal/deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(a)(5).         Neves’ removal has been stayed, however,\n\npending    his    trial    and   the    expiration    of    any     period    of\n\nincarceration imposed in this case.\n\n              The government moved for detention pending trial\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (f)(2)(A), on the ground of\n\nrisk of flight.       Following a hearing, the magistrate judge\n\ndenied the government’s motion and ordered Neves released on\n\nthe following conditions: 1) execution of an appearance bond\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fin the amount of $150,000, to be secured with $15,000 in\n\ncash; 2) confinement of Neves to his mother’s residence\n\nwhere he is to be under the custody of his mother; and 3)\n\nmonitoring at all times by an electronic bracelet.                    The\n\ngovernment moved for reconsideration of the release order.\n\nA hearing was held pursuant to United States v. Nebbia, 357\n\nF.2d 303 (2d Cir. 1966), at which Neves’ mother, Maria\n\nFortes, and his former girlfriend, Adamiz Goncalves (the\n\nsureties),     testified.       The   magistrate    judge    denied   the\n\ngovernment’s motion, but stayed Neves’ release pending the\n\ndistrict court’s determination of the government’s motion to\n\nrevoke the release order. See 18 U.S.C. § 3145(a)(1).\n\n             The district court held a bail hearing, at which\n\nFortes and Goncalves testified again.              The district court\n\nissued   a   five-page   memorandum       and   opinion     stating   its\n\nreasons for finding that Neves posed a risk of flight and\n\nthat there was no condition or combination of conditions\n\n(including those imposed by the magistrate judge) which\n\nwould    reasonably    assure    his     appearance    in    court    when\n\nrequired.      The   district    court    granted     the   government’s\n\nmotion for revocation of the order of release and for Neves’\n\ndetention pending trial.         Neves appeals from that order.\n\n             II. Standard of Review\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f              We apply an intermediate level of review to the\n\ndistrict court’s detention order, “tempered by a degree of\n\ndeference to the determinations made below.” United States\n\nv. Tortora, 922 F.2d 880, 882-83 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n              If upon careful review of all the facts\n              and the trial judge’s reasons the\n              appeals court concludes that a different\n              result should have been reached, the\n              detention decision may be amended or\n              reversed.   If the appellate court does\n              not reach such a conclusion -- even if\n              it sees the decisional scales as evenly\n              balanced -- then the trial judge’s\n              determination should stand.\n\nUnited States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 810, 814 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n              The government moved for detention pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3142, which provides, in relevant part, that if,\n\nafter    a    hearing,       the   judicial     officer   finds    that    “no\n\ncondition      or   combination        of    conditions   will    reasonably\n\nassure the appearance of the person as required . . . , such\n\njudicial officer shall order the detention of the person\n\nbefore       trial.”   18     U.S.C.    §    3142(e).     In   making      such\n\ndetermination, the judicial officer is to consider, among\n\nother    factors,      the    weight    of    the   evidence     against   the\n\ndefendant, family ties, employment, financial resources,\n\nlength of residence in the community, community ties, past\n\nconduct, criminal history, and record concerning appearance\n\nat court proceedings. Id. § 3142(f).\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            Our review of the district court’s determination\n\nthat no conditions of release will reasonably assure Neves’\n\nappearance proceeds in two steps. First, we “decide whether\n\nwe agree with the district court that the government proved\n\nthat the defendant poses a . . . risk of flight.” United\n\nStates v.    Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 791 (1 st Cir. 1991).\n\nSecond, if “there is some risk, we proceed to evaluate the\n\nconditions to see if they will serve as a reasonable guard.”\n\nId.\n\n            III. Risk of Flight\n\n            Based upon our independent review of the record,\n\nwe do not hesitate in agreeing with the district court’s\n\ndetermination that Neves poses a risk of flight.    He has a\n\nlengthy criminal record in the state courts, dating from\n\n1984 and continuing until his drug conviction in 1996, which\n\nprecipitated his deportation to Cape Verde.     The district\n\ncourt supportably found that Neves’ record was “remarkable\n\nfor the number of defaults.” The weight of the evidence\n\nagainst Neves on the illegal re-entry charge is strong and\n\nthe INS has reinstated the prior deportation order. Compare\n\nUnited States v. Xulam, 84 F.3d 441, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\n\n(revoking order of detention where there was no outstanding\n\ndeportation order against defendant).   The evidence supports\n\n\n                              -5-\n\fthe district court’s findings that Neves has both a general\n\ntendency to avoid court appearances and a strong incentive\n\nto flee in this case to avoid the near-certainty of a prison\n\nsentence followed by deportation again to Cape Verde.\n\n             Neves argues that the district court overestimated\n\nthe length of sentence that Neves would receive because it\n\ndid   not    take   into   consideration   the    possibility     of   a\n\ndownward departure from the applicable guideline sentencing\n\nrange.      As the government points out, however, a downward\n\ndeparture would not soften the most dreaded consequence\n\nfacing   Neves:     reinstatement   of   his   deportation   to   Cape\n\nVerde.      Neves claims that he lacks the financial resources\n\nto flee and to avoid prosecution.              But, his mother has\n\ntestified that she has $8,000 in savings and would rather\n\nsee Neves dead than returned to Cape Verde.           Neves was able\n\nto obtain the financial resources necessary to get himself\n\nback to this country from Cape Verde.            Neves points to his\n\nvoluntary appearance in the state court on the most serious\n\nof his previous charges.         Those cases, however, did not\n\ninvolve the same near-certainty of conviction and subsequent\n\ndeportation that Neves faces in this case.          Moreover, at the\n\ntime of those appearances, Neves had not yet experienced the\n\ngrim realities of deportation.         Applying independent review\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fto the district court’s determination that Neves poses a\n\nrisk of flight, we are not persuaded that “a different\n\nresult should have been reached.” O’Brien, 895 F.2d at 814.\n\n\n\n            IV.           Adequacy of Conditions\n\n            A. $150,000 Bond Secured by $15,000 from Fortes and\n\nGoncalves\n\n            We need not assume that Neves lacks close ties to\n\nhis family and to Goncalves to find that the bond provides\n\ninadequate protection against flight.                As the government\n\nargued before the district court, Fortes and Goncalves might\n\nwell be willing to sacrifice the $15,000 security to help\n\nNeves   avoid     being   deported    again    to   Cape    Verde.       Both\n\nsureties testified that they felt it was unfair for Neves to\n\nbe deported to a country where he has no ties and faces\n\nlanguage and cultural barriers.           Although the sureties also\n\ntestified    that     they   were   willing    to   put    up    their   life\n\nsavings because they trusted Neves to appear in court, the\n\nprospect    of    a   significant    federal    sentence        followed   by\n\ndeportation might overcome Neves’ loyalty to his family and\n\nfriends.\n\n            B. Electronic Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          We    have   recognized    the   value    of   electronic\n\nmonitoring in pretrial release cases “especially in allowing\n\nearly detection of possible flight.” Tortora, 922 F.2d at\n\n887.   But, where, as in this case, there is a particularly\n\nstrong incentive to flee, the early detection capabilities\n\nof electronic monitoring may be insufficient to overcome\n\nthat incentive and to guard against the risk of flight.\n\nNeves argues that electronic monitoring would be effective\n\nhere because he “utterly lacks the resources to run very far\n\nfor very long.” However, as explained above, we are not\n\npersuaded that lack of resources poses an insurmountable\n\nhurdle to Neves’ flight.\n\n          C. Placement of Neves in the Custody of his Mother.\n\n          Neves argues on appeal that his mother will be able\n\nto control him because her custody will be augmented by the\n\nelectronic     monitor.   It   is    not   clear,    however,   what\n\nadditional protection Neves’ mother would provide, beyond\n\nthat provided by the electronic bracelet.           We do not doubt\n\nthe sincerity of her good intentions, but Fortes’ ability to\n\nserve as custodian is hampered by, among other things, her\n\nfull-time job which she testified keeps her away from home\n\nfor “forty or more” hours a week.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f            Having carefully reviewed the record and considered\n\nthe district court’s reasons for revoking release, we are\n\nnot persuaded that a different result should have been\n\nreached.    The evidence supports a finding that Neves poses\n\na risk of flight and that no condition or combination of\n\nconditions (including those imposed by the magistrate judge)\n\nwould reasonably assure Neves’ appearance in court.             His\n\nrecord of failed appearances combined with the weight of the\n\nevidence and near-certainty of deportation persuade us that\n\nthe district court did not err in granting the government’s\n\nmotion pursuant to § 3142(e).\n\n            The district court’s order, dated April 18, 2001,\n\nrevoking    the   magistrate   judge’s   order   of   release   and\n\nordering Neves detained pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e), is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

He has a\n\nlengthy criminal record in the state courts, dating from\n\n1984 and continuing until his drug conviction in 1996, which\n\nprecipitated his deportation to Cape Verde.     The district\n\ncourt supportably found that Neves’ record was “remarkable\n\nfor the number of defaults.” The weight of the evidence\n\nagainst Neves on the illegal re-entry charge is strong and\n\nthe INS has reinstated the prior deportation order.

Xulam, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718591\"><a href=\"/opinion/718591/united-states-v-kani-xulam-aka-steven-barry-citron-aka-sereno-citron/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\n\n(revoking order of detention where there was no outstanding\n\ndeportation order against defendant).   The evidence supports\n\n\n                              -5-\n\fthe district court’s findings that Neves has both a general\n\ntendency to avoid court appearances and a strong incentive\n\nto flee in this case to avoid the near-certainty of a prison\n\nsentence followed by deportation again to Cape Verde.\n\n             Neves argues that the district court overestimated\n\nthe length of sentence that Neves would receive because it\n\ndid   not    take   into   consideration   the    possibility     of   a\n\ndownward departure from the applicable guideline sentencing\n\nrange.      As the government points out, however, a downward\n\ndeparture would not soften the most dreaded consequence\n\nfacing   Neves:     reinstatement   of   his   deportation   to   Cape\n\nVerde.      Neves claims that he lacks the financial resources\n\nto flee and to avoid prosecution.              But, his mother has\n\ntestified that she has $8,000 in savings and would rather\n\nsee Neves dead than returned to Cape Verde.           Neves was able\n\nto obtain the financial resources necessary to get himself\n\nback to this country from Cape Verde.            Neves points to his\n\nvoluntary appearance in the state court on the most serious\n\nof his previous charges.         Those cases, however, did not\n\ninvolve the same near-certainty of conviction and subsequent\n\ndeportation that Neves faces in this case.          Moreover, at the\n\ntime of those appearances, Neves had not yet experienced the\n\ngrim realities of deportation.         Applying independent review\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fto the district court’s determination that Neves poses a\n\nrisk of flight, we are not persuaded that “a different\n\nresult should have been reached.” O’Brien, 895 F.2d at 814.\n\n\n\n            IV.           Adequacy of Conditions\n\n            A. $150,000 Bond Secured by $15,000 from Fortes and\n\nGoncalves\n\n            We need not assume that Neves lacks close ties to\n\nhis family and to Goncalves to find that the bond provides\n\ninadequate protection against flight.                As the government\n\nargued before the district court, Fortes and Goncalves might\n\nwell be willing to sacrifice the $15,000 security to help\n\nNeves   avoid     being   deported    again    to   Cape    Verde.       Both\n\nsureties testified that they felt it was unfair for Neves to\n\nbe deported to a country where he has no ties and faces\n\nlanguage and cultural barriers.           Although the sureties also\n\ntestified    that     they   were   willing    to   put    up    their   life\n\nsavings because they trusted Neves to appear in court, the\n\nprospect    of    a   significant    federal    sentence        followed   by\n\ndeportation might overcome Neves’ loyalty to his family and\n\nfriends.\n\n            B. Electronic Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          We    have   recognized    the   value    of   electronic\n\nmonitoring in pretrial release cases “especially in allowing\n\nearly detection of possible flight.” Tortora, 922 F.2d at\n\n887.   But, where, as in this case, there is a particularly\n\nstrong incentive to flee, the early detection capabilities\n\nof electronic monitoring may be insufficient to overcome\n\nthat incentive and to guard against the risk of flight.\n\nNeves argues that electronic monitoring would be effective\n\nhere because he “utterly lacks the resources to run very far\n\nfor very long.” However, as explained above, we are not\n\npersuaded that lack of resources poses an insurmountable\n\nhurdle to Neves’ flight.\n\n          C. Placement of Neves in the Custody of his Mother.\n\n          Neves argues on appeal that his mother will be able\n\nto control him because her custody will be augmented by the\n\nelectronic     monitor.   It   is    not   clear,    however,   what\n\nadditional protection Neves’ mother would provide, beyond\n\nthat provided by the electronic bracelet.           We do not doubt\n\nthe sincerity of her good intentions, but Fortes’ ability to\n\nserve as custodian is hampered by, among other things, her\n\nfull-time job which she testified keeps her away from home\n\nfor “forty or more” hours a week.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f            Having carefully reviewed the record and considered\n\nthe district court’s reasons for revoking release, we are\n\nnot persuaded that a different result should have been\n\nreached.    The evidence supports a finding that Neves poses\n\na risk of flight and that no condition or combination of\n\nconditions (including those imposed by the magistrate judge)\n\nwould reasonably assure Neves’ appearance in court.             His\n\nrecord of failed appearances combined with the weight of the\n\nevidence and near-certainty of deportation persuade us that\n\nthe district court did not err in granting the government’s\n\nmotion pursuant to § 3142(e).\n\n            The district court’s order, dated April 18, 2001,\n\nrevoking    the   magistrate   judge’s   order   of   release   and\n\nordering Neves detained pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e), is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f</pre>",
