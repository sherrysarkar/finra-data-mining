Koshgarian and Cherwin,\nGlickman & Theise LLP were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                       February 27, 2001\n\f\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge. In April of 1989, a petition was\n\nfiled in the bankruptcy court seeking to reorganize the affairs\n\nof David W. Murray.         See 11 U.S.C. § 303.            The matter dragged on\n\nfor some two years, at which time the debtor, his wife Frances,\n\nand   the   creditors'       representative          (the   Official       Creditors'\n\nCommittee)        entered        into     a     settlement        agreement       (the\n\nStipulation).      The Stipulation provided that the creditors would\n\ndischarge certain claims and that the debtor, in return, would\n\ndeliver certain \"non-exempt\" property to the creditors' nominee.\n\nThe Stipulation also contained numerous additional provisions,\n\namong them a promise that the parties would release all claims\n\ninter sese other than \"claims relating to the performance of the\n\nterms of th[e] Stipulation\" and an acknowledgment that, post-\n\nconfirmation, the bankruptcy court would retain jurisdiction\n\nonly to determine adversary proceedings pending as of the date\n\nof confirmation.\n\n            In furtherance of the Stipulation, the parties entered\n\ninto a plan of reorganization (the Plan) on November 1, 1991.\n\nAmong other things, it established the Murray Creditors' Trust\n\nas    successor    to   the       Official      Creditors'        Committee.       The\n\nbankruptcy court confirmed the Plan on December 4, 1991, and\n\nappointed    Stewart        F.    Grossman      as    trustee      of   the    Murray\n\nCreditors'    Trust.             The    Stipulation,        the    Plan,    and    the\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fconfirmation order contained more or less similar provisions,\n\nbut often couched them in different language.\n\n            The supposed settlement proved more apparent than real.\n\nTwo years post-confirmation, the trustee brought an action in\n\nthe bankruptcy court against Frances Murray (an action that we\n\nshall call \"Grossman I\").         This action had two objectives.\n\nFirst, the trustee sought to recover property that the debtor\n\nallegedly had transferred fraudulently to his spouse at some\n\npoint   during     the   pre-petition    period   (January-April    1989).\n\nSecond, the trustee sought to recoup funds that Frances Murray\n\nallegedly    had    withheld   from     the   Murray   Creditors'   Trust\n\nnotwithstanding a contrary provision in the Stipulation.\n\n            The bankruptcy court refused to entertain the first of\n\nthese initiatives.       It determined that the parties had intended\n\nto limit the court's jurisdiction over adversary proceedings\n\ncommenced after confirmation; that such limiting provisions were\n\neffective and enforceable; and that, therefore, the fraudulent\n\ntransfer claim should be dismissed for lack of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction.      Grossman v. Murray (In re Murray), 214 B.R. 271,\n\n276-77 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997).          The court accepted jurisdiction\n\nover the second claim, but ruled that Frances Murray was under\n\nno obligation to transfer the disputed funds to the trustee\n\nbecause those funds were not part of the debtor's estate at the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ftime the parties executed the Stipulation.                          Id. at 277-79.        The\n\ntrustee appealed the decision in                      Grossman I to the district\n\ncourt    and    lost.         He      eschewed        any    further        appeal    (and,\n\nconsequently,        we   take     no   view     as    to     the    soundness       of   the\n\nbankruptcy court's rulings).\n\n              Even before Grossman I ran its course, the trustee, on\n\nDecember 6, 1996, filed another action in the bankruptcy court.\n\nThis time he sued the Murrays and the appellees, Stephen Berman\n\nand AAI Food Services Division, Inc. (AAI).                          We shall call this\n\naction \"Grossman II.\"\n\n              In Grossman II, the trustee alleged that on December\n\n22,    1993,   the    Murrays      fraudulently             deeded    their    estate      in\n\nBedford, New Hampshire, to Berman in a sham transaction and\n\ngranted a bogus $350,000 mortgage to AAI (a company that Berman\n\ncontrolled).        Accordingly, the trustee endeavored to set aside\n\nthese purportedly fraudulent conveyances.                       Citing, inter alia,\n\nthe bankruptcy court's decision in Grossman I, the appellees\n\nmoved    to    dismiss     Grossman        II    with        prejudice       or,     in   the\n\nalternative, for summary judgment.\n\n              The bankruptcy court granted the motion for summary\n\njudgment with virtually no explanation.                         The court commented\n\nthat    it    had   decreed      in     Grossman       I    \"that     Mr.    Grossman      is\n\nexceeding his writ when he brings these actions on matters that\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fdidn't   exist    at   a   point   in    time,\"   and   with   that    cryptic\n\nobservation entered summary judgment against the trustee.                     On\n\nthe trustee's ensuing appeal, the district court issued a one\n\nline order affirming the judgment.             This appeal followed.\n\n          We     recognize    that   the      bankruptcy   court,     with   the\n\nconfirmation of the Plan behind it, was seeking to conclude a\n\ndecade-old reorganization proceeding fairly and expeditiously.\n\nYet the court's failure to give any cogent explanation of the\n\nrationale for its order, coupled with its failure to make any\n\nfindings (written or oral), places us in an untenable position.\n\nThe record is inscrutable as to the basis for the grant of\n\nsummary judgment, and the parties have galloped off in all\n\ndirections, constructing a myriad of hypothetical scenarios in\n\na vain attempt to explain why the bankruptcy court might have\n\nruled as it did.       In the last analysis, these scenarios are pure\n\nguesswork — and they raise more questions than they answer.1\n\n\n\n\n    1 To cite one example, the parties speculate that the basis\nfor the bankruptcy court's decision may have been the court's\nbelief that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, and they\nargue at some length over what they perceive to be a pivotal\njurisdictional issue. While theoretically rich, this dialogue\nappears wholly irrelevant.     After all, the bankruptcy court\ngranted summary judgment — a disposition that presupposes the\nexistence of subject-matter jurisdiction.      See generally 11\nJames Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 56-02 (3d ed.\n1999).\n\n                                        -6-\n\f           We acknowledge that a trial court, on a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, has no absolute obligation either to make\n\nspecific findings of fact or to elaborate upon its view of the\n\ncontrolling    legal    principles.         See    Fed.     R.    Civ.   P.   52(a)\n\n(exempting motions for summary judgment from the usual praxis);\n\nBankr. R. 7052 (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) and its exemption\n\nfor summary judgment motions to bankruptcy litigation); see also\n\nDomegan   v.   Fair,    859   F.2d    1059,       1065-66    (1st    Cir.     1988)\n\n(refusing to vacate an order denying summary judgment for lack\n\nof specific findings).         But if our multi-tiered adjudicative\n\nsystem is to function smoothly, a trial court must provide an\n\nadequate record for appellate review.                  For that reason, we\n\nrepeatedly have emphasized the value of statements explaining\n\nthe legal basis for a nisi prius court's decision, whether or\n\nnot required by some rule.       E.g., Roque-Rodriguez v. Lema Moya,\n\n926 F.2d 103, 105 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991);                Domegan, 859 F.2d at\n\n1066.     Although     busy   trial   judges       need     not   write   lengthy\n\nopinions in every case — a lucid explanation from the bench or\n\na brief memorandum of decision almost always will do — they\n\nshould take reasonable steps to ensure that the parties and the\n\nappellate courts will be able to glimpse the foundation on which\n\ntheir rulings rest.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           In many cases, such statements are helpful, but not\n\nessential.   At times, however, such statements are a necessary\n\nprecondition to intelligent appellate review.   Such an occasion\n\narises when a trial court grants a motion for summary judgment\n\nunder circumstances in which the basis for its ruling is not\n\neasily ascertainable from the bare record.      In that kind of\n\nsituation, it is risky business for an appellate court to guess\n\nat what the trial court might have been thinking, and the better\n\ncourse is to remand for an elaboration of the decision.2    E.g.,\n\nFrancis v. Goodman, 81 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1996); Myers v. Gulf\n\nOil Corp., 731 F.2d 281, 283-84 (5th Cir. 1984).\n\n           This is such a case.      Grossman I had two separate\n\naspects:   a fraudulent conveyance claim, 214 B.R. at 275-77, and\n\nwhat the court termed a \"breach of contract\" claim (evidently\n\nreferring to a breach of the Stipulation), id. at 277-79.     The\n\ncourt decided these claims on different legal grounds.   Grossman\n\nII can best be described as a hybrid of these double-barreled\n\nclaims.    Thus, the bankruptcy court's allusion to Grossman I\n\ndoes not shed any light on why the court thought that Grossman\n\n\n    2We note that the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has\nexercised its inherent supervisory authority to require that\ntrial courts provide an explanation for all orders granting\nsummary judgment. Vadino v. A. Valey Eng'rs, 903 F.2d 253, 258-\n59 (3d Cir. 1990).        We recognize, however, that such\nexplanations are unnecessary in many situations, and we limit\nour holding accordingly.\n\n                               -8-\n\fII should summarily be put out to pasture.                 By the same token,\n\nthe court's elliptical comment that the trustee exceeded his\n\nwrit does not enhance our ability to discern the basis for its\n\nruling; the court could have been referring to limitations on\n\nits own jurisdiction, or to the trustee's standing to bring the\n\naction, or to some recondite interpretation of the Stipulation.\n\nThe parties' confusion, as manifested in their briefs, mirrors\n\nour difficulty in attempting to understand this comment — a\n\ndifficulty that is magnified by the court's decision to grant\n\nsummary   judgment       rather    than    to    dismiss    the   case   without\n\nprejudice to the trustee's right to pursue it in another forum.\n\nSee supra note 1.        Because the basis for the bankruptcy court's\n\nruling is not ascertainable from the record without extensive\n\nsurmise, we think that the wisest course is to remand for\n\nenlightenment.\n\n            We   need    go   no    further.       The     bankruptcy    court's\n\nenigmatic    explanation          supplies      insufficient      guidance   for\n\nreasoned review.        The district court's terse affirmance does not\n\nfill the void.     Consequently, we vacate the appealed order and\n\nremand to the district court with instructions that the matter\n\nbe remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.             The bankruptcy court may, in its\n\ndiscretion, either rehear the matter and enter a new decision or\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\freinstate its original decision with a suitable explication of\n\nits reasoning.\n\n\n\n         Vacated and remanded.   All parties will bear their own\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f",

Murray. See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 303. The matter dragged on for some two years, at which time the debtor, his wife Frances, and the creditors' representative (the Official Creditors' Committee) entered into a settlement agreement (the Stipulation). The Stipulation provided that the creditors would discharge certain claims and that the debtor, in return, would deliver certain \"non-exempt\" property to the creditors' nominee. The Stipulation also contained numerous additional provisions, among them a promise that the parties would release all claims inter sese other than \"claims relating to the performance of the terms of th[e] Stipulation\" and an acknowledgment that, post-confirmation, the bankruptcy court would retain jurisdiction only to determine adversary proceedings pending as of the date of confirmation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In furtherance of the Stipulation, the parties entered into a plan of reorganization (the Plan) on November 1, 1991. Among other things, it established the Murray Creditors' Trust as successor to the Official Creditors' Committee. The bankruptcy court confirmed the Plan on December 4, 1991, and appointed Stewart F.

Murray. See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 303. The matter dragged on for some two years, at which time the debtor, his wife Frances, and the creditors' representative (the Official Creditors' Committee) entered into a settlement agreement (the Stipulation). The Stipulation provided that the creditors would discharge certain claims and that the debtor, in return, would deliver certain \"non-exempt\" property to the creditors' nominee. The Stipulation also contained numerous additional provisions, among them a promise that the parties would release all claims inter sese other than \"claims relating to the performance of the terms of th[e] Stipulation\" and an acknowledgment that, post-confirmation, the bankruptcy court would retain jurisdiction only to determine adversary proceedings pending as of the date of confirmation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In furtherance of the Stipulation, the parties entered into a plan of reorganization (the Plan) on November 1, 1991. Among other things, it established the Murray Creditors' Trust as successor to the Official Creditors' Committee. The bankruptcy court confirmed the Plan on December 4, 1991, and appointed Stewart F. Grossman as trustee of the Murray Creditors' Trust. The Stipulation, the Plan, and the confirmation order contained more or less similar provisions, but often couched them in different language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supposed settlement proved more apparent than real. Two years post-confirmation, the trustee brought an action in the bankruptcy court against Frances Murray (an action that we shall call \"Grossman I\"). This action had two objectives. First, the trustee sought to recover property that the debtor allegedly had transferred fraudulently to his spouse at some point during the pre-petition period (January-April 1989). Second, the trustee sought to recoup funds that Frances Murray allegedly had withheld from the Murray Creditors' Trust notwithstanding a contrary provision in the Stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court refused to entertain the first of these initiatives. It determined that the parties had intended to limit the court's jurisdiction over adversary proceedings commenced after confirmation; that such limiting provisions were effective and enforceable; and that, therefore, the fraudulent transfer claim should be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Grossman v. Murray (In re Murray), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1843691\"><a href=\"/opinion/1843691/in-re-murray/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 276-77 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997). The court accepted jurisdiction over the second claim, but ruled that Frances Murray was under no obligation to transfer the disputed funds to the trustee because those funds were not part of the debtor's estate at the time the parties executed the Stipulation. Id. at 277-79. The trustee appealed the decision in Grossman I to the district court and lost. He eschewed any further appeal (and, consequently, we take no view as to the soundness of the bankruptcy court's rulings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before Grossman I ran its course, the trustee, on December 6, 1996, filed another action in the bankruptcy court. This time he sued the Murrays and the appellees, Stephen Berman and AAI Food Services Division, Inc. (AAI). We shall call this action \"Grossman II.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Grossman II, the trustee alleged that on December 22, 1993, the Murrays fraudulently deeded their estate in Bedford, New Hampshire, to Berman in a sham transaction and granted a bogus $350,000 mortgage to AAI (a company that Berman controlled). Accordingly, the trustee endeavored to set aside these purportedly fraudulent conveyances. Citing, inter alia, the bankruptcy court's decision in Grossman I, the appellees moved to dismiss Grossman II with prejudice or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court granted the motion for summary judgment with virtually no explanation. The court commented that it had decreed in Grossman I \"that Mr. Grossman is exceeding his writ when he brings these actions on matters that didn't exist at a point in time,\" and with that cryptic observation entered summary judgment against the trustee. On the trustee's ensuing appeal, the district court issued a one line order affirming the judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the bankruptcy court, with the confirmation of the Plan behind it, was seeking to conclude a decade-old reorganization proceeding fairly and expeditiously. Yet the court's failure to give any cogent explanation of the rationale for its order, coupled with its failure to make any findings (written or oral), places us in an untenable position. The record is inscrutable as to the basis for the grant of summary judgment, and the parties have galloped off in all directions, constructing a myriad of hypothetical scenarios in a vain attempt to explain why the bankruptcy court might have ruled as it did. In the last analysis, these scenarios are pure guesswork -- and they raise more questions than they answer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that a trial court, on a motion for summary judgment, has no absolute obligation either to make specific findings of fact or to elaborate upon its view of the controlling legal principles. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (exempting motions for summary judgment from the usual praxis); Bankr. R. 7052 (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) and its exemption for summary judgment motions to bankruptcy litigation); see alsoDomegan v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513189\"><a href=\"/opinion/513189/dennis-j-domegan-v-michael-v-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></a></span>, 1065-66 (1st Cir. 1988) (refusing to vacate an order denying summary judgment for lack of specific findings). But if our multi-tiered adjudicative system is to function smoothly, a trial court must provide an adequate record for appellate review. For that reason, we repeatedly have emphasized the value of statements explaining the legal basis for a nisi prius court's decision, whether or not required by some rule. E.g., Roque-Rodriguez v. Lema Moya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556401\"><a href=\"/opinion/556401/elizabeth-roque-rodriguez-v-hon-jose-lema-moya/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 105 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991); Domegan, 859 F.2d at 1066. Although busy trial judges need not write lengthy opinions in every case -- a lucid explanation from the bench or a brief memorandum of decision almost always will do -- they should take reasonable steps to ensure that the parties and the appellate courts will be able to glimpse the foundation on which their rulings rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many cases, such statements are helpful, but not essential. At times, however, such statements are a necessary precondition to intelligent appellate review. Such an occasion arises when a trial court grants a motion for summary judgment under circumstances in which the basis for its ruling is not easily ascertainable from the bare record. In that kind of situation, it is risky business for an appellate court to guess at what the trial court might have been thinking, and the better course is to remand for an elaboration of the decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> E.g., Francis v. Goodman, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1996); Myers v. Gulf Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433557\"><a href=\"/opinion/433557/john-r-myers-v-gulf-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 283-84 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case. Grossman I had two separate aspects: a fraudulent conveyance claim, 214 B.R. at 275-77, and what the court termed a \"breach of contract\" claim (evidently referring to a breach of the Stipulation), id. at 277-79. The court decided these claims on different legal grounds. Grossman II can best be described as a hybrid of these double-barreled claims. Thus, the bankruptcy court's allusion to Grossman I does not shed any light on why the court thought that Grossman II should summarily be put out to pasture. By the same token, the court's elliptical comment that the trustee exceeded his writ does not enhance our ability to discern the basis for its ruling; the court could have been referring to limitations on its own jurisdiction, or to the trustee's standing to bring the action, or to some recondite interpretation of the Stipulation. The parties' confusion, as manifested in their briefs, mirrors our difficulty in attempting to understand this comment -- a difficulty that is magnified by the court's decision to grant summary judgment rather than to dismiss the case without prejudice to the trustee's right to pursue it in another forum. See supra note 1. Because the basis for the bankruptcy court's ruling is not ascertainable from the record without extensive surmise, we think that the wisest course is to remand for enlightenment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
