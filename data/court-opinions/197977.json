LACEDRA,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n     [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Glenn P. Lacedra on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Robert E.\r\nRichardson, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nMay 28, 1998\r\n\n       Per Curiam.  Pro se appellant, Glenn P. LaCedra,\r\nappeals from the district court's partial denial of his Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P. 41(e) motion seeking the return of certain property\r\nwhich had been seized pursuant to a search warrant, or, in the\r\nalternative, for compensation for the seized property.   We\r\naffirm.\r\n         The court did not abuse its discretion or commit\r\nerror in declining to return certain firearms and related\r\nproperty to LaCedra, who is a convicted felon.  See 18 U.S.C.\r\n 922(g)(1) (making it unlawful for persons convicted of crimes\r\npunishable by imprisonment for greater than one year to possess\r\nfirearms or ammunition).  Nor did the court abuse its\r\ndiscretion or err in failing to order compensation for the\r\nfirearms and related property since the government had\r\nrepresented that it would surrender these items to any third\r\nparty lawfully purchasing them from LaCedra.  \r\n         The district court also properly declined to order\r\nthe return of certain \"investigative paperwork\" casually\r\nidentified by LaCedra.  As best we can glean from the record,\r\nthe materials in question have no market value but were for the\r\nmost part materials either used in connection with the planned\r\nmurder or capable of being used in another attempt.  That is\r\nreason enough for the district court to decline to order the\r\ngovernment to restore those materials to LaCedra.\r\n         Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
