He  has  described,  in   relatively  detailed  and\r\n\nnonconclusory  fashion, the  structure  of the  agency's file\r\n\nsystem,  the scope  of  the search  performed at  plaintiff's\r\n\nbehest, and the method by which it was conducted.  Plaintiff,\r\n\nin turn, has failed to rebut this  affidavit.  His attempt to\r\n\nadduce  \"positive  indications   of  overlooked   materials,\"\r\n\nOglesby  v. Department of Army, 79 F.3d 1172, 1185 (D.C. Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1996), or to otherwise show \"that the agency's search was not\r\n\nmade in good  faith,\" Maynard,  986 F.2d at  560, amounts  to\r                                         \r\n\nnothing more than speculation.\r\n\n     In   contending  that   the   FBI  overlooked   relevant\r\n\ndocuments,  plaintiff points  to  three factors.   First,  he\r\n\nnotes  that a 1989 teletype (of which he first learned during\r\n\nthe course of other  FOIA litigation) was sent from  New York\r\n\nto Washington with a copy to Boston.  Yet as  we explained in\r\n\nMaynard,  the fact that a document refers to the existence of\r                   \r\n\nother records  \"does not  independently generate an  issue of\r\n\nmaterial fact rendering summary  judgment improper so long as\r\n\nreasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits demonstrate the\r\n\nreasonableness  of the  agency's [subsequent]  search.\"   986\r\n\nF.2d at 562; accord, e.g., Weisberg v. United States Dep't of\r                                                                         \r\n\nJustice,  705 F.2d  1344,  1351 (D.C.  Cir.  1983); see  also\r                                                                         \r\n\nMiller v. United States Dep't of Justice, 779 F.2d 1378, 1384\r                                                    \r\n\n(8th  Cir. 1985) (\"The fact that a document once existed does\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nnot mean that it now exists; nor does the fact that an agency\r\n\ncreated  a document  necessarily  imply that  the agency  has\r\n\nretained it.\"). \r\n\n     Second, plaintiff insists that the FBI must have records\r\n\npertaining to his 1969 drug prosecution in Rhode Island state\r\n\ncourt.   Yet his assertion that the FBI not only participated\r\n\nin that investigation but retained records pertaining thereto\r\n\nis conjectural.  And even  if accurate, that assertion  would\r\n\nnonetheless fail  to call into  question the adequacy  of the\r\n\nsearch as detailed in  the Callahan affidavit.   See Maynard,\r                                                                        \r\n\n986 F.2d at 560 (satisfactory agency affidavit is \"accorded a\r\n\npresumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely\r\n\nspeculative  claims   about  the   existence  ...   of  other\r\n\ndocuments\") (internal quotations omitted).  \r\n\n     Finally, plaintiff complains  that the search failed  to\r\n\nlook for entries involving possible misspellings of his name.\r\n\nYet  \"there is no  general requirement that  an agency search\r\n\n... variant spellings.\"   Id.  And the fact  that the FBI did\r                                         \r\n\nat  one point misspell plaintiff's  name does not  call for a\r\n\ndifferent result,  especially where  the record  reveals that\r\n\nthe agency had corrected such error by December 1968.\r\n\n     In the alternative,  plaintiff alleges that, because  of\r\n\nhis pro se status,  the district court erred in  entering its\r\n\nruling  without first  ensuring  that he  had  notice of  the\r\n\nsummary judgment requirements.   Yet we have no occasion here\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nto address whether such notice must always be afforded to pro\r\n\nse litigants in  the Rule  56 context--a matter  as to  which\r\n\ncourts have  differed.   Compare, e.g.,  Timms v.  Frank, 953\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 281,  283-86 (7th  Cir.  1992) with,  e.g., Jacobsen  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFiller, 790 F.2d 1362, 1364-67 (9th Cir. 1986).  In assessing\r                  \r\n\nthe adequacy  of the agency's  search, we have  accorded full\r\n\nconsideration  to  plaintiff's (untimely)  opposition  to the\r\n\nsummary  judgment  motion and  have  accepted  all reasonable\r\n\nfactual allegations  in  his (unsworn)  submissions as  true.\r\n\nEven  on  that  basis,  an  award  of  summary  judgment  for\r\n\ndefendant would be mandated.  The failure to advise plaintiff\r\n\nof the Rule 56 procedures, even if erroneous (a  matter as to\r\n\nwhich we intimate no view), would thus have been harmless. \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

United States Dep't of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1378</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1384\r                                                    \r\n\n(8th  Cir. 1985) (\"The fact that a document once existed does\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nnot mean that it now exists; nor does the fact that an agency\r\n\ncreated  a document  necessarily  imply that  the agency  has\r\n\nretained it.\"). \r\n\n     Second, plaintiff insists that the FBI must have records\r\n\npertaining to his 1969 drug prosecution in Rhode Island state\r\n\ncourt.   Yet his assertion that the FBI not only participated\r\n\nin that investigation but retained records pertaining thereto\r\n\nis conjectural.  And even  if accurate, that assertion  would\r\n\nnonetheless fail  to call into  question the adequacy  of the\r\n\nsearch as detailed in  the Callahan affidavit.   See Maynard,\r                                                                        \r\n\n986 F.2d at 560 (satisfactory agency affidavit is \"accorded a\r\n\npresumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely\r\n\nspeculative  claims   about  the   existence  ...   of  other\r\n\ndocuments\") (internal quotations omitted).  \r\n\n     Finally, plaintiff complains  that the search failed  to\r\n\nlook for entries involving possible misspellings of his name.\r\n\nYet  \"there is no  general requirement that  an agency search\r\n\n... variant spellings.\"   Id.  And the fact  that the FBI did\r                                         \r\n\nat  one point misspell plaintiff's  name does not  call for a\r\n\ndifferent result,  especially where  the record  reveals that\r\n\nthe agency had corrected such error by December 1968.\r\n\n     In the alternative,  plaintiff alleges that, because  of\r\n\nhis pro se status,  the district court erred in  entering its\r\n\nruling  without first  ensuring  that he  had  notice of  the\r\n\nsummary judgment requirements.   Yet we have no occasion here\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nto address whether such notice must always be afforded to pro\r\n\nse litigants in  the Rule  56 context--a matter  as to  which\r\n\ncourts have  differed.

In assessing\r                  \r\n\nthe adequacy  of the agency's  search, we have  accorded full\r\n\nconsideration  to  plaintiff's (untimely)  opposition  to the\r\n\nsummary  judgment  motion and  have  accepted  all reasonable\r\n\nfactual allegations  in  his (unsworn)  submissions as  true.\r\n\nEven  on  that  basis,  an  award  of  summary  judgment  for\r\n\ndefendant would be mandated.  The failure to advise plaintiff\r\n\nof the Rule 56 procedures, even if erroneous (a  matter as to\r\n\nwhich we intimate no view), would thus have been harmless. \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n</pre>",
