Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert J. Roughsedge, with whom Chester Darling and Michael\nWilliams, were on brief, for appellants.\n     Frances S. Cohen, with whom Merita A. Hopkins, Corporation Counsel\nof the City of Boston, Adam N. Lewis, Peter N. Kochansky and Hill &\nBarlow, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            April 5, 2001\n\f-2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge. Appellants are five school-age\n\nchildren who live in Boston, Massachusetts. In combination with five\n\nother children and an advocacy group, Boston's Children First, they\n\nbrought suit, claiming that the Boston elementary school assignment\n\nprogram denied them their preferred school assignments based on their\n\nrace, in violation of federal and state law. Boston's Children First\n\nv. City of Boston, 98 F. Supp. 2d 111, 112 (D. Mass. 2000).     Each\n\nplaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as\n\ncompensatory or nominal damages. Id. The district court held that\n\nbecause the five appellant children did not apply to change schools\n\nprior to the 1999-2000 school year, they could not be said to suffer\n\nany injury requiring injunctive relief, and therefore lacked standing\n\nto sue for such relief. Id. at 114. Accordingly, the district court\n\ngranted defendants' motion to dismiss as it related to appellants'\n\nclaims for injunctive relief. Id. Appellants then appealed to this\n\nCourt. Because we lack jurisdiction to entertain this interlocutory\n\nappeal, we must dismiss without addressing the merits.1\n\n\n1  Some time after the decision underlying this appeal had issued,\nthis Court granted a writ of mandamus to recuse the district judge,\nbased on an appearance of partiality stemming from that judge's public\ncomments. Boston's Children First v. City of Boston, 239 F.3d 59 (1st\nCir. 2001), amended on denial of reh'g, -- F.3d --, 2001 WL 274467 (1st\nCir. Mar. 2, 2001). We asked both parties to file supplemental briefs\naddressing whether that grant of mandamus required us to vacate the\ndecision underlying this appeal. Both parties argued that it did not,\nbecause the appealed-from order predated the events giving rise to the\nwrit. We agree. See Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486\nU.S. 847, 864 (1988) (scope of recusal remedy is complex and fact-\n\n                                -3-\n\f                                  A\n\n          Appellants argue first that this Court has jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), which provides for appellate\n\njurisdiction of \"[i]nterlocutory orders . . . granting, continuing,\n\nmodifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions . . . .\" They suggest\n\nthat the district court's dismissal of their claims for injunctive\n\nrelief, based on the determination that they lacked standing, amounted\n\nto a refusal of an injunction appealable pursuant to § 1292(a)(1).\n\n          Orders in which the district court expressly denies a request\n\nfor injunctive relief are immediately appealable as of right under\n\n§ 1292(a)(1). Casas Office Machs. v. Mita Copystar Am., Inc., 42 F.3d\n\n668, 673 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Morganstern v. Wilson, 29 F.3d 1291,\n\n1294 (8th Cir. 1994)). When the order only has the \"practical effect\"\n\nof denying an injunction, however, the denial must have a \"serious,\n\nperhaps irreparable, consequence,\" and be \"effectually challenged only\n\nby immediate appeal.\" Id.; see also Carson v. American Brands, Inc.,\n\n450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981) (setting forth this test). This narrow scope\n\ngiven to § 1292(a)(1) stems from the \"general congressional policy\n\nagainst piecemeal review,\" as well as Congress's intent to \"carve out\n\n\n\n\ndependent); In re Allied-Signal Inc., 891 F.2d 967, 973 (1st Cir. 1989)\n(lack of actual bias made it unnecessary to vacate rulings made prior\nto mandated recusal); In re Sch. Asbestos Lit., 977 F.2d 764, 786 (3d\nCir. 1992) (proposing four approaches to vacating pre-recusal\ndecisions, none of which would require us to vacate this decision).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fonly a limited exception to the final-judgment rule.\" Carson, 450 U.S.\n\nat 84.\n\n          This Court has held that the dismissal of some claims for\n\ninjunctive relief when other claims remain pending does not \"expressly\"\n\ndeny an injunction. Plymouth County Nuclear Info. Comm., Inc. v.\n\nBoston Edison Co., 655 F.2d 15, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1981) (striking claims\n\nfor injunctive relief because they were preempted by federal\n\nlegislation); see also Hutchinson v. Pfeil, 105 F.3d 566, 569 (10th\n\nCir. 1997) (partial summary judgment against plaintiff who sought\n\ninjunctive relief); Gamboa v. Chandler, 101 F.3d 90, 91 (9th Cir. 1996)\n\n(same); Cuomo v. Barr, 7 F.3d 17, 19 (2d Cir. 1993) (partial summary\n\njudgment on claims for injunctive relief); Woodard v. Sage Prods.,\n\nInc., 818 F.2d 841, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (partial summary judgment in\n\nfavor of several defendants).\n\n          The district court's determination that the five appellants\n\nlacked standing to seek injunctive relief does have the \"practical\n\neffect\" of denying an injunction, because it has \"erected a 'legal\n\nbarrier' foreclosing any meaningful future consideration of a formal\n\napplication\" for injunctive relief by these particular appellants.\n\nPlymouth Nuclear, 655 F.2d at 17.      This Court may therefore only\n\npremise its jurisdiction on a showing that appellants face \"serious,\n\nperhaps irreparable, harm\" upon the denial of immediate review.\n\nCarson, 450 U.S. at 84.     The procedural history of the instant\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\flitigation, specifically appellants' failure to pursue appellate (or\n\nother) review of the district court's earlier denial of a preliminary\n\ninjunction, points against a finding of serious harm.        Plymouth\n\nNuclear, 655 F.2d at 17-18 (holding that the failure to appeal from or\n\nmove for reconsideration of a previous denial of a preliminary\n\ninjunction makes interim relief a \"dead issue,\" and is indicative of a\n\nlack of serious harm).     In this case, appellants' motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction was denied on August 10, 1999, nine months\n\nbefore the order appealed here issued. See Boston's Children First v.\n\nCity of Boston, 62 F. Supp. 2d 247, 248 (D. Mass. 1999); cf. Plymouth\n\nNuclear, 655 F.2d at 17-18 (eighteen months between denial of\n\npreliminary injunction and dismissal of claims for permanent injunctive\n\nrelief). There was no appeal from the denial of interim relief,2 nor\n\nwas a motion for reconsideration filed. Plymouth Nuclear, 655 F.2d at\n\n17-18; Samayoa v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 783 F.2d 102, 104 (7th Cir.\n\n1986) (failure to appeal denial of preliminary relief indicative of\n\nlack of urgency). Appellants also failed to seek other avenues of\n\ninterlocutory appeal, such as a separate final judgment on the\n\ndismissed claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) or\n\ncertification for an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n\n\n2 Interlocutory orders denying preliminary injunctive relief may almost\nalways be immediately appealed pursuant to § 1292(a)(1). E.g., CMM\nCable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc., 48 F.3d 618, 620-21 (1st\nCir. 1995).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fBarr, 7 F.3d at 20 (failure to pursue all available courses of\n\ninterlocutory appeal supports an inference that serious harm does not\n\nexist).\n\n            Appellants seek to distinguish Plymouth Nuclear by arguing\n\nthat their failure to press their claims for temporary relief resulted\n\nfrom delays attributable to appellees or the district court: namely,\n\nthe alleged failure of appellees to cooperate with discovery orders and\n\nthe court's suggestion that a renewed motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction would fail unless additional evidence was unearthed during\n\ndiscovery. Even if these discovery-related complaints are justified,\n\nhowever, their timing makes appellants' argument meritless.         The\n\noriginal motion for a preliminary injunction was denied on August 10,\n\n1999. Appellants did not attempt to renew that motion until over nine\n\nmonths later, on May 19, 2000,3 which was coincidentally the same day\n\nthat the district court partially granted defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss. It was not until a month later, at a June 20, 2000 scheduling\n\nconference, that the district court indicated that the renewed motion\n\nwould probably fail because insufficient new evidence had emerged (via\n\ndiscovery) in the preceding ten months. The reasons why appellants\n\nwithdrew their May 19 renewed motion for preliminary injunction and\n\ndelayed its resubmission are irrelevant: it is their failure to press\n\n\n\n\n3   The renewed motion for a preliminary injunction was later withdrawn.\n\n                                   -7-\n\ftheir original motion for a preliminary injunction that is indicative\n\nof the lack of serious harm.\n\n          Even if we were to ascribe minimal weight to appellants'\n\nfailure to press their request for interim relief, appellants have made\n\nno showing that this order is of the type that can be \"effectually\n\nchallenged only by immediate appeal.\" Casas, 42 F.3d at 672. The\n\norder simply dismisses certain claims while other claims remain\n\npending. Once the district court has disposed of all claims, this\n\nCourt can address them as a whole, if appellants choose to appeal at\n\nthat point. Appellants have simply made no compelling argument as to\n\nwhy the order is \"insusceptible of effective vindication following\n\nfinal judgment.\" In re Unanue Casal, 998 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\nsee also Woodard, 818 F.2d at 851-52 (comparing the ability to review\n\ndenials of permanent injunctions upon final appeal with the inability\n\nto review denials of preliminary injunctions at that stage).\n\n          Appellants also argue that the dismissal of their claims for\n\npermanent injunctive relief \"effectively denied\" their renewed motion\n\nfor a preliminary injunction, which had not yet been filed when this\n\norder issued.4 In other words, because the district court found that\n\nthese five plaintiffs lacked standing to seek injunctive relief, they\n\ncould not be included in a renewed petition for preliminary relief.\n\n\n\n4 The renewed motion was actually filed the same day that the order\nissued (May 19, 2000), but as we have noted, was later withdrawn.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fEven if we assume that this is so, and even if we were to read\n\n§ 1291(a)(1) as applicable to the \"effective denial\" of an as yet\n\nunrequested preliminary injunction, we have previously denied\n\ninterlocutory review of the refusal of a permanent injunction despite\n\nthe assumption that such refusal would \"foreclose any meaningful future\n\nconsideration\" of claims for injunctive relief. See Plymouth Nuclear,\n\n655 F.2d at 17.    We do so again here.     To hold otherwise could\n\nunacceptably broaden the scope of § 1292(a)(1), as any plaintiff denied\n\na permanent injunction would claim jurisdiction based on their plans to\n\nseek future preliminary relief.\n\n                                  B\n\n          Appellants would alternatively premise this Court's\n\njurisdiction on the \"collateral order doctrine,\" which provides a\n\nnarrow exception to the final judgment rule. Midland Asphalt Co. v.\n\nUnited States, 489 U.S. 794, 798 (1989). This doctrine allows appeal\n\nfrom decisions \"which finally determine claims of right separate from,\n\nand collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be\n\ndenied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that\n\nappellate jurisdiction be deferred until the whole case is\n\nadjudicated.\" Id. (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337\n\nU.S. 541, 546 (1949)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court\n\napplies a four-part test to determine whether a decision qualifies as\n\na \"collateral order.\"     The order must involve:\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          (1) an issue essentially unrelated to the merits\n          of the main dispute, capable of review without\n          disrupting the main trial; (2) a complete\n          resolution of the issue, not one that is\n          'unfinished' or 'inconclusive'; (3) a right\n          incapable of vindication on appeal from final\n          judgment; and (4) an important and unsettled\n          question of controlling law, not merely a\n          question of the proper exercise of the trial\n          court's discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Sorren, 605 F.2d 1211, 1213 (1st Cir. 1979). In other\n\nwords, the order must be separable, final, urgent, and important. In\n\nre Cont'l Inv. Corp., 637 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n          We need not determine whether this order is final, urgent,\n\nand important, because it is clearly not separable in the manner\n\ncontemplated by the collateral order doctrine. For an order to be\n\ncollateral, it must not be \"enmeshed in the factual and legal issues\n\ncomprising the plaintiff's cause of action.\" Coopers & Lybrand v.\n\nLivesay, 437 U.S. 468-69 (1978) (quoting Mercantile Nat'l Bank v.\n\nLangdeau, 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nHere, the district court order dismissing the claims for injunctive\n\nrelief was dependent on the court's evaluation of the factual basis for\n\na claim of unconstitutional discrimination, as well as the application\n\nof standing jurisprudence to those facts. Moreover, a partial grant of\n\na motion to dismiss simply is not the sort of order that falls within\n\nthe collateral order bailiwick -- a category whose usual members\n\ninclude   orders   denying   security   in   derivative   suits,   bail\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdeterminations, orders requiring plaintiffs to identify themselves, and\n\norders granting disqualification of the trial judge -- decisions which\n\nin no way go to the merits of the underlying claim. See generally 15A\n\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 3911.2 (3d ed. 1992) (discussing scope of the\n\ncollateral order doctrine). In short, this order is a decision on the\n\nmerits, not on an issue collateral to them.\n\n                                  C\n\n          Appellants also suggest that this Court has jurisdiction\n\npursuant to the \"pragmatic finality\" doctrine, which they understand as\n\nallowing this Court to premise its jurisdiction on an ad hoc balancing\n\nof \"the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review and the danger that\n\ndelay will create an injustice.\" Gillespie v. U.S. Steel Corp., 379\n\nU.S. 148, 152 (1964).       However, the Supreme Court has since\n\nsubstantially limited the reach of Gillespie and condemned a broad\n\nbalancing approach to questions of finality. See Johnson v. Jones, 515\n\nU.S. 304, 315 (1995) (\"[W]e do not now in each individual case engage\n\nin ad hoc balancing to decide issues of appealability\"). Numerous\n\ncourts have agreed that Gillespie, in itself, does not provide\n\nappellate review unless another exception to the final judgment rule is\n\navailable. See, e.g., Kmart Corp. v. Aronds, 123 F.3d 297, 300 (5th\n\nCir. 1997) (no longer recognizing the exception); Green v. Dep't of\n\nCommerce, 618 F.2d 836, 841 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (\"No federal appellate\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fcourt, to our knowledge, has ever followed the Gillespie dictum in a\n\ncase in which the appeal could not be justified on the basis of some\n\nother, narrower, policy demanding deviation from the finality rule.\").\n\nApart from established exceptions, this Court has indicated that\n\nappellate jurisdiction does not exist in the absence of finality, and\n\nthat cases in the \"twilight zone\" of finality, such as Gillespie, are\n\nonly addressable via mandamus upon a showing of palpable error and\n\nirreparable harm. Petralia v. AT&T Global Info. Solutions Co., 114\n\nF.3d 352, 354 (1st Cir. 1997).    We have already noted the lack of\n\nserious harm or manifest injustice in delaying appeal here until a\n\nfinal judgment has issued; the pragmatic finality doctrine, if it still\n\nsurvives, does not apply.\n\n                                  D\n\n          Because we have no jurisdiction pursuant to § 1292(a)(1), and\n\nno exception to the final judgment rule applies, we dismiss the appeal\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

Midland Asphalt Co. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 798 (1989). This doctrine allows appeal from decisions \"which finally determine claims of right separate from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate jurisdiction be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\" Id. (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court applies a four-part test to determine whether a decision qualifies as a \"collateral order.\" The order must involve:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) an issue essentially unrelated to the merits of the main dispute, capable of review without disrupting the main trial; (2) a complete resolution of the issue, not one that is 'unfinished' or 'inconclusive'; (3) a right incapable of vindication on appeal from final judgment; and (4) an important and unsettled question of controlling law, not merely a question of the proper exercise of the trial court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

For an order to be collateral, it must not be \"enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action.\" Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 468-69 (1978) (quoting Mercantile Nat'l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court order dismissing the claims for injunctive relief was dependent on the court's evaluation of the factual basis for a claim of unconstitutional discrimination, as well as the application of standing jurisprudence to those facts. Moreover, a partial grant of a motion to dismiss simply is not the sort of order that falls within the collateral order bailiwick -- a category whose usual members include orders denying security in derivative suits, bail determinations, orders requiring plaintiffs to identify themselves, and orders granting disqualification of the trial judge -- decisions which in no way go to the merits of the underlying claim. See generally 15A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3911.2 (3d ed. 1992) (discussing scope of the collateral order doctrine). In short, this order is a decision on the merits, not on an issue collateral to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also suggest that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the \"pragmatic finality\" doctrine, which they understand as allowing this Court to premise its jurisdiction on an ad hoc balancing of \"the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review and the danger that delay will create an injustice.\" Gillespie v. U.S. Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 152 (1964). However, the Supreme Court has since substantially limited the reach of Gillespie and condemned a broad balancing approach to questions of finality. See Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 315 (1995) (\"[W]e do not now in each individual case engage in ad hoc balancing to decide issues of appealability\"). Numerous courts have agreed that Gillespie, in itself, does not provide appellate review unless another exception to the final judgment rule is available. See, e.g., Kmart Corp. v. Aronds, 123 F.3d 297, 300 (5th Cir. 1997) (no longer recognizing the exception); Green v. Dep't of Commerce, 618 F.2d 836, 841 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (\"No federal appellate court, to our knowledge, has ever followed the Gillespie dictum in a case in which the appeal could not be justified on the basis of some other, narrower, policy demanding deviation from the finality rule.\"). Apart from established exceptions, this Court has indicated that appellate jurisdiction does not exist in the absence of finality, and that cases in the \"twilight zone\" of finality, such as Gillespie, are only addressable via mandamus upon a showing of palpable error and irreparable harm. Petralia v. AT&amp;T Global Info. Solutions Co., 114 F.3d 352, 354 (1st Cir. 1997). We have already noted the lack of serious harm or manifest injustice in delaying appeal here until a final judgment has issued; the pragmatic finality doctrine, if it still survives, does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have no jurisdiction pursuant to &#167; 1292(a)(1), and no exception to the final judgment rule applies, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Some time after the decision underlying this appeal had issued, this Court granted a writ of mandamus to recuse the district judge, based on an appearance of partiality stemming from that judge's public comments.

We asked both parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether that grant of mandamus required us to vacate the decision underlying this appeal. Both parties argued that it did not, because the appealed-from order predated the events giving rise to the writ. We agree. See Liljeberg v.

The district court held that because the five appellant children did not apply to change schools prior to the 1999-2000 school year, they could not be said to suffer any injury requiring injunctive relief, and therefore lacked standing to sue for such relief.

This Court applies a four-part test to determine whether a decision qualifies as a \"collateral order.\" The order must involve:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) an issue essentially unrelated to the merits of the main dispute, capable of review without disrupting the main trial; (2) a complete resolution of the issue, not one that is 'unfinished' or 'inconclusive'; (3) a right incapable of vindication on appeal from final judgment; and (4) an important and unsettled question of controlling law, not merely a question of the proper exercise of the trial court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

In other words, the order must be separable, final, urgent, and important. In re Cont'l Inv. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"385708\"><a href=\"/opinion/385708/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97800-bankr-l-rep-p-67739-bankr-l-rep-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not determine whether this order is final, urgent, and important, because it is clearly not separable in the manner contemplated by the collateral order doctrine. For an order to be collateral, it must not be \"enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action.\" Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 468-69 (1978) (quoting Mercantile Nat'l Bank v. Langdeau, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106522\"><a href=\"/opinion/106522/mercantile-nat-bank-at-dallas-v-langdeau/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 558 (1963)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court order dismissing the claims for injunctive relief was dependent on the court's evaluation of the factual basis for a claim of unconstitutional discrimination, as well as the application of standing jurisprudence to those facts. Moreover, a partial grant of a motion to dismiss simply is not the sort of order that falls within the collateral order bailiwick -- a category whose usual members include orders denying security in derivative suits, bail determinations, orders requiring plaintiffs to identify themselves, and orders granting disqualification of the trial judge -- decisions which in no way go to the merits of the underlying claim. See generally 15A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3911.2 (3d ed. 1992) (discussing scope of the collateral order doctrine). In short, this order is a decision on the merits, not on an issue collateral to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also suggest that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the \"pragmatic finality\" doctrine, which they understand as allowing this Court to premise its jurisdiction on an ad hoc balancing of \"the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review and the danger that delay will create an injustice.\" Gillespie v. U.S. Steel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106943\"><a href=\"/opinion/106943/gillespie-v-united-states-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1964). However, the Supreme Court has since substantially limited the reach of Gillespie and condemned a broad balancing approach to questions of finality. See Johnson v. Jones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 315 (1995) (\"[W]e do not now in each individual case engage in ad hoc balancing to decide issues of appealability\"). Numerous courts have agreed that Gillespie, in itself, does not provide appellate review unless another exception to the final judgment rule is available. See, e.g., Kmart Corp. v. Aronds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"12986\"><a href=\"/opinion/12986/kmart-corp-v-aronds/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span>, 300 (5th Cir. 1997) (no longer recognizing the exception); Green v. Dep't of Commerce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"376814\"><a href=\"/opinion/376814/mark-green-and-corporate-accountability-research-group-v-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 841 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (\"No federal appellate court, to our knowledge, has ever followed the Gillespie dictum in a case in which the appeal could not be justified on the basis of some other, narrower, policy demanding deviation from the finality rule.\"). Apart from established exceptions, this Court has indicated that appellate jurisdiction does not exist in the absence of finality, and that cases in the \"twilight zone\" of finality, such as Gillespie, are only addressable via mandamus upon a showing of palpable error and irreparable harm. Petralia v. AT&amp;T Global Info. Solutions Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197420\"><a href=\"/opinion/197420/petralia-v-att-global/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 354 (1st Cir. 1997). We have already noted the lack of serious harm or manifest injustice in delaying appeal here until a final judgment has issued; the pragmatic finality doctrine, if it still survives, does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have no jurisdiction pursuant to &#167; 1292(a)(1), and no exception to the final judgment rule applies, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Some time after the decision underlying this appeal had issued, this Court granted a writ of mandamus to recuse the district judge, based on an appearance of partiality stemming from that judge's public comments. Boston's Children First v. City of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199261\"><a href=\"/opinion/199261/bostons-children-v-city-of-boston-et/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2001), amended on denial of reh'g, -- F.3d --, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">274467</span></span> (1st Cir. Mar. 2, 2001). We asked both parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether that grant of mandamus required us to vacate the decision underlying this appeal. Both parties argued that it did not, because the appealed-from order predated the events giving rise to the writ. We agree. See Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112106\"><a href=\"/opinion/112106/liljeberg-v-health-services-acquisition-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 864 (1988) (scope of recusal remedy is complex and fact-dependent); In re Allied-Signal Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533780\"><a href=\"/opinion/533780/in-re-allied-signal-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 973 (1st Cir. 1989) (lack of actual bias made it unnecessary to vacate rulings made prior to mandated recusal); In re Sch.
