Herbert Plympton was convicted after a jury\r                           \r\n\ntrial  of three counts of possession and concealment of goods\r\n\nstolen from  interstate commerce and sentenced  to 41 months'\r\n\nimprisonment  and  restitution  totaling  $444,231.69.    The\r\n\nconvictions and  sentence were submitted  to this court  in a\r\n\nseparate appeal.  United States v. Black, No. 94-1852.  \r                                                    \r\n\n     On April  18, 1995,  Plympton's attorney filed  a motion\r\n\nrequesting that  $35,000  bail, posted  following  Plympton's\r\n\narraignment  in 1993, be returned to one George Gotauco.  The\r\n\ngovernment  objected  and filed  a motion  to apply  the bail\r\n\nfunds toward  the  outstanding assessment,  restitution,  and\r\n\nfine pursuant  to 28 U.S.C.    2044.  The  district court, on\r\n\nJuly  12,  1995,  denied  Gotauco's motion  and  granted  the\r\n\ngovernment's motion. \r\n\n     Because 28 U.S.C.    2044, by its terms, does  not apply\r\n\n\"to any  third party  surety,\" the  central issue before  the\r\n\ndistrict court  was whether there was  sufficient evidence to\r\n\nestablish  that Gotauco was a bona fide surety.  The district\r\n\ncourt held that he was not.  On appeal, the government argues\r\n\nthat  we need  not reach  this question--which  presents some\r\n\ndifficult interpretive problems--and urges us to dismiss this\r\n\nappeal  because  the appellant,  Plympton, lacks  standing to\r\n\npress for the return of the bail funds to Gotauco.  \r\n\n     The standing  issue is itself  difficult:   There is  an\r\n\nargument  that  Plympton  himself  has standing  but  also  a\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nproffered counter  argument by  the government; and  there is\r\n\nalso  a possibility that,  on a proper  motion, Gotauco might\r\n\nhave urged that he  be substituted as the appellant  in place\r\n\nof Plympton who did file a timely notice of appeal.   Because\r\n\nof  the complexity  of  the issues,  we  issued an  order  on\r\n\nJanuary 16, 1996, requesting the parties to file supplemental\r\n\nmemoranda addressed both to merits and standing issues.\r\n\n     The government filed  a timely response, but  Plympton's\r\n\ncounsel did  not do  so; the  Clerk's  Office then  contacted\r\n\nPlympton's  counsel who  promised  that the  overdue response\r\n\nwould be  filed not later than February 19, 1996.  A week has\r\n\nnow  passed, and  no response  has been  filed.   The present\r\n\nappeal is  dismissed for  want  of prosecution.
