Andrews,        the    resort's       president,        of\n\ndischarging      Feliciano     because      of    her      Puerto    Rican     national\n\norigin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17 (\"Title VII\"). 1                                  The\n\ndistrict    court       granted    the   defendants'           motion    for    summary\n\njudgment.     We affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            In     late    1993,     Feliciano          went    to      work    for     El\n\nConquistador as the credit manager at the soon-to-be-opened\n\nhotel in Fajardo, Puerto Rico.                   According to Feliciano, her\n\nresponsibilities included: (1) reviewing and approving credit or\n\nbilling authorizations for commercial accounts; (2) preparing\n\n\n    1Feliciano was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and the\nparties treat that status as a “national origin” for purposes of\nTitle VII. The district court accepted this terminology. We\nalso accept it for the sake of convenience, without in any way\ndeciding the underlying status question. See Mulero-Rodriguez\nv. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 674 (1st Cir. 1996) (assuming that\nPuerto Rican was a national origin for the purposes of a Title\nVII disparate treatment claim); see also De la Concha v. Fordham\nUniv., 5 F. Supp. 2d 188, 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (same); Cartagena\nv. Ogden Servs. Corp., 995 F. Supp. 459, 464 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)\n(same).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fend-of-the-month \"aging reports\" summarizing accounts receivable\n\nor debts that had not yet been collected; (3) training other\n\nemployees; (4) attending pre-convention meetings; (5) helping\n\nthe assistant controller with the monthly closing of accounts\n\nreceivable; and (6) assisting the general cashier.                         Six months\n\nafter she began the job, El Conquistador increased her salary by\n\n$4,000, ahead of her scheduled performance review.                             Later,\n\nFeliciano received a commendation letter from El Conquistador's\n\npresident, Hugh Andrews, and a \"Pionero Certificate,\" thanking\n\nher for her contributions to the hotel's first-year operations.\n\nJust three days after receiving the Pionero Certificate and\n\nthirteen months after she was hired, however, El Conquistador\n\nabruptly terminated Feliciano's employment, replacing her with\n\na woman from the Philippines.\n\n               Feliciano then initiated this lawsuit, alleging that\n\nEl       Conquistador    fired    her   because   she       was   Puerto    Rican   in\n\nviolation of Title VII, which makes it unlawful for an employer\n\nto \"discharge any individual . . . because of such individual's\n\n.    .    .   national   origin.\"       42   U.S.C.     §    2000e-2(a)(1).         El\n\nConquistador       moved    for    summary     judgment,      asserting      that   it\n\ndischarged Feliciano solely because her job performance failed\n\nto meet its expectations.           Concluding that Feliciano \"failed to\n\nprovide any genuine and material facts directed toward proving\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fan animus of discrimination on the basis of national origin,\"\n\nthe district court granted El Conquistador's motion.                      Feliciano\n\ncontends that the court reached this ruling only because it\n\n\"engaged in impermissible weighing of the evidence and in effect\n\nmade credibility determinations in favor of El Conquistador.\"\n\n            The district court did not explicitly reference in its\n\ndecision    the    McDonnell      Douglas-Burdine-Hicks           burden-shifting\n\nframework    typically      used    in    evaluating      Title    VII    disparate\n\ntreatment    claims.        Nevertheless,        its   focus      on    Feliciano's\n\nevidence of discriminatory animus is consistent with our prior\n\ndecisions in which summary judgment has tended to stand or fall\n\non whether the plaintiff adduced adequate evidence that the\n\nemployer's       stated   reason    for    its   action    was     a    pretext    for\n\nunlawful discrimination.            See, e.g., Thomas v. Eastman Kodak\n\nCo., 183 F.3d 38, 56 (1st Cir. 1999) cert. denied, 120 S.Ct.\n\n1174 (2000); Rodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 181\n\nF.3d 15, 20 (1st Cir. 1999).             Although we add some legal context\n\nand factual analysis to the district court's ruling, we conclude\n\nas the district court did that summary judgment was appropriate.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            We    review    the    district      court's    grant       of   summary\n\njudgment    de    novo,    evaluating      the   record    in     the    light    most\n\nfavorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthe nonmoving party.     See Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98\n\nF.3d 670, 672 (1st Cir. 1996).        We will uphold summary judgment\n\nwhere \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\n\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\n\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).        Even in employment discrimination\n\ncases \"where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at\n\nissue,\" this standard compels summary judgment if the non-moving\n\nparty \"rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable\n\ninferences, and unsupported speculation.\"           Medina-Munoz v. R.J.\n\nReynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nA.    The Burden-Shifting Framework\n\n           Because   Feliciano      produces   no   direct     evidence   of\n\ndiscrimination, we apply the familiar McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-\n\nHicks burden-shifting framework.          See Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle\n\nCaribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 429 (1st Cir. 2000).               The Supreme\n\nCourt's opinion in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n792    (1973),   established   an    allocation     of   the    burden    of\n\nproduction and an order for the presentation of proof in Title\n\nVII    discriminatory-treatment       cases    \"[w]ith    the     goal    of\n\n'progressively . . . sharpen[ing] the inquiry into the elusive\n\nfactual questions of intentional discrimination.'\"              St. Mary's\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fHonor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993) (quoting Texas\n\nDep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255 n.8\n\n(1981)).    The plaintiff \"carr[ies] the initial burden under the\n\nstatute of establishing a prima facie case of [national origin]\n\ndiscrimination.\"      McDonnell     Douglas,   411   U.S.    at   802.    In\n\nemployment termination cases, a plaintiff establishes a prima\n\nfacie case by showing that: (1) the plaintiff is within a\n\nprotected class; (2) she was qualified for, and performing her\n\njob at a level that met the employer's legitimate expectations;\n\n(3) she was nevertheless dismissed; and (4) after her departure,\n\nthe employer sought someone of roughly equivalent qualifications\n\nto perform substantially the same work.          See Mulero-Rodriguez,\n\n98 F.3d at 673; Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d\n\n881, 899 (1st Cir. 1988).       Although El Conquistador suggests in\n\npassing that Feliciano failed to establish a prima facie case,\n\nthe developed argumentation in its brief assumes the existence\n\nof a prima facie case.      We make the same assumption.\n\n           Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the\n\nburden shifts to the employer to articulate some \"legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory     reason\"   for   its   employment      action.      See\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.             \"[T]he defendant must\n\nclearly    set   forth,   through   the   introduction      of    admissible\n\nevidence, reasons for its actions which, if believed by the\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\ftrier    of        fact,     would    support       a    finding       that     unlawful\n\ndiscrimination was not the cause of the employment action.\"\n\nHicks, 509 U.S. at 507 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).\n\n              El    Conquistador       produced         evidence     that     the   hotel\n\nsuffered from a number of financial problems during Feliciano's\n\ntenure as credit manager.             For example, although she stated that\n\nunder ideal circumstances invoices should be mailed to hotel\n\nguests within seven days of checkout, Feliciano admitted in her\n\ndeposition         that    \"it   always    took     more      than   seven    (7)   days,\n\nsometimes several months, sometimes three (3), four (4) months\"\n\nfor   invoices       to    be    mailed.      The    hotel      carried      substantial\n\nuncollected debts, which Feliciano conceded had not reached an\n\n\"acceptable\" level when she was discharged in November 1994.\n\nShe likewise stated that write-offs for bad debts in 1994 were\n\n\"kind of high.\"            Because Feliciano was arguably responsible as\n\ncredit   manager           for   at   least    some      of    these    problems,      El\n\nConquistador easily met its burden of producing a legitimate,\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for its employment action.                           See Ruiz\n\nv Posadas de San Juan Assocs., 124 F.3d 243, 248 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(to rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case, an employer \"need\n\nonly produce enough competent evidence, taken as true, to enable\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fa   rational   factfinder   to   conclude   that   there   existed   a\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action\").\n\n          Once the employer offers a nondiscriminatory reason for\n\nits action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that\n\nthe reason proffered was \"a coverup\" for a \"discriminatory\n\ndecision.\"     McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 805.     At this third\n\nstep in the burden-shifting analysis, \"the         McDonnell Douglas\n\nframework falls by the wayside,\" Mesnick v. General Elec. Co.,\n\n950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir. 1991), because the plaintiff's\n\nburden of producing evidence to rebut the employer's stated\n\nreason for its employment action \"merges with the ultimate\n\nburden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of\n\nintentional discrimination.\" Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256.2         Thus,\n\nwe are left to decide whether Feliciano has met her burden of\n\npersuasion: that is, whether the evidence she offered to show\n\n\n\n     2\n     Our focus on El Conquistador's motive or intent in\ndischarging Feliciano responds to Feliciano's theory of the\ncase--namely, that El Conquistador's decision to fire her was\nmotivated by anti-Puerto-Rican bias. This is not a case, like\nThomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 1999), cert.\ndenied, 120 S.Ct. 1174 (2000), in which the plaintiff alleged\nthat the employer's decision-making process was affected by\ndiscriminatory stereotypes or other types of unconscious\nnational-origin bias.    As we pointed out in Thomas, \"[t]he\nultimate question is whether the employee has been treated\ndisparately 'because of [national origin].'        This is so\nregardless of whether the employer consciously intended to base\nthe evaluations on [national origin], or simply did so because\nof unthinking stereotypes or bias.\" Id. at 58.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthat El Conquistador discharged her because she is Puerto Rican\n\ncreated a genuine dispute as to material fact.\n\nB.   Pretext and Discriminatory Animus\n\n               It is the settled law of this circuit that to survive\n\na motion for summary judgment on a Title VII disparate treatment\n\nclaim,     a    plaintiff       must   produce       evidence        that:     (1)   the\n\nemployer's articulated reason for laying off the plaintiff is a\n\npretext; and (2) the true reason is discriminatory animus.                           See\n\nThomas, 183 F.3d at 56.           This standard is sometimes described as\n\na    \"pretext-plus\"           standard,    in    contrast       to      the    standard\n\napplicable in those jurisdictions in which evidence of pretext\n\nwithout    more    is    sufficient       to    defeat    a    motion    for    summary\n\njudgment.         See id. at 56-57.             The \"pretext-plus\" standard,\n\nhowever,       \"does    not    necessarily      require       the   introduction      of\n\nadditional evidence beyond that required to show pretext.\"                           Id.\n\nat 57 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).                              The\n\nsame evidence used to show pretext can support a finding of\n\ndiscriminatory animus if it enables a                factfinder \"reasonably to\n\ninfer that unlawful discrimination was a determinative factor in\n\nthe adverse employment action.\"                Id.   (internal quotation marks\n\nand citations omitted).           There is simply \"no mechanical formula\"\n\nfor determining whether the plaintiff's evidence of pretext and\n\ndiscriminatory animus suffices to forestall summary judgment.\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fSee id.        In evaluating whether summary judgment was proper,\n\ntherefore, we must weigh all the circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscrimination, including the strength of the plaintiff's prima\n\nfacie case and the employer's proffered reasons for its action,\n\nmindful that \"everything depends on individual facts.\" Id.\n\n           We      consider      first    Feliciano's      attack     on    El\n\nConquistador's declaration that it discharged her because she\n\nwas not adequately performing her job.            In evaluating whether El\n\nConquistador's stated reason for firing her was pretextual, the\n\nquestion is not whether Feliciano was actually performing below\n\nexpectations, but whether El Conquistador believed that she was.\n\nSee Mulero-Rodriguez, 98 F.3d at 674; Goldman v. First National\n\nBank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1118 (1st Cir. 1993).                  To show\n\nthat El Conquistador did not believe that her job performance\n\nwas   unsatisfactory,         Feliciano     offered   evidence      that   the\n\nfinancial problems at the hotel were not her fault, and that El\n\nConquistador had indicated to her that she was doing a good job.\n\nAccording to Feliciano, the hotel's financial problems were\n\ncaused by an inexperienced and improperly trained hotel staff,\n\na   bug   in    the   computer   system,     a   failure   of   the   finance\n\ndepartment to obtain \"spec sheets\" for group activities and\n\nbanquets that presumably would have facilitated timely billing,\n\nand a failure to provide backups for the banquet checks.                   She\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fcontended that the hotel ignored her requests to hire additional\n\nbilling coordinators and hotel staff to help improve billing.\n\nShe maintained that the high percentage of bad checks and aging\n\naccounts receivable were attributable to the resort's group\n\ncontract      policies      rather    than        her    performance.          Finally,\n\nFeliciano     cited    her    salary       raise,       commendation      letter,    and\n\nPionero Certificate, as further evidence that El Conquistador\n\ndid    not        believe    that         she     was      performing          her   job\n\nunsatisfactorily.\n\n             El    Conquistador      counters       that,       because    the    $4,000\n\nsalary increase was a routine adjustment, not a merit-based\n\nraise, which came seven months before Feliciano's termination,\n\nit proves nothing about the hotel's view of the adequacy of\n\nFeliciano's        performance       at    the     time    she    was     fired.      El\n\nConquistador insists that the letter of commendation and the\n\nPionero      Certificate      did    not       demonstrate       that     it   believed\n\nFeliciano was performing satisfactorily because they expressed\n\nno    individualized        praise        of    Feliciano,       but    only     generic\n\nrecognition sent to numerous hotel employees.                      It also disputes\n\nher   explanation      of    the     reasons       for    the    hotel's       financial\n\nproblems.\n\n             We agree with Feliciano that, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorably to her, her explanations of the hotel's problems,\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fcoupled with the salary raise and commendations, would permit a\n\nreasonable trier of fact to infer that El Conquistador did not\n\nactually      believe    that     Feliciano     was   doing    her    job   poorly.\n\nAlthough Feliciano undoubtedly had responsibility as credit\n\nmanager for many of the areas in which the hotel suffered\n\nfinancial problems--e.g., uncollected debts, aging accounts,\n\nuntimely billing--her explanations of these problems, if true,\n\nmight    absolve       her   of    blame.       For   example,       it   would   be\n\nunreasonable      to    hold      her   responsible    for     a   malfunctioning\n\ncomputer system, a failure of the banquet staff to deliver \"spec\n\nsheets,\" a hotel's general policies regarding group contracts,\n\nor a failure of the hotel to hire adequate staff to keep pace\n\nwith billing.      Moreover, although Feliciano acknowledged that\n\nher     job   included       training     other   employees,         it   would   be\n\nunreasonable to assume that this meant training all of the\n\nemployees implicated in the numerous problems she described.\n\n              It is also reasonable to infer that El Conquistador\n\nwould not have sent Feliciano even generic commendations if it\n\nwere truly dissatisfied with her job performance and that the\n\ncompany would have formally communicated its dissatisfaction in\n\nsome way before terminating her employment.                   In short, although\n\nthe evidence of pretext is thin and disputed, Feliciano survives\n\nsummary judgment on that issue because a reasonable trier of\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\ffact    could   find       that   El   Conquistador         did   not    believe   that\n\nFeliciano's job performance was unsatisfactory, and hence fired\n\nher for some other reason.\n\n            In this case, however, the evidence of pretext only\n\nsuggests    that      El    Conquistador           fired    her   for     some   reason\n\nunrelated to performance.              It does not shed any light on what El\n\nConquistador's true reason for firing her was, let alone show\n\nthat the reason was discrimination based on Feliciano's Puerto\n\nRican origin.         Indeed, even if a rational trier of fact could\n\ninfer    from   the    evidence        of    pretext       that   El    Conquistador's\n\ndecision to fire Feliciano was \"unfair\" (because she continued\n\nto perform her job well), that proof is not sufficient to state\n\na claim under Title VII.               See Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc.,\n\n40 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1994).                    Title VII was not designed to\n\ntransform courts into \"super personnel departments, assessing\n\nthe     merits--or           even      the         rationality--of          employers'\n\nnondiscriminatory business decisions.\"                       Mesnick, 950 F.2d at\n\n825.    To obtain relief under Title VII, the evidence must permit\n\na factfinder reasonably to infer that unlawful discrimination\n\nwas a determinative factor in the employer's decision.                              See\n\nThomas, 183 F.3d at 57.                 Although \"[e]vidence of [national\n\norigin] animus need not be of the smoking gun variety, . . . the\n\ntotality of the circumstances must permit a reasonable inference\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fthat the employer's justification for the challenged action was\n\na pretext for . . . discrimination.\"         Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1119\n\n(emphasis    added)     (internal    quotation    marks     and   citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            As proof of discrimination, Feliciano argues: (1) that\n\nprior to her termination there were other Puerto Rican employees\n\nat her same level in El Conquistador's finance department who\n\n\"were   replaced   by    Americans    or   foreigners”; 3   (2)   that    El\n\nConquistador's executive committee was \"comprised entirely of\n\nnon-Puerto Ricans”; (3) that her replacement, a Filipino woman,\n\nwas hired prior to her termination; and (4) that these facts\n\nmake this case indistinguishable from our decision in Olivera v.\n\nNestle Puerto Rico, Inc., 922 F.2d 43 (1st Cir. 1990), a case in\n\nwhich we reversed the entry of summary judgment after finding\n\nsufficient    evidence    of   discriminatory     animus     (there,     age\n\ndiscrimination), see id. at 49-50.\n\n\n\n\n    3 Feliciano insists that, with respect to the Puerto Rican\nemployees dismissed from El Conquistador's finance department,\nEl Conquistador failed to comply with her request for production\nof personnel files. Feliciano does not, however, challenge any\ndiscovery rulings in this appeal.       Even if she had, such\narguments would be waived because Feliciano failed to raise them\nin the district court.     See Higgins v. New Balance Athletic\nShoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 258 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating that the\ncourt of appeals will not reverse an order granting summary\njudgment on the basis of arguments not made in the trial court).\n\n                                    -14-\n\f            More     specifically,      Feliciano       claimed     that     El\n\nConquistador       terminated   \"Messrs.   Guzmán,      Arenas    and   Rivera\n\n[Aponte],     all     Puerto    Rican   nationals       who    were     former\n\nConquistador finance department employees,\" and replaced them\n\nwith   non-Puerto     Ricans.     The   record   does    not   support     this\n\nassertion.     Feliciano testified in her deposition that, at the\n\ntime she left El Conquistador, Mr. Guzmán was still working with\n\nthe company.       Feliciano said that she became        aware that Guzmán\n\nwas asked to resign when he told her so, but she produced no\n\nadmissible evidence to confirm this hearsay.               She stated that\n\nshe did not know \"for a fact\" whether Rivera Aponte was asked to\n\nresign.   She did not think that Arenas was terminated.                 Rather,\n\nshe thought that he had retired from the company.\n\n            Feliciano's allegation that El Conquistador's executive\n\ncommittee was comprised entirely of non-Puerto Ricans is equally\n\nflawed.     In November 1994, the committee had two Puerto Rican\n\nmembers; in October 1998 three Puerto Ricans sat on that body.\n\nIndeed, at various times the executive committee had members\n\nfrom the United States, Sweden, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Mexico,\n\nColombia, India, as well as Puerto Rico.                Likewise, the fact\n\nthat Feliciano's replacement was a recent company hire provides\n\nno evidence of discriminatory animus.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f            There are crucial differences between this case and the\n\nOlivera age discrimination case relied upon by Feliciano.                                 In\n\nOlivera, we concluded that \"the employer's articulated reasons\n\nfor its action [of discharging the plaintiff] were convincingly\n\nrefuted.\"        Id. at 49 (emphasis added).                  There, the plaintiff\n\nproduced evidence that of eight people fired as part of a\n\nreorganization, four or five of them were over forty and all but\n\none were replaced within two years by persons under thirty.                              See\n\nid.     Moreover, the employer \"had told plaintiff more than once\n\nthat     '[he]     had    to       get    rid     of     several       of   [plaintiff's]\n\nsubordinates because they were not performing according to his\n\nopinion up to standards because of their age.'\" Id.                               Finally,\n\nthe employer offered a retirement inducement package aimed at\n\nemployees over fifty-eight.                    See id.\n\n            Here, Feliciano offers no evidence that El Conquistador\n\nfired    Puerto     Ricans         in    greater       proportion       than    non-Puerto\n\nRicans,    engaged        in   a    pattern       of     firing    Puerto       Ricans   and\n\nreplacing them with non-Puerto Ricans, or adopted corporate\n\npolicies discriminatory toward Puerto Ricans.                                There is no\n\nevidence of         statements by El Conquistador's management or\n\nofficers    indicating         a        bias    against    Puerto       Ricans,    and    no\n\nevidence that El Conquistador's evaluation of her performance\n\nwas     infected     by    stereotyped            thinking        or    other    types   of\n\n\n                                               -16-\n\funconscious national-origin bias.     Thus, if we remanded for\n\ntrial, the jury \"would be left to guess at the reasons behind\n\nthe pretext.\"   Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896\n\nF.2d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 199o).   Under such circumstances, summary\n\njudgment is proper.    See Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., 99 F.3d\n\n456, 467-68 (1st Cir. 1996) (upholding summary judgment where\n\n\"[s]ubmitting the issue of discriminatory intent to a jury on\n\nthis record would amount to nothing more than an invitation to\n\nspeculate\"); see also Connell v. Bank of Boston, 924 F.2d 1169,\n\n1178 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[T]he question is not whether there is\n\nliterally no evidence favoring the non-movant, but whether there\n\nis any upon which a jury could properly proceed to find a\n\nverdict in that party's favor.\") (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).4\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    4The district court also granted summary judgment in favor\nof the defendants on claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§\n1981, 1983, and 1985.    The appellants do not challenge the\ndismissal of any of these claims on appeal.\n\n                              -17-\n\f",

Feliciano de la Cruz, Erasmo Jimenez, and their conjugal partnership, brought a claim in the district court for the district of Puerto Rico accusing El Conquistador Resort and Country Club, a resort hotel located on the east coast of Puerto Rico, and Hugh A. Andrews, the resort's president, of discharging Feliciano because of her Puerto Rican national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-17 (\"Title VII\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1993, Feliciano went to work for El Conquistador as the credit manager at the soon-to-be-opened hotel in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. According to Feliciano, her responsibilities included: (1) reviewing and approving credit or billing authorizations for commercial accounts; (2) preparing end-of-the-month \"aging reports\" summarizing accounts receivable or debts that had not yet been collected; (3) training other employees; (4) attending pre-convention meetings; (5) helping the assistant controller with the monthly closing of accounts receivable; and (6) assisting the general cashier. Six months after she began the job, El Conquistador increased her salary by $4,000, ahead of her scheduled performance review. Later, Feliciano received a commendation letter from El Conquistador's president, Hugh Andrews, and a \"Pionero Certificate,\" thanking her for her contributions to the hotel's first-year operations. Just three days after receiving the Pionero Certificate and thirteen months after she was hired, however, El Conquistador abruptly terminated Feliciano's employment, replacing her with a woman from the Philippines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliciano then initiated this lawsuit, alleging that El Conquistador fired her because she was Puerto Rican in violation of Title VII, which makes it unlawful for an employer to \"discharge any individual... because of such individual's... national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1). El Conquistador moved for summary judgment, asserting that it discharged Feliciano solely because her job performance failed to meet its expectations. Concluding that Feliciano \"failed to provide any genuine and material facts directed toward proving an animus of discrimination on the basis of national origin,\" the district court granted El Conquistador's motion. Feliciano contends that the court reached this ruling only because it \"engaged in impermissible weighing of the evidence and in effect made credibility determinations in favor of El Conquistador.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not explicitly reference in its decision the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks burden-shifting framework typically used in evaluating Title VII disparate treatment claims. Nevertheless, its focus on Feliciano's evidence of discriminatory animus is consistent with our prior decisions in which summary judgment has tended to stand or fall on whether the plaintiff adduced adequate evidence that the employer's stated reason for its action was a pretext for unlawful discrimination. See, e.g., Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 56 (1st Cir. 1999) cert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 1174 (2000); Rodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 181 F.3d 15, 20 (1st Cir. 1999). Although we add some legal context and factual analysis to the district court's ruling, we conclude as the district court did that summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, evaluating the record in the light most favorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party. See Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 672 (1st Cir. 1996). We will uphold summary judgment where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Even in employment discrimination cases \"where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue,\" this standard compels summary judgment if the non-moving party \"rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Burden-Shifting Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Feliciano produces no direct evidence of discrimination, we apply the familiar McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks burden-shifting framework. See Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 429 (1st Cir. 2000). The Supreme Court's opinion in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), established an allocation of the burden of production and an order for the presentation of proof in Title VII discriminatory-treatment cases \"[w]ith the goal of 'progressively... sharpen[ing] the inquiry into the elusive factual questions of intentional discrimination.'\" St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993) (quoting Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255 n.8 (1981)). The plaintiff \"carr[ies] the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of [national origin] discrimination.\" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. In employment termination cases, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that: (1) the plaintiff is within a protected class; (2) she was qualified for, and performing her job at a level that met the employer's legitimate expectations; (3) she was nevertheless dismissed; and (4) after her departure, the employer sought someone of roughly equivalent qualifications to perform substantially the same work. See Mulero-Rodriguez, 98 F.3d at 673; Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 899 (1st Cir. 1988). Although El Conquistador suggests in passing that Feliciano failed to establish a prima facie case, the developed argumentation in its brief assumes the existence of a prima facie case. We make the same assumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for its employment action. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. \"[T]he defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, reasons for its actions which, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action.\" Hicks, 509 U.S. at 507 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">El Conquistador produced evidence that the hotel suffered from a number of financial problems during Feliciano's tenure as credit manager. For example, although she stated that under ideal circumstances invoices should be mailed to hotel guests within seven days of checkout, Feliciano admitted in her deposition that \"it always took more than seven (7) days, sometimes several months, sometimes three (3), four (4) months\" for invoices to be mailed. The hotel carried substantial uncollected debts, which Feliciano conceded had not reached an \"acceptable\" level when she was discharged in November 1994. She likewise stated that write-offs for bad debts in 1994 were \"kind of high.\" Because Feliciano was arguably responsible as credit manager for at least some of these problems, El Conquistador easily met its burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment action. See Ruiz v Posadas de San Juan Assocs., 124 F.3d 243, 248 (1st Cir. 1999) (to rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case, an employer \"need only produce enough competent evidence, taken as true, to enable a rational factfinder to conclude that there existed a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the employer offers a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the reason proffered was \"a coverup\" for a \"discriminatory decision.\" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 805. At this third step in the burden-shifting analysis, \"the McDonnell Douglas framework falls by the wayside,\" Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir. 1991), because the plaintiff's burden of producing evidence to rebut the employer's stated reason for its employment action \"merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination.\" Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, we are left to decide whether Feliciano has met her burden of persuasion: that is, whether the evidence she offered to show that El Conquistador discharged her because she is Puerto Rican created a genuine dispute as to material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Pretext and Discriminatory Animus</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the settled law of this circuit that to survive a motion for summary judgment on a Title VII disparate treatment claim, a plaintiff must produce evidence that: (1) the employer's articulated reason for laying off the plaintiff is a pretext; and (2) the true reason is discriminatory animus. See Thomas, 183 F.3d at 56. This standard is sometimes described as a \"pretext-plus\" standard, in contrast to the standard applicable in those jurisdictions in which evidence of pretext without more is sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. See id. at 56-57. The \"pretext-plus\" standard, however, \"does not necessarily require the introduction of additional evidence beyond that required to show pretext.\" Id. at 57 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The same evidence used to show pretext can support a finding of discriminatory animus if it enables a factfinder \"reasonably to infer that unlawful discrimination was a determinative factor in the adverse employment action.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). There is simply \"no mechanical formula\" for determining whether the plaintiff's evidence of pretext and discriminatory animus suffices to forestall summary judgment. See id. In evaluating whether summary judgment was proper, therefore, we must weigh all the circumstantial evidence of discrimination, including the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case and the employer's proffered reasons for its action, mindful that \"everything depends on individual facts.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider first Feliciano's attack on El Conquistador's declaration that it discharged her because she was not adequately performing her job. In evaluating whether El Conquistador's stated reason for firing her was pretextual, the question is not whether Feliciano was actually performing below expectations, but whether El Conquistador believed that she was. See Mulero-Rodriguez, 98 F.3d at 674; Goldman v. First National Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1118 (1st Cir. 1993). To show that El Conquistador did not believe that her job performance was unsatisfactory, Feliciano offered evidence that the financial problems at the hotel were not her fault, and that El Conquistador had indicated to her that she was doing a good job. According to Feliciano, the hotel's financial problems were caused by an inexperienced and improperly trained hotel staff, a bug in the computer system, a failure of the finance department to obtain \"spec sheets\" for group activities and banquets that presumably would have facilitated timely billing, and a failure to provide backups for the banquet checks. She contended that the hotel ignored her requests to hire additional billing coordinators and hotel staff to help improve billing. She maintained that the high percentage of bad checks and aging accounts receivable were attributable to the resort's group contract policies rather than her performance. Finally, Feliciano cited her salary raise, commendation letter, and Pionero Certificate, as further evidence that El Conquistador did not believe that she was performing her job unsatisfactorily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">El Conquistador counters that, because the $4,000 salary increase was a routine adjustment, not a merit-based raise, which came seven months before Feliciano's termination, it proves nothing about the hotel's view of the adequacy of Feliciano's performance at the time she was fired. El Conquistador insists that the letter of commendation and the Pionero Certificate did not demonstrate that it believed Feliciano was performing satisfactorily because they expressed no individualized praise of Feliciano, but only generic recognition sent to numerous hotel employees. It also disputes her explanation of the reasons for the hotel's financial problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Feliciano that, viewed in the light most favorably to her, her explanations of the hotel's problems, coupled with the salary raise and commendations, would permit a reasonable trier of fact to infer that El Conquistador did not actually believe that Feliciano was doing her job poorly. Although Feliciano undoubtedly had responsibility as credit manager for many of the areas in which the hotel suffered financial problems--e.g., uncollected debts, aging accounts, untimely billing--her explanations of these problems, if true, might absolve her of blame. For example, it would be unreasonable to hold her responsible for a malfunctioning computer system, a failure of the banquet staff to deliver \"spec sheets,\" a hotel's general policies regarding group contracts, or a failure of the hotel to hire adequate staff to keep pace with billing. Moreover, although Feliciano acknowledged that her job included training other employees, it would be unreasonable to assume that this meant training all of the employees implicated in the numerous problems she described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also reasonable to infer that El Conquistador would not have sent Feliciano even generic commendations if it were truly dissatisfied with her job performance and that the company would have formally communicated its dissatisfaction in some way before terminating her employment. In short, although the evidence of pretext is thin and disputed, Feliciano survives summary judgment on that issue because a reasonable trier of fact could find that El Conquistador did not believe that Feliciano's job performance was unsatisfactory, and hence fired her for some other reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, the evidence of pretext only suggests that El Conquistador fired her for some reason unrelated to performance. It does not shed any light on what El Conquistador's true reason for firing her was, let alone show that the reason was discrimination based on Feliciano's Puerto Rican origin. Indeed, even if a rational trier of fact could infer from the evidence of pretext that El Conquistador's decision to fire Feliciano was \"unfair\" (because she continued to perform her job well), that proof is not sufficient to state a claim under Title VII. See Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1994). Title VII was not designed to transform courts into \"super personnel departments, assessing the merits--or even the rationality--of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\" Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825. To obtain relief under Title VII, the evidence must permit a factfinder reasonably to infer that unlawful discrimination was a determinative factor in the employer's decision. See Thomas, 183 F.3d at 57. Although \"[e]vidence of [national origin] animus need not be of the smoking gun variety,... the totality of the circumstances must permit a reasonable inference that the employer's justification for the challenged action was a pretext for... discrimination.\" Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1119 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As proof of discrimination, Feliciano argues: (1) that prior to her termination there were other Puerto Rican employees at her same level in El Conquistador's finance department who \"were replaced by Americans or foreigners\";<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (2) that El Conquistador's executive committee was \"comprised entirely of non-Puerto Ricans\"; (3) that her replacement, a Filipino woman, was hired prior to her termination; and (4) that these facts make this case indistinguishable from our decision in Olivera v. Nestle Puerto Rico, Inc., 922 F.2d 43 (1st Cir. 1990), a case in which we reversed the entry of summary judgment after finding sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus (there, age discrimination), see id. at 49-50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, Feliciano claimed that El Conquistador terminated \"Messrs. Guzman, Arenas and Rivera [Aponte], all Puerto Rican nationals who were former Conquistador finance department employees,\" and replaced them with non-Puerto Ricans. The record does not support this assertion. Feliciano testified in her deposition that, at the time she left El Conquistador, Mr. Guzman was still working with the company. Feliciano said that she became aware that Guzman was asked to resign when he told her so, but she produced no admissible evidence to confirm this hearsay. She stated that she did not know \"for a fact\" whether Rivera Aponte was asked to resign. She did not think that Arenas was terminated. Rather, she thought that he had retired from the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliciano's allegation that El Conquistador's executive committee was comprised entirely of non-Puerto Ricans is equally flawed. In November 1994, the committee had two Puerto Rican members; in October 1998 three Puerto Ricans sat on that body. Indeed, at various times the executive committee had members from theUnited States, Sweden, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Mexico, Colombia, India, as well as Puerto Rico. Likewise, the fact that Feliciano's replacement was a recent company hire provides no evidence of discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are crucial differences between this case and the Olivera age discrimination case relied upon by Feliciano. In Olivera, we concluded that \"the employer's articulated reasons for its action [of discharging the plaintiff] were convincingly refuted.\" Id. at 49 (emphasis added). There, the plaintiff produced evidence that of eight people fired as part of a reorganization, four or five of them were over forty and all but one were replaced within two years by persons under thirty. See id. Moreover, the employer \"had told plaintiff more than once that '[he] had to get rid of several of [plaintiff's] subordinates because they were not performing according to his opinion up to standards because of their age.'\" Id. Finally, the employer offered a retirement inducement package aimed at employees over fifty-eight. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Feliciano offers no evidence that El Conquistador fired Puerto Ricans in greater proportion than non-Puerto Ricans, engaged in a pattern of firing Puerto Ricans and replacing them with non-Puerto Ricans, or adopted corporate policies discriminatory toward Puerto Ricans. There is no evidence of statements by El Conquistador's management or officers indicating a bias against Puerto Ricans, and no evidence that El Conquistador's evaluation of her performance was infected by stereotyped thinking or other types of unconscious national-origin bias. Thus, if we remanded for trial, the jury \"would be left to guess at the reasons behind the pretext.\" Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 199o). Under such circumstances, summary judgment is proper. See Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., 99 F.3d 456, 467-68 (1st Cir. 1996) (upholding summary judgment where \"[s]ubmitting the issue of discriminatory intent to a jury on this record would amount to nothing more than an invitation to speculate\"); see also Connell v. Bank of Boston, 924 F.2d 1169, 1178 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[T]he question is not whether there is literally no evidence favoring the non-movant, but whether there is any upon which a jury could properly proceed to find a verdict in that party's favor.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Chief Judge Juan R.

This is not a case, like Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 1174 (2000), in which the plaintiff alleged that the employer's decision-making process was affected by discriminatory stereotypes or other types of unconscious national-origin bias. As we pointed out in Thomas, \"[t]he ultimate question is whether the employee has been treated disparately 'because of [national origin].' This is so regardless of whether the employer consciously intended to base the evaluations on [national origin], or simply did so because of unthinking stereotypes or bias.\" Id. at 58.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  Feliciano insists that, with respect to the Puerto Rican employees dismissed from El Conquistador's finance department, El Conquistador failed to comply with her request for production of personnel files.

El Conquistador, 2000 WL 709928, No. 99-1810 (1st Cir. June 6, 2000) (evaluating employment discrimination claim under Title VII), is contrary to the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 120 S. Ct. 2097 (2000) (evaluating claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act). In Reeves, the Supreme Court said it was resolving the conflict between the Courts of Appeals \"as to whether a plaintiff's prima facie case of discrimination..., combined with sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to reject the employer's nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision, is adequate to sustain liability for intentional discrimination.\" Id. at 2104. In some circuits a plaintiff's evidence of a prima facie case and pretext, without more, was adequate to get to the jury on a discrimination claim; in others, there was a requirement that the plaintiff produce additional evidence that the employer acted with discriminatory animus. See id. at 2104-05. The Court placed the First Circuit in the latter group, see id. (citing Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255 (1st Cir. 1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although our prior use of the label, \"pretext plus,\" may have resulted in a misunderstanding about the proof required to state a discrimination claim in this circuit, we have been careful to explain that the phrase did not mean that the plaintiff always must present evidence beyond the proof of pretext in order to establish discrimination. In both Woods and Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., we emphatically said that this is not the case. See Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 57 (1st Cir. 1999) cert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 1174 (2000) (\"Although it uses the label 'plus,' the First Circuit's 'pretext plus' standard does not necessarily require the introduction of additional evidence beyond that required to show pretext.\")(internal quotation marks omitted); Woods, 30 F.3d 255, at 260 n.3 (\"[S]ome cases exist where a prima facie case and the disbelief of a pretext could provide a strong enough inference of actual discrimination to permit the fact-finder to find for the plaintiff.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our precedents are consistent with Reeves, and our application of those precedents in the case at hand was consistent with Reeves. We explained that Feliciano was not required to show any evidence in addition to her evidence of pretext in order to get to the jury. Although we concluded that Feliciano's explanations of her job performance problems generated a triable issue of pretext, we found her evidence of pretext \"thin\" (consisting primarily of her own explanations of why she was unable to perform her job adequately). That evidence did not \"shed any light on what El Conquistador's true reason for firing her was, let alone show that the reason was discrimination based on Feliciano's Puerto Rican origin.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our approach was therefore consistent with Reeves, which makes clear that \"[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\" 120 S. Ct. at 2106. Although the Court emphasized that \"[p]roof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination,... [and that] [i]n appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose,\" it did not announce a rule that a showing of pretext alone always precludes summary judgment in a case alleging intentional discrimination. To the contrary, the Court emphasized that, \"Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors. Those include the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\" Id. at 2109. Our conclusion that Feliciano failed to adduce sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment based on the particular weakness of her case, therefore, is entirely consistent with the Supreme Court's conclusion that the plaintiff in Reeves was entitled to have his claim heard by a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for panel rehearing is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

According to Feliciano, her responsibilities included: (1) reviewing and approving credit or billing authorizations for commercial accounts; (2) preparing end-of-the-month \"aging reports\" summarizing accounts receivable or debts that had not yet been collected; (3) training other employees; (4) attending pre-convention meetings; (5) helping the assistant controller with the monthly closing of accounts receivable; and (6) assisting the general cashier. Six months after she began the job, El Conquistador increased her salary by $4,000, ahead of her scheduled performance review. Later, Feliciano received a commendation letter from El Conquistador's president, Hugh Andrews, and a \"Pionero Certificate,\" thanking her for her contributions to the hotel's first-year operations. Just three days after receiving the Pionero Certificate and thirteen months after she was hired, however, El Conquistador abruptly terminated Feliciano's employment, replacing her with a woman from the Philippines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliciano then initiated this lawsuit, alleging that El Conquistador fired her because she was Puerto Rican in violation of Title VII, which makes it unlawful for an employer to \"discharge any individual... because of such individual's... national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1). El Conquistador moved for summary judgment, asserting that it discharged Feliciano solely because her job performance failed to meet its expectations. Concluding that Feliciano \"failed to provide any genuine and material facts directed toward proving an animus of discrimination on the basis of national origin,\" the district court granted El Conquistador's motion. Feliciano contends that the court reached this ruling only because it \"engaged in impermissible weighing of the evidence and in effect made credibility determinations in favor of El Conquistador.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not explicitly reference in its decision the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine-Hicks burden-shifting framework typically used in evaluating Title VII disparate treatment claims. Nevertheless, its focus on Feliciano's evidence of discriminatory animus is consistent with our prior decisions in which summary judgment has tended to stand or fall on whether the plaintiff adduced adequate evidence that the employer's stated reason for its action was a pretext for unlawful discrimination.

The plaintiff \"carr[ies] the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of [national origin] discrimination.\" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. In employment termination cases, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that: (1) the plaintiff is within a protected class; (2) she was qualified for, and performing her job at a level that met the employer's legitimate expectations; (3) she was nevertheless dismissed; and (4) after her departure, the employer sought someone of roughly equivalent qualifications to perform substantially the same work. See Mulero-Rodriguez, 98 F.3d at 673; Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516408\"><a href=\"/opinion/516408/annabelle-lipsett-v-university-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span>, 899 (1st Cir. 1988). Although El Conquistador suggests in passing that Feliciano failed to establish a prima facie case, the developed argumentation in its brief assumes the existence of a prima facie case. We make the same assumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for its employment action. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. \"[T]he defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, reasons for its actions which, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action.\" Hicks, 509 U.S. at 507 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">El Conquistador produced evidence that the hotel suffered from a number of financial problems during Feliciano's tenure as credit manager. For example, although she stated that under ideal circumstances invoices should be mailed to hotel guests within seven days of checkout, Feliciano admitted in her deposition that \"it always took more than seven (7) days, sometimes several months, sometimes three (3), four (4) months\" for invoices to be mailed. The hotel carried substantial uncollected debts, which Feliciano conceded had not reached an \"acceptable\" level when she was discharged in November 1994. She likewise stated that write-offs for bad debts in 1994 were \"kind of high.\" Because Feliciano was arguably responsible as credit manager for at least some of these problems, El Conquistador easily met its burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment action. See Ruiz v Posadas de San Juan Assocs., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></span>, 248 (1st Cir. 1999) (to rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case, an employer \"need only produce enough competent evidence, taken as true, to enable a rational factfinder to conclude that there existed a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the employer offers a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the reason proffered was \"a coverup\" for a \"discriminatory decision.\" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 805. At this third step in the burden-shifting analysis, \"the McDonnell Douglas framework falls by the wayside,\" Mesnick v. General Elec.

Pretext and Discriminatory Animus</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the settled law of this circuit that to survive a motion for summary judgment on a Title VII disparate treatment claim, a plaintiff must produce evidence that: (1) the employer's articulated reason for laying off the plaintiff is a pretext; and (2) the true reason is discriminatory animus. See Thomas, 183 F.3d at 56. This standard is sometimes described as a \"pretext-plus\" standard, in contrast to the standard applicable in those jurisdictions in which evidence of pretext without more is sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. See id. at 56-57. The \"pretext-plus\" standard, however, \"does not necessarily require the introduction of additional evidence beyond that required to show pretext.\" Id. at 57 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The same evidence used to show pretext can support a finding of discriminatory animus if it enables a factfinder \"reasonably to infer that unlawful discrimination was a determinative factor in the adverse employment action.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). There is simply \"no mechanical formula\" for determining whether the plaintiff's evidence of pretext and discriminatory animus suffices to forestall summary judgment. See id. In evaluating whether summary judgment was proper, therefore, we must weigh all the circumstantial evidence of discrimination, including the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case and the employer's proffered reasons for its action, mindful that \"everything depends on individual facts.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider first Feliciano's attack on El Conquistador's declaration that it discharged her because she was not adequately performing her job. In evaluating whether El Conquistador's stated reason for firing her was pretextual, the question is not whether Feliciano was actually performing below expectations, but whether El Conquistador believed that she was. See Mulero-Rodriguez, 98 F.3d at 674; Goldman v. First National Bank of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600349\"><a href=\"/opinion/600349/robert-goldman-v-first-national-bank-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span>, 1118 (1st Cir. 1993). To show that El Conquistador did not believe that her job performance was unsatisfactory, Feliciano offered evidence that the financial problems at the hotel were not her fault, and that El Conquistador had indicated to her that she was doing a good job. According to Feliciano, the hotel's financial problems were caused by an inexperienced and improperly trained hotel staff, a bug in the computer system, a failure of the finance department to obtain \"spec sheets\" for group activities and banquets that presumably would have facilitated timely billing, and a failure to provide backups for the banquet checks. She contended that the hotel ignored her requests to hire additional billing coordinators and hotel staff to help improve billing. She maintained that the high percentage of bad checks and aging accounts receivable were attributable to the resort's group contract policies rather than her performance. Finally, Feliciano cited her salary raise, commendation letter, and Pionero Certificate, as further evidence that El Conquistador did not believe that she was performing her job unsatisfactorily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">El Conquistador counters that, because the $4,000 salary increase was a routine adjustment, not a merit-based raise, which came seven months before Feliciano's termination, it proves nothing about the hotel's view of the adequacy of Feliciano's performance at the time she was fired. El Conquistador insists that the letter of commendation and the Pionero Certificate did not demonstrate that it believed Feliciano was performing satisfactorily because they expressed no individualized praise of Feliciano, but only generic recognition sent to numerous hotel employees. It also disputes her explanation of the reasons for the hotel's financial problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Feliciano that, viewed in the light most favorably to her, her explanations of the hotel's problems, coupled with the salary raise and commendations, would permit a reasonable trier of fact to infer that El Conquistador did not actually believe that Feliciano was doing her job poorly. Although Feliciano undoubtedly had responsibility as credit manager for many of the areas in which the hotel suffered financial problems--e.g., uncollected debts, aging accounts, untimely billing--her explanations of these problems, if true, might absolve her of blame. For example, it would be unreasonable to hold her responsible for a malfunctioning computer system, a failure of the banquet staff to deliver \"spec sheets,\" a hotel's general policies regarding group contracts, or a failure of the hotel to hire adequate staff to keep pace with billing. Moreover, although Feliciano acknowledged that her job included training other employees, it would be unreasonable to assume that this meant training all of the employees implicated in the numerous problems she described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also reasonable to infer that El Conquistador would not have sent Feliciano even generic commendations if it were truly dissatisfied with her job performance and that the company would have formally communicated its dissatisfaction in some way before terminating her employment. In short, although the evidence of pretext is thin and disputed, Feliciano survives summary judgment on that issue because a reasonable trier of fact could find that El Conquistador did not believe that Feliciano's job performance was unsatisfactory, and hence fired her for some other reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, the evidence of pretext only suggests that El Conquistador fired her for some reason unrelated to performance. It does not shed any light on what El Conquistador's true reason for firing her was, let alone show that the reason was discrimination based on Feliciano's Puerto Rican origin. Indeed, even if a rational trier of fact could infer from the evidence of pretext that El Conquistador's decision to fire Feliciano was \"unfair\" (because she continued to perform her job well), that proof is not sufficient to state a claim under Title VII. See Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195745\"><a href=\"/opinion/195745/smith-v-stratus-computers/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1994). Title VII was not designed to transform courts into \"super personnel departments, assessing the merits--or even the rationality--of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\" Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825. To obtain relief under Title VII, the evidence must permit a factfinder reasonably to infer that unlawful discrimination was a determinative factor in the employer's decision. See Thomas, 183 F.3d at 57. Although \"[e]vidence of [national origin] animus need not be of the smoking gun variety,... the totality of the circumstances must permit a reasonable inference that the employer's justification for the challenged action was a pretext for... discrimination.\" Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1119 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As proof of discrimination, Feliciano argues: (1) that prior to her termination there were other Puerto Rican employees at her same level in El Conquistador's finance department who \"were replaced by Americans or foreigners\";<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (2) that El Conquistador's executive committee was \"comprised entirely of non-Puerto Ricans\"; (3) that her replacement, a Filipino woman, was hired prior to her termination; and (4) that these facts make this case indistinguishable from our decision in Olivera v. Nestle Puerto Rico, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span> (1st Cir. 1990), a case in which we reversed the entry of summary judgment after finding sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus (there, age discrimination), see id. at 49-50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, Feliciano claimed that El Conquistador terminated \"Messrs. Guzman, Arenas and Rivera [Aponte], all Puerto Rican nationals who were former Conquistador finance department employees,\" and replaced them with non-Puerto Ricans. The record does not support this assertion. Feliciano testified in her deposition that, at the time she left El Conquistador, Mr. Guzman was still working with the company. Feliciano said that she became aware that Guzman was asked to resign when he told her so, but she produced no admissible evidence to confirm this hearsay. She stated that she did not know \"for a fact\" whether Rivera Aponte was asked to resign. She did not think that Arenas was terminated. Rather, she thought that he had retired from the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliciano's allegation that El Conquistador's executive committee was comprised entirely of non-Puerto Ricans is equally flawed. In November 1994, the committee had two Puerto Rican members; in October 1998 three Puerto Ricans sat on that body. Indeed, at various times the executive committee had members from theUnited States, Sweden, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Mexico, Colombia, India, as well as Puerto Rico. Likewise, the fact that Feliciano's replacement was a recent company hire provides no evidence of discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are crucial differences between this case and the Olivera age discrimination case relied upon by Feliciano. In Olivera, we concluded that \"the employer's articulated reasons for its action [of discharging the plaintiff] were convincingly refuted.\" Id. at 49 (emphasis added). There, the plaintiff produced evidence that of eight people fired as part of a reorganization, four or five of them were over forty and all but one were replaced within two years by persons under thirty. See id. Moreover, the employer \"had told plaintiff more than once that '[he] had to get rid of several of [plaintiff's] subordinates because they were not performing according to his opinion up to standards because of their age.'\" Id. Finally, the employer offered a retirement inducement package aimed at employees over fifty-eight. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Feliciano offers no evidence that El Conquistador fired Puerto Ricans in greater proportion than non-Puerto Ricans, engaged in a pattern of firing Puerto Ricans and replacing them with non-Puerto Ricans, or adopted corporate policies discriminatory toward Puerto Ricans. There is no evidence of statements by El Conquistador's management or officers indicating a bias against Puerto Ricans, and no evidence that El Conquistador's evaluation of her performance was infected by stereotyped thinking or other types of unconscious national-origin bias. Thus, if we remanded for trial, the jury \"would be left to guess at the reasons behind the pretext.\" Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536516\"><a href=\"/opinion/536516/52-fair-emplpraccas-253-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39659-jose-medina-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 199o).

In Reeves, the Supreme Court said it was resolving the conflict between the Courts of Appeals \"as to whether a plaintiff's prima facie case of discrimination..., combined with sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to reject the employer's nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision, is adequate to sustain liability for intentional discrimination.\" Id. at 2104. In some circuits a plaintiff's evidence of a prima facie case and pretext, without more, was adequate to get to the jury on a discrimination claim; in others, there was a requirement that the plaintiff produce additional evidence that the employer acted with discriminatory animus. See id. at 2104-05. The Court placed the First Circuit in the latter group, see id. (citing Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675091\"><a href=\"/opinion/675091/jimmie-e-woods-v-friction-materials-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although our prior use of the label, \"pretext plus,\" may have resulted in a misunderstanding about the proof required to state a discrimination claim in this circuit, we have been careful to explain that the phrase did not mean that the plaintiff always must present evidence beyond the proof of pretext in order to establish discrimination. In both Woods and Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., we emphatically said that this is not the case. See Thomas v.

We explained that Feliciano was not required to show any evidence in addition to her evidence of pretext in order to get to the jury. Although we concluded that Feliciano's explanations of her job performance problems generated a triable issue of pretext, we found her evidence of pretext \"thin\" (consisting primarily of her own explanations of why she was unable to perform her job adequately). That evidence did not \"shed any light on what El Conquistador's true reason for firing her was, let alone show that the reason was discrimination based on Feliciano's Puerto Rican origin.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our approach was therefore consistent with Reeves, which makes clear that \"[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\" 120 S. Ct. at 2106. Although the Court emphasized that \"[p]roof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination,... [and that] [i]n appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose,\" it did not announce a rule that a showing of pretext alone always precludes summary judgment in a case alleging intentional discrimination. To the contrary, the Court emphasized that, \"Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors. Those include the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\" Id. at 2109. Our conclusion that Feliciano failed to adduce sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment based on the particular weakness of her case, therefore, is entirely consistent with the Supreme Court's conclusion that the plaintiff in Reeves was entitled to have his claim heard by a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for panel rehearing is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
