Jury selection\r                                   \r\n\n     Appellant argues the district court committed reversible\r\n\nerror  when it allowed  the government to  exercise a seventh\r\n\nperemptory  challenge in  violation  of  Rule  24(b)  of  the\r\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\r\n\n     Rule  24(b)  prohibits  granting  additional  peremptory\r\n\nchallenges  to the government.

Thus,  it\r                            \r\n\nwas  error for  the  district judge  to  grant an  additional\r\n\nchallenge to the government.

In that case, the defendants'\r\n\ncounsel  did object to the government's receipt of additional\r\n\nchallenges, yet  counsel did  not state  the grounds  for the\r\n\nobjection or mention Rule 24(b).  Id. at 140.  The court held\r                                                 \r\n\nthat since counsel had not  alerted the district court to the\r\n\nrestrictions of  Rule 24(b),  counsel had  not preserved  the\r\n\nissue for appeal.

She did not cite Rule\r\n\n24(b) or argue  that the court lacked authority  to grant the\r\n\nadditional challenge.   Instead, she only argued  that it was\r\n\n\"unfair.\"    This   is  not  sufficient  under   New  England\r                                                                         \r\n\nEnterprises and Projansky.   The judgment of  conviction will\r                                     \r\n\nbe affirmed.\r\n\n     2.  Sentencing\r                               \r\n\n     Secondly, appellant argues  the district court erred  in\r\n\nfinding he \"used  or possessed\" a firearm in  connection with\r\n\nanother felony (possession  of cocaine with intent  to sell),\r\n\nand so  the court should  not have enhanced his  base offense\r\n\nlevel under U.S.S.G.   2K2.1(b)(5).  \r\n\n     The firearm in question--a loaded, .22 caliber revolver-\r\n\n-was located in defendant's nightstand in the master bedroom.\r\n\nThe  district court's conclusion that the loaded revolver was\r\n\nkept to protect  the cocaine stored in the  house is reviewed\r\n\nfor  clear error.   United States  v. Thompson, 32  F.3d 1, 4\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).  We find none.  It is reasonable to conclude\r\n\nthat the  defendant kept  the revolver  in his  nightstand to\r\n\nprotect his valuables, including  his cocaine, should someone\r\n\nbreak into his home.\r\n\n     This court must also determine whether the keeping  of a\r\n\nrevolver  to protect a supply  of drugs meets the requirement\r\n\nof  U.S.S.G.     2K2.1(b)(5)  that  the  firearm be  used  or\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\npossessed  \"in  connection with\"  a  felony.

Brewster, 1 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 1993),\r                                             \r\n\nwe examined when a firearm is possessed \"in  connection with\"\r\n\ndrug trafficking under U.S.S.G.   2K2.1(b)(5).  We held  that\r\n\nsome  nexus  between  the  firearm and  the  other  felony is\r\n\nrequired, but  that the language  of the Guideline  should be\r\n\ninterpreted  broadly.    Brewster,  1  F.3d  at  54-55.  \"The\r                                             \r\n\ncombination   of  firearms  and  drugs  is  common,  and  the\r\n\nguideline  encompasses the  many  logical links  which  exist\r\n\nbetween the use of firearms and drugs.\"  Thompson, 32 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n8.\r\n\n     Here, a  logical link exists  between the  storing of  a\r\n\nlarge amount of cocaine for  purposes of sale and the keeping\r\n\nof a loaded revolver to protect  those drugs from theft.
