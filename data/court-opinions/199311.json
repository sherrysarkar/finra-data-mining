On August 24, 1995, after a\n\ntwenty-seven day trial, a jury convicted defendants-appellants\n\nLee H. Leichter, John F. Cvinar, and David W. Prigmore of\n\nconspiring to defraud and impair the functioning of the United\n\nStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in connection with its\n\noversight and regulation of medical devices.                See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n371.      The jury simultaneously acquitted George Maloney and\n\nKenneth    Thurston    of    the   same    charge.    The     district   court\n\nthereafter sentenced each convicted defendant to 18 months'\n\nimprisonment and two years of supervised release, but stayed\n\nexecution of the sentences pending appeals.             In these appeals,\n\nLeichter, Cvinar, and Prigmore (\"defendants\") raise a host of\n\narguments challenging the legality of their convictions.                    In\n\naddition, Prigmore claims that insufficient evidence supports\n\nhis conviction and that his sentence is unlawful.               We vacate the\n\nconvictions and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Because    we    review   the    trial   record    primarily    to\n\nascertain    whether    an    error   in     the   district    court’s   jury\n\ninstructions was harmless, see infra Section II, we look at the\n\nevidence as a whole and not in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, see Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, 3 F.3d 525,\n\n528 (1st Cir. 1993).        Thus, although we give a detailed account\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fof the evidence the government relies on to support its case\n\ntheory and harmless-error argument, we also provide an overview\n\nof relevant responsive evidence and arguments.                   See id. at 528-\n\n29.    We note too that this case has a complicated procedural\n\nhistory which we describe only insofar as is relevant to these\n\nappeals. Readers interested in additional procedural background\n\nshould consult our previous opinion in this matter.                     See United\n\nStates v. Leichter, 160 F.3d 33, 34 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nA.    Statutory and Regulatory Background\n\n           In 1976, Congress amended the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics\n\nAct   (FDCA),    21    U.S.C.    §    360   et    seq.,   by    passing   what   it\n\ndenominated the Medical Device Amendments (MDA), 21 U.S.C. §\n\n360c et seq.          The amendments made the FDA responsible for\n\nensuring   the       safety    and    effectiveness       of    medical    devices\n\ndistributed to the American public.                 This prosecution proceeded\n\non the theory that, in testing and marketing medical devices\n\nknown as \"heart catheters,\" the defendants conspired to violate\n\nprovisions      of    these    statutes       and     regulations      promulgated\n\nthereunder.\n\n           A    heart    catheter     is    a    tiny   instrument     consisting\n\nprimarily of a thin metal wire with a small inflatable balloon\n\nat or near one end.       The device is used in a surgical procedure\n\ncalled   angioplasty,         which   seeks      to   treat    heart   disease   by\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fopening   clogged     coronary     arteries.         During      angioplasty,      a\n\nphysician    inserts   a   heart       catheter   into      a    patient's   body,\n\ntypically through an artery in the leg or groin area.                            The\n\nphysician     then    steers     the     device      through      the   patient's\n\ncirculatory system to the site of the blockage and inflates the\n\nballoon with fluid.        As it is inflated, the balloon breaks the\n\n\"plaque\" that is clogging the artery and pushes it against the\n\nartery wall.     The physician subsequently withdraws the liquid,\n\ndeflates the balloon, and removes it and the catheter, thereby\n\nallowing blood to flow freely through the artery.\n\n            Regulations promulgated pursuant to the FDCA and MDA\n\ndesignate heart catheters as Class III medical devices.                          See\n\ngenerally 21 C.F.R. Part 870.           Class III medical devices are the\n\nmost heavily regulated medical devices in the country.                       See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 360c(a).      Before a manufacturer may market a new Class\n\nIII medical device, the manufacturer must apply for and receive\n\n\"premarket     approval\"    (PMA)       from   the     FDA.        21   U.S.C.     §\n\n360c(a)(C).      In    connection       with   its    PMA       application,     the\n\nmanufacturer must submit information sufficient to provide the\n\nFDA with \"reasonable assurance\" that, inter alia, the device is\n\nboth \"safe\" and \"effective.\"            21 U.S.C. § 360e(d)(2).\n\n            Under the MDA,\n\n            [T]he safety and effectiveness of a [Class\n            III] device are to be determined –\n\n                                        -5-\n\f                     (A) with respect to the\n                persons for whose use the\n                device   is  represented  or\n                intended,\n\n                     (B) with respect to the\n                conditions of use prescribed,\n                recommended, or suggested in\n                the labeling of the device,\n                and\n\n                     (C) weighing any probable\n                benefit to health from use of\n                the    device   against    any\n                probable risk of injury or\n                illness from such use.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(2).   Regulations promulgated pursuant to\n\nthis statute (and others) elaborate:\n\n                In   determining   the   safety   and\n         effectiveness of a device for purposes of\n         [deciding whether to grant] . . . premarket\n         approval   of   class   III   devices,   the\n         Commissioner . . . will consider the\n         following, among other relevant factors: (1)\n         The persons for whose use the device is\n         represented or intended; (2) The conditions\n         of use for the device, including conditions\n         of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested\n         in the labeling or advertising of the\n         device, and other intended conditions of\n         use; (3) The probable benefit to health from\n         the use of the device weighed against any\n         probable injury or illness from such use;\n         and (4) The reliability of the device.\n\n21 C.F.R. § 860.7(b).\n\n                There is reasonable assurance that a\n         device is safe when it can be determined,\n         based upon valid scientific evidence, that\n         the probable benefits to health from use of\n         the device for its intended uses and\n         conditions of use, when accompanied by\n\n                             -6-\n\f            adequate directions and warnings against\n            unsafe use, outweigh any probable risks.\n\nId. § 860.7(d)(1).\n\n                   There is reasonable assurance that a\n            device   is   effective   when  it    can  be\n            determined, based upon valid scientific\n            evidence, that in a significant portion of\n            the targeted population, the use of the\n            device for its intended uses and conditions\n            of  use,    when  accompanied   by   adequate\n            directions for use and warnings against\n            unsafe   use,    will   provide    clinically\n            significant results.\n\nId. § 860.7(e)(1).\n\n            Two additional sets of regulations governing Class III\n\nsurgical devices are of particular importance to this case, so\n\nwe describe them in some detail.        The first requires, insofar as\n\nis relevant, that a manufacturer of a previously approved Class\n\nIII surgical device \"submit a PMA supplement for review and\n\napproval by FDA before making a change affecting the safety or\n\neffectiveness of the device . . . .\"        21 C.F.R. § 814.39(a).    As\n\nwith   an   application   for   initial    PMA,   the   so-called   \"PMA\n\nsupplement\" must contain scientific information that provides a\n\nbasis for approval of the modified device.        See id. § 814.39(c).\n\nThe regulation lists eight \"types of changes\" for which a PMA\n\nsupplement must be filed \"if [the changes] affect the safety or\n\neffectiveness of the device,\" id. § 814.39(a), including the\n\nfollowing:     \"[n]ew indications for use of the device,\" id.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f§   814.39(a)(1);   \"[t]he     use     of   a    different         facility    or\n\nestablishment to manufacture, process, or package the device,\"\n\nid. § 814.39(a)(3); and \"[c]hanges in the performance or design\n\nspecifications, circuits, components, ingredients, principle of\n\noperation,     or   physical     layout         of    the     device,\"        id.\n\n§ 814.39(a)(7).     By operation of § 814.39(c) (\"All procedures\n\nand actions that apply to [a PMA] application under § 814.20\n\nalso apply to PMA supplements . . .\"), the manufacturer also\n\nmust \"periodically update [a] pending [PMA] application with new\n\nsafety and effectiveness information learned about the device\n\nfrom on-going or completed studies that may reasonably affect an\n\nevaluation of the safety or effectiveness of the device . . . .\"\n\nId. § 814.20(e).\n\n          As   implied   by    the     regulations          just    quoted,     a\n\nmanufacturer need not submit a PMA supplement \"if the change\n\ndoes not affect the device's safety and effectiveness . . .,\n\ne.g., an editorial change in labeling which does not affect the\n\nsafety or effectiveness of the device.\"              Id. § 814.39(b).         But\n\nwhere the FDA has required periodic reports as a condition of\n\napproval of the device, the manufacturer must report any changes\n\nto the FDA \"in [its] postapproval periodic reports . . . .\"                   Id.\n\nThe PMAs of the heart catheters at issue in this case explicitly\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\frequired postapproval reports documenting any and all changes to\n\nthe catheters.\n\n           The       second       set       of     regulations    underlying    this\n\nprosecution      arise   from       the      background    fact   that,    prior   to\n\nsubmitting a PMA application or PMA supplement, the manufacturer\n\nof a new or modified Class III medical device may desire to test\n\nthe device in humans.             To do so lawfully, the manufacturer must\n\napply to the FDA for an \"investigational device exemption\"\n\n(IDE).    An     IDE   \"permits         a    device    that    otherwise   would   be\n\nrequired . . . to have premarket approval to be shipped lawfully\n\nfor the purpose of conducting investigations of that device.\"\n\n21 C.F.R. § 812.1(a).              An IDE thus permits limited use of an\n\nunapproved device for the purpose of collecting human test data.\n\nSee id.   But the testing regulations themselves specify a number\n\nof situations in which an IDE is not a prerequisite to the\n\ninvestigational use of unapproved Class III medical devices in\n\nhumans.        See     id.    §         812.2(a),       (c).       Such    “exempted\n\ninvestigations” include \"consumer preference testing\" and the\n\n\"testing of a modification\" to an approved Class III medical\n\ndevice, so long as \"the testing is not for the purpose of\n\ndetermining [the unapproved device's] safety or effectiveness\n\nand does not put subjects at risk.\"                    Id. § 812.2(c)(4).\n\n\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fB.     Relevant Factual Background\n\n              Defendants had leadership positions at United States\n\nCatheter and Instrument, Inc. (USCI), a division of C.R. Bard,\n\nInc. (Bard), for most or all of the alleged conspiracy period,\n\nwhich ran from 1987 to 1990.          Defendant Leichter was USCI's head\n\nof regulatory affairs and quality assurance; defendant Cvinar\n\nwas USCI's president; and defendant Prigmore, who previously had\n\nbeen    president    of    USCI,    was   until     September        1989   a    vice\n\npresident at Bard with authority over USCI's operations.                         All\n\nthree defendants had offices in Billerica, Massachusetts, where\n\nUSCI operated a manufacturing plant and maintained its corporate\n\nheadquarters.\n\n              USCI's chief decision-making body was its Management\n\nBoard.        Cvinar presided over the Board and Leichter was a\n\nmember.       Cvinar reported to Prigmore.             Representatives from\n\nmiddle management at USCI made up an organization known as the\n\n\"Breakfast Club.\"         The Breakfast Club reported regularly to the\n\nBoard and provided the Board with the minutes of its meetings.\n\nThe Breakfast Club had no authority to make decisions without\n\nthe    Board's    approval.        Leichter   was    not    a   member      of    the\n\nBreakfast Club, but he sometimes attended its meetings.\n\n              The conspiracy alleged in this case involved two lines\n\nof    heart    catheters    manufactured      by    USCI.       In    1987,      USCI\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fintroduced the first line, which we shall call the \"Probe Line,\"\n\nwith a catheter known as \"Probe A.\"                  In 1988, USCI modified\n\nProbe A and renamed it \"Probe B.\"               In early 1989, USCI began\n\ndistributing Probe B commercially.             Later in 1989, USCI modified\n\nProbe B and renamed it \"Probe C.\"               At trial, the government's\n\nconspiracy theory with respect to the Probe Line was that, under\n\ndefendants'      leadership     and    with    defendants'    knowledge   and\n\napproval, USCI tested Probe B and Probe C in humans in violation\n\nof the Class III medical device testing regulations; marketed\n\nProbe B and Probe C in violation of the Class III medical device\n\nmarketing regulations; and otherwise deceived the FDA in order\n\nto avoid the agency's oversight.\n\n           In 1987, the second line of heart catheters, which we\n\nshall call the \"Miniprofile Line,\" featured a catheter called\n\nthe \"Simplus.”      In 1988, the Simplus evolved into a catheter\n\ncalled    the   \"Miniprofile,”        which,    in   1989,   evolved   into   a\n\ncatheter called the \"Solo.\"             In 1989, USCI also filed a PMA\n\nsupplement for a catheter called the \"Solo Sr.,\" but the company\n\nnever manufactured the Solo Sr. and ultimately withdrew the\n\nfiling.    With respect to the Miniprofile Line, the government's\n\nconspiracy      theory   once   again     was    that,   under   defendants'\n\nleadership and with defendants' knowledge and approval, USCI\n\ncommitted a number of violations of the Class III medical device\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\ftesting and marketing regulations and otherwise lied to the FDA\n\nto avoid the agency's oversight.       The following is a summary of\n\nthe evidence supporting the government's conspiracy theories.\n\n         1.    The Probe Line\n\n         In the early 1980s, when angioplasty first became\n\navailable in this country, USCI controlled 100% of the market\n\nfor heart catheters.    By the late 1980s, however, USCI's market\n\nshare had declined by about half and the market had become very\n\ncompetitive.     When USCI introduced the FDA-approved Probe A in\n\n1987, the device initially sold very well.       But the device had\n\na significant limitation.     Although USCI marketed Probe A with\n\na label warning that it should not be rotated more than one full\n\nturn (360 degrees) in the same direction, physicians performing\n\nangioplasties sometimes saw it as necessary to rotate the device\n\nbeyond its warned-against limitation.       When this occurred, the\n\ndevice's balloon had a tendency to wrap itself around the wire,\n\nwhich prevented deflation.      This, in turn, blocked blood flow\n\nthrough the artery and complicated efforts to remove the device\n\nfrom the body.\n\n         USCI's solution to Probe A's wrapping problem was Probe\n\nB, a redesigned version of the same catheter.       In Probe A, the\n\nballoon attached at the end of the wire, but in Probe B, the\n\nballoon attached to a polymer tube threaded over the wire.       The\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fresult was that Probe B could be rotated more than once in the\n\nsame   direction     without    the      balloon     becoming       entangled.\n\nUnfortunately,     however,     the     new    design     created    different\n\nproblems.\n\n            There was evidence that, in actual use in humans, Probe\n\nB's wire broke 25 times more frequently than Probe A's wire.\n\nThere also was evidence that, when compared to Probe A, these\n\nbreaks were far more likely to occur when the device was rotated\n\nmore   than   once   in   the    same        direction.      Moreover,    the\n\nconsequences of a Probe B wire break tended to be more serious.\n\nIn the relatively unlikely event of a Probe A wire break, the\n\ncatheter's metal tip typically would not detach and could be\n\nremoved with the wire and balloon.              By contrast, when Probe B\n\nbroke, the broken tip frequently could not be removed with the\n\nrest of the catheter.     In such a situation, the physician either\n\nhad to leave the tip in the patient or remove it by invasive\n\nsurgery.    Evidence of these problems poured into USCI in early\n\n1989, but, contrary to the urgings of certain USCI \"Crisis Team\"\n\nmembers appointed by Cvinar to handle the situation, USCI, and\n\nthen Bard, declined to order a voluntary recall of Probe B.\n\n            The government contends that this disastrous state of\n\naffairs was a direct result of USCI violating the regulations\n\ngoverning the testing and marketing of Class III medical devices\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fin connection with bringing Probe B to market.     We start with a\n\nsynopsis of the evidence of unlawful testing in connection with\n\nProbe B.\n\n                 a.   Misconduct Involving the Probe B\n\n           On November 11, 1988, one of Leichter's subordinates\n\nfiled a PMA supplement for Probe B asserting that it should be\n\napproved without being tested in humans.      Upon receipt of the\n\nsupplement, the FDA questioned USCI's assertion and asked for\n\nproof that clinical testing was unnecessary.     In a December 13,\n\n1988 letter and in a December 15, 1988 meeting, certain of\n\nLeichter's subordinates explained to FDA representatives that\n\nProbe B's safety and effectiveness had been established by\n\nlaboratory \"bench\" testing and that the FDA could rely on data\n\nsubmitted in connection with Probe A's PMA application because\n\nthe two devices were similar.         The December 13 letter also\n\nexplained that clinical testing was not necessary because bench\n\ntesting had showed that Probe B \"allows for more independent\n\nrotation of the core wire and balloon\" than Probe A.      Leichter\n\nsent the Management Board a copy of the December 13 letter and\n\na memorandum summarizing the December 15 meeting.        On these\n\ndocuments he handwrote \"Excellent work.\"      On January 19, 1989,\n\nthe FDA approved Probe B for commercial distribution without\n\nrequiring testing in humans.\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f            In fact, however, notwithstanding its representations\n\nto the FDA and without having applied for an IDE, in late\n\nOctober 1988, USCI began shipping Probe B catheters for purposes\n\nof    gathering    feedback   as   to     how   they    performed     in   humans.\n\nDocumentary evidence suggests that this feedback gathering,\n\nwhich USCI called \"disaster checking,\" was for purposes of\n\nascertaining Probe B's rotational capabilities, steerability,\n\nand \"performance characteristics . . . as compared to the [Probe\n\nA].\"    The government contends that testing for such purposes was\n\nsafety or effectiveness testing, and thus violated a negative\n\nimplication to be found in the Class III medical device testing\n\nregulations: that an unapproved Class III medical device may not\n\nbe tested in humans for safety or effectiveness without an IDE.\n\nSee    generally    21   C.F.R.    Part    812.        With   the   exception    of\n\nPrigmore,    who    explicitly     challenges     the     sufficiency      of   the\n\ngovernment's proof linking him with this evidence, defendants do\n\nnot dispute that they were aware of and approved of this course\n\nof conduct.   Rather, pointing to testimonial evidence supporting\n\ntheir case theory, they (joined by Prigmore arguing in the\n\nalternative) take the position that this \"testing\" was solely\n\nfor purposes of establishing consumer preferences; was not for\n\npurposes of determining safety or effectiveness as defendants\n\nreasonably understood the regulations to define those terms; and\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fdid not pose risks to humans beyond those associated with Probe\n\nA.   Defendants thus understood the testing to be exempted from\n\nPart 812's IDE requirements by § 812.2(c)(4).            We shall have\n\nconsiderably more to say on the defendants' understanding of\n\nPart 812 and the terms \"safety\" and \"effectiveness\" later in\n\nthis opinion.\n\n          The government also argues that, in bringing Probe B\n\nto market, USCI violated the Class III medical device marketing\n\nviolations in two ways.    First, USCI failed to report to the FDA\n\nthat it was conducting clinical tests in humans in several\n\ndocuments:     the Probe B PMA supplement (which was filed after\n\nclinical tests in humans began in October 1988); the December\n\n13, 1988 letter to the FDA; the December 15, 1988 meeting with\n\nFDA representatives; and the subsequent updates required by the\n\nFDA when it approved Probe A.            See 21 C.F.R. §§ 814.39(c),\n\n814.20(e).     Moreover, USCI failed to report that, in Probe B's\n\nclinical tests, the device experienced breakage rates far beyond\n\nthose reported with respect to Probe A as marketed.             See id.\n\nHere too, only Prigmore disputes the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nthat he was aware of Probe B's test results and the subsequent\n\nfailure   to   share   those   results    with   the   FDA;   the   other\n\ndefendants take the position that, under their understanding of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fthe regulatory mandates and the typical circumstances of a Probe\n\nB tip break, no reporting was required.\n\n           Second, USCI representatives were marketing Probe B\n\nwith the claim that it could be rotated more than once in the\n\nsame direction even though Probe B’s PMA supplement represented\n\nthat the device would retain Probe A's label warning against\n\nmore than a single revolution.         There was evidence that, despite\n\nthe label warning, the device was presented to USCI sales staff\n\nas   the   solution      to    Probe     A's      rotational    limitations.\n\nPresentations to sales staff at the company's annual national\n\nmeeting held at Lake Tahoe, California, from January 15-17,\n\n1989, left at least one salesman with the impression that \"Probe\n\nB could be torqued more than once, and that was the whole idea\n\nof   freeing   the   wire     [from    the   balloon].\"        Also,   written\n\npromotional materials for Probe B explained that \"[t]his new\n\ndevice allows increased torque delivery because of the new\n\ndesign\" and that \"with every rotation, it's the wire you're\n\nsteering and not the balloon.\"           In addition, a USCI videotape\n\ndesigned to instruct doctors on use of Probe B contained remarks\n\nfrom a doctor suggesting that the device could be rotated two or\n\nthree times.\n\n           USCI's sales force, which had been instructed to warn\n\nphysicians     against   overrotation        of   Probe   A,   were    not   so\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\finstructed with respect to Probe B.         Indeed, USCI sales staff\n\ninformed physicians that, although there would be no labeling\n\nchange, Probe B contained improvements \"that should prevent the\n\ntwisting problem\" that occurred with overrotation of Probe A.\n\nOne USCI representative told a doctor that he could rotate Probe\n\nB as many as 10 times, and another told several doctors at a\n\nphysicians' conference that they could rotate the device up to\n\n15 times (although the second representative subsequently was\n\nadmonished not to advocate such extreme use).\n\n           Defendants do not contest that USCI representatives in\n\nfact told physicians that they could rotate Probe B more than\n\nonce, and that USCI promotional materials might have given the\n\nsame impression.    Defendants vigorously contest, however, that\n\nthey   themselves   knew   of   and   condoned   promotion   of   Probe   B\n\ncontrary to its label warning.         The evidence as to defendants’\n\nknowledge and condonation was thin; Cvinar and Prigmore attended\n\nthe January 1989 Lake Tahoe conference, but no witness placed\n\nthem at the presentation in question.       All promotional materials\n\nrelating to use of a Class III device were approved by the\n\nregulatory affairs department (which Leichter headed), but there\n\nwas evidence that the doctor’s remarks on the videotape were\n\nadded after regulatory affairs had approved it.          In any event,\n\nno witness or document ever directly tied defendants to the\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fpromotional materials in question.        Finally, there was evidence\n\nthat Leichter insisted that label warnings be followed when he\n\nlearned that some USCI salespeople had been promoting Probe B\n\ncontrary to its label warnings.\n\n                  b.    Misconduct Involving the Probe C\n\n         The government asserts that USCI committed similar\n\nregulatory infractions with respect to the testing and marketing\n\nof Probe C.    In early 1989, at the same time the Crisis Team was\n\nreacting to the problems with Probe B, USCI was working urgently\n\non modifications designed to rectify those problems.         The result\n\nwas Probe C.    USCI bench tested eight Probe C prototypes and,\n\nwithout having secured an IDE from the FDA, shipped two or three\n\nof the prototypes for use in humans to see whether the changes\n\nimproved the strength of the catheter's tip and thus reduced the\n\nchance of breakage.     Some of the prototypes used in humans did\n\nnot perform as well as Probe B, but, by March 1989, USCI had\n\nsettled on a final version.    In this version, USCI increased the\n\ndiameter of the device's core wire by 30% and eliminated a\n\nsolder joint used to attach the wire to a spring.             USCI also\n\nmodified the device's assembly process.\n\n         USCI    then   marketed    Probe   C   without   filing   a   PMA\n\nsupplement.    In fact, the company took steps that can be taken\n\nto evince an intent to conceal Probe C’s changes and thus to\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fblur the differences between Probe C and its predecessor.       For\n\nexample, USCI basically retained the Probe B label for the new\n\ndevice but placed on the label an inconspicuous dot or small\n\nletter \"C\" so that USCI, and USCI alone, would know the model's\n\nidentity.    In the government's view, the unapproved testing and\n\nmarketing of Probe C was unlawful because the testing was for\n\npurposes of establishing the device's safety or effectiveness,\n\nsee 21 C.F.R. Part 812, and because the new product contained\n\ndesign changes affecting its safety or effectiveness, see id.\n\n§ 814.39(a), (b).      Once more, Prigmore contests the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence establishing his knowledge and approval of\n\nUSCI's conduct with respect to Probe C, and the other defendants\n\nassert that their conduct was perfectly lawful under their\n\nunderstanding of the applicable regulations.\n\n                  c.    Additional Deceptions\n\n            In the spring of 1989, the FDA learned that USCI had\n\nmodified Probe B so as to create Probe C without filing a PMA\n\nsupplement.    At the same time, the FDA came into possession of\n\ninformation that caused it to become concerned about Probe B tip\n\nbreaks.     On April 25, 1989, an FDA reviewer met with Leichter\n\nand informed him that she was concerned whether Probe B was\n\nsufficiently safe.       Leichter denied that there were safety\n\nconcerns and failed to reveal the tip breaks that had occurred\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fduring the investigational use of Probe B in humans.            The next\n\nday, Prigmore sent Leichter a memo conveying a \"personal 'job\n\nwell done' with regard to your recent dealings on the Probe, and\n\nparticularly your meeting with the FDA.\"\n\n          The FDA later requested explanations for both Probe B's\n\nfailure rates and USCI's failure to file a PMA supplement with\n\nrespect to Probe C.       On May 15, 1989, USCI responded to the\n\nFDA's concerns by letter.      All three defendants spent several\n\nhours   reviewing   the   contents   of    the   letter.      The   letter\n\nexplained that, following field observation and analysis of\n\nbroken catheters, it had become clear to USCI that Probe B's\n\nbreakage problems were attributable to \"overtorque[ing] during\n\nclinical use while the tip was restricted.\"        In other words, the\n\ndevice was only breaking when it was being used contrary to its\n\nlabel warning against more than a single revolution in either\n\ndirection.   The letter also took the position that Probe B was\n\nsufficiently safe because the device's actual breakage rate was\n\nstatistically identical to the breakage rate of Probe A observed\n\nin clinical testing and reported to the FDA before the agency\n\nacted favorably on the Probe A PMA application.            But the letter\n\ndid not reveal that the tip of Probe B had a tendency to remain\n\nin the patient following a break.         Nor did it acknowledge that,\n\nin actual use, Probe B in fact broke 25 times more frequently\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fthan did Probe A, and that, during what defendants call the\n\n\"consumer preference testing\" of Probe B, the device broke many\n\ntimes   more    frequently   than     did    Probe    A   in   actual    use.\n\nDefendants     contend   that,   under     their    understanding   of    the\n\nregulations and the circumstances of Probe B tip breaks, none of\n\nthe foregoing representations or omissions was fraudulent.\n\n          The letter also explained that, although the design\n\nmodifications in Probe C \"substantially reduced the risk of\n\ncritical tip failure,\" these modifications did not affect the\n\ndevice's safety or effectiveness.           The asserted basis for these\n\nseemingly contradictory assertions was a tripartite argument:\n\n(1) the regulations only require the filing of a PMA supplement\n\nwhen a design modification affects the safety or effectiveness\n\nof the device when it is used in accordance with its labeling;\n\n(2) the modifications to Probe B inhering in Probe C only\n\naffected (by improving) the safety and effectiveness of the\n\ndevice when it was used in a manner contrary to its labeling\n\n(i.e., when, contrary to its label warning, the device was\n\nrotated more than a single revolution in the same direction);\n\nand (3) the modified catheter that became Probe C thus could be\n\nmarketed without a PMA supplement.                 This argument presaged\n\ndefendants' trial position in the dispute about the meaning of\n\nthe regulations at the core of this case.\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f            On June 9, 1989, the FDA ordered a recall of Probes B\n\nand   C   and    directed    USCI   to    file    a   PMA     supplement   before\n\nmarketing Probe C in the future.              In August 1989, USCI submitted\n\nsuch a supplement.          In the supplement, USCI asserted that the\n\nProbe C was in fact safe and effective and cited in support of\n\nthis claim the data gathered during its earlier investigational\n\nuse of the device in humans, along with additional follow-up\n\ndata collected at the direction of the FDA.                   The PMA supplement\n\nstated without limitation that Probe C had been \"distributed\n\nfrom March 1989 until August 1989\" in order \"to determine the\n\nsafety and efficacy of the device.\"\n\n            2.     The Miniprofile Line\n\n            During the conspiracy period, the Miniprofile line was\n\nUSCI's second most profitable line of catheters, ranking just\n\nbehind the Probe line in sales.                  At trial, the government\n\nintroduced       evidence   tending      to   show    that,    with   defendants'\n\nknowledge and approval, USCI engaged in four courses of conduct\n\nwith respect to the Miniprofile line that the government sees as\n\nfraudulent:       (1) in late 1987, USCI changed the manufacturing\n\nlocation for the Miniprofile line and then marketed catheters\n\nmanufactured at the new location without obtaining the FDA's\n\nprior approval; (2) in 1988, USCI modified the design of the\n\nMiniprofile, tested the modified catheter in humans without\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fhaving secured an IDE, marketed the modified version without\n\nhaving filed a PMA supplement, and adopted complex inventory\n\nsorting and labeling methods designed to conceal the change; (3)\n\nin 1989, in PMA supplements filed in connection with several\n\nadditional changes to the Miniprofile, USCI (a) represented that\n\nclinical testing was not necessary to evaluate the safety or\n\neffectiveness of the changes at the same time it allegedly was\n\nconducting such testing, and (b) failed to reveal the 1988\n\ndesign   change;   and   (4)   in   August   1989,   USCI   filed    a   PMA\n\nsupplement crafted to \"legitimize\" the 1988 design change.                We\n\nelaborate briefly on each of these four blocs of evidence.\n\n                   a.    The Change in Manufacturing Location\n\n          As previously detailed, the first catheter in the\n\nMiniprofile line was called the \"Simplus.\"             Until the end of\n\n1987, USCI manufactured the Simplus at a plant in Billerica,\n\nMassachusetts.      In September 1987, USCI acquired a factory\n\nbuilding in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and began preparations to\n\nmove its Simplus manufacturing operations there.                 The move\n\nrequired approximately six weeks of work from a 25-person crew,\n\nstructural changes to the buildings, and the installation of\n\nfilters and purifiers to de-ionize the air and water.            The idea\n\nwas   essentially       to   \"replicate\"     the     Billerica      Simplus\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fmanufacturing operations, although only some Billerica machines\n\nand workers were transferred to the new plant.\n\n            On December 15, 1987, USCI filed a PMA supplement\n\nrequesting       FDA   approval    to    manufacture      the    Simplus    at    its\n\nHaverhill facility.         On March 3, 1988, the FDA sent inspectors\n\nto   the   Haverhill      plant.        After    a   five-day    inspection,       the\n\ninspectors identified a number of problems with various pieces\n\nof equipment at the new plant.             On March 23, 1988, Cvinar wrote\n\nto the FDA and promised to correct the problems.                         On June 7,\n\n1988, the FDA approved the PMA supplement for the Haverhill\n\nfacility,       stating   in   a   cover    letter     that     \"[y]ou   may     begin\n\nmarketing of the device manufactured at this facility upon\n\nreceipt of this letter.\"            But by that time, USCI already had\n\nmarketed     several      thousand       catheters      manufactured        at     the\n\nHaverhill plant.\n\n            As noted above, the regulations for Class III medical\n\ndevices require the filing of a PMA supplement when an approved\n\ndevice     is     manufactured       at     \"a       different     facility        and\n\nestablishment\" and the change in location affects the device's\n\nsafety or effectiveness.            See 21 C.F.R. § 814.39(a)(3).                 The\n\ngovernment takes the position that the move from Billerica to\n\nHaverhill was one that affected safety or effectiveness and thus\n\nrequired FDA approval prior to the marketing of any catheters\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fassembled in Haverhill.             Defendants respond that, because the\n\nHaverhill operations were designed to replicate the Billerica\n\noperations, the move was \"safety neutral\" and the PMA supplement\n\nUSCI filed was in fact unnecessary.              Defendants also contest the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence linking them with the decision to\n\nmarket Haverhill-manufactured catheters prior to FDA approval.\n\n\n\n\n                      b. The 1988 Design Change\n\n             On May 24, 1988, the FDA approved the marketing of the\n\nMiniprofile      catheter,      which    evolved       from   the    Simplus.       As\n\napproved, the Miniprofile contained three \"lumens,\" which are\n\nthe   tiny    tubes    used    to    inflate     and    deflate      the   balloon.\n\nOriginally, USCI intended to manufacture the Miniprofile with a\n\n\"fast purge\" system that facilitated quick elimination of air\n\nfrom the lumens prior to filling them with the liquid that would\n\ninflate    the     balloon.       The   fast   purge     system     was    patented,\n\nhowever,     and     USCI     ultimately       could    not    use    it    in     the\n\nMiniprofile.\n\n             Following      its     commercialization,         the     Miniprofile\n\ndeveloped a reputation for having a deflation problem.                           There\n\nwas evidence that the problem was largely traceable to end users\n\nnot preparing and purging the catheter in accordance with the\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\finstructions in its labeling.             But there also was evidence that\n\nthe round shape of the Miniprofile's lumens may have been a\n\ncontributing factor.            In any event, the perception that the\n\nMiniprofile had a deflation problem affected sales, and USCI\n\nbegan     investigating        the   possibility        of   an   ameliorative\n\nmodification.\n\n               Eventually, USCI decided that a reduction in the number\n\nof lumens from three to two would positively affect Miniprofile\n\ndeflation issues.            The company created a two-lumen prototype\n\nand, after bench testing, shipped it for investigational use in\n\nhumans.    USCI did not secure an IDE prior to its investigation\n\nof the device, the objective of which (as stated in an internal\n\nUSCI document) was \"[t]o evaluate the 2 Lumen Mini/Simplus\n\ncatheter for improved inflation/deflation times; and to verify\n\nthat non-deflation of the balloon will not occur.\"                 On November\n\n3, 1988, a USCI employee sent the Management Board and Breakfast\n\nClub a memorandum summarizing the results of the company's\n\ntesting.        On November 7, 1988, Cvinar informed Prigmore in\n\nwriting that testing of the two-lumen Miniprofile had been\n\ncompleted,       that   the    testing    revealed     \"significantly      better\n\ninflation/deflation times with latest 2 lumen version,\"                       and\n\nthat    USCI    would   be    changing    to    the   two-lumen   design    \"post\n\nhaste.\"    On November 17, 1988, Cvinar sent the Management Board\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fa memo explaining that the changeover to a two-lumen Miniprofile\n\nwas a \"safety issue\" and linking the decision with the need to\n\n\"remain competitive in key market areas.\"\n\n            USCI did not file a PMA supplement prior to marketing\n\nthe two-lumen Miniprofile.            Moreover, the company took steps\n\nthat tend to evince an intent to conceal the change from the\n\nFDA.     For    example,    Leichter      would   not    permit    USCI's      vice\n\npresident of marketing to issue a brochure with a diagram of the\n\nmodified catheter because the diagram was \"inconsistent with\n\nwhat had been submitted to the FDA . . . .\"                       Leichter also\n\nrejected    a   subordinate’s       suggestion    that    the     label   of    the\n\nmodified    device     reflect      the   decreased      number     of    lumens,\n\nexplaining that \"[w]e don't want it to be evident to the FDA, so\n\nI would rather have something different that would not be so\n\nobvious.\"       Instead, USCI adopted more complicated inventory-\n\nsorting and labeling methods.             The government takes the now-\n\nfamiliar position that the testing and marketing of the two-\n\nlumen    Miniprofile       violated    the   Class      III   medical     device\n\nregulations because the testing was for purposes of determining\n\nthe modified device's safety or effectiveness yet was performed\n\nwithout an IDE, see 21 C.F.R. Part 812, and because the change\n\nfrom    three   to   two   lumens     affected    the    device's    safety      or\n\neffectiveness yet was implemented without a PMA supplement, see\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fid. § 814.39(a).              Here again, Prigmore asserts evidentiary\n\ninsufficiency      and     all   defendants       contend    that,      under    their\n\nunderstanding of the regulations, neither an IDE nor a PMA\n\nsupplement was required in connection with the testing and\n\nmarketing of the two-lumen Miniprofile.\n\n                      c.      The 1989 PMA Supplements\n\n              Throughout       1989,   USCI     modified    the   Miniprofile       by\n\ncreating versions of the device with (1) a silicone coating, (2)\n\na   balloon    bond   cured      by    ultraviolet      light,    (3)    longer    and\n\nthicker balloons, and (4) a thinner shaft (the so-called \"Solo\"\n\nmodel).       USCI filed PMA supplements for these modifications,\n\nasserting that clinical testing was not required to verify the\n\ncontinued safety and effectiveness of the device.                             In fact,\n\nhowever, USCI investigated how each of these models performed in\n\nhumans without having secured an IDE from the FDA.                        The plans\n\nfor   and   results      of    these    tests    were   documented       in    various\n\nmemoranda sent to Leichter and Cvinar.                   In addition, with the\n\nexception of the Solo submission (which in one section mentioned\n\nthat the device had two lumens), the PMA supplements for these\n\nmodifications did not reveal that the Miniprofile was, by 1989,\n\na two-lumen catheter.             This apparently was not an accident.\n\nThere was evidence that Leichter directed that a draft of the\n\nPMA supplement for the Miniprofile with the new balloon sizes be\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\faltered to remove a passage describing the catheter as having\n\ntwo lumens because \"right now it wasn't a good time\" to mention\n\nthe change in light of \"what had happened with the Probe.\"\n\n            Defendants' response to the government's argument that\n\nthis evidence suggests a conspiracy to defraud is basically the\n\nsame as that with respect to the three-to-two lumen change.\n\nPrigmore asserts that there is insufficient evidence that he\n\nknew or approved of these events.                The other defendants do not\n\ndisclaim the necessary knowledge and approval.                       Rather, they\n\nassert that the \"testing\" of these modifications without an IDE\n\nand the failure to reveal the three-to-two lumen change were not\n\nunlawful     given          their     understanding      of    the     regulatory\n\nrequirements.\n\n                       d.    The \"Legitimizing\" 1989 PMA Supplement\n\n            In August 1989, USCI allegedly conceived a plan to\n\nobtain post hoc FDA approval of the two-lumen Miniprofile.                    The\n\ncompany decided to file a PMA supplement for a new catheter in\n\nthe Miniprofile line called the \"Solo Sr.\"                The supplement would\n\ndisclose and seek approval for the three-to-two lumen change as\n\nif   it   were   not    already       a   done   deed.    As   explained    in   a\n\nmemorandum summarizing an August 30, 1989 Regulatory Affairs\n\nMeeting    attended          by     Leichter     and   Prigmore,     USCI   would\n\n\"'legitimize' the changes [it] ha[d] already made (3 lumen to 2\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\f.    .    .)\"    by   submitting    a   PMA    supplement        \"within   a    month.\"\n\nLeichter told a subordinate that the Solo Sr. PMA supplement was\n\ndesigned as a \"cleanup\" filing to secure FDA approval of a\n\nproduct already being shipped.                  As noted previously, the PMA\n\nsupplement submitted for the Solo Sr. was eventually withdrawn.\n\n                 During the late summer of 1989, Leichter walked into\n\na Management Board meeting carrying a group of files on the\n\nMiniprofile line and announced that the files were problematic\n\nand \"not clean.\"           William Longfield, the Chief Operating Officer\n\nof       Bard,    replied    by   asking      whether     the    records    could      be\n\n\"purged.\"         In response, Cvinar halted the meeting and sent the\n\nparticipants out of the room.                      After a break, the meeting\n\nresumed and the subject of purging the files did not arise\n\nagain.\n\n                 Despite    his   presence     at   the   meeting       where    it   was\n\ndecided that USCI would attempt to “legitimize” already-made\n\nchanges to the Miniprofile, Prigmore again argues that there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to prove that he knew of or condoned\n\nUSCI's       actions       with   respect     to    the   Solo    Sr.      The    other\n\ndefendants contend that the Solo Sr. was not in fact the then-\n\nextant Miniprofile, pointing to evidence that the device was to\n\nhave a blood-pressure monitoring capability not then present in\n\nthe Miniprofile.            In other words, defendants take the position\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fthat the Solo Sr. PMA supplement was not fraudulently filed in\n\nan    attempt     to   legitimize         already     made    changes      to    the\n\nMiniprofile; rather, it was filed \"in order to seek approval of\n\nchanges    and    features    other       than      the   number     of   lumens.\"\n\nDefendants additionally contend that the Solo Sr. PMA supplement\n\nwas filed at the direction and under the supervision of David\n\nThomas, USCI's Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and an\n\nimmunized government witness.\n\nC.    Relevant Procedural History\n\n              As indicated above, the primary defense theme at trial\n\nwas that, under defendants' understanding of the applicable\n\nstatutory and regulatory requirements, the testing and marketing\n\nefforts   at     the   root   of    the     charged       conspiracy      were   not\n\nfraudulent.      This theme had two components pressed by defendants\n\nin the alternative:      (1) defendants' understanding of the legal\n\nrequirements was correct; or (2) defendants' understanding of\n\nthe   legal    requirements,       even    if   incorrect,     was    objectively\n\nreasonable and therefore foreclosed a fraud prosecution based on\n\na stricter reading of the law.                  See, e.g., United States v.\n\nRowe, 144 F.3d 15, 21-23 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying the rule\n\nthat, in a fraud prosecution premised on an alleged violation of\n\nambiguous positive law, the defendant is entitled to have his\n\nculpability assessed against the interpretation of the law that\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fmost tends to rebut the charge of intentional deceit so long as\n\nthe interpretation is objectively reasonable).\n\n            Although defendants took a number of different legal\n\npositions    based   on    the   specific      language   of    the   pertinent\n\nregulations, the foundation supporting their primary defense\n\ntheme tracked USCI's earlier argument, set forth in the May 15,\n\n1989   letter   to   the    FDA,   that    a   Class   III     medical   device\n\nmanufacturer is only required to file a PMA supplement when it\n\nmodifies an approved device and the modification affects the\n\ndevice's safety or effectiveness when the device is used in\n\naccordance with its \"intended conditions of use\" – i.e., the\n\nconditions    of   use    prescribed      in   the   labeling.        Thus,   the\n\nargument ran, modifications affecting the device's safety or\n\neffectiveness only during \"unlabeled,\" and thus unintended,\n\nconditions of use, such as overrotation with respect to the\n\nProbe line and improper preparation and purging with respect to\n\nthe Miniprofile line, did not affect the device's safety or\n\neffectiveness within the meaning of the applicable regulations.\n\n\n\n            In support of their argument, defendants relied heavily\n\nupon 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(2) and 21 C.F.R. § 860.7, which by\n\ntheir terms define for the FDA when a device is to be regarded\n\nas safe and effective.       These provisions combine to suggest that\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fthe safety and effectiveness of a device are to be determined\n\nby, inter alia, weighing its benefits to health against the\n\nprobable      risks    from     use    of   the    device        for    its   intended\n\nconditions of use.           See id.   In a nutshell, defendants' position\n\nwas    that,    if     the    FDA     determines       a    device's     safety    and\n\neffectiveness        within    the     context    of       the   device's     intended\n\nconditions of use, it was at least reasonable for them to assume\n\nthat       modifications       which     affect     a       device's      safety    or\n\neffectiveness only during unintended conditions of use do not\n\naffect      \"safety\"    or    \"effectiveness\"          within     the    meaning   the\n\napplicable law.1\n\n\n       1\n      As to the claim that the clinical testing described above\nviolated 21 C.F.R. Part 812 because it was done without an IDE\n\"to determine [the] safety and effectiveness\" of the various\ndevice modifications, § 812.2(a), defendants in part relied on\na derivative of their argument responding to the government's\nclaims of illegal marketing. With respect to modifications for\nwhich, in defendants' view, no PMA supplement was required,\ndefendants reasonably understood that an IDE also was not\nrequired because an IDE is nothing more than an \"exemption\npermit[ting] a device that otherwise would be required . . . to\nhave premarket approval to be shipped lawfully,\" id. § 812.1(a).\nWith respect to the preapproval testing conducted on modified\ndevices for which a PMA supplement admittedly was required\n(e.g., Probe B), defendants asserted that they regarded the\ntesting to be consumer preference testing exempted from the IDE\nrequirements by § 812.2(c)(4).\n     In their submissions to this court, defendants also hint at\nan all-encompassing argument that they reasonably did not regard\nany of the allegedly unlawful clinical \"testing\" charged by the\ngovernment to violate Part 812. According to this argument, as\nwe understand it, defendants reasonably read Part 812 as merely\nprescribing the protocols for the gathering of the \"valid\nscientific evidence\" upon which the FDA will assess the safety\n\n                                         -34-\n\f             The government did not agree with defendants' asserted\n\nunderstanding      of     the    crucial       statutory     and   regulatory\n\nprovisions, or with defendants' alternative argument that, even\n\nif   not   correct,      defendants'     understanding       was   objectively\n\nreasonable and therefore the appropriate benchmark against which\n\ncriminal liability should be judged.                Rather, the government\n\ntook   the     position     that   any        modification    known    by    the\n\nmanufacturer     to     affect   the    safety    or   effectiveness    of    an\n\napproved Class III device – even a modification only affecting\n\nsafety or effectiveness during unlabeled and warned-against\n\nconditions of use – triggers the obligation to file a PMA\n\nsupplement.     The government supported this so-called \"plain\" or\n\n\"dictionary\" meaning of the phrase \"affecting the safety or\n\neffectiveness of the device\" in 21 C.F.R. § 814.39(a) with the\n\ntestimony of two FDA experts and a Bard executive, all of whom\n\n\n\nand effectiveness of new and modified devices pursuant to §\n860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1).    The testing at issue in this case was\nnot for purposes of gathering this type of \"valid scientific\nevidence\"; it was more in the way of informal feedback gathered\non the front lines by USCI sales representatives and passed back\nto corporate headquarters. Thus, the argument concludes, while\nthe prior shipment of the catheters in question might have\nviolated § 814.39(a), their actual use in humans did not\nindependently violate Part 812.\n     Whatever merits this alternative argument might have, we\ndisregard it for present purposes because defendants did not\nsufficiently develop and preserve it as a defense theory in the\ndistrict court. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n(1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                       -35-\n\fshared with the jury their understandings of the crucial Class\n\nIII medical device regulations.          Although the experts gave\n\ntestimony that generally tended to support the government's\n\ncase, defendants were able to elicit on cross-examination of the\n\nFDA witnesses that a manufacturer attempting to divine the\n\nmeaning of the phrase \"affecting the safety or effectiveness of\n\nthe device\" reasonably might cross-reference § 860.7, and that\n\nthis   regulation   does   indeed   circumscribe      the   concepts       of\n\n\"safety\"   and   \"effectiveness\"    in   terms   of   \"intended   .    .    .\n\nconditions of use.\"\n\n           Consistent with their position on the meaning of the\n\nphrase \"affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device,\"\n\ndefendants requested that the district court instruct the jury\n\nto construe the phrase in the light cast by 21 C.F.R. § 860.7.\n\nAccordingly, defendants asked the court to quote § 860.7(d)(1)\n\nand (e)(1) verbatim and to instruct the jury to \"seek the\n\ndefinition[s] of 'safe' and 'effective'\" in these provisions.\n\nDefendants further asked that the court instruct the jury \"to\n\ndetermine the safety and effectiveness of a device or of a\n\nchange to a device, not under any conditions of use, but in\n\nlight of the conditions of use, directions for use, and warnings\n\nagainst unsafe use contained in the manufacturer's labeling for\n\nthat device.\"    Finally, defendants asked the court to instruct\n\n\n                                -36-\n\fthe jury that \"the defendants' interpretation of the standard\n\nthey were to use in determining safety and effectiveness was\n\nreasonable.\"\n\n           The    government,       by     contrast,      opposed   defendants'\n\nattempt to link 21 C.F.R. § 860.7 to the phrase \"affecting the\n\nsafety or effectiveness of the device\" in § 814.39(a).                          The\n\ngovernment argued that § 860.7 is intended only to guide the FDA\n\nas to whether a device is safe and/or effective; it is not\n\nintended   to    advise      the   manufacturers     of    Class    III    medical\n\ndevices    in    connection        with     their   PMA     supplement      filing\n\nobligations.       Accordingly,           the   government      asked   that,    in\n\ninstructing the jury, the district court (1) simply quote the\n\nrelevant portions of § 814.39 (but not § 860.7); (2) define the\n\nterms \"safety\" and \"effectiveness\" according to \"their plain\n\nordinary meaning,\" – i.e., \"freedom from danger or risks\" and\n\n\"having a definite or desired effect,\" respectively; and (3)\n\nstate   that    there   is    no   exemption     from     the   relevant    filing\n\nrequirements \"based upon a misuse of the device by users of the\n\ndevice,\" and that \"a PMA supplement must be filed . . . for a\n\nchange that affects safety and efficacy regardless of the reason\n\nfor the change\" – i.e., even if the change affects safety or\n\neffectiveness of the device only in the event of unlabeled or\n\nwarned-against conditions of use.\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\f           The district court did not adopt either approach.\n\nInstead, the court advised counsel on the day before closing\n\narguments that, although it would permit defendants and the\n\ngovernment to argue to the jury their respective interpretations\n\nof   the   applicable      Class    III     medical    device      statute   and\n\nregulations, it would only instruct on conspiracy to defraud.\n\nThe court thus would not instruct on either the meaning of the\n\nunderlying statute and regulations or objectively reasonable\n\ninterpretations thereof.\n\n           Accordingly, counsel for Leichter and Cvinar stressed\n\nin their closing arguments that, as the relevant statute and\n\nregulations   were     reasonably      understood     by   their     clients,   a\n\nmodification to an approved Class III medical device affected\n\nthe device's safety or effectiveness (and triggered the PMA\n\nsupplement    filing      requirement)      only    when   the     modification\n\nimpacted safety or effectiveness during the device's intended\n\nconditions    of   use.      Counsel      for   Leichter   and      Cvinar   also\n\nemphasized that the intended conditions of use were to be found\n\nin the device's labeling instructions and warnings.                 Counsel for\n\nPrigmore   primarily      focused   on    whether     there   was    sufficient\n\nevidence to tie his client to the conspiracy, but also joined in\n\nLeichter and Cvinar's legal arguments to the district court.\n\nThe government, for its part, prominently argued that \"safety\"\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\fand \"effectiveness\" should be given their plain or dictionary\n\nmeanings,      and     that     modifications           affecting       safety     or\n\neffectiveness        during   unlabeled        or    warned-against      uses    were\n\nsubject to the regulatory filing requirements.                       The government\n\nalso suggested that 21 C.F.R. § 860.7 is intended only to guide\n\nthe FDA in making its safety and effectiveness assessments, and\n\nhas no bearing on a manufacturer's obligation to file a PMA\n\nsupplement.\n\n            Subsequently, as promised, the district court declined\n\nto   instruct   the     jury    on     the   meaning      of    the    statute    and\n\nregulations.        Rather, the court instructed on the elements of\n\nconspiracy     to    defraud,    and    specified        that    defendants      were\n\naccused of conspiring to defraud the FDA in three respects:                       (1)\n\n\"knowingly and willfully, and with an intent to defraud, failing\n\nto submit applications for product approval and testing [to] the\n\nFDA,   which    allegedly       they    were        required    to    submit\";    (2)\n\n\"concealing or failing to report material facts which allegedly\n\nthey were required to report\"; and (3) \"making false statements\n\nin documents that they submitted to the FDA.\"\n\n            The district court also gave detailed state-of-mind\n\ninstructions, emphasizing that the government was required to\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants had knowledge of\n\ntheir legal duties (on this point, the court simply provided the\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fjury with copies of the applicable Class III medical device\n\nstatutory        and   regulatory         provisions);       that    defendants\n\nspecifically intended to agree to violate these duties and thus\n\ndefraud the FDA; and that defendants \"did not act in good faith\n\nor    by   mistake,    accident,     or    neglect.\"     Defendants      timely\n\nobjected to the court's refusal to instruct that the terms\n\n\"safety\" and \"effectiveness\" in the provisions spelling out\n\ndefendants' legal duties must be understood as described and\n\nconfined by 21 C.F.R. § 860.7 and, alternatively, to the court's\n\nrefusal     to   instruct   that    defendants'    interpretation       of   the\n\nregulatory requirements was at the very least reasonable.                     On\n\nthe    sixth     day   of   its    deliberations,      the    jury    convicted\n\ndefendants.       These appeals eventually ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\f                                    II.\n\n          As we stated at the outset, defendants raise a number\n\nof issues.     All three defendants press various arguments that\n\nthe underlying convictions should be reversed and the conspiracy\n\ncharge dismissed.    All three defendants also assert a number of\n\nalternative arguments that their convictions should be vacated\n\nand the matter remanded for further proceedings.                 Prigmore\n\nadditionally    contends,   again    in   the   alternative,    that   his\n\nsentence was unlawful.       In the end, we are not persuaded by\n\ndefendants' arguments for reversal and dismissal.              Yet we are\n\nconvinced that the convictions should be vacated and the case\n\nremanded for further proceedings.         To simplify our analysis, we\n\nshall begin by explaining why vacatur is warranted and then\n\nproceed to explain why reversal and dismissal is not.           We do not\n\nreach the merits of any arguments for vacatur beyond the one we\n\nregard as dispositive because, in any retrial, the issues giving\n\nrise to these other arguments are either not likely to arise\n\nagain or likely to arise in materially different contexts.             For\n\nthe same reason, we do not address the merits of Prigmore's\n\nsentencing challenge.\n\nA.   The Dispositive Issue\n\n          Defendants contend, inter alia, that the district court\n\ncommitted reversible error in refusing to instruct the jury that\n\n\n                                -41-\n\fdefendants' asserted understanding of when a change should be\n\nregarded as \"affecting the safety or effectiveness\" of a Class\n\nIII medical device, and thus trigger the PMA supplement filing\n\nrequirement, was at least reasonable and therefore the measure\n\nagainst     which      defendants'     criminal      culpability      should   be\n\nassessed.       In defendants' view, the trial record and the logic\n\nof the rule we applied in Rowe, see 144 F.3d at 21-23, entitled\n\nthem to such an instruction as a matter of law.                       We do not\n\nbelieve that the court was obliged to discuss the concept of\n\nreasonableness in its instructions; an instruction that the jury\n\nshould    simply       apply   a   definition   of    the    applicable   phrase\n\ninformed by the limitations of 21 C.F.R. § 860.7 and tailored to\n\nthe evidence in this case would have covered the point just as\n\nwell.    Nonetheless, on the facts of this case, we agree that the\n\ncourt erred in not instructing the jury to determine defendants'\n\nguilt against the backdrop of such a definition.\n\n               We begin by acknowledging that the district court has\n\nconsiderable discretion in how it formulates, structures, and\n\nwords    its    jury    instructions.      See,      e.g.,   United   States   v.\n\nWoodward, 149 F.3d 46, 68 n.14 (1st Cir. 1998).                  Moreover, the\n\ncourt often acts within its discretion in refusing to elaborate\n\nthe meaning of even an important legal term or phrase that falls\n\nshort of being self-explanatory.                Indeed, we have recognized\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\fthat, in some instances, attempts to clarify inherently nebulous\n\nconcepts can do more harm than good.                  Cf. United States v.\n\nAndujar, 49 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining our repeated\n\nwarnings that district courts within this circuit should avoid\n\ndefining    the     phrase    \"reasonable       doubt\"       in   their     jury\n\ninstructions).      The applicable standard, informed in part by\n\nthese principles, is that a court's refusal to give a requested\n\ninstruction    is    reversible       error     only    if     the     requested\n\ninstruction was (1) substantively correct; (2) not substantially\n\ncovered    elsewhere    in    the     charge;     and    (3)      concerned      a\n\nsufficiently      important   point    that     the    failure    to    give    it\n\nseriously impaired the defendant's ability to present his or her\n\ndefense.   See, e.g., United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1416\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).      In our view, this is the relatively rare case\n\nwhere all three of these requirements are met.\n\n           As an initial matter, defendants are plainly correct\n\nin asserting that, under settled circuit law, they were entitled\n\nto have their intent assessed in the light of the interpretation\n\nof the underlying filing requirements that is most congenial to\n\ntheir case theory and yet also objectively reasonable.                         See\n\nRowe, 144 F.3d at 21-23 (bankruptcy fraud case) (applying this\n\nprinciple to hold that an allegedly false statement was not\n\nfraudulent because it was not in fact false under an objectively\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\freasonable     interpretation      of      the     underlying            disclosure\n\nrequirement); United States v. Migliaccio, 34 F.3d 1517, 1525\n\n(10th   Cir.     1994)    (applying     the      rule    in     a    mail      fraud\n\nprosecution); cf. United States v. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d 46, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (securities fraud case) (endorsing such a rule\n\nin dicta).     This rule, rooted in the due process-based \"fair\n\nwarning requirement,\" see United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259,\n\n265-67 (1997), recognizes that, in a prosecution based on the\n\ntheory that a defendant has defrauded the government by making\n\nfalse statements in information defendant was duty-bound to\n\ndivulge to the government (or by failing to divulge information\n\ndefendant was duty-bound to divulge), there has been no crime if\n\nthe statements were not false (or if there was no duty to\n\ndivulge) under an objectively reasonable interpretation of the\n\nlaw   imposing   the     duty.   See    Rowe,     144    F.3d       at   21.     The\n\ngovernment does not take issue with this general principle; in\n\nfact, it makes no mention at all of Rowe or Bradstreet despite\n\ndefendants' significant reliance on them.\n\n           We also think it apparent that, if the evidence at\n\ntrial gives rise to a genuine and material dispute as to the\n\nreasonableness     of    a   defendant's      asserted    understanding           of\n\napplicable law, the judge, and not the jury, must resolve the\n\ndispute.     See United States v. Cheek, 498 U.S. 192, 203 (1991)\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f(tax fraud case) (observing that the objective reasonableness of\n\ndefendant's view of the law is a legal question);      Rowe, 144\n\nF.3d at 21-23 (treating the reasonableness question raised in\n\nthat case as a matter of law). 2      On this general point, the\n\ngovernment's agreement is explicit.\n\n         Indeed, despite its position at trial, the government\n\nno longer affirmatively takes issue with the general proposition\n\nthat it was reasonable for defendants to have regarded the\n\ndefinition of the phrase \"affecting the safety or effectiveness\n\nof the device\" in 21 C.F.R. § 814.39(a) as properly informed by\n\n\n\n    2 To be sure, a reasonableness determination sometimes\nrequires preliminary resolution of underlying factual disputes,\nand the court almost certainly acts within its rights in asking\nthe jury to resolve these disputes. Cf. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d at\n50-52 (suggesting in dicta that, had there been a genuine\ndispute as to which of several \"revenue recognition policies\"\ndefendant had been \"booking\" revenue under, and had an allegedly\nfraudulent booking of revenue been appropriate under an\nobjectively reasonable interpretation of one such policy, then\nthe court would have been obliged to instruct the jury to assess\nculpability in the light of that reasonable interpretation so\nlong as it first found defendant to have been using that policy\nin booking the revenue in question); St. Hilaire v. City of\nLaconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 n.1 (1st Cir. 1995) (civil rights\ndamages action) (observing in a discussion of the qualified\nimmunity defense and its \"objective reasonableness\" criterion\nthat it is an open question whether the judge may decide\nunderlying factual disputes bearing on reasonableness or must\nask the jury to resolve such disputes).         But as a legal\nquestion, the reasonableness of defendants' understanding is\nultimately a question for the judge. See Nieves-Villanueva v.\nSoto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 99 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that, in\nour legal system, purely legal questions are exclusively within\nthe domain of the judge).\n\n                             -45-\n\fthe   context-providing    qualifications   set   forth    in    §    860.7.\n\nAlthough at oral argument the government declined to disavow the\n\n\"plain    meaning\"   or   \"dictionary\"   definitions      of    the    terms\n\n\"safety\" and \"effectiveness\" that it pressed at trial and in its\n\nclosing arguments, the government makes no real effort to defend\n\nthose definitions in its brief to this court.          Perhaps this is\n\nbecause the Supreme Court recently recognized that \"virtually\n\nevery drug or device poses dangers under certain conditions,\"\n\nFDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 120 S. Ct. 1291, 1305\n\n(2000), and repeatedly emphasized that a drug or device is safe\n\nwithin the meaning of the FDCA when, in connection with its\n\nintended uses and conditions of use, see generally id. at 1301-\n\n06, its \"therapeutic benefits outweigh the risk of harm,\" id. at\n\n1305.     Perhaps this is because, on cross-examination, the FDA\n\nexperts who testified concerning the meaning of the applicable\n\nregulations conceded that it was reasonable to refer to the\n\nphrase \"intended . . . conditions of use\" in § 860.7(d)(1) and\n\n(e)(1) in ascertaining the meaning of the phrase \"affecting the\n\nsafety or effectiveness of the device\" in § 814.39(a).3              Perhaps\n\n\n      3\n      In referring to the experts' testimony regarding the\nmeaning of the applicable laws, we do not wish to be understood\nas more generally endorsing the use of expert testimony on legal\nmeaning.   Neither side contests the appropriateness of the\nexpert testimony that took place in this case, so we do not\naddress its admissibility.     We feel it important to note,\nhowever, that expert testimony proffered solely to establish the\n\n                                 -46-\n\fthe government has simply changed its position because it now\n\nagrees with defendants' argument that terms and phrases repeated\n\nthroughout a given law generally carry the same meaning.               See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., Ltd., 109 F.3d\n\n1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1997).         In any event, to the extent that the\n\ngovernment may have tacitly conceded the general point, we\n\nregard the concession as proper.          For the reasons just stated,\n\nand   regardless   how    the    phrase    \"affecting   the   safety     or\n\neffectiveness of the device\" in § 814.39(a) ultimately ought to\n\nbe understood, it was objectively reasonable for defendants to\n\nregard   the   phrase    as   definitionally    circumscribed    by     the\n\n\"intended . . . conditions of use\" qualification found in, among\n\nother places, § 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1).\n\n          That said, the government does not concede that the\n\ndistrict court committed reversible error in declining to give\n\nthe instruction defendants requested.          Put in the language of\n\nthe three-part test under which we review the court's refusal to\n\ninstruct, see Rose, 104 F.3d at 1416, the government's argument,\n\n\n\nmeaning of a law is presumptively improper.         See Nieves-\nVillanueva v. Soto-Rivera, 133 F.3d at 99-101; see also Benjamin\nJ. Vernia, Annotation, Admissibility of Expert Testimony\nRegarding Questions of Domestic Law, 66 A.L.R. 5th 135 (1999)\n(detailing how, despite the inroads courts have made into the\nrule against expert testimony on questions of law, such\ntestimony is still usually excluded).\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\fin   essence,      is    that    there          has    been   no   error    because   the\n\ninstruction     defendants         requested            was   neither      substantively\n\ncorrect nor concerned a sufficiently important point that the\n\ncourt's    failure       to     give       it    seriously     impaired     defendants'\n\nability to present their defense, see id.4                         We disagree.\n\n           As to the first Rose factor, substantive correctness,\n\nthe government points out that defendants requested that the\n\ncourt instruct the jury not only that it should link the phrase\n\n\"affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device\" in 21\n\nC.F.R. § 814.39(a) with the phrase \"intended . . . conditions of\n\nuse\" in § 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1), but that it also should\n\nunderstand \"intended . . . conditions of use\" in terms of the\n\ndevice's labeling.            Such a definition was too narrow, according\n\nto the government, because there was evidence that, with respect\n\nto Probe B, defendants knew of and acquiesced in USCI's on-the-\n\nside promotion of the overrotation against which the device's\n\nlabel warned.       As the government sees it, all actual conditions\n\nof use that the manufacturer intends or even knows of are\n\nrelevant      to        the     safety-or-effectiveness                   inquiry,    and\n\nmodifications       affecting          a    device's      safety     or    effectiveness\n\n\n\n      4\n     It is undisputed that the instruction defendants requested\nwas not substantially covered elsewhere in the charge.      See\nRose, 104 F.3d at 1416.   Thus, we address only the first and\nthird prongs of the Rose standard.\n\n                                                -48-\n\fduring such conditions of use trigger the PMA supplement-filing\n\nrequirements even if they are specifically warned against on the\n\nlabel.   In making this argument, the government points out that\n\n§ 860.7(b)(2) specifies that \"[t]he conditions of use for [a]\n\ndevice[] includ[e] conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or\n\nsuggested in the labeling or advertising of the device, and\n\nother intended conditions of use.\"                 (emphasis supplied).5\n\n            Given the explicit references to intention in 21 C.F.R.\n\n§ 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1), and in the absence of some clarifying\n\nregulatory    or    judicial     gloss        to   support      the    government's\n\nposition,    see    Lanier,      520       U.S.    at   266    (recognizing     that\n\n\"uncertain\"        laws    can        be      clarified        by     authoritative\n\nconstruction),      we    are   not    persuaded        that   a    criminal   fraud\n\n\n\n    5The government also draws support for this argument from 21\nC.F.R. § 801.4, which was neither the subject of trial argument\nnor given to the jury. In relevant part, § 801.4 states:\n\n         The words \"intended uses\" or words of similar\n    import in [three regulations not relevant to this\n    case] refer to the objective intent of the persons\n    legally responsible for the labeling of devices. The\n    intent is determined by such persons' expressions or\n    may be shown by the circumstances surrounding the\n    distribution of the article.    The objective intent\n    may, for example, be shown by labeling claims,\n    advertising matter, or oral or written statements by\n    such persons or their representatives.     It may be\n    shown by the circumstances that the article is, with\n    the    knowledge   of   such    persons   or    their\n    representatives, offered and used for a purpose for\n    which it is neither labeled nor advertised . . . .\n\n                                           -49-\n\fprosecution          can    be   premised    upon     a   failure     to   file   a    PMA\n\nsupplement in connection with a modification to an approved\n\ndevice that affects the device's safety or effectiveness only\n\nwith       respect    to     a   sincerely    unintended        and   warned-against,\n\nalbeit       known,        condition   of    use. 6       Yet   we    think   that     the\n\nregulatory text does accommodate the government's argument that\n\na manufacturer must take into account unlabeled, though promoted\n\n(and thus “intended”), conditions of use in determining whether\n\na modification affects safety or effectiveness.                       Moreover, given\n\nthe evidence of USCI's promotion of Probe B overrotation, such\n\na jury instruction might well be necessary at any retrial if\n\nthere       is   sufficient        evidence    that       defendants       knew   of    or\n\nacquiesced to such promotion.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      We of course recognize that, if a modification makes an\napproved device more dangerous in the event of a condition of\nuse that sometimes occurs despite the manufacturer's best\nefforts to prevent it, there may be sound policy reasons for\nrequiring the manufacturer to file a PMA supplement. But we are\nconcerned here not with the most socially useful interpretation\nof the relevant regulations; we are concerned with whether those\nregulations gave fair warning that a failure to file a PMA\nsupplement in such a circumstance is a felony under federal law.\nSee Lanier, 520 U.S. at 265-67.      Because the most relevant\nregulation defines device safety in terms of \"intended . . .\nconditions of use,\" § 860(d)(1) (emphasis supplied), and because\nthere has been no authoritative judicial or regulatory\npronouncement clarifying that a sincerely warned-against but\nknown condition of use should be regarded as \"intended,\" see\nLanier, 520 U.S. at 266, we reject the government's argument on\nthis narrow point.\n\n                                            -50-\n\f            But under the circumstances of this case, we do not\n\nthink it appropriate to hold that the defendants' reference to\n\nlabeling in their requested instruction effectively waived their\n\nright to an instruction that, for purposes of this prosecution,\n\nthe \"intended . . . conditions of use\" qualification in 21\n\nC.F.R. § 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1) limits the meaning of the phrase\n\n\"affecting safety or effectiveness\" in § 814.39(a).                 Although\n\ndefendants' proposed instruction did request that the jury be\n\ninstructed in terms of labeling, it more generally requested\n\n(over the government's objection) that the jury be instructed in\n\nthe specific language of § 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1), both of which\n\nstate broadly, without specific reference to labeling, that\n\n\"intended . . . conditions of use\" are relevant to safety and\n\neffectiveness       determinations.       In   other   words,    but   for   a\n\nproposed    refinement      suggesting    that   the   label    instructions\n\nreveal the manufacturer’s intended conditions of use (as in most\n\ncases they would), defendants' request was sufficiently close to\n\nthe mark.    Moreover, and more to the point, we think it evident\n\nthat the government's promotion at trial of an overly broad (at\n\nleast for purposes of assessing criminal liability) definition\n\nof the relevant statutory and regulatory terms had as much, if\n\nnot more, to do with this issue not emerging in sharp relief as\n\ndid   any   lapse    on   defendants'    part.    Defendants'     requested\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\finstruction was thus adequate to preserve the issue.                     Cf. United\n\nStates   v.    Sanborn,     563    F.2d      488,    490-91    (1st    Cir.   1977)\n\n(vacating a conviction on the basis of a rule of law slightly\n\ndifferent, and less defendant-friendly, than that sought by the\n\ndefendant in his requested instruction).\n\n            As to the third Rose factor, whether the requested\n\ninstruction concerned a sufficiently important point that the\n\ndistrict      court's     failure       to   give     it     seriously    impaired\n\ndefendants' ability to present their defense, the government\n\nappears to make two arguments.               First, the government makes a\n\nhalfhearted     claim     that    the    court's      good-faith      instructions\n\n\"adequately articulated\" the no-mens-rea defense theory and thus\n\nrendered unimportant the court's failure to define the disputed\n\nunderlying regulatory requirements.                  See Gov’t Br. at 111.       We\n\ndisagree.       While   the      court's     good-faith       instructions    were\n\ncomprehensive, articulate, and beyond reproach insofar as they\n\ngenerally described the concept of good faith, the jury's good-\n\nfaith finding may well have been affected by its view of what\n\nthe   underlying    law    required.           The   trial    evidence,    closing\n\narguments, and the jury instructions might well have left the\n\njury with an erroneous belief that manufacturers face criminal\n\nliability for failing to file a PMA supplement when they make a\n\nmodification to an approved device that has an effect only\n\n\n                                        -52-\n\fduring a sincerely unintended and specifically warned-against\n\ncondition of use.          This erroneous belief, in turn, might well\n\nhave been the basis upon which the jury rejected the good-faith\n\ndefense.      The good-faith instruction thus did not undo the harm\n\ncaused by the court’s failure to give the requested instruction\n\nin and of itself.          See Migliaccio, 34 F.3d at 1525.\n\n             Second, the government in substance contends that, even\n\nif    erroneous,     the    district     court's     failure     to   define    the\n\nunderlying     regulatory       terms    was   unimportant     because    it    was\n\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt within the meaning of Neder\n\nv. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 16-20 (1999) (holding harmless the\n\ntrial      court's   erroneous     failure      to    instruct    the    jury    to\n\ndetermine     whether      a   failure    to   report    taxable      income    was\n\n\"material\" where the failure to report involved over $5 million,\n\nthe     evidence     regarding     the     failure      to   report     was     not\n\ncontroverted, and defendant did not argue to the jury that his\n\nfailure to report was immaterial).                   The government suggests\n\nthat, as in Neder, it is here \"clear beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat a rational jury would have found\" defendants guilty even if\n\nproperly instructed.           Id. at 18 (emphasis supplied).7\n\n\n       7\n     In arguing that any error here was harmless “beyond a\nreasonable doubt,” the government appears to take the position\nthat instructional error of the type we have identified is\nconstitutional in dimension.   See Chapman v. California, 386\nU.S.  18,   24  (1967)   (holding  that,  “before   a  federal\n\n                                        -53-\n\f          Indeed, in the government's view, \"[t]his case . . .\n\npresents a stronger candidate for a finding of harmlessness\"\n\nthan did Neder because the legal error in Neder affected the\n\njury's   consideration    with     respect        to   all    of   defendant's\n\nallegedly illegal acts.    Gov’t Br. at 80.            In contrast to Neder,\n\nthe government asserts, the error in this case only affected the\n\njury's deliberations with respect to those acts pertaining to\n\nthe failure to obtain a PMA supplement; the error did not affect\n\nthe   jury's   consideration      of    the   evidence       of    the   testing\n\nviolations, the evidence that defendants failed to disclose the\n\nthree-to-two    lumen    change        in   the    1989      Miniprofile     PMA\n\nsupplements, the evidence regarding deceptive intentions with\n\nrespect to the filing of the Solo Sr. PMA supplement, the\n\n\n\nconstitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be\nable to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt”). One member of the panel, however, believes\nthat the error likely was not constitutional, and that the\napplicable   harmless-error   standard   therefore   comes from\nKotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946)\n(interpreting the predecessor to the federal harmless-error\nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 2111, to require reversal only when the\nerror “had substantial and injurious effect or influence in\ndetermining the jury’s verdict”). See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507\nU.S. 619, 630-32 (1993) (noting that the Chapman standard\napplies to direct review of constitutional errors and that the\nKotteakos   standard   applies   to   direct   review   of non-\nconstitutional errors).   Because the panel unanimously agrees\nthat the error we discern cannot be said to be harmless under\neither test, we do not decide which test applies or,\nconcomitantly, whether the error deprived defendants of       a\nconstitutional right.\n\n                                   -54-\n\fevidence of USCI's failure to report modifications in mandatory\n\nfollow-up reports, or the evidence of other assorted deceit and\n\ntrickery (e.g., promoting Probe B contrary to its label warnings\n\nand adopting complicated inventory and labeling methods designed\n\nto    conceal   device    modifications           from       the   FDA).     And,    the\n\nargument concludes, the evidence with respect to these matters\n\nwas \"overwhelming.\"           Id.\n\n           In our view, the evidence of guilt in this case is\n\nquite    substantial; certainly, it is more than sufficient to\n\npermit a retrial on a properly formulated theory that defendants\n\nconspired to defraud the FDA with respect to its oversight and\n\nregulation of medical devices.              We do not believe, however, that\n\nthe    evidence    is    so    one-sided         as    to    render    harmless      the\n\nunderlying instructional error we have identified.                          Unlike the\n\ngovernment, we do not see this as a case, like Neder, where it\n\nis far-fetched to conclude that a properly instructed jury might\n\nhave    returned   different         verdicts         than   those    returned.       In\n\nexplaining, we follow the government's lead and focus upon the\n\nnature    and   weight    of        the   evidence       asserted     to    have    been\n\nunaffected by the instructional defect.\n\n           The government first asserts that the trial evidence\n\nshowed    conclusively         that       defendants         tested    their    device\n\nmodifications      for    the       purpose      of     determining        safety   and\n\n\n                                          -55-\n\feffectiveness with respect to intended conditions of use and in\n\nsuch   a   way    as   to    put   patients     at   prohibited   risks.    In\n\nresponding to this argument, we limit ourselves to the factual\n\nnature of the evidence presented and put to the side defendants'\n\nlegal argument that, because an IDE is an exemption permitting\n\nthe clinical testing of unapproved devices that otherwise could\n\nnot    lawfully    be       shipped   without    premarket    approval,    the\n\nlawfulness of most of the testing at issue in this case turns in\n\nthe first place on whether the modification at issue was subject\n\nto the PMA supplement requirement.              See supra note 1.\n\n            As to the nature of the testing evidence, we think\n\nthat, while the factual inference the government would have us\n\ndraw surely would be permissible on the present record, see,\n\ne.g., supra at 13, 20, 23-24 (summarizing documentary evidence\n\nsuggesting that the testing was for purposes of evaluating\n\nsafety and/or efficacy during intended conditions of use), it is\n\nnot the only rational inference.          Unlike Neder, the government's\n\nevidence as to the purpose of the testing was contested by\n\ndefendants; as we have stated, defendants introduced testimonial\n\nevidence that the purposes of this testing were to determine\n\nwhether the modifications were ameliorating safety concerns\n\nduring unintended conditions of use and/or to establish consumer\n\npreferences within the meaning of 21 C.F.R. § 812(c)(4).                   See\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\fsupra   at    13-14.      Given    Neder's     repeated      emphasis     on    the\n\n\"uncontested\" nature of the evidence of materiality in that\n\ncase, see 527 U.S. at 15, 17, 17 n.2, & 19, the contested nature\n\nof the testing evidence in this case might well suffice to\n\ndistinguish        it     from    Neder        in     and     of    itself.\n\n\n\n             In any event, while the government's evidence of the\n\npurpose behind the testing was strong, the competing evidence\n\nwas   not    inherently    incredible.         That   effectively        ends   the\n\nmatter.      As an appellate court, we are not equipped to make the\n\ncredibility determinations that must be made in choosing between\n\nthese clashing blocs of evidence, each of which is sufficient to\n\nrender rational a finding in favor of its proponent.                 See Neder,\n\n527   U.S.    at   19.     We    also    are   mindful      that,   in    denying\n\ndefendants' motions for judgments of acquittal, the trial court\n\nthought it a very \"close\" call whether the motions should be\n\ngranted, and that, in overruling defendants’ objections to its\n\nfailure to give the requested safety-and-efficacy instruction,\n\nthe court opined that instructing the jury as the defendants\n\nrequested would be tantamount to directing a verdict for them.\n\nIn sum, we do not regard the government's evidence of the\n\npurpose of the testing, alone or combination with the other\n\n\n\n\n                                        -57-\n\fevidence discussed below, to be of such a nature as to render\n\nthe court's instructional error harmless.\n\n             Our     analysis       with   respect    to       the    other    evidence\n\nmentioned by the government in support of its harmless-error\n\nargument     follows      a   similar       path.         As   we     have    observed,\n\ndefendants explained the failure to file a PMA supplement with\n\nrespect to the three-to-two lumen change in the Miniprofile with\n\nevidence and argument that a filing was unnecessary because the\n\nchange    was    designed      to    ameliorate      safety      issues       caused    by\n\nunintended preparation and purging techniques by end users.                            See\n\nsupra at 23. The evidence on this point was not inherently\n\nincredible.          If   a   correctly      instructed        jury    were    to     have\n\naccepted this evidence and line of defense (as it might have),\n\nwe think it might well also have regarded the subsequent failure\n\nto report the three-to-two lumen change in the 1989 Miniprofile\n\nPMA supplements as inconsequential.                  So too with the Solo Sr.;\n\nwe   think      it   possible       that    the    jury    might       have    accepted\n\ndefendants' supported and argued contention that USCI filed the\n\nSolo Sr. PMA supplement in order to seek approval of changes\n\nother    than    those    pertaining        to    lumen    number     and/or     at    the\n\ndirection and under the supervision of David Thomas, and not\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -58-\n\f           Finally, with respect to the evidence of failure to\n\nsubmit follow-up reports and the evidence of other assorted\n\ndeceptions and trickery, it suffices to note that such evidence\n\nwas either largely tangential to the primary trial themes or not\n\nparticularly probative of any of the principal fraud theories as\n\nto which the jury was instructed.             See supra at 34.       As we have\n\nexplained, instructional error and the absence of one-sided and\n\noverwhelming     evidence   of    guilt      combine   to    prevent    us   from\n\naffirming defendants' convictions on the basis of the primary\n\ncriminal   liability      theories     advanced     at      trial:   fraudulent\n\nmarketing and fraudulent testing.              Moreover, the experienced\n\ntrial judge who presided over the case stated on the record that\n\nhe was not sure he was correct in even sending the case to the\n\njury.    Given this state of affairs, it would be improper to\n\naffirm defendants' convictions on the basis of evidence that, on\n\nthe whole, played a supporting rather than a starring role at\n\ntrial.\n\nB.   Other Issues\n\n           As    noted,   defendants        press   various     arguments      for\n\nreversal   and    dismissal      of   the    conspiracy       charge.        These\n\narguments do not merit extended discussion.\n\n           First, all three defendants argued in their initial\n\nbriefs that the regulations under which they were prosecuted did\n\n\n                                      -59-\n\fnot give fair warning of the \"dictionary\" or \"plain language\"\n\ninterpretation that the government relied upon in pressing this\n\nprosecution.         Then,      when       defendants       perceived       in       the\n\ngovernment's brief a shift in position towards (if not all the\n\nway to) the interpretation of the regulations they have advanced\n\nall along (and we herein confirm as objectively reasonable), all\n\nthree   defendants       suggested       in   their   reply   briefs    that         the\n\nconspiracy      charge   should     be     dismissed    outright      because        the\n\ngovernment's       \"switch      .      .      .   confirms      the     .        .    .\n\nunconstitutionality of this prosecution.\"                   Defendants do not,\n\nhowever, place this argument within the context of a recognized\n\nlegal theory; nor do they cite authority which supports the\n\ndrastic remedy they seek.           We therefore reject the argument as\n\ninsufficiently elaborated.            See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n           Second, defendants Cvinar and Prigmore contend that\n\nthey are entitled to dismissal of the conspiracy charge because\n\nthe FDA did not provide them with notice and an opportunity to\n\npresent to the FDA their \"views\" as to the events underlying\n\nthis case prior to reporting their alleged violations of the\n\nFDCA to a United States Attorney for prosecution.                     21 U.S.C. §\n\n335.    But even assuming that Cvinar and Prigmore were entitled\n\nto such notice and opportunity, the Supreme Court has made it\n\nclear    that    they     are   not      entitled      to   dismissal       of       the\n\n\n                                         -60-\n\fprosecution.       See United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277,\n\n279 (1943).\n\n            Third, and finally, Prigmore asserts that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to link him to the conspiracy charged and\n\nthus to sustain his conviction.             Frankly, in reviewing those\n\nportions of the record the government points to in response to\n\nPrigmore's     sufficiency    argument,      we   are   not    particularly\n\nimpressed by the strength of the case against him.             Nonetheless,\n\nmindful that \"in a criminal conspiracy, culpability may be\n\nconstant    even    though   responsibilities     are   divided,\"     United\n\nStates v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993), and\n\nthat a successful sufficiency claim requires a showing that \"no\n\nrational jury could have found [defendant] guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt,\" United States v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (emphasis supplied), we are persuaded that there\n\nwas sufficient evidence to tie Prigmore to the conspiracy.\n\n            As we have noted, there was evidence that, on November\n\n7, 1988, Cvinar informed Prigmore that testing of the modified\n\ntwo-lumen    Miniprofile     had   been    completed,   that   the   testing\n\nrevealed \"significantly better inflation/deflation times\" in the\n\nnew model, and that USCI would be adopting the two-lumen design\n\n\"post haste.\"      See supra at 23-24.       There thus was evidence to\n\nground a conclusion that Prigmore knew that the three-to-two\n\n\n                                    -61-\n\flumen   change   was    a    change   affecting   the   safety   and/or   the\n\neffectiveness of the Miniprofile – at least with respect to its\n\nunintended conditions of use.\n\n           Further, there was evidence that Prigmore reviewed for\n\nseveral hours the May 15, 1989 letter in which USCI took the\n\nposition that the modifications to Probe B that became Probe C\n\ndid not require a PMA supplement because they did not affect the\n\nsafety or effectiveness of the catheter during its intended uses\n\nand conditions of use.          See supra at 18-20.        There thus was\n\nevidence to ground a conclusion that, by May 1989, Prigmore knew\n\nthat USCI was under a regulatory obligation to file a PMA\n\nsupplement with respect to all changes affecting the safety or\n\neffectiveness    of    its    approved   heart    catheters   during   their\n\nintended uses and conditions of use prior to marketing the\n\naltered product.\n\n           Moreover, there was evidence that, on August 30, 1989,\n\nPrigmore participated in the meeting where it was decided that\n\nUSCI, according to a memorandum memorializing the meeting, would\n\nfile a PMA supplement for the Solo Sr. designed to \"'legitimize'\n\nthe changes [it] already ha[d] made (3 lumen to 2 . . .)\" to the\n\nMiniprofile by submitting to the FDA a cleanup PMA supplement.\n\nSee supra at 26.       There is no indication that Prigmore, who then\n\nwas a Bard vice president with authority over USCI operations,\n\n\n                                      -62-\n\fdissented from the proposed course of conduct, which eventually\n\nwas implemented.         In our view, the memorandum describing the\n\nAugust   30    meeting   suggests     that   Prigmore   acquiesced     in   an\n\nunlawful plan to conceal from the FDA a dubious course of\n\nconduct, particularly in light of Prigmore's authority, his\n\nknowledge of the three-to-two lumen change, and his awareness of\n\nthe   relevant     regulatory    requirements.          This    evidence    is\n\nsufficient to implicate Prigmore in the conspiracy of which he\n\nwas convicted.\n\n                                      III.\n\n              As we have stated, there was substantial evidence that\n\ndefendants in fact committed the serious crime of which the jury\n\nconvicted them.      But there is too great a possibility that the\n\njury’s verdicts were affected by an erroneous failure to define\n\ncrucial and disputed regulatory terms for us to affirm the\n\nconvictions under the harmless-error doctrine.                 We thus vacate\n\ndefendants'      convictions    and   remand   for   further      proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n              Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -63-\n\f",

On August 24, 1995, after a\n\ntwenty-seven day trial, a jury convicted defendants-appellants\n\nLee H. Leichter, John F. Cvinar, and David W. Prigmore of\n\nconspiring to defraud and impair the functioning of the United\n\nStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in connection with its\n\noversight and regulation of medical devices.                See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n371.      The jury simultaneously acquitted George Maloney and\n\nKenneth    Thurston    of    the   same    charge.    The     district   court\n\nthereafter sentenced each convicted defendant to 18 months'\n\nimprisonment and two years of supervised release, but stayed\n\nexecution of the sentences pending appeals.             In these appeals,\n\nLeichter, Cvinar, and Prigmore (\"defendants\") raise a host of\n\narguments challenging the legality of their convictions.

The amendments made the FDA responsible for\n\nensuring   the       safety    and    effectiveness       of    medical    devices\n\ndistributed to the American public.                 This prosecution proceeded\n\non the theory that, in testing and marketing medical devices\n\nknown as \"heart catheters,\" the defendants conspired to violate\n\nprovisions      of    these    statutes       and     regulations      promulgated\n\nthereunder.\n\n           A    heart    catheter     is    a    tiny   instrument     consisting\n\nprimarily of a thin metal wire with a small inflatable balloon\n\nat or near one end.       The device is used in a surgical procedure\n\ncalled   angioplasty,         which   seeks      to   treat    heart   disease   by\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fopening   clogged     coronary     arteries.         During      angioplasty,      a\n\nphysician    inserts   a   heart       catheter   into      a    patient's   body,\n\ntypically through an artery in the leg or groin area.                            The\n\nphysician     then    steers     the     device      through      the   patient's\n\ncirculatory system to the site of the blockage and inflates the\n\nballoon with fluid.        As it is inflated, the balloon breaks the\n\n\"plaque\" that is clogging the artery and pushes it against the\n\nartery wall.     The physician subsequently withdraws the liquid,\n\ndeflates the balloon, and removes it and the catheter, thereby\n\nallowing blood to flow freely through the artery.\n\n            Regulations promulgated pursuant to the FDCA and MDA\n\ndesignate heart catheters as Class III medical devices.                          See\n\ngenerally 21 C.F.R. Part 870.           Class III medical devices are the\n\nmost heavily regulated medical devices in the country.                       See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 360c(a).      Before a manufacturer may market a new Class\n\nIII medical device, the manufacturer must apply for and receive\n\n\"premarket     approval\"    (PMA)       from   the     FDA.        21   U.S.C.     §\n\n360c(a)(C).      In    connection       with   its    PMA       application,     the\n\nmanufacturer must submit information sufficient to provide the\n\nFDA with \"reasonable assurance\" that, inter alia, the device is\n\nboth \"safe\" and \"effective.\"            21 U.S.C. § 360e(d)(2).\n\n            Under the MDA,\n\n            [T]he safety and effectiveness of a [Class\n            III] device are to be determined –\n\n                                        -5-\n\f                     (A) with respect to the\n                persons for whose use the\n                device   is  represented  or\n                intended,\n\n                     (B) with respect to the\n                conditions of use prescribed,\n                recommended, or suggested in\n                the labeling of the device,\n                and\n\n                     (C) weighing any probable\n                benefit to health from use of\n                the    device   against    any\n                probable risk of injury or\n                illness from such use.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(2).   Regulations promulgated pursuant to\n\nthis statute (and others) elaborate:\n\n                In   determining   the   safety   and\n         effectiveness of a device for purposes of\n         [deciding whether to grant] . . . premarket\n         approval   of   class   III   devices,   the\n         Commissioner . . . will consider the\n         following, among other relevant factors: (1)\n         The persons for whose use the device is\n         represented or intended; (2) The conditions\n         of use for the device, including conditions\n         of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested\n         in the labeling or advertising of the\n         device, and other intended conditions of\n         use; (3) The probable benefit to health from\n         the use of the device weighed against any\n         probable injury or illness from such use;\n         and (4) The reliability of the device.\n\n21 C.F.R. § 860.7(b).\n\n                There is reasonable assurance that a\n         device is safe when it can be determined,\n         based upon valid scientific evidence, that\n         the probable benefits to health from use of\n         the device for its intended uses and\n         conditions of use, when accompanied by\n\n                             -6-\n\f            adequate directions and warnings against\n            unsafe use, outweigh any probable risks.\n\nId. § 860.7(d)(1).\n\n                   There is reasonable assurance that a\n            device   is   effective   when  it    can  be\n            determined, based upon valid scientific\n            evidence, that in a significant portion of\n            the targeted population, the use of the\n            device for its intended uses and conditions\n            of  use,    when  accompanied   by   adequate\n            directions for use and warnings against\n            unsafe   use,    will   provide    clinically\n            significant results.\n\nId. § 860.7(e)(1).\n\n            Two additional sets of regulations governing Class III\n\nsurgical devices are of particular importance to this case, so\n\nwe describe them in some detail.        The first requires, insofar as\n\nis relevant, that a manufacturer of a previously approved Class\n\nIII surgical device \"submit a PMA supplement for review and\n\napproval by FDA before making a change affecting the safety or\n\neffectiveness of the device . . . .\"        21 C.F.R. § 814.39(a).    As\n\nwith   an   application   for   initial    PMA,   the   so-called   \"PMA\n\nsupplement\" must contain scientific information that provides a\n\nbasis for approval of the modified device.        See id. § 814.39(c).\n\nThe regulation lists eight \"types of changes\" for which a PMA\n\nsupplement must be filed \"if [the changes] affect the safety or\n\neffectiveness of the device,\" id. § 814.39(a), including the\n\nfollowing:     \"[n]ew indications for use of the device,\" id.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f§   814.39(a)(1);   \"[t]he     use     of   a    different         facility    or\n\nestablishment to manufacture, process, or package the device,\"\n\nid. § 814.39(a)(3); and \"[c]hanges in the performance or design\n\nspecifications, circuits, components, ingredients, principle of\n\noperation,     or   physical     layout         of    the     device,\"        id.\n\n§ 814.39(a)(7).     By operation of § 814.39(c) (\"All procedures\n\nand actions that apply to [a PMA] application under § 814.20\n\nalso apply to PMA supplements . . .\"), the manufacturer also\n\nmust \"periodically update [a] pending [PMA] application with new\n\nsafety and effectiveness information learned about the device\n\nfrom on-going or completed studies that may reasonably affect an\n\nevaluation of the safety or effectiveness of the device . . . .\"\n\nId. § 814.20(e).\n\n          As   implied   by    the     regulations          just    quoted,     a\n\nmanufacturer need not submit a PMA supplement \"if the change\n\ndoes not affect the device's safety and effectiveness . . .,\n\ne.g., an editorial change in labeling which does not affect the\n\nsafety or effectiveness of the device.\"              Id. § 814.39(b).         But\n\nwhere the FDA has required periodic reports as a condition of\n\napproval of the device, the manufacturer must report any changes\n\nto the FDA \"in [its] postapproval periodic reports . . . .\"                   Id.\n\nThe PMAs of the heart catheters at issue in this case explicitly\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\frequired postapproval reports documenting any and all changes to\n\nthe catheters.\n\n           The       second       set       of     regulations    underlying    this\n\nprosecution      arise   from       the      background    fact   that,    prior   to\n\nsubmitting a PMA application or PMA supplement, the manufacturer\n\nof a new or modified Class III medical device may desire to test\n\nthe device in humans.             To do so lawfully, the manufacturer must\n\napply to the FDA for an \"investigational device exemption\"\n\n(IDE).    An     IDE   \"permits         a    device    that    otherwise   would   be\n\nrequired . . . to have premarket approval to be shipped lawfully\n\nfor the purpose of conducting investigations of that device.\"\n\n21 C.F.R. § 812.1(a).              An IDE thus permits limited use of an\n\nunapproved device for the purpose of collecting human test data.\n\nSee id.   But the testing regulations themselves specify a number\n\nof situations in which an IDE is not a prerequisite to the\n\ninvestigational use of unapproved Class III medical devices in\n\nhumans.        See     id.    §         812.2(a),       (c).       Such    “exempted\n\ninvestigations” include \"consumer preference testing\" and the\n\n\"testing of a modification\" to an approved Class III medical\n\ndevice, so long as \"the testing is not for the purpose of\n\ndetermining [the unapproved device's] safety or effectiveness\n\nand does not put subjects at risk.\"                    Id. § 812.2(c)(4).\n\n\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fB.     Relevant Factual Background\n\n              Defendants had leadership positions at United States\n\nCatheter and Instrument, Inc. (USCI), a division of C.R. Bard,\n\nInc. (Bard), for most or all of the alleged conspiracy period,\n\nwhich ran from 1987 to 1990.          Defendant Leichter was USCI's head\n\nof regulatory affairs and quality assurance; defendant Cvinar\n\nwas USCI's president; and defendant Prigmore, who previously had\n\nbeen    president    of    USCI,    was   until     September        1989   a    vice\n\npresident at Bard with authority over USCI's operations.                         All\n\nthree defendants had offices in Billerica, Massachusetts, where\n\nUSCI operated a manufacturing plant and maintained its corporate\n\nheadquarters.\n\n              USCI's chief decision-making body was its Management\n\nBoard.        Cvinar presided over the Board and Leichter was a\n\nmember.       Cvinar reported to Prigmore.             Representatives from\n\nmiddle management at USCI made up an organization known as the\n\n\"Breakfast Club.\"         The Breakfast Club reported regularly to the\n\nBoard and provided the Board with the minutes of its meetings.\n\nThe Breakfast Club had no authority to make decisions without\n\nthe    Board's    approval.        Leichter   was    not    a   member      of    the\n\nBreakfast Club, but he sometimes attended its meetings.\n\n              The conspiracy alleged in this case involved two lines\n\nof    heart    catheters    manufactured      by    USCI.       In    1987,      USCI\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fintroduced the first line, which we shall call the \"Probe Line,\"\n\nwith a catheter known as \"Probe A.\"                  In 1988, USCI modified\n\nProbe A and renamed it \"Probe B.\"               In early 1989, USCI began\n\ndistributing Probe B commercially.             Later in 1989, USCI modified\n\nProbe B and renamed it \"Probe C.\"               At trial, the government's\n\nconspiracy theory with respect to the Probe Line was that, under\n\ndefendants'      leadership     and    with    defendants'    knowledge   and\n\napproval, USCI tested Probe B and Probe C in humans in violation\n\nof the Class III medical device testing regulations; marketed\n\nProbe B and Probe C in violation of the Class III medical device\n\nmarketing regulations; and otherwise deceived the FDA in order\n\nto avoid the agency's oversight.\n\n           In 1987, the second line of heart catheters, which we\n\nshall call the \"Miniprofile Line,\" featured a catheter called\n\nthe \"Simplus.”      In 1988, the Simplus evolved into a catheter\n\ncalled    the   \"Miniprofile,”        which,    in   1989,   evolved   into   a\n\ncatheter called the \"Solo.\"             In 1989, USCI also filed a PMA\n\nsupplement for a catheter called the \"Solo Sr.,\" but the company\n\nnever manufactured the Solo Sr. and ultimately withdrew the\n\nfiling.    With respect to the Miniprofile Line, the government's\n\nconspiracy      theory   once   again     was    that,   under   defendants'\n\nleadership and with defendants' knowledge and approval, USCI\n\ncommitted a number of violations of the Class III medical device\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\ftesting and marketing regulations and otherwise lied to the FDA\n\nto avoid the agency's oversight.       The following is a summary of\n\nthe evidence supporting the government's conspiracy theories.\n\n         1.    The Probe Line\n\n         In the early 1980s, when angioplasty first became\n\navailable in this country, USCI controlled 100% of the market\n\nfor heart catheters.    By the late 1980s, however, USCI's market\n\nshare had declined by about half and the market had become very\n\ncompetitive.     When USCI introduced the FDA-approved Probe A in\n\n1987, the device initially sold very well.       But the device had\n\na significant limitation.     Although USCI marketed Probe A with\n\na label warning that it should not be rotated more than one full\n\nturn (360 degrees) in the same direction, physicians performing\n\nangioplasties sometimes saw it as necessary to rotate the device\n\nbeyond its warned-against limitation.       When this occurred, the\n\ndevice's balloon had a tendency to wrap itself around the wire,\n\nwhich prevented deflation.      This, in turn, blocked blood flow\n\nthrough the artery and complicated efforts to remove the device\n\nfrom the body.\n\n         USCI's solution to Probe A's wrapping problem was Probe\n\nB, a redesigned version of the same catheter.       In Probe A, the\n\nballoon attached at the end of the wire, but in Probe B, the\n\nballoon attached to a polymer tube threaded over the wire.       The\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fresult was that Probe B could be rotated more than once in the\n\nsame   direction     without    the      balloon     becoming       entangled.\n\nUnfortunately,     however,     the     new    design     created    different\n\nproblems.\n\n            There was evidence that, in actual use in humans, Probe\n\nB's wire broke 25 times more frequently than Probe A's wire.\n\nThere also was evidence that, when compared to Probe A, these\n\nbreaks were far more likely to occur when the device was rotated\n\nmore   than   once   in   the    same        direction.      Moreover,    the\n\nconsequences of a Probe B wire break tended to be more serious.\n\nIn the relatively unlikely event of a Probe A wire break, the\n\ncatheter's metal tip typically would not detach and could be\n\nremoved with the wire and balloon.              By contrast, when Probe B\n\nbroke, the broken tip frequently could not be removed with the\n\nrest of the catheter.     In such a situation, the physician either\n\nhad to leave the tip in the patient or remove it by invasive\n\nsurgery.    Evidence of these problems poured into USCI in early\n\n1989, but, contrary to the urgings of certain USCI \"Crisis Team\"\n\nmembers appointed by Cvinar to handle the situation, USCI, and\n\nthen Bard, declined to order a voluntary recall of Probe B.\n\n            The government contends that this disastrous state of\n\naffairs was a direct result of USCI violating the regulations\n\ngoverning the testing and marketing of Class III medical devices\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fin connection with bringing Probe B to market.     We start with a\n\nsynopsis of the evidence of unlawful testing in connection with\n\nProbe B.\n\n                 a.   Misconduct Involving the Probe B\n\n           On November 11, 1988, one of Leichter's subordinates\n\nfiled a PMA supplement for Probe B asserting that it should be\n\napproved without being tested in humans.      Upon receipt of the\n\nsupplement, the FDA questioned USCI's assertion and asked for\n\nproof that clinical testing was unnecessary.     In a December 13,\n\n1988 letter and in a December 15, 1988 meeting, certain of\n\nLeichter's subordinates explained to FDA representatives that\n\nProbe B's safety and effectiveness had been established by\n\nlaboratory \"bench\" testing and that the FDA could rely on data\n\nsubmitted in connection with Probe A's PMA application because\n\nthe two devices were similar.         The December 13 letter also\n\nexplained that clinical testing was not necessary because bench\n\ntesting had showed that Probe B \"allows for more independent\n\nrotation of the core wire and balloon\" than Probe A.      Leichter\n\nsent the Management Board a copy of the December 13 letter and\n\na memorandum summarizing the December 15 meeting.        On these\n\ndocuments he handwrote \"Excellent work.\"      On January 19, 1989,\n\nthe FDA approved Probe B for commercial distribution without\n\nrequiring testing in humans.\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f            In fact, however, notwithstanding its representations\n\nto the FDA and without having applied for an IDE, in late\n\nOctober 1988, USCI began shipping Probe B catheters for purposes\n\nof    gathering    feedback   as   to     how   they    performed     in   humans.\n\nDocumentary evidence suggests that this feedback gathering,\n\nwhich USCI called \"disaster checking,\" was for purposes of\n\nascertaining Probe B's rotational capabilities, steerability,\n\nand \"performance characteristics . . . as compared to the [Probe\n\nA].\"    The government contends that testing for such purposes was\n\nsafety or effectiveness testing, and thus violated a negative\n\nimplication to be found in the Class III medical device testing\n\nregulations: that an unapproved Class III medical device may not\n\nbe tested in humans for safety or effectiveness without an IDE.\n\nSee    generally    21   C.F.R.    Part    812.        With   the   exception    of\n\nPrigmore,    who    explicitly     challenges     the     sufficiency      of   the\n\ngovernment's proof linking him with this evidence, defendants do\n\nnot dispute that they were aware of and approved of this course\n\nof conduct.   Rather, pointing to testimonial evidence supporting\n\ntheir case theory, they (joined by Prigmore arguing in the\n\nalternative) take the position that this \"testing\" was solely\n\nfor purposes of establishing consumer preferences; was not for\n\npurposes of determining safety or effectiveness as defendants\n\nreasonably understood the regulations to define those terms; and\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fdid not pose risks to humans beyond those associated with Probe\n\nA.   Defendants thus understood the testing to be exempted from\n\nPart 812's IDE requirements by § 812.2(c)(4).            We shall have\n\nconsiderably more to say on the defendants' understanding of\n\nPart 812 and the terms \"safety\" and \"effectiveness\" later in\n\nthis opinion.\n\n          The government also argues that, in bringing Probe B\n\nto market, USCI violated the Class III medical device marketing\n\nviolations in two ways.    First, USCI failed to report to the FDA\n\nthat it was conducting clinical tests in humans in several\n\ndocuments:     the Probe B PMA supplement (which was filed after\n\nclinical tests in humans began in October 1988); the December\n\n13, 1988 letter to the FDA; the December 15, 1988 meeting with\n\nFDA representatives; and the subsequent updates required by the\n\nFDA when it approved Probe A.            See 21 C.F.R. §§ 814.39(c),\n\n814.20(e).     Moreover, USCI failed to report that, in Probe B's\n\nclinical tests, the device experienced breakage rates far beyond\n\nthose reported with respect to Probe A as marketed.             See id.\n\nHere too, only Prigmore disputes the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nthat he was aware of Probe B's test results and the subsequent\n\nfailure   to   share   those   results    with   the   FDA;   the   other\n\ndefendants take the position that, under their understanding of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fthe regulatory mandates and the typical circumstances of a Probe\n\nB tip break, no reporting was required.\n\n           Second, USCI representatives were marketing Probe B\n\nwith the claim that it could be rotated more than once in the\n\nsame direction even though Probe B’s PMA supplement represented\n\nthat the device would retain Probe A's label warning against\n\nmore than a single revolution.         There was evidence that, despite\n\nthe label warning, the device was presented to USCI sales staff\n\nas   the   solution      to    Probe     A's      rotational    limitations.\n\nPresentations to sales staff at the company's annual national\n\nmeeting held at Lake Tahoe, California, from January 15-17,\n\n1989, left at least one salesman with the impression that \"Probe\n\nB could be torqued more than once, and that was the whole idea\n\nof   freeing   the   wire     [from    the   balloon].\"        Also,   written\n\npromotional materials for Probe B explained that \"[t]his new\n\ndevice allows increased torque delivery because of the new\n\ndesign\" and that \"with every rotation, it's the wire you're\n\nsteering and not the balloon.\"           In addition, a USCI videotape\n\ndesigned to instruct doctors on use of Probe B contained remarks\n\nfrom a doctor suggesting that the device could be rotated two or\n\nthree times.\n\n           USCI's sales force, which had been instructed to warn\n\nphysicians     against   overrotation        of   Probe   A,   were    not   so\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\finstructed with respect to Probe B.         Indeed, USCI sales staff\n\ninformed physicians that, although there would be no labeling\n\nchange, Probe B contained improvements \"that should prevent the\n\ntwisting problem\" that occurred with overrotation of Probe A.\n\nOne USCI representative told a doctor that he could rotate Probe\n\nB as many as 10 times, and another told several doctors at a\n\nphysicians' conference that they could rotate the device up to\n\n15 times (although the second representative subsequently was\n\nadmonished not to advocate such extreme use).\n\n           Defendants do not contest that USCI representatives in\n\nfact told physicians that they could rotate Probe B more than\n\nonce, and that USCI promotional materials might have given the\n\nsame impression.    Defendants vigorously contest, however, that\n\nthey   themselves   knew   of   and   condoned   promotion   of   Probe   B\n\ncontrary to its label warning.         The evidence as to defendants’\n\nknowledge and condonation was thin; Cvinar and Prigmore attended\n\nthe January 1989 Lake Tahoe conference, but no witness placed\n\nthem at the presentation in question.       All promotional materials\n\nrelating to use of a Class III device were approved by the\n\nregulatory affairs department (which Leichter headed), but there\n\nwas evidence that the doctor’s remarks on the videotape were\n\nadded after regulatory affairs had approved it.          In any event,\n\nno witness or document ever directly tied defendants to the\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fpromotional materials in question.        Finally, there was evidence\n\nthat Leichter insisted that label warnings be followed when he\n\nlearned that some USCI salespeople had been promoting Probe B\n\ncontrary to its label warnings.\n\n                  b.    Misconduct Involving the Probe C\n\n         The government asserts that USCI committed similar\n\nregulatory infractions with respect to the testing and marketing\n\nof Probe C.    In early 1989, at the same time the Crisis Team was\n\nreacting to the problems with Probe B, USCI was working urgently\n\non modifications designed to rectify those problems.         The result\n\nwas Probe C.    USCI bench tested eight Probe C prototypes and,\n\nwithout having secured an IDE from the FDA, shipped two or three\n\nof the prototypes for use in humans to see whether the changes\n\nimproved the strength of the catheter's tip and thus reduced the\n\nchance of breakage.     Some of the prototypes used in humans did\n\nnot perform as well as Probe B, but, by March 1989, USCI had\n\nsettled on a final version.    In this version, USCI increased the\n\ndiameter of the device's core wire by 30% and eliminated a\n\nsolder joint used to attach the wire to a spring.             USCI also\n\nmodified the device's assembly process.\n\n         USCI    then   marketed    Probe   C   without   filing   a   PMA\n\nsupplement.    In fact, the company took steps that can be taken\n\nto evince an intent to conceal Probe C’s changes and thus to\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fblur the differences between Probe C and its predecessor.       For\n\nexample, USCI basically retained the Probe B label for the new\n\ndevice but placed on the label an inconspicuous dot or small\n\nletter \"C\" so that USCI, and USCI alone, would know the model's\n\nidentity.    In the government's view, the unapproved testing and\n\nmarketing of Probe C was unlawful because the testing was for\n\npurposes of establishing the device's safety or effectiveness,\n\nsee 21 C.F.R. Part 812, and because the new product contained\n\ndesign changes affecting its safety or effectiveness, see id.\n\n§ 814.39(a), (b).      Once more, Prigmore contests the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence establishing his knowledge and approval of\n\nUSCI's conduct with respect to Probe C, and the other defendants\n\nassert that their conduct was perfectly lawful under their\n\nunderstanding of the applicable regulations.\n\n                  c.    Additional Deceptions\n\n            In the spring of 1989, the FDA learned that USCI had\n\nmodified Probe B so as to create Probe C without filing a PMA\n\nsupplement.    At the same time, the FDA came into possession of\n\ninformation that caused it to become concerned about Probe B tip\n\nbreaks.     On April 25, 1989, an FDA reviewer met with Leichter\n\nand informed him that she was concerned whether Probe B was\n\nsufficiently safe.       Leichter denied that there were safety\n\nconcerns and failed to reveal the tip breaks that had occurred\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fduring the investigational use of Probe B in humans.            The next\n\nday, Prigmore sent Leichter a memo conveying a \"personal 'job\n\nwell done' with regard to your recent dealings on the Probe, and\n\nparticularly your meeting with the FDA.\"\n\n          The FDA later requested explanations for both Probe B's\n\nfailure rates and USCI's failure to file a PMA supplement with\n\nrespect to Probe C.       On May 15, 1989, USCI responded to the\n\nFDA's concerns by letter.      All three defendants spent several\n\nhours   reviewing   the   contents   of    the   letter.      The   letter\n\nexplained that, following field observation and analysis of\n\nbroken catheters, it had become clear to USCI that Probe B's\n\nbreakage problems were attributable to \"overtorque[ing] during\n\nclinical use while the tip was restricted.\"        In other words, the\n\ndevice was only breaking when it was being used contrary to its\n\nlabel warning against more than a single revolution in either\n\ndirection.   The letter also took the position that Probe B was\n\nsufficiently safe because the device's actual breakage rate was\n\nstatistically identical to the breakage rate of Probe A observed\n\nin clinical testing and reported to the FDA before the agency\n\nacted favorably on the Probe A PMA application.            But the letter\n\ndid not reveal that the tip of Probe B had a tendency to remain\n\nin the patient following a break.         Nor did it acknowledge that,\n\nin actual use, Probe B in fact broke 25 times more frequently\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fthan did Probe A, and that, during what defendants call the\n\n\"consumer preference testing\" of Probe B, the device broke many\n\ntimes   more    frequently   than     did    Probe    A   in   actual    use.\n\nDefendants     contend   that,   under     their    understanding   of    the\n\nregulations and the circumstances of Probe B tip breaks, none of\n\nthe foregoing representations or omissions was fraudulent.\n\n          The letter also explained that, although the design\n\nmodifications in Probe C \"substantially reduced the risk of\n\ncritical tip failure,\" these modifications did not affect the\n\ndevice's safety or effectiveness.           The asserted basis for these\n\nseemingly contradictory assertions was a tripartite argument:\n\n(1) the regulations only require the filing of a PMA supplement\n\nwhen a design modification affects the safety or effectiveness\n\nof the device when it is used in accordance with its labeling;\n\n(2) the modifications to Probe B inhering in Probe C only\n\naffected (by improving) the safety and effectiveness of the\n\ndevice when it was used in a manner contrary to its labeling\n\n(i.e., when, contrary to its label warning, the device was\n\nrotated more than a single revolution in the same direction);\n\nand (3) the modified catheter that became Probe C thus could be\n\nmarketed without a PMA supplement.                 This argument presaged\n\ndefendants' trial position in the dispute about the meaning of\n\nthe regulations at the core of this case.\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f            On June 9, 1989, the FDA ordered a recall of Probes B\n\nand   C   and    directed    USCI   to    file    a   PMA     supplement   before\n\nmarketing Probe C in the future.              In August 1989, USCI submitted\n\nsuch a supplement.          In the supplement, USCI asserted that the\n\nProbe C was in fact safe and effective and cited in support of\n\nthis claim the data gathered during its earlier investigational\n\nuse of the device in humans, along with additional follow-up\n\ndata collected at the direction of the FDA.                   The PMA supplement\n\nstated without limitation that Probe C had been \"distributed\n\nfrom March 1989 until August 1989\" in order \"to determine the\n\nsafety and efficacy of the device.\"\n\n            2.     The Miniprofile Line\n\n            During the conspiracy period, the Miniprofile line was\n\nUSCI's second most profitable line of catheters, ranking just\n\nbehind the Probe line in sales.                  At trial, the government\n\nintroduced       evidence   tending      to   show    that,    with   defendants'\n\nknowledge and approval, USCI engaged in four courses of conduct\n\nwith respect to the Miniprofile line that the government sees as\n\nfraudulent:       (1) in late 1987, USCI changed the manufacturing\n\nlocation for the Miniprofile line and then marketed catheters\n\nmanufactured at the new location without obtaining the FDA's\n\nprior approval; (2) in 1988, USCI modified the design of the\n\nMiniprofile, tested the modified catheter in humans without\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fhaving secured an IDE, marketed the modified version without\n\nhaving filed a PMA supplement, and adopted complex inventory\n\nsorting and labeling methods designed to conceal the change; (3)\n\nin 1989, in PMA supplements filed in connection with several\n\nadditional changes to the Miniprofile, USCI (a) represented that\n\nclinical testing was not necessary to evaluate the safety or\n\neffectiveness of the changes at the same time it allegedly was\n\nconducting such testing, and (b) failed to reveal the 1988\n\ndesign   change;   and   (4)   in   August   1989,   USCI   filed    a   PMA\n\nsupplement crafted to \"legitimize\" the 1988 design change.                We\n\nelaborate briefly on each of these four blocs of evidence.\n\n                   a.    The Change in Manufacturing Location\n\n          As previously detailed, the first catheter in the\n\nMiniprofile line was called the \"Simplus.\"             Until the end of\n\n1987, USCI manufactured the Simplus at a plant in Billerica,\n\nMassachusetts.      In September 1987, USCI acquired a factory\n\nbuilding in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and began preparations to\n\nmove its Simplus manufacturing operations there.                 The move\n\nrequired approximately six weeks of work from a 25-person crew,\n\nstructural changes to the buildings, and the installation of\n\nfilters and purifiers to de-ionize the air and water.            The idea\n\nwas   essentially       to   \"replicate\"     the     Billerica      Simplus\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fmanufacturing operations, although only some Billerica machines\n\nand workers were transferred to the new plant.\n\n            On December 15, 1987, USCI filed a PMA supplement\n\nrequesting       FDA   approval    to    manufacture      the    Simplus    at    its\n\nHaverhill facility.         On March 3, 1988, the FDA sent inspectors\n\nto   the   Haverhill      plant.        After    a   five-day    inspection,       the\n\ninspectors identified a number of problems with various pieces\n\nof equipment at the new plant.             On March 23, 1988, Cvinar wrote\n\nto the FDA and promised to correct the problems.                         On June 7,\n\n1988, the FDA approved the PMA supplement for the Haverhill\n\nfacility,       stating   in   a   cover    letter     that     \"[y]ou   may     begin\n\nmarketing of the device manufactured at this facility upon\n\nreceipt of this letter.\"            But by that time, USCI already had\n\nmarketed     several      thousand       catheters      manufactured        at     the\n\nHaverhill plant.\n\n            As noted above, the regulations for Class III medical\n\ndevices require the filing of a PMA supplement when an approved\n\ndevice     is     manufactured       at     \"a       different     facility        and\n\nestablishment\" and the change in location affects the device's\n\nsafety or effectiveness.            See 21 C.F.R. § 814.39(a)(3).                 The\n\ngovernment takes the position that the move from Billerica to\n\nHaverhill was one that affected safety or effectiveness and thus\n\nrequired FDA approval prior to the marketing of any catheters\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fassembled in Haverhill.             Defendants respond that, because the\n\nHaverhill operations were designed to replicate the Billerica\n\noperations, the move was \"safety neutral\" and the PMA supplement\n\nUSCI filed was in fact unnecessary.              Defendants also contest the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence linking them with the decision to\n\nmarket Haverhill-manufactured catheters prior to FDA approval.\n\n\n\n\n                      b. The 1988 Design Change\n\n             On May 24, 1988, the FDA approved the marketing of the\n\nMiniprofile      catheter,      which    evolved       from   the    Simplus.       As\n\napproved, the Miniprofile contained three \"lumens,\" which are\n\nthe   tiny    tubes    used    to    inflate     and    deflate      the   balloon.\n\nOriginally, USCI intended to manufacture the Miniprofile with a\n\n\"fast purge\" system that facilitated quick elimination of air\n\nfrom the lumens prior to filling them with the liquid that would\n\ninflate    the     balloon.       The   fast   purge     system     was    patented,\n\nhowever,     and     USCI     ultimately       could    not    use    it    in     the\n\nMiniprofile.\n\n             Following      its     commercialization,         the     Miniprofile\n\ndeveloped a reputation for having a deflation problem.                           There\n\nwas evidence that the problem was largely traceable to end users\n\nnot preparing and purging the catheter in accordance with the\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\finstructions in its labeling.             But there also was evidence that\n\nthe round shape of the Miniprofile's lumens may have been a\n\ncontributing factor.            In any event, the perception that the\n\nMiniprofile had a deflation problem affected sales, and USCI\n\nbegan     investigating        the   possibility        of   an   ameliorative\n\nmodification.\n\n               Eventually, USCI decided that a reduction in the number\n\nof lumens from three to two would positively affect Miniprofile\n\ndeflation issues.            The company created a two-lumen prototype\n\nand, after bench testing, shipped it for investigational use in\n\nhumans.    USCI did not secure an IDE prior to its investigation\n\nof the device, the objective of which (as stated in an internal\n\nUSCI document) was \"[t]o evaluate the 2 Lumen Mini/Simplus\n\ncatheter for improved inflation/deflation times; and to verify\n\nthat non-deflation of the balloon will not occur.\"                 On November\n\n3, 1988, a USCI employee sent the Management Board and Breakfast\n\nClub a memorandum summarizing the results of the company's\n\ntesting.        On November 7, 1988, Cvinar informed Prigmore in\n\nwriting that testing of the two-lumen Miniprofile had been\n\ncompleted,       that   the    testing    revealed     \"significantly      better\n\ninflation/deflation times with latest 2 lumen version,\"                       and\n\nthat    USCI    would   be    changing    to    the   two-lumen   design    \"post\n\nhaste.\"    On November 17, 1988, Cvinar sent the Management Board\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fa memo explaining that the changeover to a two-lumen Miniprofile\n\nwas a \"safety issue\" and linking the decision with the need to\n\n\"remain competitive in key market areas.\"\n\n            USCI did not file a PMA supplement prior to marketing\n\nthe two-lumen Miniprofile.            Moreover, the company took steps\n\nthat tend to evince an intent to conceal the change from the\n\nFDA.     For    example,    Leichter      would   not    permit    USCI's      vice\n\npresident of marketing to issue a brochure with a diagram of the\n\nmodified catheter because the diagram was \"inconsistent with\n\nwhat had been submitted to the FDA . . . .\"                       Leichter also\n\nrejected    a   subordinate’s       suggestion    that    the     label   of    the\n\nmodified    device     reflect      the   decreased      number     of    lumens,\n\nexplaining that \"[w]e don't want it to be evident to the FDA, so\n\nI would rather have something different that would not be so\n\nobvious.\"       Instead, USCI adopted more complicated inventory-\n\nsorting and labeling methods.             The government takes the now-\n\nfamiliar position that the testing and marketing of the two-\n\nlumen    Miniprofile       violated    the   Class      III   medical     device\n\nregulations because the testing was for purposes of determining\n\nthe modified device's safety or effectiveness yet was performed\n\nwithout an IDE, see 21 C.F.R. Part 812, and because the change\n\nfrom    three   to   two   lumens     affected    the    device's    safety      or\n\neffectiveness yet was implemented without a PMA supplement, see\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fid. § 814.39(a).              Here again, Prigmore asserts evidentiary\n\ninsufficiency      and     all   defendants       contend    that,      under    their\n\nunderstanding of the regulations, neither an IDE nor a PMA\n\nsupplement was required in connection with the testing and\n\nmarketing of the two-lumen Miniprofile.\n\n                      c.      The 1989 PMA Supplements\n\n              Throughout       1989,   USCI     modified    the   Miniprofile       by\n\ncreating versions of the device with (1) a silicone coating, (2)\n\na   balloon    bond   cured      by    ultraviolet      light,    (3)    longer    and\n\nthicker balloons, and (4) a thinner shaft (the so-called \"Solo\"\n\nmodel).       USCI filed PMA supplements for these modifications,\n\nasserting that clinical testing was not required to verify the\n\ncontinued safety and effectiveness of the device.                             In fact,\n\nhowever, USCI investigated how each of these models performed in\n\nhumans without having secured an IDE from the FDA.                        The plans\n\nfor   and   results      of    these    tests    were   documented       in    various\n\nmemoranda sent to Leichter and Cvinar.                   In addition, with the\n\nexception of the Solo submission (which in one section mentioned\n\nthat the device had two lumens), the PMA supplements for these\n\nmodifications did not reveal that the Miniprofile was, by 1989,\n\na two-lumen catheter.             This apparently was not an accident.\n\nThere was evidence that Leichter directed that a draft of the\n\nPMA supplement for the Miniprofile with the new balloon sizes be\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\faltered to remove a passage describing the catheter as having\n\ntwo lumens because \"right now it wasn't a good time\" to mention\n\nthe change in light of \"what had happened with the Probe.\"\n\n            Defendants' response to the government's argument that\n\nthis evidence suggests a conspiracy to defraud is basically the\n\nsame as that with respect to the three-to-two lumen change.\n\nPrigmore asserts that there is insufficient evidence that he\n\nknew or approved of these events.                The other defendants do not\n\ndisclaim the necessary knowledge and approval.                       Rather, they\n\nassert that the \"testing\" of these modifications without an IDE\n\nand the failure to reveal the three-to-two lumen change were not\n\nunlawful     given          their     understanding      of    the     regulatory\n\nrequirements.\n\n                       d.    The \"Legitimizing\" 1989 PMA Supplement\n\n            In August 1989, USCI allegedly conceived a plan to\n\nobtain post hoc FDA approval of the two-lumen Miniprofile.                    The\n\ncompany decided to file a PMA supplement for a new catheter in\n\nthe Miniprofile line called the \"Solo Sr.\"                The supplement would\n\ndisclose and seek approval for the three-to-two lumen change as\n\nif   it   were   not    already       a   done   deed.    As   explained    in   a\n\nmemorandum summarizing an August 30, 1989 Regulatory Affairs\n\nMeeting    attended          by     Leichter     and   Prigmore,     USCI   would\n\n\"'legitimize' the changes [it] ha[d] already made (3 lumen to 2\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\f.    .    .)\"    by   submitting    a   PMA    supplement        \"within   a    month.\"\n\nLeichter told a subordinate that the Solo Sr. PMA supplement was\n\ndesigned as a \"cleanup\" filing to secure FDA approval of a\n\nproduct already being shipped.                  As noted previously, the PMA\n\nsupplement submitted for the Solo Sr. was eventually withdrawn.\n\n                 During the late summer of 1989, Leichter walked into\n\na Management Board meeting carrying a group of files on the\n\nMiniprofile line and announced that the files were problematic\n\nand \"not clean.\"           William Longfield, the Chief Operating Officer\n\nof       Bard,    replied    by   asking      whether     the    records    could      be\n\n\"purged.\"         In response, Cvinar halted the meeting and sent the\n\nparticipants out of the room.                      After a break, the meeting\n\nresumed and the subject of purging the files did not arise\n\nagain.\n\n                 Despite    his   presence     at   the   meeting       where    it   was\n\ndecided that USCI would attempt to “legitimize” already-made\n\nchanges to the Miniprofile, Prigmore again argues that there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to prove that he knew of or condoned\n\nUSCI's       actions       with   respect     to    the   Solo    Sr.      The    other\n\ndefendants contend that the Solo Sr. was not in fact the then-\n\nextant Miniprofile, pointing to evidence that the device was to\n\nhave a blood-pressure monitoring capability not then present in\n\nthe Miniprofile.            In other words, defendants take the position\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fthat the Solo Sr. PMA supplement was not fraudulently filed in\n\nan    attempt     to   legitimize         already     made    changes      to    the\n\nMiniprofile; rather, it was filed \"in order to seek approval of\n\nchanges    and    features    other       than      the   number     of   lumens.\"\n\nDefendants additionally contend that the Solo Sr. PMA supplement\n\nwas filed at the direction and under the supervision of David\n\nThomas, USCI's Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and an\n\nimmunized government witness.\n\nC.    Relevant Procedural History\n\n              As indicated above, the primary defense theme at trial\n\nwas that, under defendants' understanding of the applicable\n\nstatutory and regulatory requirements, the testing and marketing\n\nefforts   at     the   root   of    the     charged       conspiracy      were   not\n\nfraudulent.      This theme had two components pressed by defendants\n\nin the alternative:      (1) defendants' understanding of the legal\n\nrequirements was correct; or (2) defendants' understanding of\n\nthe   legal    requirements,       even    if   incorrect,     was    objectively\n\nreasonable and therefore foreclosed a fraud prosecution based on\n\na stricter reading of the law.                  See, e.g., United States v.\n\nRowe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197937\"><a href=\"/opinion/197937/united-states-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-23 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying the rule\n\nthat, in a fraud prosecution premised on an alleged violation of\n\nambiguous positive law, the defendant is entitled to have his\n\nculpability assessed against the interpretation of the law that\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fmost tends to rebut the charge of intentional deceit so long as\n\nthe interpretation is objectively reasonable).\n\n            Although defendants took a number of different legal\n\npositions    based   on    the   specific      language   of    the   pertinent\n\nregulations, the foundation supporting their primary defense\n\ntheme tracked USCI's earlier argument, set forth in the May 15,\n\n1989   letter   to   the    FDA,   that    a   Class   III     medical   device\n\nmanufacturer is only required to file a PMA supplement when it\n\nmodifies an approved device and the modification affects the\n\ndevice's safety or effectiveness when the device is used in\n\naccordance with its \"intended conditions of use\" – i.e., the\n\nconditions    of   use    prescribed      in   the   labeling.        Thus,   the\n\nargument ran, modifications affecting the device's safety or\n\neffectiveness only during \"unlabeled,\" and thus unintended,\n\nconditions of use, such as overrotation with respect to the\n\nProbe line and improper preparation and purging with respect to\n\nthe Miniprofile line, did not affect the device's safety or\n\neffectiveness within the meaning of the applicable regulations.\n\n\n\n            In support of their argument, defendants relied heavily\n\nupon 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(2) and 21 C.F.R. § 860.7, which by\n\ntheir terms define for the FDA when a device is to be regarded\n\nas safe and effective.       These provisions combine to suggest that\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fthe safety and effectiveness of a device are to be determined\n\nby, inter alia, weighing its benefits to health against the\n\nprobable      risks    from     use    of   the    device        for    its   intended\n\nconditions of use.           See id.   In a nutshell, defendants' position\n\nwas    that,    if     the    FDA     determines       a    device's     safety    and\n\neffectiveness        within    the     context    of       the   device's     intended\n\nconditions of use, it was at least reasonable for them to assume\n\nthat       modifications       which     affect     a       device's      safety    or\n\neffectiveness only during unintended conditions of use do not\n\naffect      \"safety\"    or    \"effectiveness\"          within     the    meaning   the\n\napplicable law.1\n\n\n       1\n      As to the claim that the clinical testing described above\nviolated 21 C.F.R. Part 812 because it was done without an IDE\n\"to determine [the] safety and effectiveness\" of the various\ndevice modifications, § 812.2(a), defendants in part relied on\na derivative of their argument responding to the government's\nclaims of illegal marketing. With respect to modifications for\nwhich, in defendants' view, no PMA supplement was required,\ndefendants reasonably understood that an IDE also was not\nrequired because an IDE is nothing more than an \"exemption\npermit[ting] a device that otherwise would be required . . . to\nhave premarket approval to be shipped lawfully,\" id. § 812.1(a).\nWith respect to the preapproval testing conducted on modified\ndevices for which a PMA supplement admittedly was required\n(e.g., Probe B), defendants asserted that they regarded the\ntesting to be consumer preference testing exempted from the IDE\nrequirements by § 812.2(c)(4).\n     In their submissions to this court, defendants also hint at\nan all-encompassing argument that they reasonably did not regard\nany of the allegedly unlawful clinical \"testing\" charged by the\ngovernment to violate Part 812. According to this argument, as\nwe understand it, defendants reasonably read Part 812 as merely\nprescribing the protocols for the gathering of the \"valid\nscientific evidence\" upon which the FDA will assess the safety\n\n                                         -34-\n\f             The government did not agree with defendants' asserted\n\nunderstanding      of     the    crucial       statutory     and   regulatory\n\nprovisions, or with defendants' alternative argument that, even\n\nif   not   correct,      defendants'     understanding       was   objectively\n\nreasonable and therefore the appropriate benchmark against which\n\ncriminal liability should be judged.                Rather, the government\n\ntook   the     position     that   any        modification    known    by    the\n\nmanufacturer     to     affect   the    safety    or   effectiveness    of    an\n\napproved Class III device – even a modification only affecting\n\nsafety or effectiveness during unlabeled and warned-against\n\nconditions of use – triggers the obligation to file a PMA\n\nsupplement.     The government supported this so-called \"plain\" or\n\n\"dictionary\" meaning of the phrase \"affecting the safety or\n\neffectiveness of the device\" in 21 C.F.R. § 814.39(a) with the\n\ntestimony of two FDA experts and a Bard executive, all of whom\n\n\n\nand effectiveness of new and modified devices pursuant to §\n860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1).    The testing at issue in this case was\nnot for purposes of gathering this type of \"valid scientific\nevidence\"; it was more in the way of informal feedback gathered\non the front lines by USCI sales representatives and passed back\nto corporate headquarters. Thus, the argument concludes, while\nthe prior shipment of the catheters in question might have\nviolated § 814.39(a), their actual use in humans did not\nindependently violate Part 812.\n     Whatever merits this alternative argument might have, we\ndisregard it for present purposes because defendants did not\nsufficiently develop and preserve it as a defense theory in the\ndistrict court.

Although the experts gave\n\ntestimony that generally tended to support the government's\n\ncase, defendants were able to elicit on cross-examination of the\n\nFDA witnesses that a manufacturer attempting to divine the\n\nmeaning of the phrase \"affecting the safety or effectiveness of\n\nthe device\" reasonably might cross-reference § 860.7, and that\n\nthis   regulation   does   indeed   circumscribe      the   concepts       of\n\n\"safety\"   and   \"effectiveness\"    in   terms   of   \"intended   .    .    .\n\nconditions of use.\"\n\n           Consistent with their position on the meaning of the\n\nphrase \"affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device,\"\n\ndefendants requested that the district court instruct the jury\n\nto construe the phrase in the light cast by 21 C.F.R. § 860.7.\n\nAccordingly, defendants asked the court to quote § 860.7(d)(1)\n\nand (e)(1) verbatim and to instruct the jury to \"seek the\n\ndefinition[s] of 'safe' and 'effective'\" in these provisions.\n\nDefendants further asked that the court instruct the jury \"to\n\ndetermine the safety and effectiveness of a device or of a\n\nchange to a device, not under any conditions of use, but in\n\nlight of the conditions of use, directions for use, and warnings\n\nagainst unsafe use contained in the manufacturer's labeling for\n\nthat device.\"    Finally, defendants asked the court to instruct\n\n\n                                -36-\n\fthe jury that \"the defendants' interpretation of the standard\n\nthey were to use in determining safety and effectiveness was\n\nreasonable.\"\n\n           The    government,       by     contrast,      opposed   defendants'\n\nattempt to link 21 C.F.R. § 860.7 to the phrase \"affecting the\n\nsafety or effectiveness of the device\" in § 814.39(a).                          The\n\ngovernment argued that § 860.7 is intended only to guide the FDA\n\nas to whether a device is safe and/or effective; it is not\n\nintended   to    advise      the   manufacturers     of    Class    III    medical\n\ndevices    in    connection        with     their   PMA     supplement      filing\n\nobligations.       Accordingly,           the   government      asked   that,    in\n\ninstructing the jury, the district court (1) simply quote the\n\nrelevant portions of § 814.39 (but not § 860.7); (2) define the\n\nterms \"safety\" and \"effectiveness\" according to \"their plain\n\nordinary meaning,\" – i.e., \"freedom from danger or risks\" and\n\n\"having a definite or desired effect,\" respectively; and (3)\n\nstate   that    there   is    no   exemption     from     the   relevant    filing\n\nrequirements \"based upon a misuse of the device by users of the\n\ndevice,\" and that \"a PMA supplement must be filed . . . for a\n\nchange that affects safety and efficacy regardless of the reason\n\nfor the change\" – i.e., even if the change affects safety or\n\neffectiveness of the device only in the event of unlabeled or\n\nwarned-against conditions of use.\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\f           The district court did not adopt either approach.\n\nInstead, the court advised counsel on the day before closing\n\narguments that, although it would permit defendants and the\n\ngovernment to argue to the jury their respective interpretations\n\nof   the   applicable      Class    III     medical    device      statute   and\n\nregulations, it would only instruct on conspiracy to defraud.\n\nThe court thus would not instruct on either the meaning of the\n\nunderlying statute and regulations or objectively reasonable\n\ninterpretations thereof.\n\n           Accordingly, counsel for Leichter and Cvinar stressed\n\nin their closing arguments that, as the relevant statute and\n\nregulations   were     reasonably      understood     by   their     clients,   a\n\nmodification to an approved Class III medical device affected\n\nthe device's safety or effectiveness (and triggered the PMA\n\nsupplement    filing      requirement)      only    when   the     modification\n\nimpacted safety or effectiveness during the device's intended\n\nconditions    of   use.      Counsel      for   Leichter   and      Cvinar   also\n\nemphasized that the intended conditions of use were to be found\n\nin the device's labeling instructions and warnings.                 Counsel for\n\nPrigmore   primarily      focused   on    whether     there   was    sufficient\n\nevidence to tie his client to the conspiracy, but also joined in\n\nLeichter and Cvinar's legal arguments to the district court.\n\nThe government, for its part, prominently argued that \"safety\"\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\fand \"effectiveness\" should be given their plain or dictionary\n\nmeanings,      and     that     modifications           affecting       safety     or\n\neffectiveness        during   unlabeled        or    warned-against      uses    were\n\nsubject to the regulatory filing requirements.                       The government\n\nalso suggested that 21 C.F.R. § 860.7 is intended only to guide\n\nthe FDA in making its safety and effectiveness assessments, and\n\nhas no bearing on a manufacturer's obligation to file a PMA\n\nsupplement.\n\n            Subsequently, as promised, the district court declined\n\nto   instruct   the     jury    on     the   meaning      of    the    statute    and\n\nregulations.        Rather, the court instructed on the elements of\n\nconspiracy     to    defraud,    and    specified        that    defendants      were\n\naccused of conspiring to defraud the FDA in three respects:                       (1)\n\n\"knowingly and willfully, and with an intent to defraud, failing\n\nto submit applications for product approval and testing [to] the\n\nFDA,   which    allegedly       they    were        required    to    submit\";    (2)\n\n\"concealing or failing to report material facts which allegedly\n\nthey were required to report\"; and (3) \"making false statements\n\nin documents that they submitted to the FDA.\"\n\n            The district court also gave detailed state-of-mind\n\ninstructions, emphasizing that the government was required to\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants had knowledge of\n\ntheir legal duties (on this point, the court simply provided the\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fjury with copies of the applicable Class III medical device\n\nstatutory        and   regulatory         provisions);       that    defendants\n\nspecifically intended to agree to violate these duties and thus\n\ndefraud the FDA; and that defendants \"did not act in good faith\n\nor    by   mistake,    accident,     or    neglect.\"     Defendants      timely\n\nobjected to the court's refusal to instruct that the terms\n\n\"safety\" and \"effectiveness\" in the provisions spelling out\n\ndefendants' legal duties must be understood as described and\n\nconfined by 21 C.F.R. § 860.7 and, alternatively, to the court's\n\nrefusal     to   instruct   that    defendants'    interpretation       of   the\n\nregulatory requirements was at the very least reasonable.                     On\n\nthe    sixth     day   of   its    deliberations,      the    jury    convicted\n\ndefendants.       These appeals eventually ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\f                                    II.\n\n          As we stated at the outset, defendants raise a number\n\nof issues.     All three defendants press various arguments that\n\nthe underlying convictions should be reversed and the conspiracy\n\ncharge dismissed.    All three defendants also assert a number of\n\nalternative arguments that their convictions should be vacated\n\nand the matter remanded for further proceedings.                 Prigmore\n\nadditionally    contends,   again    in   the   alternative,    that   his\n\nsentence was unlawful.       In the end, we are not persuaded by\n\ndefendants' arguments for reversal and dismissal.              Yet we are\n\nconvinced that the convictions should be vacated and the case\n\nremanded for further proceedings.         To simplify our analysis, we\n\nshall begin by explaining why vacatur is warranted and then\n\nproceed to explain why reversal and dismissal is not.           We do not\n\nreach the merits of any arguments for vacatur beyond the one we\n\nregard as dispositive because, in any retrial, the issues giving\n\nrise to these other arguments are either not likely to arise\n\nagain or likely to arise in materially different contexts.             For\n\nthe same reason, we do not address the merits of Prigmore's\n\nsentencing challenge.\n\nA.   The Dispositive Issue\n\n          Defendants contend, inter alia, that the district court\n\ncommitted reversible error in refusing to instruct the jury that\n\n\n                                -41-\n\fdefendants' asserted understanding of when a change should be\n\nregarded as \"affecting the safety or effectiveness\" of a Class\n\nIII medical device, and thus trigger the PMA supplement filing\n\nrequirement, was at least reasonable and therefore the measure\n\nagainst     which      defendants'     criminal      culpability      should   be\n\nassessed.       In defendants' view, the trial record and the logic\n\nof the rule we applied in Rowe, see 144 F.3d at 21-23, entitled\n\nthem to such an instruction as a matter of law.                       We do not\n\nbelieve that the court was obliged to discuss the concept of\n\nreasonableness in its instructions; an instruction that the jury\n\nshould    simply       apply   a   definition   of    the    applicable   phrase\n\ninformed by the limitations of 21 C.F.R. § 860.7 and tailored to\n\nthe evidence in this case would have covered the point just as\n\nwell.    Nonetheless, on the facts of this case, we agree that the\n\ncourt erred in not instructing the jury to determine defendants'\n\nguilt against the backdrop of such a definition.\n\n               We begin by acknowledging that the district court has\n\nconsiderable discretion in how it formulates, structures, and\n\nwords    its    jury    instructions.      See,      e.g.,   United   States   v.\n\nWoodward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198059\"><a href=\"/opinion/198059/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 n.14 (1st Cir. 1998).                  Moreover, the\n\ncourt often acts within its discretion in refusing to elaborate\n\nthe meaning of even an important legal term or phrase that falls\n\nshort of being self-explanatory.                Indeed, we have recognized\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\fthat, in some instances, attempts to clarify inherently nebulous\n\nconcepts can do more harm than good.                  Cf. United States v.\n\nAndujar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining our repeated\n\nwarnings that district courts within this circuit should avoid\n\ndefining    the     phrase    \"reasonable       doubt\"       in   their     jury\n\ninstructions).      The applicable standard, informed in part by\n\nthese principles, is that a court's refusal to give a requested\n\ninstruction    is    reversible       error     only    if     the     requested\n\ninstruction was (1) substantively correct; (2) not substantially\n\ncovered    elsewhere    in    the     charge;     and    (3)      concerned      a\n\nsufficiently      important   point    that     the    failure    to    give    it\n\nseriously impaired the defendant's ability to present his or her\n\ndefense.

For the reasons just stated,\n\nand   regardless   how    the    phrase    \"affecting   the   safety     or\n\neffectiveness of the device\" in § 814.39(a) ultimately ought to\n\nbe understood, it was objectively reasonable for defendants to\n\nregard   the   phrase    as   definitionally    circumscribed    by     the\n\n\"intended . . . conditions of use\" qualification found in, among\n\nother places, § 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1).\n\n          That said, the government does not concede that the\n\ndistrict court committed reversible error in declining to give\n\nthe instruction defendants requested.

Such a definition was too narrow, according\n\nto the government, because there was evidence that, with respect\n\nto Probe B, defendants knew of and acquiesced in USCI's on-the-\n\nside promotion of the overrotation against which the device's\n\nlabel warned.       As the government sees it, all actual conditions\n\nof use that the manufacturer intends or even knows of are\n\nrelevant      to        the     safety-or-effectiveness                   inquiry,    and\n\nmodifications       affecting          a    device's      safety     or    effectiveness\n\n\n\n      4\n     It is undisputed that the instruction defendants requested\nwas not substantially covered elsewhere in the charge.      See\nRose, 104 F.3d at 1416.   Thus, we address only the first and\nthird prongs of the Rose standard.\n\n                                                -48-\n\fduring such conditions of use trigger the PMA supplement-filing\n\nrequirements even if they are specifically warned against on the\n\nlabel.   In making this argument, the government points out that\n\n§ 860.7(b)(2) specifies that \"[t]he conditions of use for [a]\n\ndevice[] includ[e] conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or\n\nsuggested in the labeling or advertising of the device, and\n\nother intended conditions of use.\"                 (emphasis supplied).5\n\n            Given the explicit references to intention in 21 C.F.R.\n\n§ 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1), and in the absence of some clarifying\n\nregulatory    or    judicial     gloss        to   support      the    government's\n\nposition,    see    Lanier,      520       U.S.    at   266    (recognizing     that\n\n\"uncertain\"        laws    can        be      clarified        by     authoritative\n\nconstruction),      we    are   not    persuaded        that   a    criminal   fraud\n\n\n\n    5The government also draws support for this argument from 21\nC.F.R. § 801.4, which was neither the subject of trial argument\nnor given to the jury. In relevant part, § 801.4 states:\n\n         The words \"intended uses\" or words of similar\n    import in [three regulations not relevant to this\n    case] refer to the objective intent of the persons\n    legally responsible for the labeling of devices. The\n    intent is determined by such persons' expressions or\n    may be shown by the circumstances surrounding the\n    distribution of the article.    The objective intent\n    may, for example, be shown by labeling claims,\n    advertising matter, or oral or written statements by\n    such persons or their representatives.     It may be\n    shown by the circumstances that the article is, with\n    the    knowledge   of   such    persons   or    their\n    representatives, offered and used for a purpose for\n    which it is neither labeled nor advertised . . . .\n\n                                           -49-\n\fprosecution          can    be   premised    upon     a   failure     to   file   a    PMA\n\nsupplement in connection with a modification to an approved\n\ndevice that affects the device's safety or effectiveness only\n\nwith       respect    to     a   sincerely    unintended        and   warned-against,\n\nalbeit       known,        condition   of    use. 6       Yet   we    think   that     the\n\nregulatory text does accommodate the government's argument that\n\na manufacturer must take into account unlabeled, though promoted\n\n(and thus “intended”), conditions of use in determining whether\n\na modification affects safety or effectiveness.                       Moreover, given\n\nthe evidence of USCI's promotion of Probe B overrotation, such\n\na jury instruction might well be necessary at any retrial if\n\nthere       is   sufficient        evidence    that       defendants       knew   of    or\n\nacquiesced to such promotion.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      We of course recognize that, if a modification makes an\napproved device more dangerous in the event of a condition of\nuse that sometimes occurs despite the manufacturer's best\nefforts to prevent it, there may be sound policy reasons for\nrequiring the manufacturer to file a PMA supplement. But we are\nconcerned here not with the most socially useful interpretation\nof the relevant regulations; we are concerned with whether those\nregulations gave fair warning that a failure to file a PMA\nsupplement in such a circumstance is a felony under federal law.\nSee Lanier, 520 U.S. at 265-67.      Because the most relevant\nregulation defines device safety in terms of \"intended . . .\nconditions of use,\" § 860(d)(1) (emphasis supplied), and because\nthere has been no authoritative judicial or regulatory\npronouncement clarifying that a sincerely warned-against but\nknown condition of use should be regarded as \"intended,\" see\nLanier, 520 U.S. at 266, we reject the government's argument on\nthis narrow point.\n\n                                            -50-\n\f            But under the circumstances of this case, we do not\n\nthink it appropriate to hold that the defendants' reference to\n\nlabeling in their requested instruction effectively waived their\n\nright to an instruction that, for purposes of this prosecution,\n\nthe \"intended . . . conditions of use\" qualification in 21\n\nC.F.R. § 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1) limits the meaning of the phrase\n\n\"affecting safety or effectiveness\" in § 814.39(a).                 Although\n\ndefendants' proposed instruction did request that the jury be\n\ninstructed in terms of labeling, it more generally requested\n\n(over the government's objection) that the jury be instructed in\n\nthe specific language of § 860.7(d)(1) and (e)(1), both of which\n\nstate broadly, without specific reference to labeling, that\n\n\"intended . . . conditions of use\" are relevant to safety and\n\neffectiveness       determinations.       In   other   words,    but   for   a\n\nproposed    refinement      suggesting    that   the   label    instructions\n\nreveal the manufacturer’s intended conditions of use (as in most\n\ncases they would), defendants' request was sufficiently close to\n\nthe mark.    Moreover, and more to the point, we think it evident\n\nthat the government's promotion at trial of an overly broad (at\n\nleast for purposes of assessing criminal liability) definition\n\nof the relevant statutory and regulatory terms had as much, if\n\nnot more, to do with this issue not emerging in sharp relief as\n\ndid   any   lapse    on   defendants'    part.    Defendants'     requested\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\finstruction was thus adequate to preserve the issue.                     Cf. United\n\nStates   v.

See Gov’t Br. at 111.       We\n\ndisagree.       While   the      court's     good-faith       instructions    were\n\ncomprehensive, articulate, and beyond reproach insofar as they\n\ngenerally described the concept of good faith, the jury's good-\n\nfaith finding may well have been affected by its view of what\n\nthe   underlying    law    required.           The   trial    evidence,    closing\n\narguments, and the jury instructions might well have left the\n\njury with an erroneous belief that manufacturers face criminal\n\nliability for failing to file a PMA supplement when they make a\n\nmodification to an approved device that has an effect only\n\n\n                                        -52-\n\fduring a sincerely unintended and specifically warned-against\n\ncondition of use.          This erroneous belief, in turn, might well\n\nhave been the basis upon which the jury rejected the good-faith\n\ndefense.      The good-faith instruction thus did not undo the harm\n\ncaused by the court’s failure to give the requested instruction\n\nin and of itself.          See Migliaccio, 34 F.3d at 1525.\n\n             Second, the government in substance contends that, even\n\nif    erroneous,     the    district     court's     failure     to   define    the\n\nunderlying     regulatory       terms    was   unimportant     because    it    was\n\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt within the meaning of Neder\n\nv.

See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 630-32 (1993) (noting that the Chapman standard\napplies to direct review of constitutional errors and that the\nKotteakos   standard   applies   to   direct   review   of non-\nconstitutional errors).   Because the panel unanimously agrees\nthat the error we discern cannot be said to be harmless under\neither test, we do not decide which test applies or,\nconcomitantly, whether the error deprived defendants of       a\nconstitutional right.\n\n                                   -54-\n\fevidence of USCI's failure to report modifications in mandatory\n\nfollow-up reports, or the evidence of other assorted deceit and\n\ntrickery (e.g., promoting Probe B contrary to its label warnings\n\nand adopting complicated inventory and labeling methods designed\n\nto    conceal   device    modifications           from       the   FDA).     And,    the\n\nargument concludes, the evidence with respect to these matters\n\nwas \"overwhelming.\"           Id.\n\n           In our view, the evidence of guilt in this case is\n\nquite    substantial; certainly, it is more than sufficient to\n\npermit a retrial on a properly formulated theory that defendants\n\nconspired to defraud the FDA with respect to its oversight and\n\nregulation of medical devices.              We do not believe, however, that\n\nthe    evidence    is    so    one-sided         as    to    render    harmless      the\n\nunderlying instructional error we have identified.                          Unlike the\n\ngovernment, we do not see this as a case, like Neder, where it\n\nis far-fetched to conclude that a properly instructed jury might\n\nhave    returned   different         verdicts         than   those    returned.       In\n\nexplaining, we follow the government's lead and focus upon the\n\nnature    and   weight    of        the   evidence       asserted     to    have    been\n\nunaffected by the instructional defect.\n\n           The government first asserts that the trial evidence\n\nshowed    conclusively         that       defendants         tested    their    device\n\nmodifications      for    the       purpose      of     determining        safety   and\n\n\n                                          -55-\n\feffectiveness with respect to intended conditions of use and in\n\nsuch   a   way    as   to    put   patients     at   prohibited   risks.    In\n\nresponding to this argument, we limit ourselves to the factual\n\nnature of the evidence presented and put to the side defendants'\n\nlegal argument that, because an IDE is an exemption permitting\n\nthe clinical testing of unapproved devices that otherwise could\n\nnot    lawfully    be       shipped   without    premarket    approval,    the\n\nlawfulness of most of the testing at issue in this case turns in\n\nthe first place on whether the modification at issue was subject\n\nto the PMA supplement requirement.              See supra note 1.\n\n            As to the nature of the testing evidence, we think\n\nthat, while the factual inference the government would have us\n\ndraw surely would be permissible on the present record, see,\n\ne.g., supra at 13, 20, 23-24 (summarizing documentary evidence\n\nsuggesting that the testing was for purposes of evaluating\n\nsafety and/or efficacy during intended conditions of use), it is\n\nnot the only rational inference.          Unlike Neder, the government's\n\nevidence as to the purpose of the testing was contested by\n\ndefendants; as we have stated, defendants introduced testimonial\n\nevidence that the purposes of this testing were to determine\n\nwhether the modifications were ameliorating safety concerns\n\nduring unintended conditions of use and/or to establish consumer\n\npreferences within the meaning of 21 C.F.R. § 812(c)(4).                   See\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\fsupra   at    13-14.      Given    Neder's     repeated      emphasis     on    the\n\n\"uncontested\" nature of the evidence of materiality in that\n\ncase, see 527 U.S. at 15, 17, 17 n.2, & 19, the contested nature\n\nof the testing evidence in this case might well suffice to\n\ndistinguish        it     from    Neder        in     and     of    itself.\n\n\n\n             In any event, while the government's evidence of the\n\npurpose behind the testing was strong, the competing evidence\n\nwas   not    inherently    incredible.         That   effectively        ends   the\n\nmatter.      As an appellate court, we are not equipped to make the\n\ncredibility determinations that must be made in choosing between\n\nthese clashing blocs of evidence, each of which is sufficient to\n\nrender rational a finding in favor of its proponent.                 See Neder,\n\n527   U.S.    at   19.     We    also    are   mindful      that,   in    denying\n\ndefendants' motions for judgments of acquittal, the trial court\n\nthought it a very \"close\" call whether the motions should be\n\ngranted, and that, in overruling defendants’ objections to its\n\nfailure to give the requested safety-and-efficacy instruction,\n\nthe court opined that instructing the jury as the defendants\n\nrequested would be tantamount to directing a verdict for them.\n\nIn sum, we do not regard the government's evidence of the\n\npurpose of the testing, alone or combination with the other\n\n\n\n\n                                        -57-\n\fevidence discussed below, to be of such a nature as to render\n\nthe court's instructional error harmless.\n\n             Our     analysis       with   respect    to       the    other    evidence\n\nmentioned by the government in support of its harmless-error\n\nargument     follows      a   similar       path.         As   we     have    observed,\n\ndefendants explained the failure to file a PMA supplement with\n\nrespect to the three-to-two lumen change in the Miniprofile with\n\nevidence and argument that a filing was unnecessary because the\n\nchange    was    designed      to    ameliorate      safety      issues       caused    by\n\nunintended preparation and purging techniques by end users.                            See\n\nsupra at 23. The evidence on this point was not inherently\n\nincredible.          If   a   correctly      instructed        jury    were    to     have\n\naccepted this evidence and line of defense (as it might have),\n\nwe think it might well also have regarded the subsequent failure\n\nto report the three-to-two lumen change in the 1989 Miniprofile\n\nPMA supplements as inconsequential.                  So too with the Solo Sr.;\n\nwe   think      it   possible       that    the    jury    might       have    accepted\n\ndefendants' supported and argued contention that USCI filed the\n\nSolo Sr. PMA supplement in order to seek approval of changes\n\nother    than    those    pertaining        to    lumen    number     and/or     at    the\n\ndirection and under the supervision of David Thomas, and not\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -58-\n\f           Finally, with respect to the evidence of failure to\n\nsubmit follow-up reports and the evidence of other assorted\n\ndeceptions and trickery, it suffices to note that such evidence\n\nwas either largely tangential to the primary trial themes or not\n\nparticularly probative of any of the principal fraud theories as\n\nto which the jury was instructed.             See supra at 34.       As we have\n\nexplained, instructional error and the absence of one-sided and\n\noverwhelming     evidence   of    guilt      combine   to    prevent    us   from\n\naffirming defendants' convictions on the basis of the primary\n\ncriminal   liability      theories     advanced     at      trial:   fraudulent\n\nmarketing and fraudulent testing.              Moreover, the experienced\n\ntrial judge who presided over the case stated on the record that\n\nhe was not sure he was correct in even sending the case to the\n\njury.    Given this state of affairs, it would be improper to\n\naffirm defendants' convictions on the basis of evidence that, on\n\nthe whole, played a supporting rather than a starring role at\n\ntrial.\n\nB.   Other Issues\n\n           As    noted,   defendants        press   various     arguments      for\n\nreversal   and    dismissal      of   the    conspiracy       charge.        These\n\narguments do not merit extended discussion.\n\n           First, all three defendants argued in their initial\n\nbriefs that the regulations under which they were prosecuted did\n\n\n                                      -59-\n\fnot give fair warning of the \"dictionary\" or \"plain language\"\n\ninterpretation that the government relied upon in pressing this\n\nprosecution.         Then,      when       defendants       perceived       in       the\n\ngovernment's brief a shift in position towards (if not all the\n\nway to) the interpretation of the regulations they have advanced\n\nall along (and we herein confirm as objectively reasonable), all\n\nthree   defendants       suggested       in   their   reply   briefs    that         the\n\nconspiracy      charge   should     be     dismissed    outright      because        the\n\ngovernment's       \"switch      .      .      .   confirms      the     .        .    .\n\nunconstitutionality of this prosecution.\"                   Defendants do not,\n\nhowever, place this argument within the context of a recognized\n\nlegal theory; nor do they cite authority which supports the\n\ndrastic remedy they seek.           We therefore reject the argument as\n\ninsufficiently elaborated.            See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n           Second, defendants Cvinar and Prigmore contend that\n\nthey are entitled to dismissal of the conspiracy charge because\n\nthe FDA did not provide them with notice and an opportunity to\n\npresent to the FDA their \"views\" as to the events underlying\n\nthis case prior to reporting their alleged violations of the\n\nFDCA to a United States Attorney for prosecution.                     21 U.S.C. §\n\n335.    But even assuming that Cvinar and Prigmore were entitled\n\nto such notice and opportunity, the Supreme Court has made it\n\nclear    that    they     are   not      entitled      to   dismissal       of       the\n\n\n                                         -60-\n\fprosecution.

Frankly, in reviewing those\n\nportions of the record the government points to in response to\n\nPrigmore's     sufficiency    argument,      we   are   not    particularly\n\nimpressed by the strength of the case against him.             Nonetheless,\n\nmindful that \"in a criminal conspiracy, culpability may be\n\nconstant    even    though   responsibilities     are   divided,\"     United\n\nStates v.

Scharon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198519\"><a href=\"/opinion/198519/united-states-v-scharon/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (emphasis supplied), we are persuaded that there\n\nwas sufficient evidence to tie Prigmore to the conspiracy.\n\n            As we have noted, there was evidence that, on November\n\n7, 1988, Cvinar informed Prigmore that testing of the modified\n\ntwo-lumen    Miniprofile     had   been    completed,   that   the   testing\n\nrevealed \"significantly better inflation/deflation times\" in the\n\nnew model, and that USCI would be adopting the two-lumen design\n\n\"post haste.\"      See supra at 23-24.       There thus was evidence to\n\nground a conclusion that Prigmore knew that the three-to-two\n\n\n                                    -61-\n\flumen   change   was    a    change   affecting   the   safety   and/or   the\n\neffectiveness of the Miniprofile – at least with respect to its\n\nunintended conditions of use.\n\n           Further, there was evidence that Prigmore reviewed for\n\nseveral hours the May 15, 1989 letter in which USCI took the\n\nposition that the modifications to Probe B that became Probe C\n\ndid not require a PMA supplement because they did not affect the\n\nsafety or effectiveness of the catheter during its intended uses\n\nand conditions of use.          See supra at 18-20.        There thus was\n\nevidence to ground a conclusion that, by May 1989, Prigmore knew\n\nthat USCI was under a regulatory obligation to file a PMA\n\nsupplement with respect to all changes affecting the safety or\n\neffectiveness    of    its    approved   heart    catheters   during   their\n\nintended uses and conditions of use prior to marketing the\n\naltered product.\n\n           Moreover, there was evidence that, on August 30, 1989,\n\nPrigmore participated in the meeting where it was decided that\n\nUSCI, according to a memorandum memorializing the meeting, would\n\nfile a PMA supplement for the Solo Sr. designed to \"'legitimize'\n\nthe changes [it] already ha[d] made (3 lumen to 2 . . .)\" to the\n\nMiniprofile by submitting to the FDA a cleanup PMA supplement.\n\nSee supra at 26.       There is no indication that Prigmore, who then\n\nwas a Bard vice president with authority over USCI operations,\n\n\n                                      -62-\n\fdissented from the proposed course of conduct, which eventually\n\nwas implemented.         In our view, the memorandum describing the\n\nAugust   30    meeting   suggests     that   Prigmore   acquiesced     in   an\n\nunlawful plan to conceal from the FDA a dubious course of\n\nconduct, particularly in light of Prigmore's authority, his\n\nknowledge of the three-to-two lumen change, and his awareness of\n\nthe   relevant     regulatory    requirements.          This    evidence    is\n\nsufficient to implicate Prigmore in the conspiracy of which he\n\nwas convicted.\n\n                                      III.\n\n              As we have stated, there was substantial evidence that\n\ndefendants in fact committed the serious crime of which the jury\n\nconvicted them.      But there is too great a possibility that the\n\njury’s verdicts were affected by an erroneous failure to define\n\ncrucial and disputed regulatory terms for us to affirm the\n\nconvictions under the harmless-error doctrine.                 We thus vacate\n\ndefendants'      convictions    and   remand   for   further      proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n              Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -63-\n\f</pre>",
