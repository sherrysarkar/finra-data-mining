Triba, Chief Counsel, and Maria A. Machin,\nAssistant Regional Counsel, Social Security Administration, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\f                           October 5, 2000\n\n\n\n            Per Curiam.     The claimant, Luz M. Gonzalez, has\n\nappealed from a district court judgment affirming a decision\n\nof   the    Commissioner     of    Social     Security   that    denied\n\nGonzalez's application for disability insurance benefits\n\nunder the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 401 et seq.                We\n\nhave carefully reviewed the parties' briefs and the record\n\non appeal.    We affirm essentially for the reasons stated in\n\nthe district court's opinion, dated November 19, 1999.                We\n\nadd only the following.\n\n            Gonzalez is mistaken in her contention that the\n\nadministrative law judge (\"ALJ\") omitted her limitation in\n\nreaching     with   her    right   arm      and   shoulder   from   the\n\nhypothetical presented to the vocational expert (\"VE\").\n\nThat limitation was contained in the hypothetical.              Gonzalez\n\nis similarly mistaken in her contention that the ALJ's\n\nwritten decision ignored her limitation in reaching.                The\n\nALJ mentioned, and indeed accepted, the opinions of two\n\nphysicians, each of whom had found Gonzalez to be limited in\n\nreaching.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f             As for Gonzalez's citation to cases that conclude\n\nthat application of the age criteria of the \"grid,\" see 20\n\nC.F.R.    pt.      404,     subpt.P,        app.2,     §    200.00(d),        is\n\ninappropriate      in     \"borderline\"      cases     --    that   is,   cases\n\ninvolving claimants whose age falls near the line between\n\ntwo age categories -- that citation is misplaced.                        Unlike\n\nthe cases which Gonzalez cites, the ALJ in the instant case\n\ndid not find Gonzalez not disabled by reliance on the grid.\n\nRather,      the   ALJ    sought,     obtained,       and    relied      on   VE\n\ntestimony, using the grid only as a framework.                     Consistent\n\nwith   the    regulations,      the    ALJ     made    an    individualized\n\ndetermination of Gonzalez's abilities and limitations and,\n\nthus, did not apply the age category in an inappropriate\n\nmechanical fashion.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f",
