S 952(a) and 18 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 2, and conspiracy to import, 21 U.S.C. S 963.   Egboudikogu\r\n\nand Nwokeji pled  guilty, and Eke  was convicted following  a\r\n\ntrial.  On appeal,  Eke makes various claims of trial  error,\r\n\nincluding \r                     a \r                       challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.  All\r\n\nthree defendants  dispute  the  district  court's  sentencing\r\n\ncalculations.\r\n\n     The defendants are Nigerian citizens who resided or  did\r\n\nbusiness in Boston or New York.  According to the government,\r\n\nthe \r               defendants recruited couriers to travel to Asia, where the\r\n\ncouriers \r                    would \r                         receive \r                                 heroin and then return with the drugs to\r\n\nBoston.   The  government offered  evidence concerning  three\r\n\nspecific importation efforts between August and November 1994\r\n\ninvolving \r                     different couriers.  We describe the evidence in the\r\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict.  United States v. Smith,\r\n\n46 F.3d 1223, 1226 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct.  176\r\n\n(1995).\r\n\n     In August 1994, Nwokeji  and Egboudikogu offered to  pay\r\n\nLamaria \r                   Hurt \r                        $10,000 \r                               to \r                                  travel to Hong Kong and Singapore; they\r\n\ntold her that she would bring back clothes and documents  but\r\n\nthat \r                no \r                   drugs \r                        would \r                              be \r                                 involved.  When Hurt agreed, Egboudikogu\r\n\nhelped her  obtain a  passport, and  Nwokeji and  Egboudikogu\r\n\nprovided her  with an airline ticket.   Hurt left Boston  for\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nSingapore in September  1994.  She  traveled on to  Malaysia,\r\n\nwhere she ultimately  received a bag whose lining was  packed\r\n\nwith a substance; at  trial, she said that the substance  was\r\n\nheroin, \r                   although \r                            she \r                               did \r                                   not actually see it.  Hurt returned to\r\n\nBoston  on September  14  and gave  the  bag to  Nwokeji  and\r\n\nEgboudikogu, who said that Egboudikogu would be going to  New\r\n\nYork \r                \"to \r                    get \r                        rid of the stuff.\"  They later paid Hurt $10,000.\r\n\n     Next, \r                      in \r                         late \r                             September \r                                       or early October 1994, Nwokeji and\r\n\nEgboudikogu arranged  a second trip,  offering a woman  named\r\n\nBethany Dagen $10,000 to travel overseas.  They helped  Dagen\r\n\nobtain \r                  a \r                    passport \r                            and \r                                purchased her airline ticket.  On October\r\n\n9, Dagen flew  from Boston to Hong  Kong and then to  Manila,\r\n\nwhere she received an oversized children's book.  On  October\r\n\n28, \r               Dagen \r                     was searched at Detroit airport, en route to Boston,\r\n\nwhen customs officials detected a powerful glue odor from the\r\n\nbook. \r                  \r                  They \r                      found \r                            229.9 \r                                  grams of heroin concealed in the book's\r\n\ncover.  Dagen was arrested and agreed to cooperate.\r\n\n     Meanwhile, a third  trip had been planned using a  third\r\n\ncourier, Mona Lisa Smith-Mixon.  In October 1994, Egboudikogu\r\n\nand Eke went to a travel agency in New York, and  Egboudikogu\r\n\nbought \r                  an \r                     airline ticket from Florida to Hong Kong in the name\r\n\nof a  third person.   Eke picked up  the ticket several  days\r\n\nlater, \r                  and \r                     thereafter \r                                requested two name changes on the ticket,\r\n\neach time paying a ticket-change penalty of $200.  The travel\r\n\nagency finally issued the ticket to Smith-Mixon and delivered\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nit \r              to \r                 Egboudikogu. \r                              \r                              Egboudikogu and Nwokeji offered Smith-Mixon\r\n\n$5,000 to make the trip and helped her obtain a passport, but\r\n\nSmith-Mixon ultimately refused to go. \r\n\n     As for Dagen, she returned to Boston after her arrest in\r\n\nDetroit and (at the direction of federal agents) arranged  to\r\n\nmeet with Nwokeji and  Egboudikogu to deliver the  children's\r\n\nbook.   On November  5,  1994, wearing  a recorder,  she  met\r\n\nEgboudikogu in a Boston  restaurant.  Egboudikogu told  Dagen\r\n\nthat \r                she \r                    had \r                        not received all the heroin that she was supposed\r\n\nto get in Asia.  He also said that his partner, who  had just\r\n\ncome from  Houston, was waiting  at a  nearby Dunkin'  Donuts\r\n\nstore, \r                  would \r                        give her partial payment of her fee, and would be\r\n\ndistributing the heroin in New York.\r\n\n     When Egboudikogu started to leave the restaurant to  get\r\n\nhis \r               supposed \r                        partner, \r                                he \r                                   was arrested.  Two agents then went to\r\n\nthe  nearby Dunkin'  Donuts  shop,  where they  saw  Eke  and\r\n\nquestioned him.  He was the only customer sitting at a  table\r\n\nand a priority mail envelope from Houston, addressed to  Eke,\r\n\nwas sitting on his table.  When Eke admitted that he had just\r\n\nbeen with Egboudikogu, he was arrested.  Nwokeji was arrested\r\n\nlater that evening.\r\n\n     A \r                  grand \r                        jury \r                             returned a three-count indictment, which set\r\n\nforth two substantive counts of drug importation or attempted\r\n\nimportation (based  on the trips by  Hurt and Dagen) and  one\r\n\ncount of conspiracy to import, spanning the time from  August\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n1994 until the defendants' arrests.  Egboudikogu and  Nwokeji\r\n\nwere charged in all three counts; Eke was charged only in the\r\n\nDagen \r                 importation count and the conspiracy count.  Egboudikogu\r\n\nand Nwokeji pled guilty to all counts and were each sentenced\r\n\nto \r              108 \r                  months' imprisonment.  Eke was convicted on both counts\r\n\nby \r              a \r                jury \r                     and was sentenced to 84 months' imprisonment.  These\r\n\nappeals followed.\r\n\n     1.  We begin with Eke's challenge to his conviction.  At\r\n\ntrial, Eke argued that he was an innocent businessman  \"whose\r\n\nonly  sin  was  associating  with  one  of  the  conspirators\r\n\n[Egboudikogu]\r                        .\"  On appeal, he renews this claim, arguing that\r\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.   To\r\n\nprevail \r                   Eke \r                       must \r                           show \r                                that, viewing the evidence most favorably\r\n\nto the government, a  rational jury could not have found  him\r\n\nguilty \r                  beyond \r                        a \r                          reasonable doubt.  United States v. Valerio, 48\r\n\nF.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n     Perhaps \r                        the \r                           strongest \r                                     single piece of evidence against Eke\r\n\nwas Egboudikogu's statement to Dagen (recorded on  audiotape)\r\n\nthat his \"partner\" in the nearby Dunkin' Donuts shop would be\r\n\ndistributing the heroin  in New York and would provide  Dagen\r\n\nwith part of her payment for making the smuggling trip.   The\r\n\ncompanion turned out to be  Eke.  As a threshold matter,  Eke\r\n\nargues that this  statement by  Egboudikogu was  inadmissible\r\n\nhearsay.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     The district court admitted the tape recording as a  co-\r\n\nconspirator's statement.  Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).   That\r\n\nhearsay exception  required  the  government to  prove  by  a\r\n\npreponderance  of evidence,  apart from  using the  statement\r\n\nitself, that (1) a  conspiracy existed between the  declarant\r\n\n(Egboudikogu) and the defendant (Eke), and (2) the  statement\r\n\nwas \r               made \r                    \"during \r                           and \r                               in \r                                  furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United\r\n\nStates v. Sepulveda,  15 F.3d 1161, 1180-82 (1st Cir.  1993),\r\n\ncert. denied,  512 U.S. 1223  (1994).   The district  court's\r\n\nfindings of fact on both points are reviewed for clear error.\r\n\nId. at 1180.\r\n\n     If an importation  conspiracy existed and included  Eke,\r\n\nEgboudikogu's statements to Dagen about his \"partner's\"  role\r\n\nwere  made  during and  in  furtherance  of  the  conspiracy:\r\n\nEgboudikogu's  references  to  his  partner  were  aimed   at\r\n\npersuading Dagen to  hand over the heroin-laden book so  that\r\n\ndelivery of the  drugs to New York  could be completed.   See\r\n\nUnited \r                  States \r                        v. \r                           Leal\r                               , \r                                 831 F.2d 7, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1987).  There\r\n\nwas also considerable evidence, independent of the statement,\r\n\nsuggesting that Eke was a member of the conspiracy.\r\n\n     First,  Eke  accompanied  Egboudikogu  when  the  latter\r\n\npurchased \r                     an \r                       airline \r                               ticket for travel to Hong Kong in the name\r\n\nof a third person, and Eke himself had the name on the ticket\r\n\nchanged to Smith-Mixon, who had been recruited by Egboudikogu\r\n\nand \r               Nwokeji \r                       to serve as a courier.  In these dealings with the\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\ntravel \r                  agency, \r                          Eke \r                             twice \r                                   paid the $200 name-change fee in cash;\r\n\nand \r               in \r                  each \r                       case Eke gave the travel agency a modified version\r\n\nof his middle name, rather than his true last name.  Eke also\r\n\naccompanied Egboudikogu to the meeting with Dagen and  waited\r\n\nnearby. \r\n\n     Second, \r                        the \r                            government also presented evidence concerning\r\n\nseveral entries in Eke's pocket diary, which was seized  upon\r\n\nhis \r               arrest. \r                        \r                       That \r                            diary \r                                  listed the phone number of Nwokeji, who\r\n\nin \r              turn \r                   had \r                       Eke's pager number.  Eke's diary also included the\r\n\nnames  of \"Jeff  Obi,\"  an  alias used  by  Egboudikogu  when\r\n\nrecruiting couriers; Anthony Isiamah, who allegedly served as\r\n\na contact in  Bangkok for Egboudikogu;  and Beth Freeland,  a\r\n\nfriend of Dagen.  While Dagen was in Manila on her trip,  she\r\n\nhad telephoned Nwokeji and Egboudikogu and asked them to send\r\n\nmoney to Freeland in order to pay Dagen's rent.\r\n\n     Third, \r                       the \r                           operator of a New York business that sends and\r\n\nreceives international calls for customers testified that Eke\r\n\nreceived \r                    a \r                      fax from Thailand sent by someone named \"Chris.\"  A\r\n\nNigerian \r                    also named \"Chris\" had delivered heroin from Bangkok,\r\n\nThailand, \r                     to \r                       Manila, \r                               where he gave it to Dagen concealed in the\r\n\nchildren's  book.   There was  no further  indication of  the\r\n\nidentity \r                    of \r                       the person who sent the fax or the contents of the\r\n\nfax.\r\n\n     The evidence  just  described  adequately  supports  the\r\n\ndistrict judge's ruling, by a preponderance of the  evidence,\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nthat \r                Eke \r                    was \r                        a \r                         member \r                                of \r                                   the conspiracy.  This made the hearsay\r\n\nstatement \r                     admissible. \r                                 \r                                 And, adding the hearsay statement to the\r\n\nevidence \r                    just described, the cumulative evidence was more than\r\n\nadequate to  permit  a rational  jury  to conclude  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt that Eke was a member of the conspiracy  and\r\n\nhad participated in the Dagen importation.  See United States\r\n\nv. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n     It is true  that without the  hearsay statement and  the\r\n\nevidence \r                    just described, Eke's mere presence at the restaurant\r\n\nshowed very little.  But with the additional evidence,  Eke's\r\n\npresence could  be viewed  as a further  step by  him in  the\r\n\nconspiracy, \r                       in \r                         addition \r                                  to his involvement with the Smith-Mixon\r\n\nticket.  As for the required element of intent to enter  into\r\n\nthe conspiracy,  see Andujar,  49 F.3d  at 22,  Egboudikogu's\r\n\nhearsay  statement  identified  Eke  as  a  partner  in   the\r\n\nconspiracy, a statement consistent with the other evidence as\r\n\nto Eke's activities.\r\n\n     Eke makes other claims of error regarding his conviction\r\n\nbased on an alleged variance between the indictment and trial\r\n\nevidence, various evidentiary  rulings, the district  court's\r\n\ndenial of his new trial motion, and the absence of minorities\r\n\non the jury.  We do not think any of these claims of error is\r\n\narguably \r                    close, \r                           and \r                              to \r                                 the extent that Eke seeks an explanation\r\n\non those points, his claims are answered in the  government's\r\n\nbrief.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     2.  All three defendants challenge the district  judge's\r\n\ncalculation  of  drug quantity  at  sentencing.    Under  the\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines, the  base offense level for  importing\r\n\ndrugs  depends on  the total  drug quantity  involved in  the\r\n\noffenses.   U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1(c);  id. comment.  (n.12).   The\r\n\ngovernment must prove drug quantity by a preponderance of the\r\n\nevidence.  United States  v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1161  (1st\r\n\nCir. \r                1996). \r                        \r                       The \r                           district court's findings of fact are reviewed\r\n\nfor \r               clear \r                     error, and its legal rulings are considered de novo.\r\n\nId. at 1159.\r\n\n     The \r                    only \r                         drugs \r                              seized \r                                     were the 229.9 grams of heroin found\r\n\nin the  children's book carried by  Dagen.  Hurt entered  the\r\n\ncountry  without detection,  and Smith-Mixon  never took  the\r\n\nplanned trip.  Nonetheless, following an evidentiary hearing,\r\n\nthe district court found that the conspirators intended  Hurt\r\n\nand \r               Dagen \r                     each \r                         to \r                            import \r                                   400 grams of heroin, while Smith-Mixon\r\n\nwas \r               intended \r                        to import 200 grams--a total of 1,000 grams.  The\r\n\ncourt \r                 found \r                       Eke \r                          not \r                              responsible for the Hurt trip, reducing the\r\n\namount     attributed     to    him     to     600     grams.\r\n\n     Under  section   2D1.1(c),  the   kilogram  charged   to\r\n\nEgboudikogu \r                       and Nwokeji gave them each a base offense level of\r\n\n32; \r               Eke, \r                    responsible \r                               for \r                                   600 grams, had a base offense level of\r\n\n28.  Egboudikogu and  Nwokeji received adjustments for  their\r\n\nrole in the  offense and acceptance  of responsibility.   All\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                        -10-\r\r\n\nthree \r                 defendants \r                           were \r                                sentenced within the applicable guideline\r\n\nranges.  On appeal, the  only issues relate to the amount  of\r\n\ndrugs attributed to the individual defendants.\r\n\n     At the  outset, the defendants  assert that no  quantity\r\n\nwhatsoever should be attributed to them based on the Hurt and\r\n\nSmith-Mixon transactions.   Egboudikogu and Nwokeji say  that\r\n\nHurt may have been making a test run and carrying no  heroin;\r\n\nbut both defendants pled guilty to count 2 of the indictment,\r\n\nwhich \r                 charged them with successfully importing heroin.  As for\r\n\nthe \r               aborted \r                       Smith-Mixon trip, section 2D1.1 expressly includes\r\n\nin  the attributed  amount any  drugs sought  to be  imported\r\n\nthrough attempts and conspiracies,  even if the efforts  were\r\n\nunsuccessful.  See also U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1 comment. (n.12).\r\n\n     The more  difficult question  is how  to determine  drug\r\n\nquantity \r                    for \r                        a transaction where no drugs are seized (Hurt and\r\n\nSmith-Mixon) or  where the  government says  that the  amount\r\n\nseized  understates  the   scale  of  the  offense   (Dagen).\r\n\nApplication note  12 to section  2D1.1 provides the  starting\r\n\npoint.  It states:\r\n\n     Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seized\r\n     does \r                     not \r                         reflect the scale of the offense, the court\r\n     shall approximate  the quantity  of the  controlled\r\n     substance.  In making this determination, the court\r\n     may consider,  for  example,  the  price  generally\r\n     obtained for the controlled substance, financial or\r\n     other records,  similar transactions in  controlled\r\n     substances  by  the  defendant,  and  the  size  or\r\n     capability of any laboratory involved.\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r\n\nAn approximation will be  upheld \"as long as it represents  a\r\n\nreasoned estimate of quantity.\"  United States v. Webster, 54\r\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n     It  is apparent  that  some  estimating  methods  (e.g.,\r\n\ninventory \r                     records) \r                             are \r                                 likely to be quite reliable, and others-\r\n\n-such as computing  drugs from sale proceeds--are  reasonably\r\n\naccurate.  Here,  however, the government  had no such  data.\r\n\nInstead, at the  evidentiary hearing, it called as a  witness\r\n\nPeter Amentas, a federal  customs agent familiar with  heroin\r\n\nsmuggling to the east coast of the United States and regarded\r\n\nas an  expert by the government.   In a companion  affidavit,\r\n\nAmentas stated that since August 1994,\r\n\n     fees  paid to  couriers importing  heroin into  the\r\n     eastern United States have  . . . remained  stable.\r\n     Over \r                     that \r                          period, couriers have been paid an average\r\n     of between  $1,000 and $2,500  per 100  grams of  a\r\n     mixture  containing  heroin  (having  a  purity  of\r\n     approximately 75%) brought into the Eastern portion\r\n     of the country.\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                            court \r                                  agreed to use the government's proposed\r\n\napproach. \r                      \r                      The court cautiously selected the highest rate from\r\n\nthe  range identified  by Amentas  ($2,500 per  100 grams  of\r\n\nheroin),  thereby  reducing  the  resulting  drug   quantity.\r\n\nDividing this $2,500 figure into the fees paid or offered  to\r\n\nthe three couriers, the  court concluded that the  defendants\r\n\nintended Hurt  and Dagen each to  import 400 grams of  heroin\r\n\n(since \r                  each \r                       had been paid or promised $10,000) and that Smith-\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                        -12-\r\r\n\nMixon was intended to import 200 grams (based on the offer of\r\n\n$5,000).\r\n\n     Needless \r                         to \r                            say, the defendants say that the computations\r\n\nmade by the district court are unduly speculative.  They urge\r\n\nthat Hurt had imported 229.9 grams for $10,000 and  therefore\r\n\nthe amounts attributed  to the other  two couriers should  be\r\n\ncomputed \r                    at \r                       the \r                          same \r                               rate (about 60 percent of the rate adopted\r\n\nby  the district  court).   On this  calculation, the  amount\r\n\nreflected by the total courier fees ($25,000) would be 574.75\r\n\ngrams, with Eke accountable for only 344.85 grams.  At  first\r\n\nblush, \r                  this \r                       might \r                            appear \r                                   a reasonable estimating approach based\r\n\non a transaction actually undertaken by the defendants.\r\n\n     The  difficulty  is that  the  drugs  seized  from  Hurt\r\n\nunderstated \r                       the amount that she had been intended to carry--or\r\n\nat \r              least \r                    it \r                      was \r                          reasonable for the district court to reach this\r\n\nconclusion.  Egboudikogu told Dagen that she had not received\r\n\nas \r              much \r                   heroin from the Asian suppliers as she was supposed to\r\n\nget; according to  Egboudikogu, the supplier had to rush  the\r\n\norder \r                 because Dagen, already delayed many days, had hurried to\r\n\nreturn  to  the United  States.    The  defendants'  proposed\r\n\ncalculation is premised upon this understatement.\r\n\n     The  district court  is not  required to  prefer a  less\r\n\nreliable \r                    calculation \r                               to \r                                  a more reliable one, and the guidelines\r\n\nthemselves instruct  that where \"the  amount seized does  not\r\n\nreflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r\n\nthe quantity.\"  U.S.S.G. S 2D1.1 comment. (n.12).  Yet a more\r\n\nreliable estimate is not automatically reliable enough:   the\r\n\nquestion \r                    remains whether the government's calculation here had\r\n\n\"sufficient indicia of  reliability to  support its  probable\r\n\naccuracy.\" \r                       \r                       Webster\r                             , \r                               54 \r                                  F.3d at 5 (citing U.S.S.G. S 6A1.3(a)).\r\n\n     Here, the \"indicia of reliability\" was the experience of\r\n\nthe government's witness, who said that he had worked on  200\r\n\nheroin cases,  and also  had secured  information from  other\r\n\nofficers.  In 15 of the cases, Amentas acted in an undercover\r\n\ncapacity and in many others he had interviewed the  couriers.\r\n\nOn this  basis, Amentas testified  to the  payment range  for\r\n\ncouriers--$1,000 to $2,500 per 100 grams--engaged in  similar\r\n\ntransactions:\r                          importing comparably pure heroin from Southeast\r\n\nAsia to the U.S. east coast.\r\n\n     In principle, drug courier services are a \"market,\" like\r\n\ndrug \r                sales, \r                       and extrapolations based on street drug prices are\r\n\ncommonly \r                    used to determine drug quantity.  E.g., United States\r\n\nv. Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 511 (1st Cir. 1993).  Quite possibly,\r\n\nthe \r               price \r                     for heroin couriers at a given time and location may\r\n\nvary more widely than for retail sales (simply because market\r\n\nimperfections are greater); and one may suspect that a direct\r\n\nlinear \r                  relationship between quantity and price is less likely.\r\n\n     Indeed, Amentas readily  admitted that courier  payments\r\n\nvaried for many reasons, including supply and demand  changes\r\n\nand the experience and understanding of the courier.

Egboudikogu and Nwokeji pled guilty, and Eke was convicted following a trial.  On appeal, Eke makes various claims of trial error, including a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.  All three defendants dispute the district court's sentencing calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants are Nigerian citizens who resided or did business in Boston or New York.  According to the government, the defendants recruited couriers to travel to Asia, where the couriers would receive heroin and then return with the drugs to Boston.  The government offered evidence concerning three specific importation efforts between August and November 1994 involving different couriers.  We describe the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.  United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223, 1226 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 176, 133 L.Ed.2d 116 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1994, Nwokeji and Egboudikogu offered to pay Lamaria Hurt $10,000 to travel to Hong Kong and Singapore;  they told her that she would bring back clothes and documents but that no drugs would be involved.  When Hurt agreed, Egboudikogu helped her obtain a passport, and Nwokeji and Egboudikogu provided her with an airline ticket.  Hurt left Boston for Singapore in September 1994.  She traveled on to Malaysia, where she ultimately received a bag whose lining was packed with a substance;  at trial, she said that the substance was heroin, although she did not actually see it.  Hurt returned to Boston on September 14 and gave the bag to Nwokeji and Egboudikogu, who said that Egboudikogu would be going to New York \"to get rid of the stuff.\"   They later paid Hurt $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, in late September or early October 1994, Nwokeji and Egboudikogu arranged a second trip, offering a woman named Bethany Dagen $10,000 to travel overseas.  They helped Dagen obtain a passport and purchased her airline ticket.  On October 9, Dagen flew from Boston to Hong Kong and then to Manila, where she received an oversized children's book.  On October 28, Dagen was searched at Detroit airport, en route to Boston, when customs officials detected a powerful glue odor from the book.  They found 229.9 grams of heroin concealed in the book's cover.  Dagen was arrested and agreed to cooperate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, a third trip had been planned using a third courier, Mona Lisa Smith-Mixon.  In October 1994, Egboudikogu and Eke went to a travel agency in New York, and Egboudikogu bought an airline ticket from Florida to Hong Kong in the name of a third person.  Eke picked up the ticket several days later, and thereafter requested two name changes on the ticket, each time paying a ticket-change penalty of $200.  The travel agency finally issued the ticket to Smith-Mixon and delivered it to Egboudikogu.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji offered Smith-Mixon $5,000 to make the trip and helped her obtain a passport, but Smith-Mixon ultimately refused to go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Dagen, she returned to Boston after her arrest in Detroit and (at the direction of federal agents) arranged to meet with Nwokeji and Egboudikogu to deliver the children's book.  On November 5, 1994, wearing a recorder, she met Egboudikogu in a Boston restaurant.  Egboudikogu told Dagen that she had not received all the heroin that she was supposed to get in Asia.  He also said that his partner, who had just come from Houston, was waiting at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts store, would give her partial payment of her fee, and would be distributing the heroin in New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Egboudikogu started to leave the restaurant to get his supposed partner, he was arrested.  Two agents then went to the nearby Dunkin' Donuts shop, where they saw Eke and questioned him.  He was the only customer sitting at a table and a priority mail envelope from Houston, addressed to Eke, was sitting on his table.  When Eke admitted that he had just been with Egboudikogu, he was arrested.  Nwokeji was arrested later that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury returned a three-count indictment, which set forth two substantive counts of drug importation or attempted importation (based on the trips by Hurt and Dagen) and one count of conspiracy to import, spanning the time from August 1994 until the defendants' arrests.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji were charged in all three counts;  Eke was charged only in the Dagen importation count and the conspiracy count.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji pled guilty to all counts and were each sentenced to 108 months' imprisonment.  Eke was convicted on both counts by a jury and was sentenced to 84 months' imprisonment.  These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. We begin with Eke's challenge to his conviction.  At trial, Eke argued that he was an innocent businessman \"whose only sin was associating with one of the conspirators [Egboudikogu].\"  On appeal, he renews this claim, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.  To prevail Eke must show that, viewing the evidence most favorably to the government, a rational jury could not have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the strongest single piece of evidence against Eke was Egboudikogu's statement to Dagen (recorded on audiotape) that his \"partner\" in the nearby Dunkin' Donuts shop would be distributing the heroin in New York and would provide Dagen with part of her payment for making the smuggling trip.  The companion turned out to be Eke.  As a threshold matter, Eke argues that this statement by Egboudikogu was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court admitted the tape recording as a co-conspirator's statement.  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  That hearsay exception required the government to prove by a preponderance of evidence, apart from using the statement itself, that (1) a conspiracy existed between the declarant (Egboudikogu) and the defendant (Eke), and (2) the statement was made \"during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180-82 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1223, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994).  The district court's findings of fact on both points are reviewed for clear error.  Id. at 1180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an importation conspiracy existed and included Eke, Egboudikogu's statements to Dagen about his \"partner's\" role were made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy:  Egboudikogu's references to his partner were aimed at persuading Dagen to hand over the heroin-laden book so that delivery of the drugs to New York could be completed.  See United States v. Leal, 831 F.2d 7, 9-10 (1st Cir.1987).  There was also considerable evidence, independent of the statement, suggesting that Eke was a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Eke accompanied Egboudikogu when the latter purchased an airline ticket for travel to Hong Kong in the name of a third person, and Eke himself had the name on the ticket changed to Smith-Mixon, who had been recruited by Egboudikogu and Nwokeji to serve as a courier.  In these dealings with the travel agency, Eke twice paid the $200 name-change fee in cash;  and in each case Eke gave the travel agency a modified version of his middle name, rather than his true last name.  Eke also accompanied Egboudikogu to the meeting with Dagen and waited nearby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the government also presented evidence concerning several entries in Eke's pocket diary, which was seized upon his arrest.  That diary listed the phone number of Nwokeji, who in turn had Eke's pager number.  Eke's diary also included the names of \"Jeff Obi,\" an alias used by Egboudikogu when recruiting couriers;  Anthony Isiamah, who allegedly served as a contact in Bangkok for Egboudikogu;  and Beth Freeland, a friend of Dagen.  While Dagen was in Manila on her trip, she had telephoned Nwokeji and Egboudikogu and asked them to send money to Freeland in order to pay Dagen's rent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the operator of a New York business that sends and receives international calls for customers testified that Eke received a fax from Thailand sent by someone named \"Chris.\"   A Nigerian also named \"Chris\" had delivered heroin from Bangkok, Thailand, to Manila, where he gave it to Dagen concealed in the children's book.  There was no further indication of the identity of the person who sent the fax or the contents of the fax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence just described adequately supports the district judge's ruling, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Eke was a member of the conspiracy.  This made the hearsay statement admissible.  And, adding the hearsay statement to the evidence just described, the cumulative evidence was more than adequate to permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Eke was a member of the conspiracy and had participated in the Dagen importation.  See United States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 21-22 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that without the hearsay statement and the evidence just described, Eke's mere presence at the donut shop showed very little.  But with the additional evidence, Eke's presence could be viewed as a further step by him in the conspiracy, in addition to his involvement with the Smith-Mixon ticket.  As for the required element of intent to enter into the conspiracy, see Andujar, 49 F.3d at 22, Egboudikogu's hearsay statement identified Eke as a partner in the conspiracy, a statement consistent with the other evidence as to Eke's activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eke makes other claims of error regarding his conviction based on an alleged variance between the indictment and trial evidence, various evidentiary rulings, the district court's denial of his new trial motion, and the absence of minorities on the jury.  We do not think any of these claims of error is arguably close, and to the extent that Eke seeks an explanation on those points, his claims are answered in the government's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. All three defendants challenge the district judge's calculation of drug quantity at sentencing.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the base offense level for importing drugs depends on the total drug quantity involved in the offenses.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c);  id. comment.  (n.12).  The government must prove drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence.  United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1161 (1st Cir.1996).  The district court's findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its legal rulings are considered de novo.  Id. at 1159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only drugs seized were the 229.9 grams of heroin found in the children's book carried by Dagen.  Hurt entered the country without detection, and Smith-Mixon never took the planned trip.  Nonetheless, following an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that the conspirators intended Hurt and Dagen each to import 400 grams of heroin, while Smith-Mixon was intended to import 200 grams--a total of 1,000 grams.  The court found Eke not responsible for the Hurt trip, reducing the amount attributed to him to 600 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 2D1.1(c), the kilogram charged to Egboudikogu and Nwokeji gave them each a base offense level of 32;  Eke, responsible for 600 grams, had a base offense level of 28.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji received adjustments for their role in the offense and acceptance of responsibility.  All three defendants were sentenced within the applicable guideline ranges.  On appeal, the only issues relate to the amount of drugs attributed to the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, the defendants assert that no quantity whatsoever should be attributed to them based on the Hurt and Smith-Mixon transactions.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji say that Hurt may have been making a test run and carrying no heroin;  but both defendants pled guilty to count 2 of the indictment, which charged them with successfully importing heroin.  As for the aborted Smith-Mixon trip, section 2D1.1 expressly includes in the attributed amount any drugs sought to be imported through attempts and conspiracies, even if the efforts were unsuccessful.  See also U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 comment.  (n.12).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more difficult question is how to determine drug quantity for a transaction where no drugs are seized (Hurt and Smith-Mixon) or where the government says that the amount seized understates the scale of the offense (Dagen).  Application note 12 to section 2D1.1 provides the starting point.  It states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.  In making this determination, the court may consider, for example, the price generally obtained for the controlled substance, financial or other records, similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant, and the size or capability of any laboratory involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An approximation will be upheld \"as long as it represents a reasoned estimate of quantity.\"  United States v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that some estimating methods (e.g., inventory records) are likely to be quite reliable, and others--such as computing drugs from sale proceeds--are reasonably accurate.  Here, however, the government had no such data.  Instead, at the evidentiary hearing, it called as a witness Peter Amentas, a federal customs agent familiar with heroin smuggling to the east coast of the United States and regarded as an expert by the government.  In a companion affidavit, Amentas stated that since August 1994,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>fees paid to couriers importing heroin into the eastern United States have ... remained stable.  Over that period, couriers have been paid an average of between $1,000 and $2,500 per 100 grams of a mixture containing heroin (having a purity of approximately 75%) brought into the Eastern portion of the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed to use the government's proposed approach.  The court cautiously selected the highest rate from the range identified by Amentas ($2,500 per 100 grams of heroin), thereby reducing the resulting drug quantity.  Dividing this $2,500 figure into the fees paid or offered to the three couriers, the court concluded that the defendants intended Hurt and Dagen each to import 400 grams of heroin (since each had been paid or promised $10,000) and that Smith-Mixon was intended to import 200 grams (based on the offer of $5,000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, the defendants say that the computations made by the district court are unduly speculative.  They urge that Dagen had imported 229.9 grams for $10,000 and therefore the amounts attributed to the other two couriers should be computed at the same rate (about 60 percent of the rate adopted by the district court).  On this calculation, the amount reflected by the total courier fees ($25,000) would be 574.75 grams, with Eke accountable for only 344.85 grams.  At first blush, this might appear a reasonable estimating approach based on a transaction actually undertaken by the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that the drugs seized from Dagen understated the amount that she had been intended to carry--or at least it was reasonable for the district court to reach this conclusion.  Egboudikogu told Dagen that she had not received as much heroin from the Asian suppliers as she was supposed to get;  according to Egboudikogu, the supplier had to rush the order because Dagen, already delayed many days, had hurried to return to the United States.  The defendants' proposed calculation is premised upon this understatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court is not required to prefer a less reliable calculation to a more reliable one, and the guidelines themselves instruct that where \"the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 comment.  (n.12) (emphasis added).  Yet a more reliable estimate is not automatically reliable enough:  the question remains whether the government's calculation here had \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"  Webster, 54 F.3d at 5 (citing U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the \"indicia of reliability\" was the experience of the government's witness, who said that he had worked on 200 heroin cases, and also had secured information from other officers.  In 15 of the cases, Amentas acted in an undercover capacity and in many others he had interviewed the couriers.  On this basis, Amentas testified to the payment range for couriers--$1,000 to $2,500 per 100 grams--engaged in similar transactions:  importing comparably pure heroin from Southeast Asia to the U.S. east coast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In principle, drug courier services are a \"market,\" like drug sales, and extrapolations based on street drug prices are commonly used to determine drug quantity.  E.g., United States v. Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 511 (1st Cir.1993).  Quite possibly, the price for heroin couriers at a given time and location may vary more widely than for retail sales (simply because market imperfections are greater);  and one may suspect that a direct linear relationship between quantity and price is less likely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Amentas readily admitted that courier payments varied for many reasons, including supply and demand changes and the experience and understanding of the courier.  But he testified to a payment range and said that this range had been steady for a considerable period.  He was cross-examined extensively;  this court has reviewed the cross-examination, and nothing in it seriously undermined Amentas' testimony.  The district judge, who has considerable latitude in this area, accepted it as persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law requires caution in estimating drug quantity but, in the last analysis, an estimate of drug quantity is treated as a \"fact.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, 102 F.3d 1313, 1318 (1st Cir.1996).  Here, the district court credited the government's witness on the figures used for the range, and the court's calculation of quantity flowed rationally from that premise.  The court guarded itself by taking the lowest end of the range offered by Amentas.  Compare United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 112 (1st Cir.1990).  On the record before us, we cannot say that the district court's estimate was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants have made other criticisms of the government's evidence at sentencing and of the district court's calculations, but again, most of the remaining claims are addressed in the government's brief and none requires separate discussion.  Nwokeji points to mitigating circumstances in his own case, but the guidelines are largely driven by quantity, and he identifies no specific error by the district court in determining other adjustments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The government offered evidence concerning three specific importation efforts between August and November 1994 involving different couriers.

When Hurt agreed, Egboudikogu helped her obtain a passport, and Nwokeji and Egboudikogu provided her with an airline ticket.  Hurt left Boston for Singapore in September 1994.  She traveled on to Malaysia, where she ultimately received a bag whose lining was packed with a substance;  at trial, she said that the substance was heroin, although she did not actually see it.  Hurt returned to Boston on September 14 and gave the bag to Nwokeji and Egboudikogu, who said that Egboudikogu would be going to New York \"to get rid of the stuff.\"   They later paid Hurt $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, in late September or early October 1994, Nwokeji and Egboudikogu arranged a second trip, offering a woman named Bethany Dagen $10,000 to travel overseas.  They helped Dagen obtain a passport and purchased her airline ticket.  On October 9, Dagen flew from Boston to Hong Kong and then to Manila, where she received an oversized children's book.  On October 28, Dagen was searched at Detroit airport, en route to Boston, when customs officials detected a powerful glue odor from the book.  They found 229.9 grams of heroin concealed in the book's cover.  Dagen was arrested and agreed to cooperate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, a third trip had been planned using a third courier, Mona Lisa Smith-Mixon.  In October 1994, Egboudikogu and Eke went to a travel agency in New York, and Egboudikogu bought an airline ticket from Florida to Hong Kong in the name of a third person.  Eke picked up the ticket several days later, and thereafter requested two name changes on the ticket, each time paying a ticket-change penalty of $200.  The travel agency finally issued the ticket to Smith-Mixon and delivered it to Egboudikogu.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji offered Smith-Mixon $5,000 to make the trip and helped her obtain a passport, but Smith-Mixon ultimately refused to go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Dagen, she returned to Boston after her arrest in Detroit and (at the direction of federal agents) arranged to meet with Nwokeji and Egboudikogu to deliver the children's book.  On November 5, 1994, wearing a recorder, she met Egboudikogu in a Boston restaurant.  Egboudikogu told Dagen that she had not received all the heroin that she was supposed to get in Asia.  He also said that his partner, who had just come from Houston, was waiting at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts store, would give her partial payment of her fee, and would be distributing the heroin in New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Egboudikogu started to leave the restaurant to get his supposed partner, he was arrested.  Two agents then went to the nearby Dunkin' Donuts shop, where they saw Eke and questioned him.  He was the only customer sitting at a table and a priority mail envelope from Houston, addressed to Eke, was sitting on his table.  When Eke admitted that he had just been with Egboudikogu, he was arrested.  Nwokeji was arrested later that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury returned a three-count indictment, which set forth two substantive counts of drug importation or attempted importation (based on the trips by Hurt and Dagen) and one count of conspiracy to import, spanning the time from August 1994 until the defendants' arrests.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji were charged in all three counts;  Eke was charged only in the Dagen importation count and the conspiracy count.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji pled guilty to all counts and were each sentenced to 108 months' imprisonment.  Eke was convicted on both counts by a jury and was sentenced to 84 months' imprisonment.  These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. We begin with Eke's challenge to his conviction.  At trial, Eke argued that he was an innocent businessman \"whose only sin was associating with one of the conspirators [Egboudikogu].\"  On appeal, he renews this claim, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.  To prevail Eke must show that, viewing the evidence most favorably to the government, a rational jury could not have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. Valerio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195933\"><a href=\"/opinion/195933/united-states-v-valerio/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the strongest single piece of evidence against Eke was Egboudikogu's statement to Dagen (recorded on audiotape) that his \"partner\" in the nearby Dunkin' Donuts shop would be distributing the heroin in New York and would provide Dagen with part of her payment for making the smuggling trip.  The companion turned out to be Eke.  As a threshold matter, Eke argues that this statement by Egboudikogu was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court admitted the tape recording as a co-conspirator's statement.  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  That hearsay exception required the government to prove by a preponderance of evidence, apart from using the statement itself, that (1) a conspiracy existed between the declarant (Egboudikogu) and the defendant (Eke), and (2) the statement was made \"during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1180-82 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Id. at 1180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an importation conspiracy existed and included Eke, Egboudikogu's statements to Dagen about his \"partner's\" role were made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy:  Egboudikogu's references to his partner were aimed at persuading Dagen to hand over the heroin-laden book so that delivery of the drugs to New York could be completed.  See United States v. Leal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495470\"><a href=\"/opinion/495470/united-states-v-jose-del-carmen-leal-aka-aldo/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9-10 (1st Cir.1987).  There was also considerable evidence, independent of the statement, suggesting that Eke was a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Eke accompanied Egboudikogu when the latter purchased an airline ticket for travel to Hong Kong in the name of a third person, and Eke himself had the name on the ticket changed to Smith-Mixon, who had been recruited by Egboudikogu and Nwokeji to serve as a courier.  In these dealings with the travel agency, Eke twice paid the $200 name-change fee in cash;  and in each case Eke gave the travel agency a modified version of his middle name, rather than his true last name.  Eke also accompanied Egboudikogu to the meeting with Dagen and waited nearby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the government also presented evidence concerning several entries in Eke's pocket diary, which was seized upon his arrest.  That diary listed the phone number of Nwokeji, who in turn had Eke's pager number.  Eke's diary also included the names of \"Jeff Obi,\" an alias used by Egboudikogu when recruiting couriers;  Anthony Isiamah, who allegedly served as a contact in Bangkok for Egboudikogu;  and Beth Freeland, a friend of Dagen.  While Dagen was in Manila on her trip, she had telephoned Nwokeji and Egboudikogu and asked them to send money to Freeland in order to pay Dagen's rent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the operator of a New York business that sends and receives international calls for customers testified that Eke received a fax from Thailand sent by someone named \"Chris.\"   A Nigerian also named \"Chris\" had delivered heroin from Bangkok, Thailand, to Manila, where he gave it to Dagen concealed in the children's book.  There was no further indication of the identity of the person who sent the fax or the contents of the fax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence just described adequately supports the district judge's ruling, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Eke was a member of the conspiracy.  This made the hearsay statement admissible.  And, adding the hearsay statement to the evidence just described, the cumulative evidence was more than adequate to permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Eke was a member of the conspiracy and had participated in the Dagen importation.  See United States v. Andujar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 21-22 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that without the hearsay statement and the evidence just described, Eke's mere presence at the donut shop showed very little.  But with the additional evidence, Eke's presence could be viewed as a further step by him in the conspiracy, in addition to his involvement with the Smith-Mixon ticket.  As for the required element of intent to enter into the conspiracy, see Andujar, 49 F.3d at 22, Egboudikogu's hearsay statement identified Eke as a partner in the conspiracy, a statement consistent with the other evidence as to Eke's activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eke makes other claims of error regarding his conviction based on an alleged variance between the indictment and trial evidence, various evidentiary rulings, the district court's denial of his new trial motion, and the absence of minorities on the jury.  We do not think any of these claims of error is arguably close, and to the extent that Eke seeks an explanation on those points, his claims are answered in the government's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. All three defendants challenge the district judge's calculation of drug quantity at sentencing.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the base offense level for importing drugs depends on the total drug quantity involved in the offenses.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c);  id. comment.  (n.12).  The government must prove drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence.  United States v. Lindia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196710\"><a href=\"/opinion/196710/united-states-v-lindia/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span>, 1161 (1st Cir.1996).  The district court's findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its legal rulings are considered de novo.  Id. at 1159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only drugs seized were the 229.9 grams of heroin found in the children's book carried by Dagen.  Hurt entered the country without detection, and Smith-Mixon never took the planned trip.  Nonetheless, following an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that the conspirators intended Hurt and Dagen each to import 400 grams of heroin, while Smith-Mixon was intended to import 200 grams--a total of 1,000 grams.  The court found Eke not responsible for the Hurt trip, reducing the amount attributed to him to 600 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 2D1.1(c), the kilogram charged to Egboudikogu and Nwokeji gave them each a base offense level of 32;  Eke, responsible for 600 grams, had a base offense level of 28.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji received adjustments for their role in the offense and acceptance of responsibility.  All three defendants were sentenced within the applicable guideline ranges.  On appeal, the only issues relate to the amount of drugs attributed to the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, the defendants assert that no quantity whatsoever should be attributed to them based on the Hurt and Smith-Mixon transactions.  Egboudikogu and Nwokeji say that Hurt may have been making a test run and carrying no heroin;  but both defendants pled guilty to count 2 of the indictment, which charged them with successfully importing heroin.  As for the aborted Smith-Mixon trip, section 2D1.1 expressly includes in the attributed amount any drugs sought to be imported through attempts and conspiracies, even if the efforts were unsuccessful.  See also U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 comment.  (n.12).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more difficult question is how to determine drug quantity for a transaction where no drugs are seized (Hurt and Smith-Mixon) or where the government says that the amount seized understates the scale of the offense (Dagen).  Application note 12 to section 2D1.1 provides the starting point.  It states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.  In making this determination, the court may consider, for example, the price generally obtained for the controlled substance, financial or other records, similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant, and the size or capability of any laboratory involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An approximation will be upheld \"as long as it represents a reasoned estimate of quantity.\"  United States v. Webster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196037\"><a href=\"/opinion/196037/united-states-v-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that some estimating methods (e.g., inventory records) are likely to be quite reliable, and others--such as computing drugs from sale proceeds--are reasonably accurate.  Here, however, the government had no such data.  Instead, at the evidentiary hearing, it called as a witness Peter Amentas, a federal customs agent familiar with heroin smuggling to the east coast of the United States and regarded as an expert by the government.  In a companion affidavit, Amentas stated that since August 1994,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>fees paid to couriers importing heroin into the eastern United States have ... remained stable.  Over that period, couriers have been paid an average of between $1,000 and $2,500 per 100 grams of a mixture containing heroin (having a purity of approximately 75%) brought into the Eastern portion of the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed to use the government's proposed approach.  The court cautiously selected the highest rate from the range identified by Amentas ($2,500 per 100 grams of heroin), thereby reducing the resulting drug quantity.  Dividing this $2,500 figure into the fees paid or offered to the three couriers, the court concluded that the defendants intended Hurt and Dagen each to import 400 grams of heroin (since each had been paid or promised $10,000) and that Smith-Mixon was intended to import 200 grams (based on the offer of $5,000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, the defendants say that the computations made by the district court are unduly speculative.  They urge that Dagen had imported 229.9 grams for $10,000 and therefore the amounts attributed to the other two couriers should be computed at the same rate (about 60 percent of the rate adopted by the district court).  On this calculation, the amount reflected by the total courier fees ($25,000) would be 574.75 grams, with Eke accountable for only 344.85 grams.  At first blush, this might appear a reasonable estimating approach based on a transaction actually undertaken by the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that the drugs seized from Dagen understated the amount that she had been intended to carry--or at least it was reasonable for the district court to reach this conclusion.  Egboudikogu told Dagen that she had not received as much heroin from the Asian suppliers as she was supposed to get;  according to Egboudikogu, the supplier had to rush the order because Dagen, already delayed many days, had hurried to return to the United States.  The defendants' proposed calculation is premised upon this understatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court is not required to prefer a less reliable calculation to a more reliable one, and the guidelines themselves instruct that where \"the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 comment.  (n.12) (emphasis added).  Yet a more reliable estimate is not automatically reliable enough:  the question remains whether the government's calculation here had \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"  Webster, 54 F.3d at 5 (citing U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the \"indicia of reliability\" was the experience of the government's witness, who said that he had worked on 200 heroin cases, and also had secured information from other officers.  In 15 of the cases, Amentas acted in an undercover capacity and in many others he had interviewed the couriers.  On this basis, Amentas testified to the payment range for couriers--$1,000 to $2,500 per 100 grams--engaged in similar transactions:  importing comparably pure heroin from Southeast Asia to the U.S. east coast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In principle, drug courier services are a \"market,\" like drug sales, and extrapolations based on street drug prices are commonly used to determine drug quantity.  E.g., United States v. Jackson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194898\"><a href=\"/opinion/194898/united-states-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 511 (1st Cir.1993).  Quite possibly, the price for heroin couriers at a given time and location may vary more widely than for retail sales (simply because market imperfections are greater);  and one may suspect that a direct linear relationship between quantity and price is less likely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Amentas readily admitted that courier payments varied for many reasons, including supply and demand changes and the experience and understanding of the courier.  But he testified to a payment range and said that this range had been steady for a considerable period.  He was cross-examined extensively;  this court has reviewed the cross-examination, and nothing in it seriously undermined Amentas' testimony.  The district judge, who has considerable latitude in this area, accepted it as persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law requires caution in estimating drug quantity but, in the last analysis, an estimate of drug quantity is treated as a \"fact.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197144\"><a href=\"/opinion/197144/united-states-v-sepulveda/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1313</span></a></span>, 1318 (1st Cir.1996).  Here, the district court credited the government's witness on the figures used for the range, and the court's calculation of quantity flowed rationally from that premise.  The court guarded itself by taking the lowest end of the range offered by Amentas.  Compare United States v. Sklar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.1990).  On the record before us, we cannot say that the district court's estimate was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants have made other criticisms of the government's evidence at sentencing and of the district court's calculations, but again, most of the remaining claims are addressed in the government's brief and none requires separate discussion.  Nwokeji points to mitigating circumstances in his own case, but the guidelines are largely driven by quantity, and he identifies no specific error by the district court in determining other adjustments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
