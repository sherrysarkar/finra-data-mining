Appellant, Kevin Rondeau, appeals the district\n\ncourt's   dismissal      of    his   complaint   on   the   ground    of   res\n\njudicata.       We give plenary review to a ruling based on res\n\njudicata.      Porn v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 93 F.3d 31, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).       We have carefully reviewed the parties' briefs\n\nand the record on appeal.             Upon our independent review, we\n\naffirm, essentially for the reasons stated in the district\n\ncourt's orders, dated July 18, 2000, and September 13, 2000.\n\n    In addition, there was neither error of law nor abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the district court's refusal to recuse itself or\n\nto retransfer this case to the United States District Court for\n\nthe Southern District of Ohio.          Rondeau also complains that the\n\ndistrict court refused to permit him to represent his minor\n\nchild or, in the alternative, to appoint counsel for her.                  But,\n\nthere was no prejudice as a result of the court's decision.\n\nRondeau had previously filed an identical complaint in 1998 and\n\nhe was permitted to litigate in that case on behalf of himself\n\nand on behalf of his minor child.            We affirmed the dismissal of\n\nthat complaint in Rondeau v. State of New Hampshire, No. 98-\n\n1802,   (1st    Cir.    Feb.   26,   1999)    (unpublished   per     curiam).\n\nBecause the instant case was properly dismissed on the basis of\n\nres judicata -- a basis that would have remained a proper ground\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\ffor dismissal even if the district court had permitted Rondeau\n\nto represent the interests of that minor child in this case as\n\nwell -- there was no prejudice as a result of the district\n\ncourt's refusal to permit Rondeau to represent that child or to\n\nappoint counsel for her in this case.\n\n    The motion to review the entire district court record is\n\ngranted.\n\n    Appellant's motions to strike the appellees' brief are\n\ndenied.\n\n    The judgment of the district court, dated September 14, 2000\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -3-\n\f",
