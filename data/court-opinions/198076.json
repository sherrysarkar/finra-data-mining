Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n James L. Sultan and Rankin &amp; Sultan on brief for appellant\r\nJose DeLaRosa.\r\n John F. Cicilline on brief for appellant John Delarosa.\r\n Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Kenneth P.\r\nMadden, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                      July 29, 1998\r\n\n                                      Per Curiam. Co-defendants Jose Delarosa and John\r\nDelarosa challenge adjustments to their respective sentences\r\nunder U.S.S.G.  3B1.1(c)   on both factual and legal grounds. \r\nWe conclude that the adjustments were not clearly erroneous.\r\n   As to each co-defendant, there was a sufficient\r\nfactual basis for the role-in-offense adjustment under \r\n3B1.1(c).  Particularly, the co-defendants pled guilty to\r\nmultiple violations of 21 U.S.C.  861 and so effectively\r\nadmitted that they \"employ[ed], hire[d], use[d], persuade[d],\r\ninduce[d], entice[d], or coerce[d]\" a minor (their 15-year-old\r\ncousin) in distributing heroin.  In the context of the present\r\ncase (where the minor was used to conduct heroin sales), those\r\nstatutory terms fairly imply leadership of a sort justifying an\r\nupward adjustment under  3B1.1.  The co-defendants' respective\r\norganizational, leadership, managerial, or supervisory roles in\r\nthe heroin distribution operation were amply demonstrated by\r\nthe undisputed facts about the heroin sales and the plausible\r\ninferences to be drawn therefrom.  We will not second-guess the\r\ndistrict court's choice among those plausible inferences.  SeeUnited States v. Garcia, 34 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n   We also reject the co-defendants' arguments that\r\nimpermissible double-counting occurred when the district court\r\ndetermined the base offense level under U.S.S.G.  2D1.2   and\r\nthen enhanced that level under  3B1.1.  The guidelines do not\r\nexpressly prohibit a  3B1.1 adjustment to a  2D1.2 base\r\noffense level, and there is no compelling reason to ban\r\nconcurrent use of the two sections.  See United States v.\r\nLilly, 13 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1994).  The two sections\r\naddress different factors:   2D1.2 addresses drug quantity and\r\ninvolvement of protected individuals and locations;  3B1.1\r\naddresses hierarchical responsibility.  And the two sections do\r\nnot apply in lockstep:  for example, selling drugs to a minor\r\nmay entail a  2D1.2 base offense level, but not necessarily a\r\n 3B1.1 role-in-offense adjustment; selling drugs through a\r\nminor may entail, as here, consequences under both  2D1.2 and\r\n 3B1.1.  Accordingly, we conclude that the  3B1.1 adjustment\r\nwas applied here without impermissible double-counting.  SeeGarcia, 34 F.3d at 11-12 (particular offense conduct, such as\r\nuse of a weapon, may be a factor both in the base offense level\r\nand also in adjusting that level to reflect a higher degree of\r\nculpability).  In reaching this conclusion, we ascribe no\r\npersuasive weight to United States v. Stevenson, 6 F.3d 1262,\r\n1269-70 (7th Cir. 1993).\r\n   Turning to the matter of criminal history, we cannot\r\nsay, on the record presented for our review, that the district\r\ncourt was required to treat four of co-defendant Jose\r\nDelarosa's juvenile offenses as \"related\" for the purpose of\r\ncalculating his criminal history points.  Even though like\r\nsentences were imposed at the same time for all four offenses,\r\nthere was no \"persuasive indicium of formal consolidation.\" \r\nUnited States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nThe claim that two of the four sentences may have been\r\nexcessive is not cognizable in the context of this appeal, and,\r\nin any event, does not prove that the four offenses were\r\nformally consolidated.\r\n  Finally, we are left with the failure-to-depart\r\nclaim.  It is evident to us from the district court's remarks\r\n(\"even if I had [the authority to depart], I wouldn't because\r\nof the aggravating factors in this case\") that the court\r\nrejected on discretionary grounds co-defendant John Delarosa's\r\nplea for a downward departure.  Accordingly, we lack\r\njurisdiction to review that decision.  See United States v.\r\nGrandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
