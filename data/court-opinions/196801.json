On appeal he argues that the\r\n\ncourt erred  in rejecting his argument  of \"sentencing factor\r\n\nmanipulation\" and refusing to exclude from the calculation of\r\n\nhis sentence certain quantities of  \"crack\" cocaine.  After a\r\n\ncareful review of the parties' briefs, the hearing transcript\r\n\nand other parts of  the record, we  find no \"clear error\"  in\r\n\nthe district court's  determination that defendant failed  to\r\n\nsustain  his   burden  of  proving  entitlement   to  such  a\r\n\nreduction.  There was  no proof of extraordinary governmental\r\n\nmisconduct.  See United States v.
