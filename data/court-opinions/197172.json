In  May  1995,  a  jury\r                      STAHL,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                            \r\n\nconvicted  defendant  Dwayne  Young  on  a  single  count  of\r\n\nunlawful  possession of  a firearm  by a  felon, 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n922(g)(1).  During trial, and after denying Young's motion to\r\n\nsuppress,  the   district  court  admitted  the  firearm  and\r\n\nammunition into evidence.  The district court also admitted a\r\n\nso-called \"turret  tape,\" a recording of  radio transmissions\r\n\nbetween a police officer and his dispatcher,  made during the\r\n\nofficer's  foot pursuit  of  Young.1   Finally, the  district\r\n\ncourt  allowed   the  jury  to   use  a   government-prepared\r\n\ntranscript as  an aid in listening  to the tape while  it was\r\n\nbeing played during trial.  Finding no error, we affirm.\r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          On  April 7,  1994, Officers  James Fee  and Robert\r\n\nTwitchell of the  Boston Police Department, while  patrolling\r\n\nthe  Roxbury section  of Boston,  received a  radio broadcast\r\n\ndescribing  three  individuals  suspected  of  armed robbery.\r\n\nSeveral  blocks  from  the  last  reported  location  of  the\r\n\nsuspects, the officers noticed a group  of three men standing\r\n\ntogether.    Upon  seeing  the unmarked  cruiser,  the  group\r\n\ndispersed.   One of the three, Young, walked in one direction\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  term \"turret  tape\"  refers to  recordings of  radio\r\nbroadcasts  between Boston  Police officers  and dispatchers.\r\nSpecifically,  \"turret\"  derives  from   the  fact  that  the\r\ncommunications  facility  which  records  such  transmissions\r\nresides in aturret tower at the Boston Police headquarters.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nby himself while the  other two departed together  in another\r\n\ndirection.  \r\n\n          The officers, noting that Young's short height  and\r\n\nblack clothing appeared  to match the  description of one  of\r\n\nthe  robbery  suspects,  pulled  their cruiser  to  the  curb\r\n\nalongside Young.  From  the passenger seat, Officer Twitchell\r\n\nrolled down his  window and announced \"Boston Police, you got\r\n\na minute?\"  to  which Young  responded  \"Sure.\"   Young  then\r\n\n\"angled\" toward the rear of the cruiser.  As Young approached\r\n\nthe  car,  the  officers  noticed  the handle  of  a  handgun\r\n\nprotruding from  his waistband.  Officer  Twitchell lunged at\r\n\nYoung  through  the  window  of the  cruiser,  made  fleeting\r\n\ncontact  with his jacket or  belt, but failed  to either grab\r\n\nthe  gun or  detain  him.   Young  turned  and  ran from  the\r\n\ncruiser, with Twitchell, now on foot, in pursuit.\r\n\n          During  the  pursuit, Officer  Twitchell  saw Young\r\n\nremove  the  gun from  his waistband  and  throw it  into the\r\n\nbasement  stairwell of  a building  on Elm Street.   Although\r\n\nYoung   successfully  eluded  Twitchell,  he  was  ultimately\r\n\napprehended  by a back-up police officer who found him hiding\r\n\nin a nearby garage.   Officer Twitchell then returned  to the\r\n\nstairwell  and recovered  the gun.   While these  events were\r\n\nunfolding, Officer Twitchell and other  officers continuously\r\n\ntransmitted  information  to  the  dispatcher  at  the Boston\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nPolice headquarters.  These transmissions comprise the turret\r\n\ntape.  \r\n\n          Prior to trial, Young moved to suppress the gun and\r\n\nthe turret tape.   Young asserted  that the police  recovered\r\n\nthe gun through  a violation of his  Fourth Amendment rights,\r\n\nand argued  that the  tape constituted  inadmissible hearsay.\r\n\nThe district court denied Young's motion to suppress the gun,\r\n\nbut  granted his motion with respect to the turret tape, with\r\n\nthe caveat  that  defense counsel's  cross examination  might\r\n\nsubsequently render  it admissible.   During trial  and after\r\n\ndefense counsel's cross examination of Officer Twitchell, the\r\n\ndistrict court admitted the turret tape as a prior consistent\r\n\nstatement, and allowed the jury to use a transcript  prepared\r\n\nby the government, as an aid in listening to the turret tape.\r\n\nYoung appeals  admission of the gun and  tape, as well as use\r\n\nof the transcript.\r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          A.  Suppression of the Gun\r                                                \r\n\n          We employ  a dual standard in  reviewing motions to\r\n\nsuppress.   We review  the district court's  findings of fact\r\n\nfor clear error.  See United States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436,\r                                                           \r\n\n441 (1st  Cir. 1995).  \"A  clear error exists only  if, after\r\n\nconsidering  all of the evidence, we are left with a definite\r\n\nand  firm conviction that a  mistake has been  made.\"  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  McCarthy,  77  F.3d 522,  529  (1st  Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndenied, 117 S.  Ct. 479  (1996).  Deference  to the  district\r                  \r\n\ncourt's  findings of  fact  reflects our  awareness that  the\r\n\ntrial judge, who hears the testimony, observes the witnesses'\r\n\ndemeanor and evaluates the facts first hand, sits in the best\r\n\nposition  to determine  what actually  happened.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Zapata, 18  F.3d 971,  975 (1st  Cir. 1994).   By\r                              \r\n\ncontrast, we review  conclusions of law  de novo and  subject\r                                                            \r\n\nthe  trial  court's  constitutional  conclusions  to  plenary\r\n\nreview.  See id.; see  also Ornelas v. United States, 116  S.\r                                                                \r\n\nCt. 1657, 1663 (1996).  Determinations  of probable cause and\r\n\nreasonable  suspicion, relevant  to the  constitutionality of\r\n\nlaw  enforcement   seizures  and  arrests  under  the  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment, present  mixed questions of law and  fact which we\r\n\nreview de novo.  See Ornelas, 116 S. Ct. at 1663.  \r                                        \r\n\n          Young  argues  that  the  district court  erred  by\r\n\nconcluding that recovery of the firearm did not occur through\r\n\nconduct   that   violated   his   Fourth   Amendment  rights.\r\n\nSpecifically,  Young contends that Officers Twitchell and Fee\r\n\nlacked either the reasonable suspicion needed to stop him, or\r\n\nthe probable cause required for an arrest.  We disagree.\r\n\n          Interaction between law  enforcement officials  and\r\n\ncitizens  generally  falls  within  three   tiers  of  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment   analysis,  depending  on   the  level  of  police\r\n\nintrusion  into a person's privacy.  The first or lowest tier\r\n\nencompasses  interaction of  such minimally  intrusive nature\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthat  it  does  not trigger  the  protections  of the  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment.  The Supreme  Court has repeatedly emphasized that\r\n\nnot all personal intercourse  between the police and citizens\r\n\nrises  to the  level of a  stop or  seizure.   See Florida v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991) (citing cases).  Police may\r                   \r\n\napproach  citizens in  public spaces  and ask  them questions\r\n\nwithout triggering  the protections of the  Fourth Amendment.\r\n\nSee  id.; United States v. Manchester, 711 F.2d 458, 460 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1983).  Such police engagements need not find a basis in\r\n\nany  articulable suspicion.  See  Bostick, 501  U.S. at  435.\r                                                     \r\n\nPolice conduct  falls short  of  triggering Fourth  Amendment\r\n\nprotections when, from the  totality of the circumstances, we\r\n\ndetermine that  the subject  of any police  interaction would\r\n\nhave  felt free  to  terminate the  conversation and  proceed\r\n\nalong his  way.  See Bostick, 501  U.S. at 439; United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Sealey, 30 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1994).  The totality of the\r                     \r\n\ncircumstances in  this case establishes  that any interaction\r\n\nbetween the  officers and Young prior  to Officer Twitchell's\r\n\nlunge  falls well  within  the first  tier of  police-citizen\r\n\ninteraction, and therefore, fails  to trigger the protections\r\n\nof the Fourth Amendment.  As they pulled alongside Young, the\r\n\nofficers identified themselves as Boston Police officers, and\r\n\nasked  \"got a  minute\" to  which Young  replied \"sure.\"   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  credited  the  officers'  testimony,  and we\r\n\ndetect  no clear error.   We recently determined that conduct\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nvirtually identical to  what occurred  in this  case did  not\r\n\ntrigger   the  protections  of   the  Fourth  Amendment,  and\r\n\nconcluded that  in the  absence of  an officer's  exertion of\r\n\nphysical  force or  an individual's submission  to a  show of\r\n\nauthority,  no seizure  occurs.   See Sealey,  30 F.3d  at 10\r                                                        \r\n\n(finding no Fourth Amendment seizure where police officers in\r\n\na cruiser approached defendant and yelled \"Hey Steven, what's\r\n\nup?\") (citing California v. Hodari D., 499  U.S. 621 (1991)).\r                                                 \r\n\nWe reiterate  that conclusion  with respect to  the officers'\r\n\nconduct toward Young prior to Officer Twitchell's lunge.\r\n\n          The   remaining  two  tiers   of  Fourth  Amendment\r\n\nanalysis comprise  de facto arrests requiring probable cause,\r                                       \r\n\nand lesser seizures generally known as investigative or Terry\r                                                                         \r\n\nstops,  which  require a  lesser  reasonable  suspicion.   An\r\n\narrest occurs when an officer, acting on probable  cause that\r\n\nan individual has committed  a crime, detains that individual\r\n\nas  a suspect.   Probable cause exists  when police officers,\r\n\nrelying  on reasonably  trustworthy facts  and circumstances,\r\n\nhave information upon which a reasonably prudent person would\r\n\nbelieve  the suspect had committed or was committing a crime.\r\n\nSee United States  v. Maguire,  918 F.2d 254,  258 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1990), cert. denied, Kavanagh v.

An investigative  stop, also known as a  Terry stop,\r                                                                   \r\n\nsee Terry  v. Ohio, 392 U.S.  1 (1968), occurs  when a police\r                              \r\n\nofficer,  acting on  reasonable and articulable  suspicion of\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\ncriminal activity, briefly  detains an individual to  confirm\r\n\nor  dispel  his suspicion.   See  McCarthy,  77 F.3d  at 529;\r                                                      \r\n\nUnited States v. Schiavo, 29 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                    \r\n\n          The  government  concedes,  for  purposes  of  this\r\n\nappeal, that when Officer  Twitchell made contact with Young,\r\n\nhe  seized him  for  Fourth Amendment  purposes.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nZapata, 18 F.3d at 977 (indicating that officer's touching of\r                  \r\n\ncitizen  during ongoing  investigative stop  establishes that\r\n\nseizure  occurred).   In the  absence of further  argument on\r\n\nthis point, we  proceed under the  assumption that a  seizure\r\n\noccurred  in this  case.   Young  contends that  the officers\r\n\neither seized him without the requisite reasonable suspicion,\r\n\nor  arrested him  without the requisite  probable cause.   We\r\n\nconclude that  to the  extent the officers,  through fleeting\r\n\nphysical  contact, seized Young, they did  so well within the\r\n\nparameters of  an investigative stop, and  that the officers'\r\n\nactions  do  not rise  to the  level  of an  arrest requiring\r\n\nprobable cause.\r\n\n          With respect to  investigative stops, the  relevant\r\n\nquestion \"is  not whether  the police had  probable cause  to\r\n\nact, but  instead whether  the actions taken  were reasonable\r\n\nunder  the circumstances.\"    McCarthy,  77  F.3d at  529.

According  to  the\r                                       \r\n\ndistrict court,  the following facts gave  rise to reasonable\r\n\nsuspicion  necessary to  temporarily detain  Young:   (1) the\r\n\nofficers saw three  individuals, one or more of whom appeared\r\n\nto  match the description of three armed robbers who had been\r\n\nspotted in the area; (2) as they approached, one of the three\r\n\n(Young)  walked  away from  the group;  (3) Officer  Fee told\r\n\nOfficer Twitchell  that he  thought he recognized  the person\r\n\nwalking away (Young) as a \"bad guy;\" (4) upon asking Young to\r\n\nanswer some questions,  Young angled toward  the rear of  the\r\n\ncar instead of directly toward  the passenger window; and (5)\r\n\nas  Young  approached,  both  officers  saw  a  gun   in  his\r\n\nwaistband.

We are satisfied, moreover, that  these facts in\r\n\ntheir totality  could give  rise to the  officers' reasonable\r\n\nsuspicion that Young had been involved in criminal activity.\r\n\n          We also conclude  that Officer Twitchell's  action,\r\n\nthe  lunge at Young, was  reasonably related in  scope to the\r\n\ncircumstances.  In agreeing  with the district court we  note\r\n\nthat  sight of the gun gave rise to a significant concern for\r\n\nthe officers' and public's safety.  See Walker, 924 F.2d at 4\r                                                          \r\n\n(officer's   concern  for   own  safety   is   of  \"paramount\r\n\nimportance\" in  assessing the  appropriateness of  the action\r\n\ntaken).  To  open the door of the cruiser  and question Young\r\n\nwould  have afforded Young an opportunity to use the gun, and\r\n\ncould  have placed the officers  and any bystanders in harm's\r\n\nway. \r\n\n          To be sure, the  officers did not determine whether\r\n\nYoung  carried the  firearm  legally prior  to attempting  to\r\n\nremove  it or restrain him.

R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B).   For Rule 801(d)(1)(B) purposes,\r\n\nwe  view the  lower  court's determination  that a  statement\r\n\nrebuts an express  or implied charge of recent fabrication as\r\n\na  finding of  fact, subject  to reversal  only if  it proves\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nto  playing  the  tape,   the  government  elicited   Officer\r\nTwitchell's  testimony  that  he  recognized the  tape  as  a\r\nrecording of the broadcast,  he had listened to the  tape, he\r\nrecognized all of  the voices on it, and that  to the best of\r\nhis knowledge,  the tape fairly and  accurately reflected the\r\nradio  transmissions  that occurred  that  evening.   In  the\r\nabsence of any foundation-based objection by defense counsel,\r\nwe cannot  conclude that  the district judge  committed plain\r\nerror.   With  respect to  Young's alternative  arguments, we\r\nconclude  that the  tape  was properly  admitted  as a  prior\r\nconsistent statement, and, therefore, we decline to  consider\r\nthem.  \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nclearly  erroneous.

The district\r\n\njudge  declined to allow the tape at that time, but indicated\r\n\nthat cross examination of  Officer Twitchell could render the\r\n\ntape  admissible  as  a Rule  801(d)(1)(B)  prior  consistent\r\n\nstatement. During cross examination, Young's counsel elicited\r\n\ntestimony from Officer Twitchell  that, prior to his recovery\r\n\nof  the firearm,  he  had never  broadcast  (a) that  he  and\r\n\nOfficer Fee saw  a gun in Young's waistband, and  (b) that he\r\n\nhad seen Young throw the handgun during the pursuit.\r\n\n          The  government argued that through those questions\r\n\ndefense counsel  implied  that Officer  Twitchell  fabricated\r\n\nseeing Young possess the  gun, and moved on redirect  to play\r\n\nthe  turret tape  as a  prior statement  consistent  with his\r\n\ntestimony.   Officer  Twitchell testified  that he  saw Young\r\n\nthrow  the gun, and on the tape, states the same observation.\r\n\nThe district court found  that defense counsel, regardless of\r\n\nher  intent, had elicited testimony from which the jury could\r\n\ninfer that  Officer Twitchell fabricated his  testimony, and,\r\n\naccordingly, admitted  the tape under Rule  801(d)(1)(B).  We\r\n\ncannot conclude that the lower court abused its discretion.\r\n\n          Despite defense  counsel's insistence that  she did\r\n\nnot intend to imply fabrication, the district judge correctly\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nruled  on the basis of the possible inferences the jury could\r\n\nmake as a result of the question.

Moreover,  the district judge  did not commit  clear\r\n\nerror in finding  that as  a result of  cross examination,  a\r\n\njury could have concluded  that Officer Twitchell neither saw\r\n\nYoung with a gun in his waistband, nor saw Young throw a gun.\r\n\nDefense   counsel's   questioning   implied  fabrication   by\r\n\nhighlighting  that Officer Twitchell  never broadcast that he\r\n\nsaw a gun in  Young's waistband, and that he  never broadcast\r\n\nthat he saw Young throw the gun until after Officer Twitchell\r\n\nrecovered  the gun.    In simple  terms,  a jury  could  have\r\n\ninferred that  if Officer Twitchell did not  broadcast it, it\r\n\ndid not happen.   His  statement on the  tape was  consistent\r\n\nwith his  testimony on direct  examination that  he had  seen\r\n\nYoung  throw  the  gun,  and,  therefore,  was  appropriately\r\n\nadmitted as a prior statement consistent with that testimony.\r\n\n          Young points  out that  nothing in the  turret tape\r\n\ndirectly  contradicts the  testimony  elicited  during  cross\r\n\nexamination, that Officer Twitchell did not broadcast that he\r\n\nsaw Young throw a gun until  after he recovered it.  While we\r\n\ndo  not dispute  the truth  of Young's  assertion, we  do not\r\n\nascribe  similar significance  to it.

Having found,\r\n\nwithout  clearly erring,  that defense  counsel's questioning\r\n\ncould  permit the  jury  to infer  fabrication, the  district\r\n\njudge did  not abuse his  discretion in admitting  the turret\r\n\ntape  as  a  Rule 801(d)(1)(B)  prior  consistent  statement,\r\n\noffered to rebut that implied charge.\r\n\n          The district judge  allowed the government to  play\r\n\nthe  entire turret  tape, \"in  order to  set the  context, in\r\n\norder  to understand the timing of what was going on.\"  Young\r\n\ncontends that  even if one of  Officer Twitchell's statements\r\n\nconstitutes a prior consistent  statement, the tape  contains\r\n\nadditional statements of Officer Twitchell and others that do\r\n\nnot  fall within  that category,  and, therefore,  constitute\r\n\ninadmissible hearsay.\r\n\n          At  sidebar  the  district  judge  invited  defense\r\n\ncounsel to  offer redactions  for his consideration  prior to\r\n\nplaying  the tape  to the  jury.   Defense counsel  failed to\r\n\noffer specific, cognizable redactions,  failed on the  record\r\n\nto  object specifically  to those  portions  of the  tape she\r\n\nfound objectionable, and to explain to the district judge why\r\n\nthey   did  not   constitute  prior   consistent  statements.\r\n\nAccordingly, Young may not now raise this argument on appeal.\r\n\nSee Piva, 870  F.2d at  759 (lack of  specific objections  at\r                    \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\ntrial  precludes  party   from  raising  specific  issue   on\r\n\nappeal).3   In any event, having reviewed the contents of the\r\n\ntape, we cannot  conclude that the district  judge abused his\r\n\ndiscretion in admitting the entire tape and playing it to the\r\n\njury.4\r\n\n          C.  Use of Transcripts of the Turret Tape\r                                                               \r\n\n          The district  judge also allowed the  government to\r\n\nprovide  a transcript  to aid  the jury  in listening  to the\r\n\ntape.   By way  of background, we digress  to explain how the\r\n\ngovernment  prepared the  transcript.   The  government first\r\n\nsent the  tape to  a transcribing company,  which transcribed\r\n\nthe  tape to the best of its ability, given its unfamiliarity\r\n\nwith police  jargon, names  and  codes, and  the events  that\r\n\ntranspired  that particular  evening.    The government  then\r\n\nallowed each participant to review the transcript independent\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  In Piva,  the district  judge admitted a  prior statement\r                       \r\nunder  Rule  801(d)(1)(B)   over  counsel's  general  hearsay\r\nobjection.  870 F.2d at 759.  Rather than point to a specific\r\nreason why  Rule 801(d)(1)(B)  did not apply,  counsel merely\r\nmade   a  hearsay   objection   and   also  argued   improper\r\nrehabilitation.   See  id.   We held  that counsel's  lack of\r                                      \r\nspecificity precluded raising  a specific  challenge to  Rule\r\n801(d)(1)(B) applicability for the first time on appeal.  See\r                                                                         \r\nid.  \r               \r\n\n4.  With respect to the  Turret tape, Young did not  raise an\r\nargument  based  on Tome  v. United  States,  116 S.  Ct. 696\r                                                       \r\n(1996)  either  at  trial  or now  on  appeal.    We are  not\r\nunmindful, however, of the Supreme  Court's recent admonition\r\nthat to be admissible, a prior consistent statement must have\r\nbeen  made before the alleged motive to fabricate arose.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\nat 700.  In  light of the nearly contemporaneous  recovery of\r\nthe gun  and Officer Twitchell's broadcast,  we are satisfied\r\nthat this case does not present us with a Tome issue.\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nof one another, in order to attempt to fill in those portions\r\n\nthe transcribing company could not determine.  The government\r\n\nthen  sent the  revised transcript  back to  the transcribing\r\n\ncompany, which then reviewed it while listening to the  tape,\r\n\nin order to validate the corrections.\r\n\n          The government informed the court of this procedure\r\n\nat  the  hearing on  Young's  motion  to  suppress,  when  it\r\n\nintroduced  the  tape  at  trial,  and  before  the  jury  by\r\n\nspecifically eliciting Officer  Twitchell's testimony that he\r\n\nassisted in the  preparation of  the final  transcript.   The\r\n\ndistrict judge  offered defense  counsel  the opportunity  to\r\n\nreplay the  tape with an alternative  transcript, and allowed\r\n\nsignificant time and latitude on cross examination of Officer\r\n\nTwitchell about  the government's transcript and  his role in\r\n\nits preparation.  Defense counsel, however, failed to utilize\r\n\nany alternative transcript, or even the original draft of the\r\n\ntranscript,   to   point   out   potential   inaccuracies  or\r\n\ninconsistencies, or  simply to offer the  jury an alternative\r\n\nview of the contents of the tape.\r\n\n          In  this circuit we  have long approved  the use of\r\n\nproperly authenticated transcripts of tape recordings for the\r\n\npurpose of  helping the  jury  listen to  and understand  the\r\n\nrecordings themselves.   See  United States v.  Campbell, 874\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  838, 849 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.

Prior to  trial, the\r\n\ndistrict judge  should attempt to obtain  a single stipulated\r\n\ntranscript;  failing that,  however, the  court should  allow\r\n\neach party to introduce its  own transcript of the  recording\r\n\nupon proper authentication.

See  id.   Should  a\r                                                             \r\n\ndefendant fail to offer  specific objections during  playback\r\n\nof the tape, or offer an alternative transcript, the district\r\n\ncourt does not abuse  its discretion by allowing the  jury to\r\n\nuse the transcript.  See id.\r                                        \r\n\n          Our  review  of  the  record reveals  no  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion in the use of the government's transcript  in this\r\n\ncase.   At the  outset we  note that  Young does  not dispute\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nproper authentication.  Upon  determining that the jury could\r\n\nhear  the tape with the  aid of the  disputed transcript, the\r\n\ndistrict judge  gave the requisite instruction  that the tape\r\n\nand  not the  transcripts constituted  the evidence  the jury\r\n\nshould consider.  The  judge specifically instructed the jury\r\n\nto  disregard anything in the transcript  that they could not\r\n\nunderstand  from the  tape.   See Campbell,  874 F.2d  at 849\r                                                      \r\n\n(once  judge instructs jury  that tape and  not transcript is\r\n\nevidence, we review for abuse of discretion).  The judge also\r\n\ninstructed the jury  that he would  allow defense counsel  to\r\n\nplay the tape again  with a different transcript, \"to  see if\r\n\nyou hear something different from what you might have thought\r\n\nyou heard when it was played with the other transcript before\r\n\nyou.\" The  judge reiterated this  instruction as part  of his\r\n\nfinal instructions while charging the jury.5      \r\n\n          In  addition to  the  events at  trial, the  record\r\n\nreflects  that  defense  counsel  possessed  copies  of   the\r\n\ngovernment's transcripts before trial, but raised no pretrial\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Young also  asserts that by reviewing  the transcript and\r\nhelping  to fill  in  some of  the portions  the transcribing\r\ncompany  found  unintelligible,  Officer  Twitchell  had  the\r\nopportunity  to create  his own  prior consistent  statements\r\nafter  a motive  to  fabricate arose.    See Tome  v.  United\r                                                                         \r\nStates,  115  S.  Ct.  696, 700  (1995)  (holding  that prior\r                  \r\nconsistent  statement must  have been  made before  motive to\r\nfabricate arose in  order to  be admissible).   We note  only\r\nthat, as  the district judge  twice instructed the  jury, the\r\nevidence  consisted of the tape  and not the  transcript.  As\r\nindicated, defense  counsel had ample opportunity  to present\r\nan  alternative  transcript,  or  to  impeach  the transcript\r\nthrough cross examination of Officer Twitchell.  \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nobjections specific to either of them.  While defense counsel\r\n\nobjected to the revised  transcript at trial on the  basis of\r\n\nalleged  inaccuracies, she  neither made  specific objections\r\n\nduring  playback   of  the  tape,  nor  chose   to  offer  an\r\n\nalternative  transcript,  even  though  the   district  judge\r\n\nclearly indicated he  would permit  her to  do so.   On  that\r\n\nbasis  we cannot conclude that  the district court abused its\r\n\ndiscretion  in  allowing the  jury  to  use the  government's\r\n\ntranscript.6   See Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 48 (holding that\r                                           \r\n\ndistrict  court   does  not  abuse   discretion  by  allowing\r\n\ntranscript in absence  of specific objections  or alternative\r\n\ntranscript).  \r\n\n          Finally, Young argues that  the tape and transcript\r\n\nhad a prejudicial effect  that far outweighed their probative\r\n\nvalue under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Young\r\n\nfailed to  raise  this  objection at  trial;  we  review  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Young also  challenges the admissibility of  the tape and\r\nuse  of  the transcript  on  the basis  of  the Confrontation\r\nClause  of the Sixth Amendment.   See U.S.  Const. amend. VI,\r                                                 \r\ncl. 3.  Young argues  that the transcript contains statements\r\nby  the dispatcher, who did not appear at trial as a witness.\r\nThe  Confrontation Clause  exists  to  \"advance  a  practical\r\nconcern for the accuracy  of 'the truth-determining process .\r\n. . by assuring  that the trier of fact [has]  a satisfactory\r\nbasis  for evaluating  the  truth of  the prior  statement.'\"\r\nUnited  States v.  Panzardi-Lespier, 918  F.2d 313,  319 (1st\r                                               \r\nCir. 1990).  On that basis, we have held that when an out-of-\r\ncourt statement  \"falls within  a firmly rooted  exception to\r\nthe hearsay  principle,\" its  admission does not  violate the\r\nConfrontation Clause.   See id.   Having determined that  the\r                                           \r\nturret tape constitutes a prior consistent statement, and not\r\nhearsay,  we are satisfied that its admission did not violate\r\nthe Confrontation Clause.  \r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\ndistrict court's decision,  therefore, only for plain  error.\r\n\nSee  Jacques v.

Several blocks from the last reported location of the suspects, the officers noticed a group of three men standing together.  Upon seeing the unmarked cruiser, the group dispersed.  One of the three, Young, walked in one direction by himself while the other two departed together in another direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers, noting that Young's short height and black clothing appeared to match the description of one of the robbery suspects, pulled their cruiser to the curb alongside Young.  From the passenger seat, Officer Twitchell rolled down his window and announced \"Boston Police, you got a minute?\" to which Young responded \"Sure.\"  Young then \"angled\" toward the rear of the cruiser.  As Young approached the car, the officers noticed the handle of a handgun protruding from his waistband.  Officer Twitchell lunged at Young through the window of the cruiser, made fleeting contact with his jacket or belt, but failed to either grab the gun or detain him.  Young turned and ran from the cruiser, with Twitchell, now on foot, in pursuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pursuit, Officer Twitchell saw Young remove the gun from his waistband and throw it into the basement stairwell of a building on Elm Street.  Although Young successfully eluded Twitchell, he was ultimately apprehended by a back-up police officer who found him hiding in a nearby garage.  Officer Twitchell then returned to the stairwell and recovered the gun.  While these events were unfolding, Officer Twitchell and other officers continuously transmitted information to the dispatcher at the Boston Police headquarters.  These transmissions comprise the turret tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Young moved to suppress the gun and the turret tape.  Young asserted that the police recovered the gun through a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, and argued that the tape constituted inadmissible hearsay.  The district court denied Young's motion to suppress the gun, but granted his motion with respect to the turret tape, with the caveat that defense counsel's cross examination might subsequently render it admissible.  During trial and after defense counsel's cross examination of Officer Twitchell, the district court admitted the turret tape as a prior consistent statement, and allowed the jury to use a transcript prepared by the government, as an aid in listening to the turret tape.  Young appeals admission of the gun and tape, as well as use of the transcript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Deference to the district court's findings of fact reflects our awareness that the trial judge, who hears the testimony, observes the witnesses' demeanor and evaluates the facts first hand, sits in the best position to determine what actually happened.  See United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994).  By contrast, we review conclusions of law de novo and subject the trial court's constitutional conclusions to plenary review.  See id.;   see also Ornelas v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).  Determinations of probable cause and reasonable suspicion, relevant to the constitutionality of law enforcement seizures and arrests under the Fourth Amendment, present mixed questions of law and fact which we review de novo.  See Ornelas, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1663.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young argues that the district court erred by concluding that recovery of the firearm did not occur through conduct that violated his Fourth Amendment rights.  Specifically, Young contends that Officers Twitchell and Fee lacked either the reasonable suspicion needed to stop him, or the probable cause required for an arrest.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interaction between law enforcement officials and citizens generally falls within three tiers of Fourth Amendment analysis, depending on the level of police intrusion into a person's privacy.  The first or lowest tier encompasses interaction of such minimally intrusive nature that it does not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that not all personal intercourse between the police and citizens rises to the level of a stop or seizure.  See Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2386, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (citing cases).  Police may approach citizens in public spaces and ask them questions without triggering the protections of the Fourth Amendment.  See id.;  United States v. Manchester, 711 F.2d 458, 460 (1st Cir.1983).  Such police engagements need not find a basis in any articulable suspicion.  See Bostick, 501 U.S. at 435, 111 S.Ct. at 2386-87.   Police conduct falls short of triggering Fourth Amendment protections when, from the totality of the circumstances, we determine that the subject of any police interaction would have felt free to terminate the conversation and proceed along his way.  See Bostick, 501 U.S. at 439, 111 S.Ct. at 2388-89; United States v. Sealey, 30 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The totality of the circumstances in this case establishes that any interaction between the officers and Young prior to Officer Twitchell's lunge falls well within the first tier of police-citizen interaction, and therefore, fails to trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.  As they pulled alongside Young, the officers identified themselves as Boston Police officers, and asked \"got a minute\" to which Young replied \"sure.\"   The district court credited the officers' testimony, and we detect no clear error.  We recently determined that conduct virtually identical to what occurred in this case did not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment, and concluded that in the absence of an officer's exertion of physical force or an individual's submission to a show of authority, no seizure occurs.  See Sealey, 30 F.3d at 10 (finding no Fourth Amendment seizure where police officers in a cruiser approached defendant and yelled \"Hey Steven, what's up?\")  (citing California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991)).  We reiterate that conclusion with respect to the officers' conduct toward Young prior to Officer Twitchell's lunge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining two tiers of Fourth Amendment analysis comprise de facto arrests requiring probable cause, and lesser seizures generally known as investigative or Terry stops, which require a lesser reasonable suspicion.  An arrest occurs when an officer, acting on probable cause that an individual has committed a crime, detains that individual as a suspect.  Probable cause exists when police officers, relying on reasonably trustworthy facts and circumstances, have information upon which a reasonably prudent person would believe the suspect had committed or was committing a crime.  See United States v. Maguire, 918 F.2d 254, 258 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, Kavanagh v. United States, 501 U.S. 1234, 111 S.Ct. 2861, 115 L.Ed.2d 1027 (1991).  An investigative stop, also known as a Terry stop, see Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), occurs when a police officer, acting on reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity, briefly detains an individual to confirm or dispel his suspicion.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 529;  United States v. Schiavo, 29 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government concedes, for purposes of this appeal, that when Officer Twitchell made contact with Young, he seized him for Fourth Amendment purposes.  See, e.g., Zapata, 18 F.3d at 977 (indicating that officer's touching of citizen during ongoing investigative stop establishes that seizure occurred).  In the absence of further argument on this point, we proceed under the assumption that a seizure occurred in this case.  Young contends that the officers either seized him without the requisite reasonable suspicion, or arrested him without the requisite probable cause.  We conclude that to the extent the officers, through fleeting physical contact, seized Young, they did so well within the parameters of an investigative stop, and that the officers' actions do not rise to the level of an arrest requiring probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to investigative stops, the relevant question \"is not whether the police had probable cause to act, but instead whether the actions taken were reasonable under the circumstances.\"  McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 529.   A familiar two-pronged test guides this inquiry.  We first must determine whether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and, if so, whether the action taken was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference.  See id. at 530;  United States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1994).  To satisfy the first prong, \" 'the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.' \"  Kimball, 25 F.3d at 6 (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-80).   To satisfy the second prong, we examine the totality of the circumstances, see United States v. Walker, 924 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1991), bearing in mind that \"an officer may [ ] conduct a patdown search where the officer is justified in believing that the person is armed and dangerous to the officer or others,\" Schiavo, 29 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the district court, the following facts gave rise to reasonable suspicion necessary to temporarily detain Young:  (1) the officers saw three individuals, one or more of whom appeared to match the description of three armed robbers who had been spotted in the area;  (2) as they approached, one of the three (Young) walked away from the group;  (3) Officer Fee told Officer Twitchell that he thought he recognized the person walking away (Young) as a \"bad guy;\" (4) upon asking Young to answer some questions, Young angled toward the rear of the car instead of directly toward the passenger window;  and (5) as Young approached, both officers saw a gun in his waistband.  Careful review of the record from which the district court drew these findings does not leave us with a \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made,\" McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 529, and those findings are not clearly erroneous.  We are satisfied, moreover, that these facts in their totality could give rise to the officers' reasonable suspicion that Young had been involved in criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that Officer Twitchell's action, the lunge at Young, was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances.  In agreeing with the district court we note that sight of the gun gave rise to a significant concern for the officers' and public's safety.  See Walker, 924 F.2d at 4 (officer's concern for own safety is of \"paramount importance\" in assessing the appropriateness of the action taken).  To open the door of the cruiser and question Young would have afforded Young an opportunity to use the gun, and could have placed the officers and any bystanders in harm's way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the officers did not determine whether Young carried the firearm legally prior to attempting to remove it or restrain him.  As we have indicated, however, \" '[c]onduct innocent in the eyes of the untrained may carry entirely different \"messages\" to the experienced or trained observer.' \"  United States v. Stanley, 915 F.2d 54, 56 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting United States v. Bernard, 623 F.2d 551, 560 (9th Cir.1979)).  \"Weighing 'the limited violation of the individual's privacy against the opposing interests in crime prevention and detection and in the police officer's safety,' \" United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1987), we conclude that Officer Twitchell's lunge at Young, and the attendant physical contact, were reasonable in scope and the circumstances justified the intrusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young, however, argues that the physical contact resulting from Officer Twitchell's lunge elevated the encounter to a de facto arrest, which required probable cause.  We have recently rejected the contention that every incidence of physical contact, even de minimis, between a police officer and a citizen, constitutes an arrest requiring probable case.  See Zapata, 18 F.3d at 977 (indicating that police touching of individual does not necessarily elevate a seizure to an arrest).  Parsing whether any given seizure constitutes an arrest or a lesser seizure, however, proves a difficult task.  See id. at 975 (explaining that no scientific formula exists to distinguish between investigative stops and arrests).  Police conduct will rise to the level of an arrest when \" 'a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation,' in the circumstances then obtaining, to be tantamount to being under arrest.\"   See id.  (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3151-52, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factors that can elevate a non-arrest seizure to a de facto arrest requiring probable cause include extending an investigative stop beyond the time necessary to confirm or dispel reasonable suspicion, and physically blocking the suspect's exit such that a reasonable person would not feel free to leave.  See Maguire, 918 F.2d at 259.   The use of guns and the presence of more than one police officer, however, do not necessarily convert an investigative stop into an arrest.  See id.   Above all else, our cases in this area evince the fact specific nature of the inquiry.  See, e.g., Kimball, 25 F.3d at 6 (\"Whether police activity is reasonable in any particular context depends on the facts which are unique to that incident.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By lunging at and brushing his hand against Young, Officer Twitchell did not impose \" 'restraints comparable to those of a formal arrest.' \"  Quinn, 815 F.2d at 156 (quoting Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 441, 104 S.Ct. at 3151).   The officers did not restrain Young's freedom of movement or succeed in detaining him even briefly.  Nor did the officers ever communicate verbally to Young that he was under arrest or that they wanted to arrest him.  Under those circumstances, no reasonable person in Young's position could have understood his situation \"to be tantamount to being under arrest.\"  Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975.   In light of police conduct we have determined to fall short of de facto arrest, we affirm the district court's conclusion that Officer Twitchell's de minimis physical contact with Young did not effect an arrest.  Cf. Zapata, 18 F.3d at 977 (holding that de minimis physical contact did not convert investigative stop into arrest);  Quinn, 815 F.2d at 156-57 (holding that presence of several officers and the blocking of defendant's car did not convert investigative stop into arrest);  United States v. Trullo, 809 F.2d 108, 113 (1st Cir.)  (holding that police officer's use of drawn gun did not convert investigative stop into arrest);  cert. denied, 482 U.S. 916, 107 S.Ct. 3191, 96 L.Ed.2d 679 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of the Turret Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the district court admitted the turret tape, a recording of the radio transmissions between Officer Twitchell and his dispatcher during his pursuit of Young.  The district court initially declined to allow the tape, but warned defense counsel that questioning on cross examination of Officer Twitchell might render the tape admissible as a prior consistent statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  On appeal Young renews his hearsay objection to the tape.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1008 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 909, 133 L.Ed.2d 841 (1996).  Rule 801(d)(1)(B) provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(d) Statements which are not hearsay.

For Rule 801(d)(1)(B) purposes, we view the lower court's determination that a statement rebuts an express or implied charge of recent fabrication as a finding of fact, subject to reversal only if it proves clearly erroneous.  United States v. Piva, 870 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During direct examination of Officer Twitchell the government sought to introduce the turret tape.  The district judge declined to allow the tape at that time, but indicated that cross examination of Officer Twitchell could render the tape admissible as a Rule 801(d)(1)(B) prior consistent statement.  During cross examination, Young's counsel elicited testimony from Officer Twitchell that, prior to his recovery of the firearm, he had never broadcast (a) that he and Officer Fee saw a gun in Young's waistband, and (b) that he had seen Young throw the handgun during the pursuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argued that through those questions defense counsel implied that Officer Twitchell fabricated seeing Young possess the gun, and moved on redirect to play the turret tape as a prior statement consistent with his testimony.  Officer Twitchell testified that he saw Young throw the gun, and on the tape, states the same observation.  The district court found that defense counsel, regardless of her intent, had elicited testimony from which the jury could infer that Officer Twitchell fabricated his testimony, and, accordingly, admitted the tape under Rule 801(d)(1)(B).  We cannot conclude that the lower court abused its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite defense counsel's insistence that she did not intend to imply fabrication, the district judge correctly ruled on the basis of the possible inferences the jury could make as a result of the question.  See Piva, 870 F.2d at 759 (evaluating charge of fabrication on basis of what jury could infer).  Moreover, the district judge did not commit clear error in finding that as a result of cross examination, a jury could have concluded that Officer Twitchell neither saw Young with a gun in his waistband, nor saw Young throw a gun.  Defense counsel's questioning implied fabrication by highlighting that Officer Twitchell never broadcast that he saw a gun in Young's waistband, and that he never broadcast that he saw Young throw the gun until after Officer Twitchell recovered the gun.  In simple terms, a jury could have inferred that if Officer Twitchell did not broadcast it, it did not happen.  His statement on the tape was consistent with his testimony on direct examination that he had seen Young throw the gun, and, therefore, was appropriately admitted as a prior statement consistent with that testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young points out that nothing in the turret tape directly contradicts the testimony elicited during cross examination, that Officer Twitchell did not broadcast that he saw Young throw a gun until after he recovered it.  While we do not dispute the truth of Young's assertion, we do not ascribe similar significance to it.  Nothing in the rule requires the prior consistent statement to contradict any testimony;  the prior consistent statement must merely \"be offered to rebut a charge or implied charge of fabrication.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added).  Having found, without clearly erring, that defense counsel's questioning could permit the jury to infer fabrication, the district judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the turret tape as a Rule 801(d)(1)(B) prior consistent statement, offered to rebut that implied charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge allowed the government to play the entire turret tape, \"in order to set the context, in order to understand the timing of what was going on.\"   Young contends that even if one of Officer Twitchell's statements constitutes a prior consistent statement, the tape contains additional statements of Officer Twitchell and others that do not fall within that category, and, therefore, constitute inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sidebar the district judge invited defense counsel to offer redactions for his consideration prior to playing the tape to the jury.  Defense counsel failed to offer specific, cognizable redactions, failed on the record to object specifically to those portions of the tape she found objectionable, and to explain to the district judge why they did not constitute prior consistent statements.  Accordingly, Young may not now raise this argument on appeal.  See Piva, 870 F.2d at 759 (lack of specific objections at trial precludes party from raising specific issue on appeal).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In any event, having reviewed the contents of the tape, we cannot conclude that the district judge abused his discretion in admitting the entire tape and playing it to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Use of Transcripts of the Turret Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge also allowed the government to provide a transcript to aid the jury in listening to the tape.  By way of background, we digress to explain how the government prepared the transcript.  The government first sent the tape to a transcribing company, which transcribed the tape to the best of its ability, given its unfamiliarity with police jargon, names and codes, and the events that transpired that particular evening.  The government then allowed each participant to review the transcript independent of one another, in order to attempt to fill in those portions the transcribing company could not determine.  The government then sent the revised transcript back to the transcribing company, which then reviewed it while listening to the tape, in order to validate the corrections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government informed the court of this procedure at the hearing on Young's motion to suppress, when it introduced the tape at trial, and before the jury by specifically eliciting Officer Twitchell's testimony that he assisted in the preparation of the final transcript.  The district judge offered defense counsel the opportunity to replay the tape with an alternative transcript, and allowed significant time and latitude on cross examination of Officer Twitchell about the government's transcript and his role in its preparation.  Defense counsel, however, failed to utilize any alternative transcript, or even the original draft of the transcript, to point out potential inaccuracies or inconsistencies, or simply to offer the jury an alternative view of the contents of the tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit we have long approved the use of properly authenticated transcripts of tape recordings for the purpose of helping the jury listen to and understand the recordings themselves.  See United States v. Campbell, 874 F.2d 838, 849 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Rengifo, 789 F.2d 975, 980 (1st Cir.1986) (citing cases).  The district judge may even allow the jury to have the transcripts during deliberations provided \"the court makes clear that the tapes, not the transcript constitute evidence in the case.\"  Rengifo, 789 F.2d at 980 (quoting United States v. Richman, 600 F.2d 286, 295 (1st Cir.1979)).  Prior to trial, the district judge should attempt to obtain a single stipulated transcript;  failing that, however, the court should allow each party to introduce its own transcript of the recording upon proper authentication.  See id. at 983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, when \"a defendant has possession of the transcript and tape prior to trial and raises no pretrial objection, the district court is not obliged to interrupt the trial to screen the transcript for accuracy prior to its use by the jury.\"  United States v. Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d 42, 48 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1065, 112 S.Ct. 954, 117 L.Ed.2d 122 (1992).  Instead, the district court may simply listen to the tape as it is played for the jury, follow the transcript, and rule on specific objections as they arise.  See id.   Should a defendant fail to offer specific objections during playback of the tape, or offer an alternative transcript, the district court does not abuse its discretion by allowing the jury to use the transcript.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion in the use of the government's transcript in this case.  At the outset we note that Young does not dispute proper authentication.  Upon determining that the jury could hear the tape with the aid of the disputed transcript, the district judge gave the requisite instruction that the tape and not the transcripts constituted the evidence the jury should consider.  The judge specifically instructed the jury to disregard anything in the transcript that they could not understand from the tape.  See Campbell, 874 F.2d at 849 (once judge instructs jury that tape and not transcript is evidence, we review for abuse of discretion).  The judge also instructed the jury that he would allow defense counsel to play the tape again with a different transcript, \"to see if you hear something different from what you might have thought you heard when it was played with the other transcript before you.\"   The judge reiterated this instruction as part of his final instructions while charging the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the events at trial, the record reflects that defense counsel possessed copies of the government's transcripts before trial, but raised no pretrial objections specific to either of them.  While defense counsel objected to the revised transcript at trial on the basis of alleged inaccuracies, she neither made specific objections during playback of the tape, nor chose to offer an alternative transcript, even though the district judge clearly indicated he would permit her to do so.  On that basis we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the jury to use the government's transcript.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 48 (holding that district court does not abuse discretion by allowing transcript in absence of specific objections or alternative transcript).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Young argues that the tape and transcript had a prejudicial effect that far outweighed their probative value under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Young failed to raise this objection at trial;  we review the district court's decision, therefore, only for plain error.  See Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 516 (1st Cir.1996).  We will disturb a district court's Rule 403 rulings, moreover, only in \" 'extraordinarily compelling circumstances.' \"  United States v. Kayne, 90 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 681, 136 L.Ed.2d 607 (1997) (quoting United States v.

We will review, therefore, only for plain error, and conclude that the district court admitted the tape on a sufficient foundation.  United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir.1996).  Prior to playing the tape, the government elicited Officer Twitchell's testimony that he recognized the tape as a recording of the broadcast, he had listened to the tape, he recognized all of the voices on it, and that to the best of his knowledge, the tape fairly and accurately reflected the radio transmissions that occurred that evening.  In the absence of any foundation-based objection by defense counsel, we cannot conclude that the district judge committed plain error.  With respect to Young's alternative arguments, we conclude that the tape was properly admitted as a prior consistent statement, and, therefore, we decline to consider them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In Piva, the district judge admitted a prior statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) over counsel's general hearsay objection.  870 F.2d at 759.   Rather than point to a specific reason why Rule 801(d)(1)(B) did not apply, counsel merely made a hearsay objection and also argued improper rehabilitation.  See id.

We are not unmindful, however, of the Supreme Court's recent admonition that to be admissible, a prior consistent statement must have been made before the alleged motive to fabricate arose.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 700.   In light of the nearly contemporaneous recovery of the gun and Officer Twitchell's broadcast, we are satisfied that this case does not present us with a Tome issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Young also asserts that by reviewing the transcript and helping to fill in some of the portions the transcribing company found unintelligible, Officer Twitchell had the opportunity to create his own prior consistent statements after a motive to fabricate arose.

See U.S. Const. amend.  VI, cl. 3.  Young argues that the transcript contains statements by the dispatcher, who did not appear at trial as a witness.  The Confrontation Clause exists to \"advance a practical concern for the accuracy of 'the truth-determining process ... by assuring that the trier of fact [has] a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.' \"  United States v.

On that basis, we have held that when an out-of-court statement \"falls within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay principle,\" its admission does not violate the Confrontation Clause.

During trial, and after denying Young's motion to suppress, the district court admitted the firearm and ammunition into evidence.  The district court also admitted a so-called \"turret tape,\" a recording of radio transmissions between a police officer and his dispatcher, made during the officer's foot pursuit of Young.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Finally, the district court allowed the jury to use a government-prepared transcript as an aid in listening to the tape while it was being played during trial.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1994, Officers James Fee and Robert Twitchell of the Boston Police Department, while patrolling the Roxbury section of Boston, received a radio broadcast describing three individuals suspected of armed robbery.  Several blocks from the last reported location of the suspects, the officers noticed a group of three men standing together.  Upon seeing the unmarked cruiser, the group dispersed.  One of the three, Young, walked in one direction by himself while the other two departed together in another direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers, noting that Young's short height and black clothing appeared to match the description of one of the robbery suspects, pulled their cruiser to the curb alongside Young.  From the passenger seat, Officer Twitchell rolled down his window and announced \"Boston Police, you got a minute?\" to which Young responded \"Sure.\"  Young then \"angled\" toward the rear of the cruiser.  As Young approached the car, the officers noticed the handle of a handgun protruding from his waistband.  Officer Twitchell lunged at Young through the window of the cruiser, made fleeting contact with his jacket or belt, but failed to either grab the gun or detain him.  Young turned and ran from the cruiser, with Twitchell, now on foot, in pursuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pursuit, Officer Twitchell saw Young remove the gun from his waistband and throw it into the basement stairwell of a building on Elm Street.  Although Young successfully eluded Twitchell, he was ultimately apprehended by a back-up police officer who found him hiding in a nearby garage.  Officer Twitchell then returned to the stairwell and recovered the gun.  While these events were unfolding, Officer Twitchell and other officers continuously transmitted information to the dispatcher at the Boston Police headquarters.  These transmissions comprise the turret tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Young moved to suppress the gun and the turret tape.  Young asserted that the police recovered the gun through a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, and argued that the tape constituted inadmissible hearsay.  The district court denied Young's motion to suppress the gun, but granted his motion with respect to the turret tape, with the caveat that defense counsel's cross examination might subsequently render it admissible.  During trial and after defense counsel's cross examination of Officer Twitchell, the district court admitted the turret tape as a prior consistent statement, and allowed the jury to use a transcript prepared by the government, as an aid in listening to the turret tape.  Young appeals admission of the gun and tape, as well as use of the transcript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Suppression of the Gun</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We employ a dual standard in reviewing motions to suppress.  We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error.  See United States v.

McCarthy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196595\"><a href=\"/opinion/196595/united-states-v-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 529 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></span> (1996).  Deference to the district court's findings of fact reflects our awareness that the trial judge, who hears the testimony, observes the witnesses' demeanor and evaluates the facts first hand, sits in the best position to determine what actually happened.  See United States v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195255\"><a href=\"/opinion/195255/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir.1994).  By contrast, we review conclusions of law de novo and subject the trial court's constitutional conclusions to plenary review.  See id.;   see also Ornelas v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span> (1996).  Determinations of probable cause and reasonable suspicion, relevant to the constitutionality of law enforcement seizures and arrests under the Fourth Amendment, present mixed questions of law and fact which we review de novo.  See Ornelas, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1663.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young argues that the district court erred by concluding that recovery of the firearm did not occur through conduct that violated his Fourth Amendment rights.  Specifically, Young contends that Officers Twitchell and Fee lacked either the reasonable suspicion needed to stop him, or the probable cause required for an arrest.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interaction between law enforcement officials and citizens generally falls within three tiers of Fourth Amendment analysis, depending on the level of police intrusion into a person's privacy.  The first or lowest tier encompasses interaction of such minimally intrusive nature that it does not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that not all personal intercourse between the police and citizens rises to the level of a stop or seizure.  See Florida v. Bostick, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112631\"><a href=\"/opinion/112631/florida-v-bostick/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span>, 434, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112631\"><a href=\"/opinion/112631/florida-v-bostick/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span> (1991) (citing cases).  Police may approach citizens in public spaces and ask them questions without triggering the protections of the Fourth Amendment.  See id.;  United States v. Manchester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421133\"><a href=\"/opinion/421133/united-states-v-isaac-f-manchester-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 460 (1st Cir.1983).  Such police engagements need not find a basis in any articulable suspicion.  See Bostick, 501 U.S. at 435, 111 S.Ct. at 2386-87.   Police conduct falls short of triggering Fourth Amendment protections when, from the totality of the circumstances, we determine that the subject of any police interaction would have felt free to terminate the conversation and proceed along his way.  See Bostick, 501 U.S. at 439, 111 S.Ct. at 2388-89; United States v. Sealey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195505\"><a href=\"/opinion/195505/united-states-v-sealey/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The totality of the circumstances in this case establishes that any interaction between the officers and Young prior to Officer Twitchell's lunge falls well within the first tier of police-citizen interaction, and therefore, fails to trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.  As they pulled alongside Young, the officers identified themselves as Boston Police officers, and asked \"got a minute\" to which Young replied \"sure.\"   The district court credited the officers' testimony, and we detect no clear error.  We recently determined that conduct virtually identical to what occurred in this case did not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment, and concluded that in the absence of an officer's exertion of physical force or an individual's submission to a show of authority, no seizure occurs.  See Sealey, 30 F.3d at 10 (finding no Fourth Amendment seizure where police officers in a cruiser approached defendant and yelled \"Hey Steven, what's up?\")  (citing California v. Hodari D., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span> (1991)).  We reiterate that conclusion with respect to the officers' conduct toward Young prior to Officer Twitchell's lunge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining two tiers of Fourth Amendment analysis comprise de facto arrests requiring probable cause, and lesser seizures generally known as investigative or Terry stops, which require a lesser reasonable suspicion.  An arrest occurs when an officer, acting on probable cause that an individual has committed a crime, detains that individual as a suspect.  Probable cause exists when police officers, relying on reasonably trustworthy facts and circumstances, have information upon which a reasonably prudent person would believe the suspect had committed or was committing a crime.  See United States v. Maguire, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551274\"><a href=\"/opinion/551274/united-states-v-john-j-maguire-united-states-v-thomas-m-kavanagh/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, Kavanagh v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span> (1968), occurs when a police officer, acting on reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity, briefly detains an individual to confirm or dispel his suspicion.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 529;  United States v. Schiavo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195480\"><a href=\"/opinion/195480/united-states-v-schiavo/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government concedes, for purposes of this appeal, that when Officer Twitchell made contact with Young, he seized him for Fourth Amendment purposes.  See, e.g., Zapata, 18 F.3d at 977 (indicating that officer's touching of citizen during ongoing investigative stop establishes that seizure occurred).  In the absence of further argument on this point, we proceed under the assumption that a seizure occurred in this case.  Young contends that the officers either seized him without the requisite reasonable suspicion, or arrested him without the requisite probable cause.  We conclude that to the extent the officers, through fleeting physical contact, seized Young, they did so well within the parameters of an investigative stop, and that the officers' actions do not rise to the level of an arrest requiring probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to investigative stops, the relevant question \"is not whether the police had probable cause to act, but instead whether the actions taken were reasonable under the circumstances.\"  McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 529.   A familiar two-pronged test guides this inquiry.  We first must determine whether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and, if so, whether the action taken was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference.  See id. at 530;  United States v. Kimball, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195379\"><a href=\"/opinion/195379/united-states-v-kimball/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1994).  To satisfy the first prong, \" 'the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.' \"  Kimball, 25 F.3d at 6 (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879-80).   To satisfy the second prong, we examine the totality of the circumstances, see United States v. Walker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554968\"><a href=\"/opinion/554968/united-states-v-stephen-joseph-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1991), bearing in mind that \"an officer may [ ] conduct a patdown search where the officer is justified in believing that the person is armed and dangerous to the officer or others,\" Schiavo, 29 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the district court, the following facts gave rise to reasonable suspicion necessary to temporarily detain Young:  (1) the officers saw three individuals, one or more of whom appeared to match the description of three armed robbers who had been spotted in the area;  (2) as they approached, one of the three (Young) walked away from the group;  (3) Officer Fee told Officer Twitchell that he thought he recognized the person walking away (Young) as a \"bad guy;\" (4) upon asking Young to answer some questions, Young angled toward the rear of the car instead of directly toward the passenger window;  and (5) as Young approached, both officers saw a gun in his waistband.  Careful review of the record from which the district court drew these findings does not leave us with a \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made,\" McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 529, and those findings are not clearly erroneous.  We are satisfied, moreover, that these facts in their totality could give rise to the officers' reasonable suspicion that Young had been involved in criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that Officer Twitchell's action, the lunge at Young, was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances.  In agreeing with the district court we note that sight of the gun gave rise to a significant concern for the officers' and public's safety.  See Walker, 924 F.2d at 4 (officer's concern for own safety is of \"paramount importance\" in assessing the appropriateness of the action taken).  To open the door of the cruiser and question Young would have afforded Young an opportunity to use the gun, and could have placed the officers and any bystanders in harm's way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the officers did not determine whether Young carried the firearm legally prior to attempting to remove it or restrain him.

For Rule 801(d)(1)(B) purposes, we view the lower court's determination that a statement rebuts an express or implied charge of recent fabrication as a finding of fact, subject to reversal only if it proves clearly erroneous.  United States v. Piva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520291\"><a href=\"/opinion/520291/united-states-v-joseph-piva/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>, 758 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During direct examination of Officer Twitchell the government sought to introduce the turret tape.  The district judge declined to allow the tape at that time, but indicated that cross examination of Officer Twitchell could render the tape admissible as a Rule 801(d)(1)(B) prior consistent statement.  During cross examination, Young's counsel elicited testimony from Officer Twitchell that, prior to his recovery of the firearm, he had never broadcast (a) that he and Officer Fee saw a gun in Young's waistband, and (b) that he had seen Young throw the handgun during the pursuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argued that through those questions defense counsel implied that Officer Twitchell fabricated seeing Young possess the gun, and moved on redirect to play the turret tape as a prior statement consistent with his testimony.  Officer Twitchell testified that he saw Young throw the gun, and on the tape, states the same observation.  The district court found that defense counsel, regardless of her intent, had elicited testimony from which the jury could infer that Officer Twitchell fabricated his testimony, and, accordingly, admitted the tape under Rule 801(d)(1)(B).  We cannot conclude that the lower court abused its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite defense counsel's insistence that she did not intend to imply fabrication, the district judge correctly ruled on the basis of the possible inferences the jury could make as a result of the question.  See Piva, 870 F.2d at 759 (evaluating charge of fabrication on basis of what jury could infer).  Moreover, the district judge did not commit clear error in finding that as a result of cross examination, a jury could have concluded that Officer Twitchell neither saw Young with a gun in his waistband, nor saw Young throw a gun.  Defense counsel's questioning implied fabrication by highlighting that Officer Twitchell never broadcast that he saw a gun in Young's waistband, and that he never broadcast that he saw Young throw the gun until after Officer Twitchell recovered the gun.  In simple terms, a jury could have inferred that if Officer Twitchell did not broadcast it, it did not happen.  His statement on the tape was consistent with his testimony on direct examination that he had seen Young throw the gun, and, therefore, was appropriately admitted as a prior statement consistent with that testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young points out that nothing in the turret tape directly contradicts the testimony elicited during cross examination, that Officer Twitchell did not broadcast that he saw Young throw a gun until after he recovered it.  While we do not dispute the truth of Young's assertion, we do not ascribe similar significance to it.  Nothing in the rule requires the prior consistent statement to contradict any testimony;  the prior consistent statement must merely \"be offered to rebut a charge or implied charge of fabrication.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added).  Having found, without clearly erring, that defense counsel's questioning could permit the jury to infer fabrication, the district judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the turret tape as a Rule 801(d)(1)(B) prior consistent statement, offered to rebut that implied charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge allowed the government to play the entire turret tape, \"in order to set the context, in order to understand the timing of what was going on.\"   Young contends that even if one of Officer Twitchell's statements constitutes a prior consistent statement, the tape contains additional statements of Officer Twitchell and others that do not fall within that category, and, therefore, constitute inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sidebar the district judge invited defense counsel to offer redactions for his consideration prior to playing the tape to the jury.  Defense counsel failed to offer specific, cognizable redactions, failed on the record to object specifically to those portions of the tape she found objectionable, and to explain to the district judge why they did not constitute prior consistent statements.  Accordingly, Young may not now raise this argument on appeal.  See Piva, 870 F.2d at 759 (lack of specific objections at trial precludes party from raising specific issue on appeal).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In any event, having reviewed the contents of the tape, we cannot conclude that the district judge abused his discretion in admitting the entire tape and playing it to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Use of Transcripts of the Turret Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge also allowed the government to provide a transcript to aid the jury in listening to the tape.  By way of background, we digress to explain how the government prepared the transcript.  The government first sent the tape to a transcribing company, which transcribed the tape to the best of its ability, given its unfamiliarity with police jargon, names and codes, and the events that transpired that particular evening.  The government then allowed each participant to review the transcript independent of one another, in order to attempt to fill in those portions the transcribing company could not determine.  The government then sent the revised transcript back to the transcribing company, which then reviewed it while listening to the tape, in order to validate the corrections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government informed the court of this procedure at the hearing on Young's motion to suppress, when it introduced the tape at trial, and before the jury by specifically eliciting Officer Twitchell's testimony that he assisted in the preparation of the final transcript.  The district judge offered defense counsel the opportunity to replay the tape with an alternative transcript, and allowed significant time and latitude on cross examination of Officer Twitchell about the government's transcript and his role in its preparation.  Defense counsel, however, failed to utilize any alternative transcript, or even the original draft of the transcript, to point out potential inaccuracies or inconsistencies, or simply to offer the jury an alternative view of the contents of the tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit we have long approved the use of properly authenticated transcripts of tape recordings for the purpose of helping the jury listen to and understand the recordings themselves.

Instead, the district court may simply listen to the tape as it is played for the jury, follow the transcript, and rule on specific objections as they arise.  See id.   Should a defendant fail to offer specific objections during playback of the tape, or offer an alternative transcript, the district court does not abuse its discretion by allowing the jury to use the transcript.

At the outset we note that Young does not dispute proper authentication.  Upon determining that the jury could hear the tape with the aid of the disputed transcript, the district judge gave the requisite instruction that the tape and not the transcripts constituted the evidence the jury should consider.  The judge specifically instructed the jury to disregard anything in the transcript that they could not understand from the tape.  See Campbell, 874 F.2d at 849 (once judge instructs jury that tape and not transcript is evidence, we review for abuse of discretion).  The judge also instructed the jury that he would allow defense counsel to play the tape again with a different transcript, \"to see if you hear something different from what you might have thought you heard when it was played with the other transcript before you.\"   The judge reiterated this instruction as part of his final instructions while charging the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the events at trial, the record reflects that defense counsel possessed copies of the government's transcripts before trial, but raised no pretrial objections specific to either of them.  While defense counsel objected to the revised transcript at trial on the basis of alleged inaccuracies, she neither made specific objections during playback of the tape, nor chose to offer an alternative transcript, even though the district judge clearly indicated he would permit her to do so.  On that basis we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the jury to use the government's transcript.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 48 (holding that district court does not abuse discretion by allowing transcript in absence of specific objections or alternative transcript).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Young argues that the tape and transcript had a prejudicial effect that far outweighed their probative value under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Young failed to raise this objection at trial;  we review the district court's decision, therefore, only for plain error.  See Jacques v.

Prior to playing the tape, the government elicited Officer Twitchell's testimony that he recognized the tape as a recording of the broadcast, he had listened to the tape, he recognized all of the voices on it, and that to the best of his knowledge, the tape fairly and accurately reflected the radio transmissions that occurred that evening.  In the absence of any foundation-based objection by defense counsel, we cannot conclude that the district judge committed plain error.  With respect to Young's alternative arguments, we conclude that the tape was properly admitted as a prior consistent statement, and, therefore, we decline to consider them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In Piva, the district judge admitted a prior statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) over counsel's general hearsay objection.  870 F.2d at 759.

As indicated, defense counsel had ample opportunity to present an alternative transcript, or to impeach the transcript through cross examination of Officer Twitchell</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Young also challenges the admissibility of the tape and use of the transcript on the basis of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  See U.S. Const. amend.  VI, cl. 3.  Young argues that the transcript contains statements by the dispatcher, who did not appear at trial as a witness.  The Confrontation Clause exists to \"advance a practical concern for the accuracy of 'the truth-determining process ... by assuring that the trier of fact [has] a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.' \"  United States v. Panzardi-Lespier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551283\"><a href=\"/opinion/551283/united-states-v-santiago-panzardi-lespier-aka-chago/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 319 (1st Cir.1990).  On that basis, we have held that when an out-of-court statement \"falls within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay principle,\" its admission does not violate the Confrontation Clause.  See id.   Having determined that the turret tape constitutes a prior consistent statement, and not hearsay, we are satisfied that its admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
