HECTOR ORTIZ-PEREZ, ET AL.,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n  [Hon. Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n                 Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n        Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nKevin G. Little on brief for appellant.\r\nAlfonso Miranda Cardenas, Pedro J. Cordova, Jose A. Miranda\r\nDaleccio, Jose E. O'Neill Font and Carlos A. Ortiz Morales on brief\r\nfor appellees.\r\n\nJuly 19, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff-appellant Diana Ortiz\r\nAnglada claims that the district court abused its discretion when\r\nit sua sponte and without notice dismissed her medical malpractice\r\naction for lack of prosecution.  We agree that the circumstances do\r\nnot warrant such a harsh sanction, and therefore reverse.\r\nOrtiz filed this lawsuit on July 18, 1996, against Dr. Hector\r\nOrtiz-Perez and the clinic for which he worked.  The case docket\r\nreveals that proceedings occurred regularly through April 1, 1997. \r\nAlthough the next docket entry is the dismissal order of August 4,\r\n1998, it appears undisputed that activity involving both parties\r\ncontinued at a normal pace through September 1997, when the\r\ntranscript of plaintiff's deposition was prepared and circulated. \r\nIn addition, the record shows that in January 1998 plaintiff was\r\nevaluated by a psychologist in connection with the litigation. \r\nThus, when the district court dismissed the suit, the docket\r\nshowed no activity for approximately 16 months, although the case\r\nhad been dormant for no more than about seven months.  Plaintiff\r\nwas given no warning that the court was considering dismissal, and,\r\nindeed, there had been neither a conference with the judge nor a\r\nscheduling order setting deadlines to move the case along.  See\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 16(b) (\"[T]he district judge . . . shall . . .\r\nenter a scheduling order that limits the time . . . (2) to file\r\nmotions; and (3) to complete discovery.\") The court's dismissal\r\norder stated:\r\n          It appears from the docket of this case that no\r\naction has been taken since March 19, 1997.  In view\r\nthereof, it is hereby ORDERED that this case be\r\nDISMISSED, for lack of prosecution.\r\n\nSeven days after entry of that order, Ortiz filed a request\r\nfor reconsideration that listed the discovery activity that had not\r\nbeen reflected on the docket.  The court was unimpressed.  It noted\r\nplaintiff's responsibility for developing and prosecuting her case\r\nand its own responsibility \"'to achieve the orderly and expeditious\r\ndisposition of cases,'\" and concluded that \"plaintiff's\r\nprotraction in the instant case is evident and unwarranted.\" The\r\ncourt thus denied the motion, and this appeal followed.\r\nAlthough our case law gives the district court broad\r\ndiscretion to dismiss a case to further its case management\r\nresponsibilities, disposition on the merits is favored and we\r\nrepeatedly have held that a case should not be dismissed with\r\nprejudice except \"when a plaintiff's misconduct is particularly\r\negregious or extreme,\" Benjamin v. Aroostook Medical Center, Inc.,\r\n57 F.3d 101, 107 (lst Cir. 1995).  We have observed more than once\r\nthat \r\n               [i]n all the cases in which we have upheld a\r\n     dismissal for want of prosecution, we have\r\n     found either extremely protracted inaction\r\n     (measured in years), disobedience of court\r\n     orders, ignorance of warnings, contumacious\r\n     conduct, or some other aggravating\r\n     circumstance.\r\n\nCosme Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (lst Cir. 1987) (citing\r\ncases); see also Benjamin, 57 F.3d at 108; Estate of Solis-Rivera\r\nv. United States, 993 F.2d 1, 2 (lst Cir. 1993).\r\nNothing of the sort occurred here.  Although the case may have\r\nbeen progressing more slowly than ideal, and the long gap following\r\nthe last docketed action understandably troubled the court, it must\r\nbear some responsibility for having failed to impose deadlines\r\nthrough a scheduling order.  Plaintiff had no reason to suspect her\r\ncase was at risk, and plaintiff responded promptly to the\r\nunexpected dismissal with a motion to reconsider it.  See Robson v.\r\nHallenbeck, 81 F.3d 1, 4 (lst Cir. 1996) (\"[A]bsence of warning\r\nthat the court was considering dismissal . . . may be a pertinent\r\nfactor in evaluating a dismissal, especially if the conduct in\r\nquestion did not violate a clear preexisting requirement.\"); Cosme\r\nNieves, 826 F.2d at 2 (\"[Plaintiffs] responded immediately to the\r\nonly warning they received   the sua sponte dismissal   with a\r\nmotion to the court.\")\r\nThis court, and federal courts generally, have warned that the\r\ndrastic sanction of dismissal for want of prosecution \"should be\r\nemployed only when the district court, in the careful exercise of\r\nits discretion, determines that none of the lesser sanctions\r\navailable to it would truly be appropriate.\"  Zavala Santiago v.\r\nGonzalez Rivera, 553 F.2d 710, 712 (lst Cir. 1977); see also Enlace\r\nMercantil Internacional v. Senior Industries, 848 F.2d 315, 317\r\n(lst Cir. 1988).  This is a classic case for a lesser sanction.\r\nThere has been no showing of particular prejudice to the defendants\r\nor the court and no deliberate disregard of deadlines.  See Robson,\r\n81 F.3d at 2-3.   Indeed, in the absence of a scheduling order, any\r\naction in these circumstances more severe than a warning that\r\nplaintiff should activate and expedite her case seems excessive.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the dismissal of plaintiff's case and\r\nremand for further proceedings.  The district court retains the\r\ndiscretion, of course, to dismiss the case if appropriate\r\ncircumstances arise.\r\nReversed and remanded.\r\n",
