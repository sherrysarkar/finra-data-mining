The\r\n\nproceedings  as  a  whole suggest  that  defendant reasonably\r\n\nshould have  understood, and  did understand,  the sentencing\r\n\nimplications of his plea.  See United States v.

That\r\n\nenhancement  had  no bearing  on  the  armed career  criminal\r\n\nsentence   ultimately   imposed   here   under   U.S.S.G.    \r\n\n4B1.4(b)(3).  See United States v.
