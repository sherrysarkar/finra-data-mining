The  district court did not  abuse its\r                                \r\n\ndiscretion   in  dismissing  debtor's   appeal  for  lack  of\r\n\nprosecution when  debtor failed to  file a brief  within Rule\r\n\n8009's 15-day limit.   The July 25, 1996 notice  of docketing\r\n\nand briefing  deadline, which  clearly referenced Rule  8009,\r\n\nwas  not confusing  and  should not  have  misled debtor  had\r\n\ndebtor read Rule  8009.  Debtor's other arguments are outside\r\n\nthe scope of the  present appeal from the August 14, 1996 and\r\n\nSeptember 19, 1996 orders dismissing for lack of prosecution,\r\n\nbut are, in any event, meritless.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
