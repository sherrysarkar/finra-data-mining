Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n          Before\r\n\n  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nCampbell, Senior Circuit Judge, \r\n\nand Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nCharles S. Hey-Maestre with whom Adalina De Jesus-Morales was\r\non brief for appellants.\r\nFrancisco San Miguel Fuxench, with whom Miguel Pagan was on\r\nbrief for appellee, Municipality of Comerio.\r\nSigfredo Rodriguez-Isaac, Assistant Solicitor General, with\r\nwhom Carlos Lugo Fiol, Solicitor General, Edda Serrano Blasini,\r\nDeputy Solicitor General, were on brief for individual appellees.\r\n\nMarch 31, 1998\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Plaintiffs-appellants\r\nBerta Baez-Cruz and twenty-three of her former co-workers brought\r\nthis action in the district court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against\r\nthe municipality of Comerio, Puerto Rico, and four of its\r\nofficials.  Plaintiff-appellants alleged that their dismissal from\r\nmunicipal employment was based on their political affiliation in\r\nviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the laws of\r\nPuerto Rico.  Previously, Plaintiffs had sought reinstatement by\r\nthe Puerto Rico administrative body that handles government\r\nemployment disputes.  That body denied relief to Plaintiffs in a\r\ndecision that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ultimately affirmed.\r\nFollowing the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's affirmance, the\r\ndistrict court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment.  It\r\nreasoned that Plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from arguing\r\nthat their dismissal was politically based by a contrary finding in\r\nthe Commonwealth proceedings.  Plaintiffs have appealed.  The\r\nquestion we face is whether, under Puerto Rico law, the\r\nadministrative body's findings preclude relitigation of Plaintiffs'\r\ntermination.  We affirm.\r\n          FACTS\r\n1.  Tension Between Comerio Municipal Employees and the New\r\nComerio Administration\r\n\nIn 1992, the citizens of Comerio elected Defendant Luis\r\nRivera Rivera (\"Rivera\"), a member of the New Progressive Party\r\n(the \"NPP\"), as their Mayor.  That election ended a half-century of\r\nrule in Comerio by the Popular Democratic Party (the \"PDP\").  Other\r\nmembers of the NPP administration included Defendant Domingo\r\nMarcano, Internal Auditor; Defendant Rufino Ayalo, Director of\r\nPublic Works; and Defendant Damian Rivera, Director of Civil\r\nDefense.  Plaintiffs, all members of the rival PDP, were career\r\nmunicipal employees.  \r\nThe months following Rivera's assumption of the mayoral\r\npost were marked by tension between the municipality and its\r\nemployees.  In their complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that they\r\nperceived the new administration to be discriminating against PDP\r\nholdovers by subjecting them to sudden transfers, threats, and\r\nrevocation of privileges.  Plaintiffs and other employees protested\r\nthis perceived mistreatment by declaring a one-day work stoppage. \r\nThe Municipality admonished the protesters and withheld their pay\r\nfor the strike day.  \r\nAfter Mayor Rivera refused to negotiate, Plaintiffs and\r\nthose in agreement declared another strike, which directly led to\r\ntheir dismissal.  The dismissed employees announced a four-day work\r\nstoppage, with a protest on the first day in front of City Hall. \r\nMayor Rivera responded by activating, through Defendant Damian\r\nRivera, the municipality's civil defense to provide Comerio with\r\nessential services.  Plaintiffs and their fellows saw the civil\r\ndefense forces as strikebreakers.  The City Hall protest led to\r\nphysical and verbal confrontations between the civil defense force\r\nand the strikers.\r\nFollowing the work stoppage, the municipality\r\ninvestigated the strike, which, the parties agree, violated Puerto\r\nRico law forbidding municipal employees to strike.  The\r\nmunicipality's auditor, Defendant Domingo Marcano, reviewed the\r\nmunicipality personnel department's attendance records to determine\r\nwho participated in the strike.  The Municipality then informed\r\nforty-eight employees of their dismissal.  \r\n2.  The Administrative Proceedings\r\nThe forty-eight terminated employees immediately\r\nrequested a hearing before the Puerto Rico Personnel Administration\r\nSystems Appeal Board (known by its Spanish acronym, \"JASAP\"), the\r\nadministrative body that handles government employment disputes. \r\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3,  1394(1).  JASAP's examining officer\r\nrecommended that only those employees who could be identified as\r\nhaving participated in the strike be terminated.  The investigation\r\npositively identified only the twenty-four Plaintiffs in this\r\naction.  The municipality quickly reinstated the other twenty-four\r\nemployees, but refused to reinstate the twenty-four Plaintiffs. \r\nPlaintiffs contested the examiner's recommendations\r\nbefore the JASAP.  JASAP upheld the examiner, adopting her findings\r\nof fact and conclusions of law.  As a \"Conclusion of Law,\" the\r\nexamining officer's report stated that,\r\n      The appellant party [the strikers-\r\nPlaintiffs] brought to our consideration that\r\nthe dismissal was due to reasons of political\r\nideology.  It arises from evidence that all\r\nthe employees who participated in the strike\r\nbelonged to the [PDP]. (Findings of Fact No.\r\n23)  Nevertheless, once the administrative\r\nhearings were held not all the forty-eight\r\n(48) employees who participated in [the]\r\nstrike were dismissed, but twenty-four (24)\r\nemployees.  There were twenty-four \"Populares\"\r\n[i.e., members of the PDP] who were reinstated\r\nafter the administrative hearing with the\r\ndiscount of the day.\r\n\n3.  The  1983 Action\r\nOn the same day that JASAP denied Plaintiffs' motion for\r\nreconsideration, Plaintiffs brought the instant action under 42\r\nU.S.C.  1983 in the United States District Court for the District\r\nof Puerto Rico.  The complaint alleged that the terminations and\r\nprior disciplinary measures violated Plaintiffs' rights conferred\r\nby the Federal Constitution to free expression and association,\r\nequal protection of the law, and procedural due process.  Also\r\nincluded within the federal complaint were claims under the law of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Defendants filed their answer,\r\nand, based on the JASAP Report's findings, they moved for summary\r\njudgment.  \r\nThe district court stayed the proceedings, including\r\ndiscovery, while Plaintiffs appealed from the JASAP decision to the\r\nPuerto Rico courts.  Plaintiffs' appeal was rebuffed at every turn. \r\nThe Superior Court, the Circuit Court, and, ultimately, by a 3-2\r\ndecision, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico each affirmed JASAP's\r\ndecision.  \r\nSoon after the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico rendered its\r\ndecision, the district court granted Defendants' motion for summary\r\njudgment.  The district court held that JASAP's determination \"that\r\n[in the court's words] the sole reason for plaintiffs' dismissal\r\nwas their participation in an illegal strike,\" collaterally\r\nestopped Plaintiffs' political discrimination claim.  The district\r\ncourt also held that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a genuine\r\nissue of material fact in their procedural due process claim, and\r\nthen dismissed without prejudice the remaining claims under Puerto\r\nRico law.  \r\nPlaintiffs filed a Rule 59(e) motion to vacate and/or to\r\namend the judgment, arguing that Puerto Rico's rules of collateral\r\nestoppel did not preclude relitigation of a factual issue unless\r\nthe parties in the second suit were identical to the first.  The\r\nindividual officials, defendants here, were not parties to the\r\nJASAP proceeding.  Thus, Plaintiffs argued, the JASAP decision\r\ncould not collaterally estop a claim involving these new parties. \r\nThe district court rejected this contention, and this appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n        DISCUSSION\r\n1.  Background\r\nTo survive summary judgment in a case alleging\r\nunconstitutional political discrimination in public employment, an\r\nemployee must produce evidence that her political affiliation was\r\na \"substantial\" or \"motivating\" factor behind the challenged\r\nemployment decision.  Mount Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429\r\nU.S. 274, 287 (1977); see also  Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado,\r\n982 F.2d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 1993).  Even if such a link is shown\r\nbetween political affiliation and the adverse employment action,\r\nthe employee's claim will still fail if the employment decision\r\nwould have occurred regardless of plaintiff's political\r\naffiliation.  See Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.\r\n1993).  \r\nHere, the district court accurately described the JASAP\r\nproceedings as establishing \"that the sole reason for Plaintiffs'\r\ndismissal was their participation in an illegal strike.\"  The JASAP\r\nexaminer expressly rejected Plaintiffs' contention that \"the\r\ndismissal was due to reasons of political ideology,\" reasoning that\r\nthe municipality reinstated twenty-four of the forty-eight\r\noriginally dismissed workers (all of whom shared the same party\r\naffiliation) after the hearing examiner had found no proof of their\r\nparticipation in the strike.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court noted\r\nthis finding in affirming the JASAP decision and concluded that\r\n\"JASAP did not err when it decided that the action of dismissal of\r\npetitioners herein was within the legal frame of action permissible\r\nof the municipality.\"  It would not have been permissible for JASAP\r\nto have determined that Plaintiffs' termination was lawful under\r\nthe \"merit principle\" of Puerto Rico's Personnel Law, P.R. Laws\r\nAnn. tit. 3,  1331, if it had found the termination was based on\r\nPlaintiffs' political affiliation.  See Diaz de Llovet v. Governor,\r\n112 P.R. Offic. Trans. 941, 953-54 (1982) (discussing Branti v.\r\nFinkel, 455 U.S. 507 (1980)).  A finding for Plaintiffs in the\r\npresent action would, therefore, necessarily contradict JASAP's\r\nprior determination that the dismissals were not based on \"reasons\r\nof political ideology\" but rather on the strike, as affirmed by the\r\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court. \r\nThe Full Faith and Credit statute, 28 U.S.C.  1738,\r\nprovides that \"judicial proceedings . . . shall have the same full\r\nfaith and credit in every court within the United States and its\r\nTerritories . . . as they have by law or usage in the courts of\r\nsuch State [or] Territory . . . from which they are taken.\"  It is\r\nwell-settled that a proceeding in a state court collaterally estops\r\ninconsistent arguments in a later federal action, including actions\r\nunder  1983.  Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 104-05 (1980). \r\nPreclusive effect is given not only to state judicial proceedings,\r\nbut also to facts found by a \"state agency acting in a judicial\r\ncapacity [that] resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it\r\nwhich the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate.\" \r\nUniversity of Tenn. v. Elliott, 478 U.S. 788, 798 (1986).  The\r\napplicable collateral estoppel rules are not federally created, but\r\nare those of the state from which the judgment is taken.  Kremer v.\r\nChemical Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481-82 (1982).\r\nThese rules frame the central question in this appeal: \r\nwhether the district court was correct in holding that Puerto\r\nRico's issue preclusion doctrine \"bound [it] to accept those issues\r\nwhich have already been litigated by the parties and adjudicated by\r\nthe J.A.S.A.P. Hearing Examiner\" and affirmed by the Puerto Rico\r\ncourts.  To answer this question in the affirmative requires both\r\nthat the collateral estoppel rules of Puerto Rico would preclude\r\nthe issue in a Puerto Rico court and that Plaintiffs had a \"full\r\nand fair opportunity to litigate\" the factual claims.  The district\r\ncourt's grant of summary judgment is subject to our de novo review.\r\n2.   Issue Preclusion Under Puerto Rico Law\r\nPuerto Rico's doctrine of preclusion, codified at 31 P.R.\r\nLaws Ann. tit. 31,  3343, provides in pertinent part:\r\nIn order that the presumption of res judicata\r\nbe valid in another suit, it is necessary\r\nthat, between the case decided by the sentence\r\nand that in which the same is invoked, there\r\nbe the most perfect identity between the\r\nthings, causes and persons of the litigants,\r\nand their capacity as such.\r\n\nAlthough the statute speaks of \"res judicata,\" i.e., claim\r\npreclusion, it also permits issue preclusion, or \"collateral\r\nestoppel by judgment.\"  See Texaco Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Medina, 834\r\nF.2d 242, 245-46 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing A &amp; P Gen. Contractors v.\r\nAssociacion Cana, Inc., 10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 987, 995-96 (1981)). \r\nThe district court here concluded that because the Puerto Rico\r\nSupreme Court had affirmed JASAP's finding that Plaintiffs'\r\ntermination was not the result of political discrimination,\r\nPlaintiffs were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue\r\nof political discrimination in a federal court.\r\nPlaintiffs attack this conclusion on several grounds,\r\nwhich we consider in turn.\r\nA.   Non-identity of Parties \r\nPlaintiffs point out that the present action includes new\r\nparties on both sides.  First, the federal complaint added one new\r\nplaintiff -- the spouse and conjugal partnership of an original\r\nplaintiff.  Second, and more significantly, the federal complaint\r\nincluded as defendants the four municipal officials in their\r\nindividual capacities; they were not and could not have been\r\nparties before JASAP. \r\nThe rather strict wording of Puerto Rico's mutuality\r\nrequirement is not a bar to appellees' defense.  Although the\r\nlanguage of the provision calls for \"the most perfect identity of\r\npersons\" between the first and second case, we have noted on a\r\nnumber of occasions that the Puerto Rico courts do not read the\r\nrequirement literally.  See, e.g., Futura Dev. Corp. v. Centex\r\nCorp., 761 F.2d 33, 43 (1st Cir. 1985).  The preclusion statute\r\nitself goes on to provide that, \r\nthere is identity of persons whenever the\r\nlitigants of the second suit are legal\r\nrepresentatives of those who litigated in the\r\npreceding suit, or when they are jointly bound\r\nwith them or by the relations established by\r\nthe indivisibility of prestations [i.e., \"a\r\nperformance of something due upon an\r\nobligation\" according to Webster's New\r\nInternational Dictionary 1796 (1971)] among\r\nthose having a right to demand them, or the\r\nobligation to satisfy the same.\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann., tit. 33,  3343.  We have read this provision as\r\npermitting issue preclusion to operate against a plaintiff who adds\r\ndefendants in the second action.  See Futura, 761 F.2d at 43;\r\nRepublic Sec. Corp. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., 674\r\nF.2d 952, 955-56 (1st Cir. 1982); cf. De Leon v. Colon, 42 P.R.R.\r\n21, 27 (1931) (permitting preclusion based on previous action that\r\nincluded additional defendants); Restatement (Second) of Judgments 51(1).  The municipality and its officers share, in the words of\r\n3343, the \"obligation to satisfy the same [claim]\"; this shared\r\nobligation is, under these circumstances, sufficient to allow\r\npreclusion.  \"Identity of parties and interest is required so that\r\na party's rights and obligations will not be determined without\r\ntheir knowledge or an opportunity for participation.\"  Futura, 761\r\nF.2d at 43.  As Plaintiffs were themselves active participants in\r\nthe JASAP proceedings and the consequent appeals, their own\r\naddition of the officer defendants will not defeat the defense of\r\ncollateral estoppel by judgment.\r\nB.   Identity of Causes\r\nPlaintiffs' second challenge avers that the instant\r\naction and the JASAP proceedings lack an identity of \"causes,\" or\r\nthe factual predicate for relief.  Plaintiffs argue that their \r\n1983 action involves a different cause because JASAP's jurisdiction\r\nis limited to claims under Puerto Rico's Personnel Law.  This\r\nargument mistakes the legal cause of action for the factual \"cause\"\r\ncontemplated by Puerto Rico's preclusion statute: preclusion\r\nrequires an identity of the latter, not the former.  As the Supreme\r\nCourt of Puerto Rico has explained, a \"cause\" includes \"'the\r\nprincipal ground, the origin or exceptions raised and decided, and\r\nit must not be mistaken for the means of proof nor for the legal\r\ngrounds of the claims adduced by the parties.'\"  Lausell Marxuachv. Diaz de Yanez, 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 742, 748 (1975) (quoting\r\nVIII-2 Manresa, Comentarios al Codigo Civil Espanol 301 (6th ed.\r\n1967)).  The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has also stated that\r\nidentity of causes is unnecessary when the defense is one of issue\r\npreclusion, rather than claim preclusion.  See A &amp; P Gen.\r\nContractors, 10 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 996 (explaining that\r\n\"collateral estoppel by judgment\" is \"a variant of res judicata\r\nwhere identity of causes is not necessary\").  Even were collateral\r\nestoppel by judgment to require an identity of causes, we would\r\nhave no trouble concluding that the two cases' identical subject\r\nmatter satisfied that requirement.\r\nC.   Public Policy Exception\r\nThe Puerto Rico courts have recognized an exception to\r\nthe doctrine of preclusion \"whenever its application would defeat\r\nthe ends of justice, [e]specially in the presence of public policy\r\nconsiderations.\"  Pagan Hernandez v. University of Puerto Rico, 107\r\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 795, 807 (1978).  However, \"[t]he mere\r\ninvocation of a constitutional right against an administrative act\r\nis not a key which would automatically move [the court] to reject\r\nthe presumption of res judicata.\"  Id.  Plaintiffs argue that the\r\nJASAP finding should not bind them in light of the public policy\r\nfavoring access to the federal courts to seek redress for\r\ndeprivations of constitutional rights.  However, while employees\r\nmust exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing a\r\njudicial action in the Puerto Rico courts, see Pierson Muller v.\r\nFeijoo, 106 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1153, 1158 (1978), they were not\r\nrequired to do so before bringing a  1983 action in federal court,\r\nsee Patsy v. Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496, 515 (1982). \r\nPlaintiffs chose to proceed first in the JASAP before suing in the\r\nfederal courts; public policy does not require giving them a chance\r\nto revisit that choice.\r\nD.   Full and Fair Opportunity To Litigate\r\nPlaintiffs claim that the JASAP proceeding did not afford\r\nthem the \"full and fair opportunity to litigate\" required of any\r\ndecision later given preclusive effect.  See Allen, 449 U.S. at 95. \r\nTo meet this standard, \"state proceedings need do no more than\r\nsatisfy the minimum procedural requirements of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment's Due Process Clause.\"  Kremer, 456 U.S. at 481.   \r\nPlaintiffs' main proposition is that they were unable to\r\nargue their federal constitutional claims before JASAP because the\r\nCommonwealth administrative proceedings were restricted to\r\ndetermining solely whether dismissal of Plaintiffs violated Puerto\r\nRico's Personnel Law.  However, JASAP expressly considered and\r\nrejected Plaintiffs' contention that they were dismissed \"due to\r\nreasons of political ideology,\" finding that the strike was\r\nresponsible for their dismissal.  This factual issue is the basis\r\nof Plaintiffs' federal constitutional claim.  It is well-\r\nestablished that judicially reviewed administrative fact-finding\r\nmay later estop a federal claim, even though the state\r\nadministrative body itself was unable to consider the federal claim\r\nas such.  See, e.g., Gonsalves v. Alpine Country Club, 727 F.2d 27,\r\n28-29 (1st Cir. 1984).  As in Kremer, Plaintiffs could not prevail\r\non their federal claim consistently with the prior finding of no\r\ndiscrimination.  See 456 U.S. at 479.  Thus, JASAP's factual\r\nconclusion may be given collateral estoppel effect regardless of\r\nany inability by the administrative body to consider Plaintiffs'\r\nfederal constitutional claims.\r\nFinally, Plaintiffs point out that only one of the\r\ntwenty-four plaintiffs testified before JASAP; they allege no other\r\nprocedural defects in the JASAP proceedings.  Certainly, the\r\nability to give evidence is a crucial factor in answering whether\r\na party has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate. \r\nHowever, nothing in the record indicates that Plaintiffs' failure\r\nto testify resulted from JASAP's refusal to allow them to do so. \r\nFor all we can tell, they simply chose not to give evidence before\r\nJASAP.  See Lopez Vives v. Police, 8 P.R. Offic. Trans. 264, 278\r\n(1987) (explaining that JASAP must honor \"the right of an aggrieved\r\nparty to present all the evidence necessary to sustain his claim,\r\nas well as to, orally or in writing, rebut the evidence brought\r\nagainst him\").  On the present record, this argument is undeveloped\r\nand ultimately insufficient to raise any issue of the denial of due\r\nprocess.  Cf. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\r\n1990)(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\r\nby some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").\r\nThe judgment is affirmed.  Costs to appellees. \n",

The Administrative Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The forty-eight terminated employees immediately requested a hearing before the Puerto Rico Personnel Administration Systems Appeal Board (known by its Spanish acronym, \"JASAP\"), the administrative body that handles government employment disputes.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1394(1).  JASAP's examining officer recommended that only those employees who could be identified as having participated in the strike be terminated.  The investigation positively identified only the twenty-four Plaintiffs in this action.  The municipality quickly reinstated the other twenty-four employees, but refused to reinstate the twenty-four Plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contested the examiner's recommendations before the JASAP.  JASAP upheld the examiner, adopting her findings of fact and conclusions of law.  As a \"Conclusion of Law,\" the examining officer's report stated that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant party [the strikers-Plaintiffs] brought to our consideration that the dismissal was due to reasons of political ideology.  It arises from evidence that all the employees who participated in the strike belonged to the [PDP]. (Findings of Fact No. 23) Nevertheless, once the administrative hearings were held not all the forty-eight (48) employees who participated in [the] strike were dismissed, but twenty-four (24) employees.  There were twenty-four \"Populares\" [i.e., members of the PDP] who were reinstated after the administrative hearing with the discount of the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. The &#167; 1983 Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day that JASAP denied Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, Plaintiffs brought the instant action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  The complaint alleged that the terminations and prior disciplinary measures violated Plaintiffs' rights conferred by the Federal Constitution to free expression and association, equal protection of the law, and procedural due process.  Also included within the federal complaint were claims under the law of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Defendants filed their answer, and, based on the JASAP Report's findings, they moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stayed the proceedings, including discovery, while Plaintiffs appealed from the JASAP decision to the Puerto Rico courts.  Plaintiffs' appeal was rebuffed at every turn.  The Superior Court, the Circuit Court, and, ultimately, by a 3-2 decision, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico each affirmed JASAP's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico rendered its decision, the district court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The district court held that JASAP's determination \"that [in the court's words] the sole reason for plaintiffs' dismissal was their participation in an illegal strike,\" collaterally estopped Plaintiffs' political discrimination claim.  The district court also held that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact in their procedural due process claim, and then dismissed without prejudice the remaining claims under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed a Rule 59(e) motion to vacate and/or to amend the judgment, arguing that Puerto Rico's rules of collateral estoppel did not preclude relitigation of a factual issue unless the parties in the second suit were identical to the first.  The individual officials, defendants here, were not parties to the JASAP proceeding.  Thus, Plaintiffs argued, the JASAP decision could not collaterally estop a claim involving these new parties.  The district court rejected this contention, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>1. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To survive summary judgment in a case alleging unconstitutional political discrimination in public employment, an employee must produce evidence that her political affiliation was a \"substantial\" or \"motivating\" factor behind the challenged employment decision.  Mount Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977);  see also Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 39 (1st Cir.1993).  Even if such a link is shown between political affiliation and the adverse employment action, the employee's claim will still fail if the employment decision would have occurred regardless of plaintiff's political affiliation.  See Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court accurately described the JASAP proceedings as establishing \"that the sole reason for Plaintiffs' dismissal was their participation in an illegal strike.\"   The JASAP examiner expressly rejected Plaintiffs' contention that \"the dismissal was due to reasons of political ideology,\" reasoning that the municipality reinstated twenty-four of the forty-eight originally dismissed workers (all of whom shared the same party affiliation) after the hearing examiner had found no proof of their participation in the strike.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court noted this finding in affirming the JASAP decision and concluded that \"JASAP did not err when it decided that the action of dismissal of petitioners herein was within the legal frame of action permissible of the municipality.\"   It would not have been permissible for JASAP to have determined that Plaintiffs' termination was lawful under the \"merit principle\" of Puerto Rico's Personnel Law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1331, if it had found the termination was based on Plaintiffs' political affiliation.  See Diaz de Llovet v. Governor, 112 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 941, 953-54 (1982) (discussing Branti v. Finkel, 455 U.S. 507 (1980)).  A finding for Plaintiffs in the present action would, therefore, necessarily contradict JASAP's prior determination that the dismissals were not based on \"reasons of political ideology\" but rather on the strike, as affirmed by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Full Faith and Credit statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738, provides that \"judicial proceedings ... shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its Territories ... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State [or] Territory ... from which they are taken.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  It is well-settled that a proceeding in a state court collaterally estops inconsistent arguments in a later federal action, including actions under &#167; 1983.  Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 104-05, 101 S.Ct. 411, 419-21, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980).  Preclusive effect is given not only to state judicial proceedings, but also to facts found by a \"state agency acting in a judicial capacity [that] resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate.\"  University of Tenn. v. Elliott, 478 U.S. 788, 798, 106 S.Ct. 3220, 3226, 92 L.Ed.2d 635 (1986).  The applicable collateral estoppel rules are not federally created, but are those of the state from which the judgment is taken.  Kremer v. Chemical Constr.  Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481-82, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1897-98, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rules frame the central question in this appeal:  whether the district court was correct in holding that Puerto Rico's issue preclusion doctrine \"bound [it] to accept those issues which have already been litigated by the parties and adjudicated by the J.A.S.A.P. Hearing Examiner\" and affirmed by the Puerto Rico courts.  To answer this question in the affirmative requires both that the collateral estoppel rules of Puerto Rico would preclude the issue in a Puerto Rico court and that Plaintiffs had a \"full and fair opportunity to litigate\" the factual claims.  The district court's grant of summary judgment is subject to our de novo review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Issue Preclusion Under Puerto Rico Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's doctrine of preclusion, codified at 31 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3343, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>In order that the presumption of res adjudicata be valid in another suit, it is necessary that, between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the same is invoked, there be the most perfect identity between the things, causes and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the statute speaks of \"res judicata,\" i.e., claim preclusion, it also permits issue preclusion, or \"collateral estoppel by judgment.\"   See Texaco Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Medina, 834 F.2d 242, 245-46 (1st Cir.1987) (citing A &amp; P Gen. Contractors v. Associacion Cana, Inc., 10 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 987, 995-96 (1981)).  The district court here concluded that because the Puerto Rico Supreme Court had affirmed JASAP's finding that Plaintiffs' termination was not the result of political discrimination, Plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of political discrimination in a federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs attack this conclusion on several grounds, which we consider in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Non-identity of Parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs point out that the present action includes new parties on both sides.  First, the federal complaint added one new plaintiff--the spouse and conjugal partnership of an original plaintiff.  Second, and more significantly, the federal complaint included as defendants the four municipal officials in their individual capacities;  they were not and could not have been parties before JASAP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rather strict wording of Puerto Rico's mutuality requirement is not a bar to appellees' defense.  Although the language of the provision calls for \"the most perfect identity of persons\" between the first and second case, we have noted on a number of occasions that the Puerto Rico courts do not read the requirement literally.  See, e.g., Futura Dev.  Corp. v. Centex Corp., 761 F.2d 33, 43 (1st Cir.1985).  The preclusion statute itself goes on to provide that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>there is identity of persons whenever the litigants of the second suit are legal representatives of those who litigated in the preceding suit, or when they are jointly bound with them or by the relations established by the indivisibility of prestations [i.e., \"a performance of something due upon an obligation\" according to Webster's New International Dictionary 1796 (1971) ] among those having a right to demand them, or the obligation to satisfy the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 31, &#167; 3343.  We have read this provision as permitting issue preclusion to operate against a plaintiff who adds defendants in the second action.  See Futura, 761 F.2d at 43;  Republic Sec. Corp. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., 674 F.2d 952, 955-56 (1st Cir.1982);  cf. De Leon v. Colon, 42 P.R.R. 21, 27 (1931) (permitting preclusion based on previous action that included additional defendants);  Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 51(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The municipality and its officers share, in the words of &#167; 3343, the \"obligation to satisfy the same [claim]\";  this shared obligation is, under these circumstances, sufficient to allow preclusion.  \"Identity of parties and interest is required so that a party's rights and obligations will not be determined without their knowledge or an opportunity for participation.\"  Futura, 761 F.2d at 43.   As Plaintiffs were themselves active participants in the JASAP proceedings and the consequent appeals, their own addition of the officer defendants will not defeat the defense of collateral estoppel by judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Identity of Causes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' second challenge avers that the instant action and the JASAP proceedings lack an identity of \"causes,\" or the factual predicate for relief.  Plaintiffs argue that their &#167; 1983 action involves a different cause because JASAP's jurisdiction is limited to claims under Puerto Rico's Personnel Law.  This argument mistakes the legal cause of action for the factual \"cause\" contemplated by Puerto Rico's preclusion statute:  preclusion requires an identity of the latter, not the former.  As the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has explained, a \"cause\" includes \" 'the principal ground, the origin or exceptions raised and decided, and it must not be mistaken for the means of proof nor for the legal grounds of the claims adduced by the parties.' \"   Lausell Marxuach v. Diaz de Yanez, 3 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 742, 748 (1975) (quoting VIII-2 Manresa, Comentarios al Codigo Civil Espanol 301 (6th ed.1967)).  The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has also stated that identity of causes is unnecessary when the defense is one of issue preclusion, rather than claim preclusion.  See A &amp; P Gen. Contractors, 10 P.R. Offic.  Trans. at 996 (explaining that \"collateral estoppel by judgment\" is \"a variant of res judicata where identity of causes is not necessary\").  Even were collateral estoppel by judgment to require an identity of causes, we would have no trouble concluding that the two cases' identical subject matter satisfied that requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Public Policy Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Puerto Rico courts have recognized an exception to the doctrine of preclusion \"whenever its application would defeat the ends of justice, [e]specially in the presence of public policy considerations.\"   Pagan Hernandez v. University of Puerto Rico, 107 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 795, 807 (1978).  However, \"[t]he mere invocation of a constitutional right against an administrative act is not a key which would automatically move [the court] to reject the presumption of res judicata.\"  Id. Plaintiffs argue that the JASAP finding should not bind them in light of the public policy favoring access to the federal courts to seek redress for deprivations of constitutional rights.  However, while employees must exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing a judicial action in the Puerto Rico courts, see Pierson Muller v. Feijoo, 106 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 1153, 1158 (1978), they were not required to do so before bringing a &#167; 1983 action in federal court, see Patsy v. Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496, 515, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 2567, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982).  Plaintiffs chose to proceed first in the JASAP before suing in the federal courts;  public policy does not require giving them a chance to revisit that choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Full and Fair Opportunity To Litigate</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that the JASAP proceeding did not afford them the \"full and fair opportunity to litigate\" required of any decision later given preclusive effect.  See Allen, 449 U.S. at 95, 101 S.Ct. at 415.   To meet this standard, \"state proceedings need do no more than satisfy the minimum procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\"  Kremer, 456 U.S. at 481, 102 S.Ct. at 1897.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' main proposition is that they were unable to argue their federal constitutional claims before JASAP because the Commonwealth administrative proceedings were restricted to determining solely whether dismissal of Plaintiffs violated Puerto Rico's Personnel Law.  However, JASAP expressly considered and rejected Plaintiffs' contention that they were dismissed \"due to reasons of political ideology,\" finding that the strike was responsible for their dismissal.  This factual issue is the basis of Plaintiffs' federal constitutional claim.  It is well-established that judicially reviewed administrative fact-finding may later estop a federal claim, even though the state administrative body itself was unable to consider the federal claim as such.  See, e.g., Gonsalves v. Alpine Country Club, 727 F.2d 27, 28-29 (1st Cir.1984).  As in Kremer, Plaintiffs could not prevail on their federal claim consistently with the prior finding of no discrimination.  See 456 U.S. at 479, 102 S.Ct. at 1896.   Thus, JASAP's factual conclusion may be given collateral estoppel effect regardless of any inability by the administrative body to consider Plaintiffs' federal constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Plaintiffs point out that only one of the twenty-four plaintiffs testified before JASAP;  they allege no other procedural defects in the JASAP proceedings.  Certainly, the ability to give evidence is a crucial factor in answering whether a party has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate.  However, nothing in the record indicates that Plaintiffs' failure to testify resulted from JASAP's refusal to allow them to do so.  For all we can tell, they simply chose not to give evidence before JASAP.  See Lopez Vives v. Police, 8 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 264, 278 (1987) (explaining that JASAP must honor \"the right of an aggrieved party to present all the evidence necessary to sustain his claim, as well as to, orally or in writing, rebut the evidence brought against him\").  On the present record, this argument is undeveloped and ultimately insufficient to raise any issue of the denial of due process.  Cf. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990)(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed.   Costs to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> It is clear that &#167; 1738 applies to the judgments of Puerto Rico courts, see also 48 U.S.C. &#167; 734 (providing that unless otherwise specified, federal statutes applicable to states apply to Puerto Rico), and no one here argues to the contrary</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs note the particularly strict interpretation of the mutuality requirement provided in the district court decision in Buenrostro v. Collazo, 777 F.Supp. 128 (D.P.R.1991), aff'd on other grounds, 973 F.2d 39 (1st Cir.1992) (affirming denial of summary judgment based on official immunity).  There, the district court held that officers sued in a federal &#167; 1983 action could not take advantage of a prior Commonwealth trial to which they were not a party.  See id., 777 F.Supp. at 133-34.   The district court stated that \"the failure to raise claims in a prior suit as to some defendants has no effect on the permissibility of raising those same claims against other defendants.\"  Id. (emphasis in original).  To the extent it implies there are no exceptions to absolute mutuality, Buenrostro does not accord with Puerto Rico doctrine as we understand it</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Plaintiff-appellants alleged that their dismissal from municipal employment was based on their political affiliation in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the laws of Puerto Rico.  Previously, Plaintiffs had sought reinstatement by the Puerto Rico administrative body that handles government employment disputes.  That body denied relief to Plaintiffs in a decision that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ultimately affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's affirmance, the district court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment.  It reasoned that Plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from arguing that their dismissal was politically based by a contrary finding in the Commonwealth proceedings.  Plaintiffs have appealed.  The question we face is whether, under Puerto Rico law, the administrative body's findings preclude relitigation of Plaintiffs' termination.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>1. Tension Between Comerio Municipal Employees and the New Comerio Administration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, the citizens of Comerio elected Defendant Luis Rivera Rivera (\"Rivera\"), a member of the New Progressive Party (the \"NPP\"), as their Mayor.  That election ended a half-century of rule in Comerio by the Popular Democratic Party (the \"PDP\").  Other members of the NPP administration included Defendant Domingo Marcano, Internal Auditor;  Defendant Rufino Ayalo, Director of Public Works;  and Defendant Damian Rivera, Director of Civil Defense.  Plaintiffs, all members of the rival PDP, were career municipal employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The months following Rivera's assumption of the mayoral post were marked by tension between the municipality and its employees.  In their complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that they perceived the new administration to be discriminating against PDP holdovers by subjecting them to sudden transfers, threats, and revocation of privileges.  Plaintiffs and other employees protested this perceived mistreatment by declaring a one-day work stoppage.  The Municipality admonished the protesters and withheld their pay for the strike day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Mayor Rivera refused to negotiate, Plaintiffs and those in agreement declared another strike, which directly led to their dismissal.  The dismissed employees announced a four-day work stoppage, with a protest on the first day in front of City Hall.  Mayor Rivera responded by activating, through Defendant Damian Rivera, the municipality's civil defense to provide Comerio with essential services.  Plaintiffs and their fellows saw the civil defense forces as strikebreakers.  The City Hall protest led to physical and verbal confrontations between the civil defense force and the strikers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the work stoppage, the municipality investigated the strike, which, the parties agree, violated Puerto Rico law forbidding municipal employees to strike.  The municipality's auditor, Defendant Domingo Marcano, reviewed the municipality personnel department's attendance records to determine who participated in the strike.  The Municipality then informed forty-eight employees of their dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The Administrative Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The forty-eight terminated employees immediately requested a hearing before the Puerto Rico Personnel Administration Systems Appeal Board (known by its Spanish acronym, \"JASAP\"), the administrative body that handles government employment disputes.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1394(1).  JASAP's examining officer recommended that only those employees who could be identified as having participated in the strike be terminated.  The investigation positively identified only the twenty-four Plaintiffs in this action.  The municipality quickly reinstated the other twenty-four employees, but refused to reinstate the twenty-four Plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contested the examiner's recommendations before the JASAP.  JASAP upheld the examiner, adopting her findings of fact and conclusions of law.  As a \"Conclusion of Law,\" the examining officer's report stated that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant party [the strikers-Plaintiffs] brought to our consideration that the dismissal was due to reasons of political ideology.  It arises from evidence that all the employees who participated in the strike belonged to the [PDP]. (Findings of Fact No. 23) Nevertheless, once the administrative hearings were held not all the forty-eight (48) employees who participated in [the] strike were dismissed, but twenty-four (24) employees.  There were twenty-four \"Populares\" [i.e., members of the PDP] who were reinstated after the administrative hearing with the discount of the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. The &#167; 1983 Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day that JASAP denied Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, Plaintiffs brought the instant action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  The complaint alleged that the terminations and prior disciplinary measures violated Plaintiffs' rights conferred by the Federal Constitution to free expression and association, equal protection of the law, and procedural due process.  Also included within the federal complaint were claims under the law of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Defendants filed their answer, and, based on the JASAP Report's findings, they moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stayed the proceedings, including discovery, while Plaintiffs appealed from the JASAP decision to the Puerto Rico courts.  Plaintiffs' appeal was rebuffed at every turn.  The Superior Court, the Circuit Court, and, ultimately, by a 3-2 decision, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico each affirmed JASAP's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico rendered its decision, the district court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The district court held that JASAP's determination \"that [in the court's words] the sole reason for plaintiffs' dismissal was their participation in an illegal strike,\" collaterally estopped Plaintiffs' political discrimination claim.  The district court also held that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact in their procedural due process claim, and then dismissed without prejudice the remaining claims under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed a Rule 59(e) motion to vacate and/or to amend the judgment, arguing that Puerto Rico's rules of collateral estoppel did not preclude relitigation of a factual issue unless the parties in the second suit were identical to the first.  The individual officials, defendants here, were not parties to the JASAP proceeding.  Thus, Plaintiffs argued, the JASAP decision could not collaterally estop a claim involving these new parties.  The district court rejected this contention, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>1. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To survive summary judgment in a case alleging unconstitutional political discrimination in public employment, an employee must produce evidence that her political affiliation was a \"substantial\" or \"motivating\" factor behind the challenged employment decision.

Even if such a link is shown between political affiliation and the adverse employment action, the employee's claim will still fail if the employment decision would have occurred regardless of plaintiff's political affiliation.

The Puerto Rico Supreme Court noted this finding in affirming the JASAP decision and concluded that \"JASAP did not err when it decided that the action of dismissal of petitioners herein was within the legal frame of action permissible of the municipality.\"   It would not have been permissible for JASAP to have determined that Plaintiffs' termination was lawful under the \"merit principle\" of Puerto Rico's Personnel Law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1331, if it had found the termination was based on Plaintiffs' political affiliation.  See Diaz de Llovet v. Governor, 112 P.R. Offic.

Finkel, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></span> (1980)).  A finding for Plaintiffs in the present action would, therefore, necessarily contradict JASAP's prior determination that the dismissals were not based on \"reasons of political ideology\" but rather on the strike, as affirmed by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Full Faith and Credit statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738, provides that \"judicial proceedings ... shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its Territories ... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State [or] Territory ... from which they are taken.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  It is well-settled that a proceeding in a state court collaterally estops inconsistent arguments in a later federal action, including actions under &#167; 1983.

Hearing Examiner\" and affirmed by the Puerto Rico courts.  To answer this question in the affirmative requires both that the collateral estoppel rules of Puerto Rico would preclude the issue in a Puerto Rico court and that Plaintiffs had a \"full and fair opportunity to litigate\" the factual claims.  The district court's grant of summary judgment is subject to our de novo review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Issue Preclusion Under Puerto Rico Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's doctrine of preclusion, codified at 31 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3343, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>In order that the presumption of res adjudicata be valid in another suit, it is necessary that, between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the same is invoked, there be the most perfect identity between the things, causes and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the statute speaks of \"res judicata,\" i.e., claim preclusion, it also permits issue preclusion, or \"collateral estoppel by judgment.\"   See Texaco Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Medina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498120\"><a href=\"/opinion/498120/texaco-puerto-rico-inc-v-jose-medina-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 245-46 (1st Cir.1987) (citing A &amp; P Gen. Contractors v. Associacion Cana, Inc., 10 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 987, 995-96 (1981)).  The district court here concluded that because the Puerto Rico Supreme Court had affirmed JASAP's finding that Plaintiffs' termination was not the result of political discrimination, Plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of political discrimination in a federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs attack this conclusion on several grounds, which we consider in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Non-identity of Parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs point out that the present action includes new parties on both sides.  First, the federal complaint added one new plaintiff--the spouse and conjugal partnership of an original plaintiff.  Second, and more significantly, the federal complaint included as defendants the four municipal officials in their individual capacities;  they were not and could not have been parties before JASAP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rather strict wording of Puerto Rico's mutuality requirement is not a bar to appellees' defense.  Although the language of the provision calls for \"the most perfect identity of persons\" between the first and second case, we have noted on a number of occasions that the Puerto Rico courts do not read the requirement literally.  See, e.g., Futura Dev.  Corp. v. Centex Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451688\"><a href=\"/opinion/451688/fed-sec-l-rep-p-92024-futura-development-corporation-v-centex/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1985).  The preclusion statute itself goes on to provide that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>there is identity of persons whenever the litigants of the second suit are legal representatives of those who litigated in the preceding suit, or when they are jointly bound with them or by the relations established by the indivisibility of prestations [i.e., \"a performance of something due upon an obligation\" according to Webster's New International Dictionary 1796 (1971) ] among those having a right to demand them, or the obligation to satisfy the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 31, &#167; 3343.  We have read this provision as permitting issue preclusion to operate against a plaintiff who adds defendants in the second action.  See Futura, 761 F.2d at 43;  Republic Sec. Corp. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402203\"><a href=\"/opinion/402203/republic-security-corporation-v-the-puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span>, 955-56 (1st Cir.1982);  cf. De Leon v. Colon, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, 27 (1931) (permitting preclusion based on previous action that included additional defendants);  Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 51(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The municipality and its officers share, in the words of &#167; 3343, the \"obligation to satisfy the same [claim]\";  this shared obligation is, under these circumstances, sufficient to allow preclusion.  \"Identity of parties and interest is required so that a party's rights and obligations will not be determined without their knowledge or an opportunity for participation.\"  Futura, 761 F.2d at 43.   As Plaintiffs were themselves active participants in the JASAP proceedings and the consequent appeals, their own addition of the officer defendants will not defeat the defense of collateral estoppel by judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Identity of Causes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' second challenge avers that the instant action and the JASAP proceedings lack an identity of \"causes,\" or the factual predicate for relief.  Plaintiffs argue that their &#167; 1983 action involves a different cause because JASAP's jurisdiction is limited to claims under Puerto Rico's Personnel Law.  This argument mistakes the legal cause of action for the factual \"cause\" contemplated by Puerto Rico's preclusion statute:  preclusion requires an identity of the latter, not the former.  As the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has explained, a \"cause\" includes \" 'the principal ground, the origin or exceptions raised and decided, and it must not be mistaken for the means of proof nor for the legal grounds of the claims adduced by the parties.' \"   Lausell Marxuach v. Diaz de Yanez, 3 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 742, 748 (1975) (quoting VIII-2 Manresa, Comentarios al Codigo Civil Espanol 301 (6th ed.1967)).  The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has also stated that identity of causes is unnecessary when the defense is one of issue preclusion, rather than claim preclusion.  See A &amp; P Gen. Contractors, 10 P.R. Offic.  Trans. at 996 (explaining that \"collateral estoppel by judgment\" is \"a variant of res judicata where identity of causes is not necessary\").  Even were collateral estoppel by judgment to require an identity of causes, we would have no trouble concluding that the two cases' identical subject matter satisfied that requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Public Policy Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Puerto Rico courts have recognized an exception to the doctrine of preclusion \"whenever its application would defeat the ends of justice, [e]specially in the presence of public policy considerations.\"   Pagan Hernandez v. University of Puerto Rico, 107 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 795, 807 (1978).  However, \"[t]he mere invocation of a constitutional right against an administrative act is not a key which would automatically move [the court] to reject the presumption of res judicata.\"  Id. Plaintiffs argue that the JASAP finding should not bind them in light of the public policy favoring access to the federal courts to seek redress for deprivations of constitutional rights.  However, while employees must exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing a judicial action in the Puerto Rico courts, see Pierson Muller v. Feijoo, 106 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 1153, 1158 (1978), they were not required to do so before bringing a &#167; 1983 action in federal court, see Patsy v. Board of Regents, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110753\"><a href=\"/opinion/110753/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 515, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110753\"><a href=\"/opinion/110753/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2557</span></a></span>, 2567, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110753\"><a href=\"/opinion/110753/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span> (1982).  Plaintiffs chose to proceed first in the JASAP before suing in the federal courts;  public policy does not require giving them a chance to revisit that choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Full and Fair Opportunity To Litigate</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that the JASAP proceeding did not afford them the \"full and fair opportunity to litigate\" required of any decision later given preclusive effect.  See Allen, 449 U.S. at 95, 101 S.Ct. at 415.   To meet this standard, \"state proceedings need do no more than satisfy the minimum procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\"  Kremer, 456 U.S. at 481, 102 S.Ct. at 1897.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' main proposition is that they were unable to argue their federal constitutional claims before JASAP because the Commonwealth administrative proceedings were restricted to determining solely whether dismissal of Plaintiffs violated Puerto Rico's Personnel Law.  However, JASAP expressly considered and rejected Plaintiffs' contention that they were dismissed \"due to reasons of political ideology,\" finding that the strike was responsible for their dismissal.  This factual issue is the basis of Plaintiffs' federal constitutional claim.  It is well-established that judicially reviewed administrative fact-finding may later estop a federal claim, even though the state administrative body itself was unable to consider the federal claim as such.  See, e.g., Gonsalves v. Alpine Country Club, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430975\"><a href=\"/opinion/430975/33-fair-emplpraccas-1817-33-empl-prac-dec-p-34150-antone-gonsalves/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 28-29 (1st Cir.1984).  As in Kremer, Plaintiffs could not prevail on their federal claim consistently with the prior finding of no discrimination.  See 456 U.S. at 479, 102 S.Ct. at 1896.   Thus, JASAP's factual conclusion may be given collateral estoppel effect regardless of any inability by the administrative body to consider Plaintiffs' federal constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Plaintiffs point out that only one of the twenty-four plaintiffs testified before JASAP;  they allege no other procedural defects in the JASAP proceedings.  Certainly, the ability to give evidence is a crucial factor in answering whether a party has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate.  However, nothing in the record indicates that Plaintiffs' failure to testify resulted from JASAP's refusal to allow them to do so.  For all we can tell, they simply chose not to give evidence before JASAP.  See Lopez Vives v. Police, 8 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 264, 278 (1987) (explaining that JASAP must honor \"the right of an aggrieved party to present all the evidence necessary to sustain his claim, as well as to, orally or in writing, rebut the evidence brought against him\").  On the present record, this argument is undeveloped and ultimately insufficient to raise any issue of the denial of due process.  Cf. United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990)(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed.

Collazo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

There, the district court held that officers sued in a federal &#167; 1983 action could not take advantage of a prior Commonwealth trial to which they were not a party.  See id., 777 F.Supp. at 133-34.   The district court stated that \"the failure to raise claims in a prior suit as to some defendants has no effect on the permissibility of raising those same claims against other defendants.\"  Id. (emphasis in original).  To the extent it implies there are no exceptions to absolute mutuality, Buenrostro does not accord with Puerto Rico doctrine as we understand it</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
