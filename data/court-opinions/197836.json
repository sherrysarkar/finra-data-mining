Jos Antonio Fust, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                      Before\r\n\n              Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n            Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand DiClerico, District Judge.\r\n\nCarlos Del Valle Cruz for appellants.\r\nBenicio Sanchez-La Costa, with whom Jorge Rodriguez-Micheo,\r\nGoldman Antonetti &amp; Cordova, Sigfredo Rodriguez-Isaac, Assistant\r\nAttorney General, Department of Justice, Carlos Del Valle-Cruz and\r\nLespier &amp; Munoz Noya were on brief for appellees.\r\n\n                 March 12, 1998\r\n                                             CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff Carmen Rodriguez-\r\nRios, along with her husband and their conjugal partnership, appeal\r\nfrom a district court judgment rejecting her political\r\ndiscrimination claims against various executives and managers\r\nemployed at the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\"PREPA\") who\r\ndemoted Rodriguez, due allegedly to her political affiliation.  We\r\nvacate the district court judgment and remand for further\r\nproceedings.\r\n                     I\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nPlaintiff, a longtime activist in the Popular Democratic\r\nParty (\"PDP\"), served as Executive Secretary to both the Chief of\r\nStaff of the Governor of Puerto Rico and the Secretary of State\r\nwhile the PDP held sway in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico between\r\n1985 and 1990.  Plaintiff commenced her employment with the Human\r\nResources Department at PREPA in 1990 and became its Coordinator of\r\nEligible Personnel Affairs on July 5, 1992.\r\nShortly after Pedro Rossell of the opposition New\r\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\") was elected Governor of Puerto Rico on\r\nNovember 4, 1992, he appointed a fellow NPP member, defendant\r\nMiguel Cordero, as Executive Director of PREPA.  Cordero in turn\r\nappointed the other named defendants, all NPP members, to\r\nmanagerial positions in the Human Resources Department.\r\nFollowing the new NPP appointments, plaintiff was\r\nassigned employment duties theretofore performed by persons holding\r\nemployment classifications well below the M-IV level in which\r\nplaintiff continued to be classified.  Ultimately, on July 29,\r\n1994, defendant Eckart, the PREPA Personnel Director, formally\r\ndemoted plaintiff to Confidential Secretary I (M-I level),\r\nWarehouse Section, Administrative Services Department, Supplies\r\nDivision, ostensibly pursuant to a Human Resources Department\r\nreorganization orchestrated by defendant Verge under the direction\r\nof defendant Cordero.\r\nOn March 14, 1995, plaintiff, her husband and their\r\nconjugal partnership filed the present action in which plaintiff\r\nalleged that defendants had demoted her based solely on her PDP\r\naffiliation.  See 42 U.S.C.  1983.  For their part, plaintiff's\r\nhusband and the conjugal partnership invoked the supplemental\r\njurisdiction of the district court, see 28 U.S.C.  1367(a), and\r\nalleged violations of their derivative rights under Puerto Rico\r\nlaw, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  5141, resulting from the alleged\r\npolitical discrimination against plaintiff in violation of P.R.\r\nLaws Ann. tit. 29,  136, 140, 146.  See Nieves Domenech v. Dymax\r\nCorp., 952 F. Supp. 57, 66 (D.P.R. 1996); see also Santini Riverav. Serv Air, Inc., 94 J.T.S. 121 (1994).\r\nThe defendants were awarded summary judgment on the\r\nground that the challenged demotion had been effected pursuant to\r\na bona fide reorganization.  The commonwealth-law claims brought by\r\nthe husband and conjugal partnership were dismissed, apparently due\r\nto lack of standing to sue under section 1983.\r\n                     II\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA.   Political Discrimination\r\nIn political discrimination cases, nonpolicymaking\r\nemployees have the threshold burden to produce sufficient direct or\r\ncircumstantial evidence from which a rational jury could find that\r\npolitical affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind\r\nthe adverse employment action.  See Larou v. Ridlon, 98 F.3d 659,\r\n661 (1st Cir. 1996); Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 66 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).  At that point the employer must articulate a\r\nnondiscriminatory basis for the adverse employment action and prove\r\nby a preponderance of the evidence that it would have been taken\r\nwithout regard to plaintiff's political affiliation.  See Larou, 98\r\nF.3d at 661; see also Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\r\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).\r\nThe plaintiff attested, without evidentiary\r\ncontradiction, that her PDP affiliation was widely known and that\r\nthe defendants were prominent members of the opposition NPP.  See,\r\ne.g., supra at p. 2.  The district court nevertheless concluded, in\r\nreliance on Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49 (1st\r\nCir. 1990), that the politically charged atmosphere at PREPA,\r\nwithout more, did not demonstrate a direct causal link between\r\nplaintiff's PDP affiliation and her demotion.\r\nOur affirmance of the district court ruling in Correa-\r\nMartinez was explained as follows:\r\nThe complaint did not say that plaintiff\r\npossessed, or expressed, any significant\r\npolitical views; indeed, implicit in\r\nplaintiff's arguments is the suggestion that\r\nhe, himself, scrupulously avoided partisan\r\npolitical involvement. . . . [The complaint]\r\ndid not maintain that defendants knew anything\r\nabout plaintiff's politics or that their\r\nmotivation related in the slightest to\r\nplaintiff's exercise of any first amendment or\r\nother constitutionally protected right.\r\n\nId. at 57-58 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).  In contrast,\r\nhere the plaintiff alleged in her complaint and proffered competent\r\nevidence that the defendants were NPP activists who were well aware\r\nthat she was a prominent PDP activist.\r\nAlthough a highly charged political atmosphere alone\r\ncannot support an inference of discriminatory animus, \"'[a] highly\r\ncharged political atmosphere' . . ., coupled with the fact thatplaintiffs and defendants are of competing political persuasions,\r\nmay be probative of discriminatory animus.\"  Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d\r\nat 69 (emphasis added).  Thus, unlike in Correa-Martinez, but just\r\nas noted in Acevedo-Diaz, here \"[a] jury reasonably could have\r\nconcluded that [plaintiff] . . . [was a] conspicuous target[] for\r\npolitical discrimination.\"  Id.  Therefore, even standing alone\r\nsuch circumstantial evidence \"would give us serious pause.\"  Id. \r\nBut there was more.\r\nViewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, seeLarou, 98 F.3d at 660 n.1, other evidence adduced by plaintiff\r\nestablished a prima facie case of political discrimination.  For\r\nexample, plaintiff adduced evidence that every employment task for\r\nwhich she had been responsible prior to her demotion was performed\r\nthereafter by an NPP member and that at least three new recruits to\r\nthe Human Resources Department were NPP members, whereas there is\r\nno evidence that any new recruit was a PDP member.  Moreover, the\r\nsummary judgment record reflects that the putative reorganization\r\nwitnessed seven PDP-member demotions, with no evidence that any NPP\r\nmember was either demoted or discharged.\r\nThe district court ruled this evidence immaterial,\r\nexplaining that \"this case does not directly concern other parties\r\noutside those in the caption . . . .\"  However, as we pointed out\r\nin Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 706 (1st Cir.\r\n1993), and in Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 40\r\n(1st Cir. 1993), given similar evidentiary showings it is for the\r\njury to determine whether the defendants were motivated by a\r\ndiscriminatory animus.  Since there can be no serious question that\r\nthe aforementioned circumstantial evidence, viewed in the light\r\nmost favorable to plaintiff, established a prima facie case that\r\nshe had been demoted due to her political affiliation, see id., we\r\nnow consider the nondiscriminatory motivations relied upon by the\r\ndefendants.\r\nThe defendants were required to prove by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence that their challenged employment actions were\r\nprompted by legitimate, nondiscriminatory motives.  At this point\r\n\"the plaintiff-employee will prevail unless the fact finder\r\nconcludes that the defendant has produced enough evidence to\r\nestablish that the plaintiff's [demotion] would have occurred in\r\nany event for nondiscriminatory reasons.\"  Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at\r\n67.\r\nThe defendants ventured that the demotion was due to a\r\nbona fide reorganization at PREPA.  The district court accepted\r\ntheir contention that the PREPA labor force had become \"extremely\r\nbloated\" and that defendant Verge, who managed the reorganization,\r\nhad not even known the plaintiff personally.  In addition, the\r\ncourt correctly noted that the position formerly held by plaintiff\r\nrequired a bachelor's degree, which she lacked.\r\nPlaintiff responded that the bachelor's degree\r\nrequirement had been waived for at least one NPP member recruited\r\nto the Human Resources Department around the time she was demoted. \r\nFurther, she pointed out  and defendants do not dispute  that\r\nthe reorganization relied upon by defendants had not been\r\nauthorized by the PREPA Governing Board.  Although defendant\r\nCordero concedes that no other reorganization plan has ever been\r\nundertaken without Governing Board approval, he maintains that the\r\nPREPA by-laws did not require that this reorganization receive\r\nGoverning Board approval.  Yet neither Cordero nor any other\r\ndefendant proffered a copy of the PREPA by-laws or pointed to\r\nlanguage in the by-laws supporting this contention.\r\nThe district court engaged in impermissible factfinding\r\nat this point by concluding that plaintiff's demotion was simply\r\nthe neutral byproduct of a bona fide reorganization.  The evidence\r\nrevealed that the so-called reorganization, in its entirety,\r\nconsisted of (i) defendant Cordero's request that defendant Verge\r\nevaluate the functions of the Human Resources Directorate in order\r\nto determine the need for its various services; (ii) defendant\r\nVerge's subsequent recommendations to Cordero as to which services\r\nwere to be eliminated and the individual employees who were to be\r\ndemoted or discharged as a result; and (iii) Cordero's subsequent\r\napproval of every recommendation made by Verge, without further\r\naction or review by any higher authority in PREPA.\r\nFurthermore, even assuming the challenged employment\r\naction constituted a \"reorganization,\" its motivation remained very\r\nmuch in question, especially since  unlike all previous\r\nreorganization plans at PREPA  it was never reviewed or approved\r\nby the Governing Board.  Instead, the reorganization plan\r\nmemorandum was simply marked \"Confidential and Privileged.\"\r\nAbsent record evidence to substantiate the asserted\r\nnondiscriminatory motive for bypassing the PREPA Governing Board\r\nbefore proceeding with the \"reorganization\" plan, a rational\r\nfactfinder reasonably could infer that defendants' true purpose was\r\npolitical discrimination.  See Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51\r\nF.3d 1087, 1092 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Where the elements of a\r\nsufficient prima facie case combine with the factfinder's belief\r\nthat the ostensible basis for [demoting an] employee was\r\npretextual, . . . the factfinder is permitted to infer . . .\r\nintentional [political] discrimination . . . .\").\r\nFinally, it seems reasonably clear, as the district court\r\nobserved, that the PREPA labor force was bloated.  For example, the\r\nNPP report which prompted defendant Cordero to launch the\r\nreorganization plan stated:\r\n     The number of employees [at PREPA] has\r\nincreased alarmingly.  As of January 1985\r\n[i.e., when the PDP took over power in Puerto\r\nRico], [PREPA] had 8,472 employees, equivalent\r\nto 1 employee for every 125 subscribers.  In\r\n1991, the number of employees had increased to\r\n10,616 or 1 employee for every 110\r\nsubscribers.  This excess of employees imposes\r\nan unbearable burden on the finances of\r\n[PREPA].  (Emphasis added).\r\n\nNevertheless, defendants have not explained or demonstrated how the\r\nbloating in the 10,000-plus PREPA labor force was addressed by\r\nplaintiff's demotion and transfer to a different department in\r\nPREPA, as distinguished from her discharge.\r\nAt the very least, therefore, the proffered justification\r\nfor her demotion lacked conclusive force, especially since the\r\ndefendants point to no record support for an inference that her\r\ndemotion materially reduced the cost of operating the Human\r\nResources Directorate.  Moreover, particularly in light of the\r\nuncontested evidence that twenty new recruits were hired by the\r\nHuman Resources Department during the reorganization, none of whom\r\nwere shown to have been PDP members, we can discern no rational\r\nrecord basis for concluding that the putative reorganization was\r\nmotivated by cost savings.\r\nAccordingly, we are unable to agree that the evidence\r\nproffered by the defendants compelled a finding that plaintiff was\r\ndemoted for nondiscriminatory reasons, see Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait,\r\n37 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Summary judgment [is] warranted . .\r\n. only if defendants' evidentiary proffer compel[s] the finding\r\nthat political discrimination did not constitute a 'but for' cause\r\nfor the demotion.\"), since a reasonable jury certainly could infer\r\nthat the so-called \"reorganization\" was a pretext for relegating\r\nplaintiff to a less \"sensitive\" position in PREPA due to her\r\naffiliation with the opposition PDP.\r\nB.   The Commonwealth-Law Claims\r\nPlaintiff's husband and the conjugal partnership asserted\r\nderivative claims under Puerto Rico law, see Nieves Domenech v.\r\nDymax Corp., 952 F. Supp. 57, 66 (D.P.R. 1996); P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\r\n31,  5141, which were dismissed because plaintiff's discrimination\r\nclaims under section 1983 were deemed deficient.  Since the section\r\n1983 claims must be reinstated, so must the commonwealth-law\r\nclaims.  See Rodriguez v. Comas, 888 F.2d 899, 905 (1st Cir. 1989)\r\n(holding that federal district court may exercise pendent\r\njurisdiction over state-law claims of  1983 plaintiff's spouse,\r\nprovided the claims share a common nucleus of operative fact with\r\nthe section 1983 claims).\r\nThe district court judgment is vacated and the case is\r\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \r\nCosts are awarded to appellants.\r\nSO ORDERED.\n",

In addition, the court correctly noted that the position formerly held by plaintiff required a bachelor's degree, which she lacked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff responded that the bachelor's degree requirement had been waived for at least one NPP member recruited to the Human Resources Department around the time she was demoted.  Further, she pointed out--and defendants do not dispute--that the reorganization relied upon by defendants had not been authorized by the PREPA Governing Board.  Although defendant Cordero concedes that no other reorganization plan has ever been undertaken without Governing Board approval, he maintains that the PREPA by-laws did not require that this reorganization receive Governing Board approval.  Yet neither Cordero nor any other defendant proffered a copy of the PREPA by-laws or pointed to language in the by-laws supporting this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court engaged in impermissible factfinding at this point by concluding that plaintiff's demotion was simply the neutral byproduct of a bona fide reorganization.  The evidence revealed that the so-called reorganization, in its entirety, consisted of (i) defendant Cordero's request that defendant Verge evaluate the functions of the Human Resources Directorate in order to determine the need for its various services;  (ii) defendant Verge's subsequent recommendations to Cordero as to which services were to be eliminated and the individual employees who were to be demoted or discharged as a result;  and (iii) Cordero's subsequent approval of every recommendation made by Verge, without further action or review by any higher authority in PREPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even assuming the challenged employment action constituted a \"reorganization,\" its motivation remained very much in question, especially since--unlike all previous reorganization plans at PREPA--it was never reviewed or approved by the Governing Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Instead, the reorganization plan memorandum was simply marked \"Confidential and Privileged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent record evidence to substantiate the asserted nondiscriminatory motive for bypassing the PREPA Governing Board before proceeding with the \"reorganization\" plan, a rational factfinder reasonably could infer that defendants' true purpose was political discrimination.  See Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1092 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Where the elements of a sufficient prima facie case combine with the factfinder's belief that the ostensible basis for [demoting an] employee was pretextual, ... the factfinder is permitted to infer ... intentional [political] discrimination....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it seems reasonably clear, as the district court observed, that the PREPA labor force was bloated.  For example, the NPP report which prompted defendant Cordero to launch the reorganization plan stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The number of employees [at PREPA] has increased alarmingly.  As of January 1985 [i.e., when the PDP took over power in Puerto Rico], [PREPA] had 8,472 employees, equivalent to 1 employee for every 125 subscribers.  In 1991, the number of employees had increased to 10,616 or 1 employee for every 110 subscribers.  This excess of employees imposes an unbearable burden on the finances of [PREPA].  (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, defendants have not explained or demonstrated how the bloating in the 10,000-plus PREPA labor force was addressed by plaintiff's demotion and transfer to a different department in PREPA, as distinguished from her discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the very least, therefore, the proffered justification for her demotion lacked conclusive force, especially since the defendants point to no record support for an inference that her demotion materially reduced the cost of operating the Human Resources Directorate.  Moreover, particularly in light of the uncontested evidence that twenty new recruits were hired by the Human Resources Department during the reorganization, none of whom were shown to have been PDP members, we can discern no rational record basis for concluding that the putative reorganization was motivated by cost savings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we are unable to agree that the evidence proffered by the defendants compelled a finding that plaintiff was demoted for nondiscriminatory reasons, see Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait, 37 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Summary judgment [is] warranted ... only if defendants' evidentiary proffer compel[s] the finding that political discrimination did not constitute a 'but for' cause for the demotion.\"), since a reasonable jury certainly could infer that the so-called \"reorganization\" was a pretext for relegating plaintiff to a less \"sensitive\" position in PREPA due to her affiliation with the opposition PDP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Commonwealth-Law Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's husband and the conjugal partnership asserted derivative claims under Puerto Rico law, see Nieves Domenech v.

Ultimately, on July 29, 1994, defendant Eckart, the PREPA Personnel Director, formally demoted plaintiff to Confidential Secretary I (M-I level), Warehouse Section, Administrative Services Department, Supplies Division, ostensibly pursuant to a Human Resources Department reorganization orchestrated by defendant Verge under the direction of defendant Cordero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 1995, plaintiff, her husband and their conjugal partnership filed the present action in which plaintiff alleged that defendants had demoted her based solely on her PDP affiliation.

For example, plaintiff adduced evidence that every employment task for which she had been responsible prior to her demotion was performed thereafter by an NPP member and that at least three new recruits to the Human Resources Department were NPP members, whereas there is no evidence that any new recruit was a PDP member.  Moreover, the summary judgment record reflects that the putative reorganization witnessed seven PDP-member demotions, with no evidence that any NPP member was either demoted or discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled this evidence immaterial, explaining that \"this case does not directly concern other parties outside those in the caption....\"  However, as we pointed out in Nereida-Gonzalez v.

Since there can be no serious question that the aforementioned circumstantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, established a prima facie case that she had been demoted due to her political affiliation, see id., we now consider the nondiscriminatory motivations relied upon by the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that their challenged employment actions were prompted by legitimate, nondiscriminatory motives.

Although defendant Cordero concedes that no other reorganization plan has ever been undertaken without Governing Board approval, he maintains that the PREPA by-laws did not require that this reorganization receive Governing Board approval.

The evidence revealed that the so-called reorganization, in its entirety, consisted of (i) defendant Cordero's request that defendant Verge evaluate the functions of the Human Resources Directorate in order to determine the need for its various services;  (ii) defendant Verge's subsequent recommendations to Cordero as to which services were to be eliminated and the individual employees who were to be demoted or discharged as a result;  and (iii) Cordero's subsequent approval of every recommendation made by Verge, without further action or review by any higher authority in PREPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even assuming the challenged employment action constituted a \"reorganization,\" its motivation remained very much in question, especially since--unlike all previous reorganization plans at PREPA--it was never reviewed or approved by the Governing Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Instead, the reorganization plan memorandum was simply marked \"Confidential and Privileged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent record evidence to substantiate the asserted nondiscriminatory motive for bypassing the PREPA Governing Board before proceeding with the \"reorganization\" plan, a rational factfinder reasonably could infer that defendants' true purpose was political discrimination.  See Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span>, 1092 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Where the elements of a sufficient prima facie case combine with the factfinder's belief that the ostensible basis for [demoting an] employee was pretextual, ... the factfinder is permitted to infer ... intentional [political] discrimination....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it seems reasonably clear, as the district court observed, that the PREPA labor force was bloated.  For example, the NPP report which prompted defendant Cordero to launch the reorganization plan stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The number of employees [at PREPA] has increased alarmingly.  As of January 1985 [i.e., when the PDP took over power in Puerto Rico], [PREPA] had 8,472 employees, equivalent to 1 employee for every 125 subscribers.  In 1991, the number of employees had increased to 10,616 or 1 employee for every 110 subscribers.  This excess of employees imposes an unbearable burden on the finances of [PREPA].  (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, defendants have not explained or demonstrated how the bloating in the 10,000-plus PREPA labor force was addressed by plaintiff's demotion and transfer to a different department in PREPA, as distinguished from her discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the very least, therefore, the proffered justification for her demotion lacked conclusive force, especially since the defendants point to no record support for an inference that her demotion materially reduced the cost of operating the Human Resources Directorate.  Moreover, particularly in light of the uncontested evidence that twenty new recruits were hired by the Human Resources Department during the reorganization, none of whom were shown to have been PDP members, we can discern no rational record basis for concluding that the putative reorganization was motivated by cost savings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we are unable to agree that the evidence proffered by the defendants compelled a finding that plaintiff was demoted for nondiscriminatory reasons, see Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195629\"><a href=\"/opinion/195629/jirau-bernal-v-agrait/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Summary judgment [is] warranted ... only if defendants' evidentiary proffer compel[s] the finding that political discrimination did not constitute a 'but for' cause for the demotion.\"), since a reasonable jury certainly could infer that the so-called \"reorganization\" was a pretext for relegating plaintiff to a less \"sensitive\" position in PREPA due to her affiliation with the opposition PDP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Commonwealth-Law Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's husband and the conjugal partnership asserted derivative claims under Puerto Rico law, see Nieves Domenech v. Dymax Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></span>, 66 (D.P.R.1996);  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5141, which were dismissed because plaintiff's discrimination claims under section 1983 were deemed deficient.  Since the section 1983 claims must be reinstated, so must the commonwealth-law claims.  See Rodriguez v.

[They] also provide[ ] a simpler organizational structure, which will translate into a greater control of the activities carried out.</p>\n        <p>The personnel that is [sic] deemed extra, as a result of the reorganization, will be placed in areas where a need for personnel has been indicated, thereby limiting the recruitment of outside personnel, which will result in additional savings to the Company.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, the summary judgment record does not support a finding that even one NPP member was demoted or discharged pursuant to the \"reorganization\" plan.  Whereas it plainly reflects that seven PDP-member employees were demoted.  Thus, it was error to hold that \"[a]ny ... irregularities [in the reorganization process] appear to be subsumed by the resolve to force efficiency into this behemoth public utility,\" absent an explanation as to why efficiency dictated that the \"reorganization\" be conducted strictly along political lines, a suggestion which is strongly supported by the aforementioned evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Rodriguez-Rios</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The defendants further contend that they are entitled to assert the so-called \"changeover\" defense articulated in Agosto-de-Feliciano v.

There, we recognized that a \"changeover in government is ... likely to produce substantial alterations in certain employee's jobs not because those employees are members of the outgoing party but because the incoming party, as a matter of policy, does not view those jobs to be important.\"  Id. at 1221.   Accordingly, we held that \"the factfinder should give some deference to a new government's explanation of how changes made shortly after it assumed power fit into its overall policy objectives.\"  Id. The government bears the burden of proof on this issue and the \"plaintiff always must be given the opportunity to demonstrate that the government's asserted justification is simply a pretext.\"  Id. Among the important hurdles for defendants is a showing that the challenged action was \"connected with [their] previously announced goals....\"  Id. at 1221-22</p>\n        <p>As the district court did not reach the instant claim, we do not address it at this time.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
