STAHL, Circuit Judge.  In the late 1980s, Dr. Marjorie\r\nMcMillan, head of the radiology department for the\r\nMassachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\nAnimals (\"MSPCA\"), learned that she was being paid less than\r\nthe male heads of the organization's other departments. \r\nDefendants MSPCA and Dr. Gus Thornton now appeal the district\r\ncourt's denial of their motion to set aside verdicts in Dr.\r\nMcMillan's favor on her various pay discrimination claims. \r\nThey also appeal as excessive the jury's award of\r\ncompensatory and punitive damages, and the district court's\r\naward of attorney's fees.  Dr. McMillan cross-appeals the\r\ncourt's grant of judgment as a matter of law on her tortious\r\ninterference with contractual relations claim against\r\ndefendant Dr. Paul Gambardella, and its grant of summary\r\njudgment on her contract claims against the MSPCA and on her\r\nretaliation claim against all three defendants.  We affirm\r\nthe district court's ruling on the pay discrimination,\r\ntortious interference, contract, and retaliation claims, and,\r\nin part, the jury's compensatory damages verdict; reverse the\r\naward of punitive damages and compensatory damages\r\nrepresenting lost benefits; and vacate the award of\r\nattorney's fees with directions that it be recalculated after\r\nremand.\r\n                               I.\r\n            BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\r\n    We begin with an overview of general facts and prior\r\nproceedings, and leave more detailed recitations to the\r\n                appropriate contexts.\r\n  Defendant MSPCA is a charitable, non-profit organization that\r\ncombats cruelty to animals through educational programs and\r\nveterinary services.  It operates Angell Memorial Animal\r\nHospital (\"Angell\"), whose staff, during the relevant time\r\n period, totalled more than 200 employees, including\r\nveterinarians, interns, residents in post-graduate veterinary\r\ntraining, and technical and support staff.  Defendant Dr. Gus\r\nThornton began working at Angell in 1957, and was its chief\r\nof staff from 1966 until 1989, at which time he became\r\npresident of the MSPCA.  Defendant Dr. Paul Gambardella\r\nworked as a staff surgeon at Angell from 1975 until 1984, and\r\nas the interim director of surgery from 1984 until 1989, when\r\n      Dr. Thornton appointed him chief of staff.\r\n  Plaintiff Dr. Marjorie McMillan was first employed by Angell\r\nin 1969 and thereafter was employed in various capacities\r\nuntil she left in 1977 to work in private practice.  She\r\nreturned in 1981 as the director of the radiology department,\r\nemployed part time.  She left Angell again in 1984 to spend\r\n  one year completing coursework necessary for board\r\ncertification and returned to Angell in 1985, again as\r\ndirector of radiology on a part-time schedule.  From 1987\r\nuntil 1991, she worked full time as head of radiology.  In\r\naddition, from 1981 to 1991, she worked approximately seven\r\nhours each week at Windhover Bird Clinic (\"Windhover\"), a\r\npart-time private avian practice that she had established in\r\n               Walpole, Massachusetts.\r\n  Until 1988, Angell had seven veterinary departments: clinics,\r\ncardiology, intensive care, clinical pathology, pathology,\r\nsurgery, and radiology.  All of the departments were headed\r\nby veterinarians, who, in addition to fulfilling their\r\nclinical duties, also served as administrative directors of\r\ntheir departments.  During this time, Dr. Thornton was\r\nresponsible for negotiating veterinarians' initial salaries\r\nand for setting discretionary annual increases from a fixed\r\namount of funds.  Although the department directors were\r\nresponsible for such tasks as purchasing equipment, training\r\ninterns and residents, scheduling, and making budget and\r\ncompensation recommendations to Dr. Thornton, all of the\r\nstaff reported to Dr. Thornton rather than to the individual\r\n                      directors.\r\n  In 1985 Dr. Thornton initiated a plan to restructure Angell's\r\nmanagement, giving to the department directors greater\r\nresponsibility, including the authority to make hiring,\r\nfiring, compensation, and discipline decisions.  As part of\r\nthe reorganization, Dr. Thornton in 1988 consolidated\r\nAngell's seven departments into four departments: radiology,\r\n          medicine, surgery, and pathology.\r\n  Dr. McMillan did not know the salaries of other veterinarians\r\nemployed by Angell until 1987, when she learned that the\r\nsalary of a newly-hired radiologist was $38,000.  Dr.\r\nMcMillan, whose salary at that time was $41,000, consulted\r\nDr. Thornton and requested a raise so that her compensation\r\nwould be comparable to that of the other department heads. \r\nDr. Thornton eventually offered Dr. McMillan a raise to\r\n$47,000, which she did not accept because she had been\r\noffered a $50,000 salary for a non-administrative veterinary\r\nposition at Tufts University Veterinary School.  Dr. Thornton\r\nthen agreed to adjust Dr. McMillan's salary to $51,000,\r\n              effective in January 1988.\r\n  In 1989, Dr. McMillan discovered the disparity between her\r\nsalary and that of the other department heads at Angell when\r\na newspaper published a letter about the MSPCA that listed\r\nthe various salaries.  At the time, her salary was $58,000;\r\nher male counterparts in surgery, pathology, and medicine, by\r\ncontrast, were earning $73,000, $80,244, and $73,199,\r\nrespectively.  On the basis of the salary disparity, Dr.\r\nMcMillan filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission\r\n               Against Discrimination.\r\n   Also in 1989, Dr. Gambardella, who became chief of staff\r\nupon Dr. Thornton's accession to the MSPCA presidency, set\r\nout to reevaluate and to improve the level of department\r\nheads' compensation.  He began by creating job descriptions\r\nfor each of the department heads in which the list of duties\r\nfor the head of radiology was substantially the same as those\r\nfor the other department head positions.  He also consulted a\r\nstudy of the salaries at another major animal hospital and an\r\ninformal market survey, on the basis of which he tentatively\r\nsuggested to Kathleen Collins, Angell's human resources\r\ndirector, that the heads of radiology and surgery receive\r\n$88,000, the head of medicine, $90,000, and the head of\r\npathology, $95,000.  Collins then undertook an analysis of\r\nthe department head jobs in order to \"rationalize\" the\r\nMSPCA's salary structure, giving a range of points in a\r\nnumber of categories of responsibility.  On the basis of the\r\npoint totals, she determined an appropriate salary for each\r\nof the department heads.  On completion of the analysis, in\r\n1990, Dr. McMillan received a raise from $58,295 to $72,000,\r\nwhich was substantially larger than that received by any of\r\nthe other department heads.  \r\n    Also in 1990, Dr. McMillan entered into negotiations with\r\nAngell over the status of Windhover.  Dr. McMillan suggested\r\nthat Angell acquire her practice or, alternatively, that it\r\nrent her space so that she could carry on her bird practice\r\nthere or that it pay her a separate, additional amount for\r\nher treatment of Angell's avian patients.  When the\r\nnegotiations came to an impasse, Dr. McMillan refused to\r\ncontinue to treat birds at Angell, a duty to which she had\r\nbeen devoting approximately six hours per week.\r\n    In 1991, Dr. Gambardella began to receive complaints from\r\nveterinarians -- other department heads and members of the\r\nsurgery staff, in particular -- that Dr. McMillan was\r\nuncooperative and had created an atmosphere of animosity and\r\ninflexibility in the radiology department.  On November 21,\r\n1991, Dr. Gambardella summoned Dr. McMillan as she was\r\npreparing to perform a procedure on an anesthetized dog,\r\nfired her, gave her fifteen minutes to gather her belongings,\r\nand had her escorted out of the hospital.  She was told not\r\nto return and was thereafter excluded from the premises. \r\nAlthough Angell had adopted in March 1990 a discipline policy\r\ndirected at the correction of inappropriate behavior and\r\nretention of employees whenever possible, Dr. McMillan was\r\ngiven no advance warning of her termination.\r\n    On May 21, 1992, Dr. McMillan sued the MSPCA, Dr. Thornton,\r\nand Dr. Gambardella, alleging pay discrimination in violation\r\nof Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-1; the Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\"),\r\n29 U.S.C.  206; and the Massachusetts anti-discrimination\r\nstatute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, and Equal Rights Act,\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93,  102.  The complaint also alleged\r\nretaliation in violation of Title VII, the EPA, and Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 151B and ch. 272,  92A and 98; breach of\r\ncontract and negligent performance of contractual duties\r\nagainst the MSPCA; and tortious interference with contractual\r\nrelations against Dr. Thornton and Dr. Gambardella.  On March\r\n17, 1995, the district court awarded the MSPCA summary\r\njudgment on Dr. McMillan's claims for pay discrimination\r\nunder Title VII and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93,  102,\r\nretaliation under state and federal law, breach of contract\r\nand negligent performance of contractual duties, and tortious\r\ninterference with contractual relations against Dr. Thornton. \r\nThe court also held that damages against the MSPCA were\r\nlimited to $20,000, pursuant to the Massachusetts charitable\r\nimmunity law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231,  85K.  The court\r\nlater held that chapter 231 did not apply and granted Dr.\r\nMcMillan's motion for reconsideration of the limitation on\r\ndamages.\r\n    In December 1995, plaintiff tried to a jury the remaining\r\ncounts: pay discrimination in violation of the EPA against\r\nthe MSPCA and in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B\r\nagainst the MSPCA and Dr. Thornton, and tortious interference\r\nwith contractual relations against Dr. Gambardella.  The jury\r\nfound in her favor on all counts.  On Dr. McMillan's pay\r\ndiscrimination claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, the jury\r\nawarded $183,784.50 as back pay accrued from 1985 through\r\n1991, to which it added $178,915 for interest accrued from\r\n1985.  On her tortious interference claim against Dr.\r\nGambardella, it awarded $197,550 as back pay, adding\r\n$84,846.50 as interest and $99,375.23 as front pay.  Finally,\r\nthe jury assessed punitive damages against Dr. Thornton and\r\nthe MSPCA in the amount of $306,912.50.  On November 12,\r\n1996, the court awarded Dr. McMillan $447,928.81 in\r\nattorney's fees and $18,889 in costs.  On the same day, the\r\ntrial court set aside the jury verdict on the tortious\r\ninterference claim against Dr. Gambardella but declined to\r\nset aside or grant a new trial on the pay discrimination\r\nverdict or award of back pay and punitive damages.  This\r\nappeal and cross-appeal followed.\r\n                          II.\r\n                       DISCUSSION\r\n                 A.  Pay Discrimination\r\n  The MSPCA and Dr. Thornton contend that the trial court erred\r\nby denying their Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion for judgment as\r\na matter of law, thereby ruling that there was sufficient\r\n   evidence for a reasonable jury to find that they\r\nintentionally discriminated against Dr. McMillan, on the\r\nbasis of her sex, in setting her salary between 1985 and\r\n1991.  They first argue that the evidence was insufficient to\r\n    show that Dr. McMillan's skills, efforts, and\r\nresponsibilities as a radiologist and department head were\r\nsubstantially similar to those of the male department heads.   \r\nThe remainder of their argument addresses the issue of\r\npretext.  Focusing on evidentiary questions, defendants\r\ncontend that the trial court erred by admitting Dr.\r\nGambardella's preliminary suggestions about appropriate\r\ndepartment head salaries, and sporadic comments derogatory to\r\nwomen made by Dr. Thornton, as evidence that the reasons\r\nprovided by Dr. Thornton for the pay disparity were\r\npretextual.  They further assert that there was insufficient\r\nevidence that Dr. Thornton's stated reasons for his\r\ndeterminations of base salaries and annual salary increases\r\nwere pretextual.  Specifically, they contend that a\r\nstatistical analysis used to show pay differentials between\r\nmales and females at the MSPCA could not support the verdict,\r\nand that Dr. Thornton's \"stray remarks\" were insufficient to\r\nexpose as pretextual his purported method of establishing and\r\nraising salaries.  \r\n    Defendants challenge the pay discrimination verdicts under\r\nboth state and federal discrimination law.  To establish a\r\nprima facie case of sex discrimination based on salary\r\ndisparity under the federal Equal Pay Act, a plaintiff must\r\nshow that her employer was subject to the Act, and that she\r\nwas paid less than her male counterparts who were performing\r\nwork requiring substantially equal skill, effort, and\r\nresponsibility under similar working conditions.  Defendants\r\nmust then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\r\npay disparity can be explained by a legitimate factor such as\r\nseniority or performance.  See Corning Glass Works v.\r\nBrennan, 417 U.S. 188, 195-96 (1974); Timmer v. Michigan\r\nDep't of Commerce, 104 F.3d 833, 843 (6th Cir. 1997).  Thus,\r\nin cases brought under the Equal Pay Act, the plaintiff need\r\nnot show that the defendant was motivated by a discriminatory\r\nanimus, as required in cases governed by the McDonnell-\r\nBurdine burden shifting framework.\r\n    Under Massachusetts law, after a plaintiff presents her prima\r\nfacie case, the requirements of which are the same as under\r\nfederal law, see, e.g., Petsch-Schmid v. Boston Edison Co.,\r\n914 F. Supp. 697, 706-07 (D. Mass. 1996), there is a\r\nrebuttable presumption of intentional discrimination, seeBlare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., 419 Mass.\r\n437, 441 (1995). The defendant then has the burden of\r\nproducing evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason\r\nfor the pay disparity.  See id. at 441-42.  After the\r\ndefendant has satisfied this burden, the presumption of\r\nintentional discrimination disappears, see id. at 442, and\r\nplaintiff assumes the burden of proving, by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence, that the defendant's stated reasons for the\r\npay disparity were not the real reasons, see id. at 444-45.  \r\n    We review de novo a trial court's decision to deny or to\r\ngrant a defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law. \r\nSee Morrison v. Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc., 108 F.3d 429,\r\n436 (1st Cir. 1997).  The standard of review for motions for\r\njudgment as a matter of law requires us to view the evidence\r\n\"in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, drawing\r\nall reasonable inferences in its favor.\"  Id.  We will not\r\nset aside a jury verdict as a matter of law unless there was\r\nonly one conclusion the jury could have reached.  See Conwayv. Electro Switch Corp., 825 F.2d 593, 598 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n    1.  Prima Facie Case\r\n    We agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could\r\nhave found that Dr. McMillan had satisfied her burden of\r\nestablishing a prima facie case of pay discrimination. \r\nContrary to defendants' assertion that plaintiff failed to\r\noffer evidence comparing the skill, effort, and\r\nresponsibilities of her position as radiology department head\r\nwith that of the other department heads, plaintiff proffered\r\ntestimony that the radiology department is comparable with\r\nthe other departments in all three respects.  In particular,\r\ntestimony from Dr. Neil Harpster, Angell's cardiology\r\ndepartment head from 1985 to 1988, and Dr. Allen Sisson, a\r\nstaff veterinarian, provided evidence both that the\r\nprocedures performed by Dr. McMillan in her job were among\r\nthe most technically difficult procedures performed by any\r\nveterinarian at Angell and that the hours Dr. McMillan spent\r\nat her job were comparable to those of the other department\r\nheads.  In addition, the evidence showed that Dr. McMillan\r\nsupervised more staff than did Dr. James Carpenter, the head\r\nof the pathology department, and that, in Kathleen Collins's\r\nanalysis of department head jobs in the late 1980s, radiology\r\nwas ranked equally with pathology and medicine in seven out\r\nof eight categories of responsibility.    Moreover, although\r\nthe job descriptions that Dr. Gambardella formulated in 1989,\r\nwithout more, are not dispositive, the fact that the job\r\nrequirements for all of the department heads were\r\nsubstantially the same is supportive of other evidence that\r\nthe department head positions required substantially equal\r\nskill, effort, and responsibility.  Finally, a market survey\r\npublished sometime in the first half of the 1980s and\r\nadmitted into evidence demonstrated that the average salaries\r\nof radiologists were comparable to those of other\r\nspecialists, indicating that radiology is not an\r\nintrinsically less demanding area of veterinary medicine. \r\nThe evidence was thus sufficient to support a finding that\r\nplaintiff had presented a prima facie case.\r\n    2.  Pretext\r\n  We turn next to the issue of pretext.    At trial, defendants\r\npresented several reasons to explain why Dr. McMillan was\r\npaid less than the other department heads.  Dr. Thornton\r\ntestified that, as chief of staff, he set a department head's\r\ncompensation by conducting an informal survey of what\r\nsimilarly situated veterinarians were being paid at other\r\ninstitutions and by negotiating compensation with the\r\nprospective department head.  He stated that, in general,\r\nradiologists commanded lower compensation than did\r\nveterinarians in other specialties.  He further testified\r\nthat, to determine yearly percentage salary increases, he\r\nevaluated each department head's productivity and\r\nresponsibilities.  Dr. Thornton stated that, in his view, the\r\nhead of medicine, Dr. Michael Bernstein, had significantly\r\nmore responsibilities, including the oversight of more staff,\r\nthan did Dr. McMillan as head of radiology.  Dr. Thornton\r\nlikewise claimed that the head of pathology, Dr. Carpenter,\r\nhad more responsibilities than did Dr. McMillan because he\r\nsupervised more staff, had a larger budget, and was\r\nnationally known, and because pathology, unlike radiology,\r\nincorporated several disciplines such as clinical and\r\nanatomic pathology.  The head of surgery, Dr. Gambardella at\r\nthe time, merited greater compensation in Dr. Thornton's view\r\nbecause he was accountable for the budget and staff hiring\r\nand discipline for the department, supervised more staff, and\r\nhad significant responsibility for patient care and client\r\ncontact.\r\n    Defendants make two primary arguments regarding the pretext\r\nprong of plaintiff's pay discrimination claim.  First, they\r\nargue that the jury's findings that Dr. Thornton's\r\nexplanations were pretextual are tainted because the district\r\ncourt improperly admitted into evidence (1) Dr. Gambardella's\r\npreliminary suggestions in 1989 regarding salary increases as\r\nproof of Dr. Thornton's state of mind throughout the time\r\nperiod that he set Dr. McMillan's salary and yearly\r\nincreases, and (2) evidence of sporadic distasteful remarks\r\nthat Dr. Thornton made to women colleagues in 1979 and 1989. \r\nSecond, defendants assert, in essence, that, even taking into\r\naccount all of the evidence actually admitted, plaintiff\r\nfailed to prove, as required under Massachusetts law, that\r\nDr. Thornton's stated procedures for setting salaries were\r\npretextual.\r\n    We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See United States v. Young, 105 F.2d 1, 8 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  A judge should not exclude relevant evidence,\r\nunless its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403.  \"Only\r\nrarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances --\r\nwill we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a\r\ndistrict court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative\r\nweighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"  Freeman v.\r\nPackage Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\n    The court's admission of testimony about Dr. Gambardella's\r\n1989 suggestions regarding salary increases was not an abuse\r\nof its discretion.  One of Dr. Thornton's stated reasons for\r\nsetting salaries at Angell as he did during the period from\r\n1985 to 1989 was that radiologists commanded lower salaries\r\non the market than did veterinarians in other specialties. \r\nThe issue was whether this reason was pretextual.  The\r\ninformal 1989 survey on which Dr. Gambardella based his\r\nsuggestions showed relative parity among salaries of\r\nradiologists and other specialists.  Accordingly, Dr.\r\nGambardella's suggestions were probative of whether radiology\r\nis intrinsically a less-valued veterinary specialty and,\r\ntherefore, of whether Dr. Thornton's stated reason was, in\r\nfact, the real reason.  They are probative also of Dr.\r\nThornton's credibility because they were based on what\r\nveterinarians in various specialties were worth in the\r\nmarket, the very factor on which Dr. Thornton purported to\r\nrely in setting salaries at Angell.  Further, although\r\ndefendants contend that, regardless of the status of\r\nradiology at other institutions, the radiology department at\r\nAngell was not equal to Angell's other departments with\r\nregard to the responsibilities required of its head, we think\r\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\ndetermining that Dr. Gambardella's testimony regarding salary\r\nparity at other institutions was not unfairly prejudicial to\r\ndefendants in their attempt to make this point.\r\n    Whether the court's admission into evidence of the so-called\r\nstray remarks was proper presents a more difficult question. \r\nThere is, of course, no question that Dr. Thornton's\r\nmotivation in paying Dr. McMillan less than the other\r\ndepartment heads was a material issue in the case.  We note\r\ninitially that stray remarks may properly constitute evidence\r\nof discriminatory intent for the jury to consider in\r\ncombination with other evidence.  See Bevan v. Honeywell,\r\nInc., 118 F.3d 603, 610 (8th Cir. 1997); O'Connor v. DePaul\r\nUniv., 123 F.3d 665, 671-72 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"'[S]tray\r\nremarks' -- made by the decisionmaker but not related to the\r\ndisputed employment action -- may be relevant to the question\r\nof pretext . . . .\").  Yet even if the remarks are relevant\r\nfor the pretext inquiry, their probativeness is circumscribed\r\nif they were made in a situation temporally remote from the\r\ndate of the employment decision, see Armbruster v. Unisys\r\nCorp., 32 F.3d 768, 779 (3d Cir. 1994), or if they were not\r\nrelated to the employment decision in question or were made\r\nby nondecisionmakers, see, e.g., Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr\r\n&amp; Solis-Cohen, 983 F.2d 509, 545 (3d Cir. 1992) (\"Stray\r\nremarks by non-decisionmakers or by decisionmakers unrelated\r\nto the decision process are rarely given great weight . . .\r\n.\").\r\n    The allegations in this case are that, during his time at\r\nAngell, Dr. Thornton made various unprofessional remarks to\r\nwomen with whom he worked.  In 1979 or 1980, he talked to a\r\nlab technician about warming up a vial of medicine in her\r\nbrassiere.  Approximately ten years later, he made a remark\r\nto the MSPCA's lobbyist about her cleavage and then later\r\nasked whether, to stop bad publicity about the MSPCA by a\r\nparticular reporter, she had slept with the reporter. \r\nArguably, at least, these remarks may have been relevant and\r\nprobative as to Dr. Thornton's motivation in setting the\r\nsalaries of male and female department heads, in the sense\r\nthat they evince a derogatory attitude toward women.\r\n    However, not only did the remarks not involve the employment\r\ndecision at issue, they did not involve employment at all. \r\nFurther, at least one of the remarks was made several years\r\nbefore any dispute arose over the pay disparity between Dr.\r\nMcMillan and other department heads.  Such factors heighten\r\nthe remoteness of the remarks, arguably to the point at which\r\nthey are no more probative than they are prejudicial. \r\nNonetheless, the question we must address in determining\r\nadmissibility is not whether we agree with the district court\r\nbut, rather, whether the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion.  See Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., Inc., 43\r\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994).  We think that it did not. \r\nAlthough the comments were unrelated to Dr. McMillan's\r\nsituation, and although the remarks may, in the end, have\r\nfallen on the other side of the imprecise nexus/no-nexus\r\nboundary, the court's determination to admit the remarks for\r\nthe jury to consider with the other evidence was not so one-\r\nsided such that it did not act within its discretion.  \r\n    Defendants contend in addition that the district court erred\r\nby giving the jury an improper instruction on the relevance\r\nof Dr. Thornton's remarks.    They assert that the court both\r\nanalyzed and added to the evidence by equating Dr. Thornton's\r\nremarks with his attitude about the value of women when no\r\nevidentiary foundation supplied the nexus.  Further, they\r\nargue that the instruction misled the jury to believe that\r\nstray remarks alone were sufficient evidence of pretext.\r\n    Defendants' objections to the jury instructions were not\r\nclearly articulated at trial and, therefore, not properly\r\npreserved.    In such a situation, we review only for error\r\nresulting in a \"clear miscarriage of justice.\"  Transnational\r\nCorp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd., 920 F.2d 1066, 1069 (1st Cir.\r\n1990).\r\n    In reviewing jury instructions such as these, we focus\r\nprincipally on \"whether they tended to confuse or mislead the\r\njury on the controlling issues.\"  Service Merchandise Co.,\r\nInc. v. Boyd Corp., 722 F.2d 945, 950 (1st Cir. 1983).  In\r\nthis instance, we discern no problems with the judge's stray\r\nremarks instructions.  First, contrary to defendants'\r\nsuggestion, federal judges may comment on the evidence.  SeeLeshore v. County of Worcester, 945 F.2d 471, 474 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).  Second, in this case the judge merely made explicit\r\nwhat the jury might infer if it chose to credit the stray\r\nremarks.  This may be, as defendants assert, \"connect[ing]\r\nthe dots,\" but it is not a suggestion that a particular\r\nconclusion must be reached.  Moreover, the court made clear\r\nto the jury that it was equally plausible to regard the\r\nremarks as \"random and completely out of character,\" and thus\r\nto infer nothing at all about them.  Likewise, the\r\ninstructions in no way misled the jury to believe that the\r\nstray remarks might, alone, be sufficient to prove that\r\ndefendants' stated reasons for paying Dr. McMillan less were\r\nmere pretext.  That the jury \"might decide that a given\r\nremark is evidence of a discriminatory mindset\" seems to us\r\nto be nothing other than a restatement of why such evidence\r\nis presented to the jury in the first place; it implies\r\nnothing about how much or how little of such evidence is\r\nsufficient for the jury to find in the plaintiff's favor.  In\r\nany event, the instructions did not result in a \"clear\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\"\r\n    As to the sufficiency of the evidence of pretext, defendants\r\nattack the analysis of plaintiff's statistical expert, Dr.\r\nArlene Ash.  They argue that the analysis cannot support the\r\njury verdict because it did not incorporate variables that\r\nDr. Thornton argued he applied when he set initial salaries\r\nand determined annual incremental increases.  They also\r\ncontend that it was based on a legally insufficient sample\r\nsize.\r\n    We turn first to the argument that Dr. Ash's analysis ignored\r\nimportant factors.  Defendants assert that Dr. Ash's model\r\nshould have included such variables as market factors,\r\nnegotiations, veterinary experience, performance evaluations,\r\nproductivity, and veterinarians' overall contribution to the\r\nhospital.  As a preliminary matter we note that, although a\r\nfailure to include particular variables in a regression\r\nanalysis may diminish the probativeness of the analysis, \"it\r\ncan hardly be said, absent some other infirmity, that an\r\nanalysis which accounts for the major factors . . . 'must be\r\nconsidered unacceptable as evidence of discrimination.'\"  SeeBazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 400 (1986).  Dr. Ash\r\nincorporated into the analysis such legitimate variables as\r\nveterinarians' seniority at Angell, department head status,\r\nboard-approved specialization, area of specialization, and\r\ndepartmental budget size.  Although the models she developed\r\nmay not have included every relevant variable, her testimony\r\nshows solid reasoning in her determinations to exclude\r\ncertain variables that the defendants argued should have been\r\nincluded.  We therefore reject this argument.\r\n    Defendants further assert that Dr. Ash's analysis was\r\neffectively based on an insufficient sample size because Dr.\r\nAsh used factors which could apply only to department heads. \r\nThis objection is opaque and unpersuasive.  Dr. Ash's choice\r\nof sample, which was the approximately forty-six\r\nveterinarians who worked at Angell from 1981 to 1991, was not\r\nfatally deficient.  The analysis made a distinction between\r\nthose veterinarians who were department heads and those who\r\nwere not.  Only one variable -- budget size -- was specific\r\nto department head status, and it was not applied to the\r\nveterinarians who were not department heads.\r\n    Defendants continue, however, arguing that statistical\r\nevidence \"should rarely be accorded any weight\" in disparate\r\ntreatment cases.  We agree that in a disparate treatment\r\ncase, such as this one, the necessary focus on the treatment\r\nof a particular individual appears incongruous with an\r\nanalysis that necessarily involves numerous individuals and\r\nthat, therefore, is intuitively more probative in the\r\ndisparate impact context.  See LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co.,\r\n6 F.3d 836, 848 (1st Cir. 1993); Cumpiano v. Banco Santander\r\nP.R., 902 F.2d 148, 156 (1st Cir. 1990).  Nonetheless, such\r\nanalyses are admissible even in disparate treatment cases\r\nunless they are \"so incomplete as to be inadmissible as\r\nirrelevant.\"    See Bazemore, 478 U.S. at 400 n.10.  Further,\r\nwe have held that \"[s]tatistical evidence is permissible on\r\nthe issue of pretext in a disparate treatment case since\r\n'statistics as to . . . employment policy and practice may be\r\nhelpful to a determination of whether [the employer's\r\nconduct] conformed to a general pattern of discrimination.'\" \r\nFreeman, 865 F.2d at 1342 (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\r\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 805 (1973)).  We agree with the court\r\nbelow that, in a case such as this, \"the jury could have\r\nfound a plausible connection between Dr. Thornton's treatment\r\nof women generally at Angell and his treatment of Dr.\r\nMcMillan in particular.\"\r\n    Leaving aside whether Dr. Ash's analysis was watertight in\r\nall respects, we think it important to note that Dr. Ash's\r\ntestimony was focused, perceptive, and understandably\r\ncompelling to the jury.  Reviewing the record, it is apparent\r\nto us that, whatever \"infirmities\" existed in her analysis,\r\nnone was so substantive that no reasonable jury could have\r\nrelied on it, along with the other evidence, in reaching a\r\nverdict.  Rather, if Dr. Ash's analysis omitted what\r\ndefendants argue are important variables, or was deficient in\r\nother respects, and thereby did not reflect whether Dr.\r\nThornton's salary decisions were based at least in part on\r\ngender, it was up to defendants to exploit and discredit the\r\nanalysis during cross examination.  Furthermore, although the\r\nconflicting expert testimony they provided placed Dr. Ash's\r\nanalysis into question, the jury was free to disregard that\r\ntestimony and place credence in that of Dr. Ash.  Indeed, as\r\nthe district court noted, although the defendants' expert,\r\nDr. Herbert Weisberg, disputed Dr. Ash's finding of a pattern\r\nof discrimination, he admitted that her model had produced\r\nstatistically significant results.  \r\n    In arguing that plaintiff did not show evidence of pretext,\r\nDefendants' position seems to be that, aside from evidence of\r\nDr. Thornton's stray remarks and Dr. Ash's statistical\r\nanalysis, there remains no basis on which the jury might\r\nreasonably have found pretext under Massachusetts law and pay\r\ndiscrimination under the EPA.  But in addition to the\r\nstatistical analysis, plaintiff offered other evidence,\r\nwhich, in combination with the statistical evidence, was\r\nsufficient to support a finding of pretext.  Although\r\ndefendants posited that the radiology department was smaller\r\nthan the other departments, plaintiff presented evidence\r\nthat, in fact, cardiology was the smallest department, with\r\nonly two employees under the supervision of the department\r\nhead.  The record reveals that the issue of seniority\r\nprovided an additional basis for a jury finding of pretext. \r\nDr. Thornton testified that both the number of years a\r\nveterinarian had been in practice and his or her seniority at\r\nAngell were factors he weighed in setting initial salaries\r\nfor a particular position.  And, indeed, it appears from the\r\nevidence that he did consider seniority in setting the\r\nsalaries of Dr. Gambardella when he became head of surgery\r\nand of Dr. Michael Aronsohn when he succeeded Dr. Gambardella\r\nin that position.  Dr. Thornton's testimony indicates,\r\nhowever, that he ignored seniority and years in practice in\r\nthe case of Dr. McMillan, treating her as a new hire when she\r\nreturned to Angell in 1985.    The testimony shows that, even\r\nthough Dr. McMillan in 1985 had spent two and a half years as\r\nradiology department director (albeit part time) and five\r\nyears at Angell in various capacities, Dr. Thornton did not\r\nconsider that experience in setting her salary.  Rather, he\r\ntestified that he based her salary on a survey that\r\nrecommended $29,000 to $50,000 for the least experienced\r\nradiologists, and that, in fact, he paid her $35,000 simply\r\nbecause he could.  But $35,000 was essentially the same\r\nsalary Dr. McMillan had been earning in 1983, before she\r\nspent a year away from Angell.    As for annual percentage\r\nincreases of salaries, although Dr. Thornton testified that\r\nhe based his decisions on subjective factors such as\r\nproductivity, contribution to the hospital, and interaction\r\nwith other employees, he also testified that he did not\r\nsystematically quantify contributions and interaction and\r\nthat he did not evaluate the radiology department on the\r\nbasis of productivity.  Finally, testimony from Dr. Bernstein\r\nand Dr. Aronsohn placed into question Dr. Thornton's\r\nassertion that some department heads were so-called \"strong\r\ndepartment heads,\" and had more authority on that basis. \r\nThus, a reasonable jury could have found that Dr. Thornton's\r\nstated reason for his salary decisions was not true or, in\r\nother words, pretextual.\r\n    Accordingly, because we think that there was sufficient\r\nproperly admitted evidence for a jury to find that Dr.\r\nThornton's stated reasons for the pay disparity were\r\npretextual, we choose not to disturb the district court's\r\ndenial of judgment as a matter of law with regard to the pay\r\ndiscrimination claims based on Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B and\r\non the Equal Pay Act.  \r\nB.  Damages\r\n    Defendants present a variety of arguments regarding\r\ncalculation of damages, most of which need not detain us\r\nlong.  At the outset, we note that we do not disturb a jury's\r\naward of damages unless it \"exceed[s] any rational appraisal\r\nor estimate\" of what the damages should be.  Kolb v.\r\nGoldring, Inc., 694 F.2d 869, 871 (1st Cir. 1982) (internal\r\ncitation omitted).\r\n    Defendants argue that Dr. McMillan's back pay damages award\r\nshould be set aside or reduced because the award was\r\nexcessive and unsupported by the evidence.  They contend that\r\nthe jury's award of back pay based on an average of the\r\nsalaries of the male department heads between 1985 and 1991\r\nhas no legal basis.  We disagree.  As Dr. McMillan rightly\r\npoints out, the cases defendants rely on to support their\r\nargument, Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 954\r\n(1st Cir. 1995) and E.E.O.C. v. Liggett &amp; Myers, Inc., 690\r\nF.2d 1072, 1075 (4th Cir. 1982), are inapplicable in this\r\nsituation, and, if anything, serve to support rather than to\r\ndiscredit the averaging method.  In Liggett &amp; Myers, the\r\ncourt rejected a calculation of back pay based on the average\r\nsalary in favor of a calculation based on the salary of the\r\nhighest paid employee comparator.  See 690 F.2d at 1074. \r\nAlthough Scarfo holds that back pay should be calculated by\r\ncomparing the plaintiff's salary to that of \"arguably\r\nequivalent\" employees, it in no way indicates that averaging\r\nthe salaries of two or more such employees is inappropriate. \r\nSee 54 F.3d at 954.  Here, averaging the salaries of the male\r\ndepartment heads was a rational approach.  In fact, in this\r\ncontext, a more appropriate method has not been proposed.  We\r\nthus find that the method the jury apparently used to\r\ndetermine the amount of the back pay award was not\r\ninappropriate.\r\n    Defendants next assert that Dr. McMillan is not entitled to\r\nrecovery, as part of her back pay award, for \"lost benefits\"\r\n-- health insurance, life insurance, and retirement\r\ncontributions -- because she did not prove that she had lost\r\nthem.  Plaintiff testified that she had been told that such\r\nbenefits constituted twenty-one percent of an employee's\r\nsalary and that, in her capacity as department head, she\r\nbudgeted twenty-one percent of her supervisees' salaries as\r\nbenefits.  On this basis, the jury awarded Dr. McMillan an\r\nadditional twenty-one percent of her back pay award to\r\nrepresent the value of the lost benefits.\r\n    Lost benefits are recoverable only if the plaintiff has\r\noffered evidence of out-of-pocket expenses for the same\r\nbenefits.  See Kossman v. Calumet County, 800 F.2d 697, 703-\r\n04 (7th Cir. 1986) (holding that, to recover damages\r\nrepresenting benefits, a plaintiff must show that she\r\nactually incurred insurance or medical care expenses); Taylorv. Central Pa. Drug &amp; Alcohol Servs. Corp., 890 F. Supp. 360,\r\n372 (M.D. Pa. 1995); Berndt v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Sales,\r\nInc., 604 F. Supp. 962, 965 (E.D. Pa. 1985).  In this case,\r\neven if the budgeted value of benefits corresponding to\r\nplaintiff's salary had been less than the budgeted value of\r\nbenefits corresponding to the salaries of the other\r\ndepartment heads, plaintiff presented no evidence that she\r\nincurred insurance expenses.  In addition, she presented no\r\nevidence that any employer-contributed retirement benefits\r\nwere tied to the amount of her salary.  Further, that\r\nbenefits may have amounted to twenty-one percent of her\r\nsupervisees' salaries does not mean that benefits constituted\r\nan equal percentage of higher salaries.  Indeed, it would be\r\nlogical to expect that employer insurance contributions at\r\nall salary levels were substantially the same and that,\r\ntherefore, benefits were a considerably lower percentage of\r\nhigher salaries.  Because there was no competent evidence\r\nfrom which a reasonable jury could conclude that Dr. McMillan\r\nsuffered any loss in benefits as a result of her lower\r\nsalary, Dr. McMillan's back pay award should be accordingly\r\nreduced by the amount of the lost benefits award.\r\n    Defendants' third argument is that we should import the\r\nthree-year cap on back pay liability under the EPA, see 29\r\nU.S.C.  255, to Dr. McMillan's state back pay award under\r\nchapter 151B.  This argument is without merit.  No court\r\ndecisions impose such a cap under Massachusetts law, and\r\ndefendants present no rationale as to why state law should be\r\nthe same as federal law.  Further, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,\r\nas interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\r\n(\"SJC\"), mandates \"make-whole relief,\" which encompasses\r\ndamages which are \"the natural and probable consequences of\r\nthe illegal conduct.\"  Conway v. Electro Switch Corp., 402\r\nMass. 385, 388 (1988) (internal citation omitted).  Indeed,\r\nthe SJC has declined to follow federal precedent in order to\r\ninterpret chapter 151B more liberally than the federal courts\r\nhave interpreted parallel federal law provisions.  See Lynn\r\nTeachers Union, Local 1037 v. Massachusetts Comm'n Against\r\nDiscrimination, 406 Mass. 515, 521 n.7 (1990).  We thus\r\ndecline to adopt defendants' suggestion.\r\n    Fourth, defendants contend that Dr. McMillan's punitive\r\ndamages award against the MSPCA on her pay discrimination\r\nclaim should be set aside, or, alternatively, that a new\r\ntrial should be granted on the issue.  They challenge the\r\npunitive damages award on the basis that it was unwarranted,\r\nexcessive, and obtained as a result of irrelevant testimony\r\nabout Dr. Gambardella's termination of Dr. McMillan.  We\r\nagree with defendants that the award was unwarranted and\r\nexcessive.\r\n    In a lawsuit such as this one, in which state law provides\r\nthe basis of decision, \"the propriety of an award of punitive\r\ndamages for the conduct in question, and the factors the jury\r\nmay consider in determining their amount, are questions of\r\nstate law.\"  Browning-Ferris Ind. v. Kelco Disposal, 492 U.S.\r\n257, 278 (1988).  In reviewing an award of punitive damages,\r\nour role is to determine whether the district court abused\r\nits discretion in determining that the jury's award of\r\npunitive damages was within the confines of state law and\r\nthat defendants are not entitled to a new trial or\r\nremittitur.  See id. at 279.  Although juries have wide\r\ndiscretion in determining the amount of punitive damages, and\r\nthe trial court has broad discretion to affirm the jury's\r\naward of damages, see Fishman v. Clancy, 763 F.2d 485, 489-90\r\n(1st Cir. 1985), appeals courts should reduce or set aside\r\nawards that are \"grossly excessive\" or \"shocking to the\r\nconscience,\" id. at 489 (citing LaForest v. Autoridad de Las\r\nFuentes Fluviales De P.R., 536 F.2d 443, 447 (1st Cir.\r\n1976)).\r\n    The jury in this case assessed punitive damages under chapter\r\n151B against the MSPCA in the amount of $135,662.50 and\r\nagainst Dr. Thornton in the amount of $171,250.  Although the\r\nstatute authorizes punitive damages, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n151B,  9, it does not specify when they should be awarded. \r\nHowever, other punitive damages provisions in Massachusetts\r\nlaw provide that such damages shall apply only on a finding\r\nthat defendants' conduct was wilful, wanton, or reckless,\r\nsee, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 229,  2, and the SJC has\r\nfurther refined the criteria, holding that punitive damages\r\nare warranted \"where a defendant's conduct warrants\r\ncondemnation and deterrence,\" Bain v. City of Springfield,\r\n424 Mass. 758, 767 (1997).\r\n    Dr. McMillan contends that, because the jury found\r\nintentional discrimination, she was eligible for an award of\r\npunitive damages if the jury so decided in its discretion. \r\nWe observe, however, that nowhere does Massachusetts law\r\nstate that a finding of intentional discrimination\r\nnecessarily justifies an award of punitive damages.  This\r\naccords with the logic that, even in situations involving\r\nintentional misconduct, compensatory damages may provide\r\nsufficient punishment and deterrence.  See Smith v. Wade, 461\r\nU.S. 30, 52 (1983); see also Rowlett v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,\r\n832 F.2d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that, even though\r\na jurisdiction may authorize punitive damages in cases\r\nrequiring proof of intentional wrongdoing, \"[t]hat does not\r\nmean that punitive damages are appropriate in every [such]\r\ncase\").\r\n    The district court's jury instructions on punitive damages\r\nwere that the jury could award punitive damages if it found\r\ndefendants' conduct to have been \"egregious and beyond the\r\npale of tolerable,\" and that such damages are \"intended to\r\npunish the defendants as a warning, both to them and other\r\nlike-minded individuals, that society will not tolerate\r\ngrievous discriminatory behavior.\"  The district judge\r\nfurther stated that \"[a]ny sum you award as punitive damages\r\nshould be commensurate with your own conscience, the\r\noutrageousness of the conduct that you intend to punish, and\r\nthe character of the MSPCA as both an employer and as a\r\nnonprofit enterprise.\"  As these instructions imply, above\r\nthe inquiry for finding intent, the jury had to conduct a\r\nsecond inquiry to determine whether defendants' intentional\r\nconduct was egregious enough for an award of punitive\r\ndamages.  Cf. Smith, 461 U.S. at 52 (observing that whether\r\npunitive damages are appropriate turns on whether the\r\ntortfeasor's conduct \"is of the sort that calls for\r\ndeterrence and punishment over and above that provided by\r\ncompensatory awards\").  It follows, then, that just as we may\r\nreview the record to determine whether a reasonable jury\r\ncould have found that the defendants intentionally\r\ndiscriminated against Dr. McMillan, we may also review the\r\nrecord to determine whether a reasonable jury could have\r\nfound defendants' conduct sufficiently worthy of condemnation\r\nand deterrence to justify exemplary damages.\r\n    Although we affirm the jury's finding of discrimination, we\r\ncannot say, on the basis of the record before us, that Dr.\r\nThornton's and the MSPCA's intentional misconduct calls for\r\npunishment and deterrence beyond that secured by the\r\ncompensatory award.  Determining what conduct rises to the\r\nlevel at which an award of punitive damages is appropriate is\r\na difficult task, but the evidence shows that the actions at\r\nissue in this case do not.  We therefore hold that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in upholding the award\r\nof punitive damages, and that the award of punitive damages\r\nin this case constitutes a grossly excessive award of damages\r\nthat shocks the conscience.  \r\n    Fifth, defendants argue that the MSPCA's liability is limited\r\nto $20,000 by a damages cap for charitable organizations\r\nunder the Massachusetts charitable immunity law, which\r\nprovides that liability for any \"cause of action based on\r\ntort brought against a [charitable] corporation\" shall not\r\nexceed $20,000 exclusive of interest and costs.  See Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 231,  85K.  Although this statute applies to\r\nnegligent, reckless, and intentional torts in the employment\r\ncontext, see St. Clair v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 25 Mass.\r\nApp. Ct. 662, 665-66 (1988), it has been unclear whether a\r\nclaim under chapter 151B is a \"cause of action based on tort\"\r\nand thus subject to the $20,000 limitation.  We conclude that\r\nit is not.\r\n    Defendants and plaintiff engage in extensive exercises of\r\ninterpretation to suggest the relevance of a variety of cases\r\nto this issue.  Ultimately, we agree with Dr. McMillan that\r\nLinkage Corp. v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 425 Mass. 1, 27\r\n(1997), provides the most guidance.  In that case, the SJC\r\nheld that the chapter 231, section 85K damages limitation\r\ndoes not apply to damages awarded under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n93A, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute, on the\r\nbasis that chapter 93A \"creates an independent statutory\r\nbasis of liability\" and \"forbid[s] conduct not previously\r\nunlawful under the common law of contract and tort or under\r\nany prior statute,\" id. (internal citation omitted).  Like\r\nchapter 93A, chapter 151B creates rights that did not exist\r\nunder the common law, see, e.g., Melley v. Gillette Corp., 19\r\nMass. App. Ct. 511, 512-13 (1985), aff'd, 397 Mass. 1004\r\n(1986); the causes of action to which it gives rise thus\r\ncannot properly be called causes of action in tort. \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the damages award to Dr. McMillan\r\npursuant to chapter 151B is not subject to the constraints of\r\nchapter 231.\r\n    Defendants next contend that the district court misapplied\r\nthe relevant legal standard when it awarded attorney's fees\r\nbecause it did not award the appropriate hourly rates for the\r\ndifferent types of services performed and instead allowed Dr.\r\nMcMillan's counsel to recover her standard hourly rate ($285\r\nper hour) for performing tasks appropriate to either a less\r\nexperienced lawyer or a secretary or paralegal.  We agree.\r\n    We have established that \"clerical or secretarial tasks ought\r\nnot to be billed at lawyers' rates, even if a lawyer performs\r\nthem.\"  Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 940 (1st Cir. 1992). \r\nThus, \"[t]ime spent on clerical or secretarial tasks by\r\nattorneys should be compensated at a rate commensurate with\r\nthe nature of the tasks.\"  Massachusetts Dep't of Pub. Healthv. School Comm. of Tewksbury, 841 F. Supp. 449, 460 (D. Mass.\r\n1993); see Deary v. City of Gloucester, 789 F. Supp. 61, 66\r\n(D. Mass. 1992), aff'd, 9 F.3d 191 (1st Cir. 1993).  We think\r\nthat it was an abuse of discretion to award the same rate for\r\nall tasks performed by Dr. McMillan's counsel, without regard\r\nto the nature of the tasks.  Accordingly, we remand this\r\nissue in order that the court may determine those tasks which\r\ncould have been adequately performed by a less-experienced\r\nlawyer or by a secretary or paralegal.  The compensation for\r\ntasks so designated should be reduced to an appropriate\r\nlevel.\r\n    Finally, defendants argue that the trial court erred by\r\ncomputing interest on the back pay award from the date on\r\nwhich the cause of action accrued, rather than from the date\r\nplaintiff filed her complaint.  This argument has no merit. \r\nAs the district court stated, \"the purpose of interest is to\r\ninsure that the present value of an award fully compensates a\r\nplaintiff for her losses.\"  Moreover, the SJC has held that\r\nan award of interest may be used to make an aggrieved party\r\nwhole in chapter 151B actions.  See Conway, 402 Mass. at 390\r\nn.7.  Here, an award of interest from the date Dr. McMillan\r\nwas paid less than her counterparts comports with these\r\nstandards.\r\nC.  Cross-Appeal\r\n    Plaintiff cross-appeals from the district court's grant of\r\njudgment as a matter of law in favor of defendants setting\r\naside the jury's finding that Dr. Gambardella had tortiously\r\ninterfered with Dr. McMillan's employment relationship with\r\nthe MSPCA.  She argues that she presented ample evidence\r\nduring the trial to show that Dr. Gambardella's actions\r\nleading up to and including her termination were based on \"an\r\nimproper motive, active animosity and spite.\"  We do not\r\nagree.\r\n    Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the\r\nplaintiff, see Morrison, 108 F.3d at 436, we conclude that\r\nthe evidence did not permit a reasonable jury to find for the\r\nplaintiff.  Under Massachusetts law, to make out the tort of\r\nintentional interference with a contractual relationship, a\r\nplaintiff must present evidence of \"actual malice\" or a\r\n\"spiteful, malignant purpose, unrelated to the legitimate\r\ncorporate interest.\"  Shea v. Emmanuel College, 425 Mass.\r\n761, 764 (1997) (quoting Wright v. Shriners Hosp. for\r\nCrippled Children, et al., 412 Mass. 469, 476 (1992)).  In\r\naddition, \"[w]hen an employer or supervisor is acting within\r\nthe scope of his employment responsibilities, the hiring and\r\nfiring decisions are privileged unless he acted with\r\nmalevolence.\"  Walker v. Waltham Hous. Auth., 44 F.3d 1042,\r\n1049 n.1 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n    Dr. McMillan presented evidence that Dr. Gambardella\r\nquestioned her decisions and actions on various occasions,\r\nthat he had her replaced as the head of a hospital committee,\r\nthat he did not reprimand another doctor who made a derisive\r\ncomment to her during a staff meeting, and that he terminated\r\nher without notice, had her summoned while she was involved\r\nin a complicated radiological procedure, and then barred her\r\nfrom the hospital grounds.  To support her claim of tortious\r\ninterference, Dr. McMillan points to O'Brien v. New England\r\nTel. &amp; Tel. Co., 422 Mass. 686, 687 (1996), in which the SJC\r\nheld reasonable a jury's finding that an employer tortiously\r\ninterfered with an employment relationship when he\r\nincessantly harassed employee, called her names in front of\r\ncoworkers, and actively sought to make her cry.  The facts of\r\nO'Brien are, however, much more egregious than those in this\r\ncase.  Insensitive though Dr. Gambardella's actions may have\r\nbeen, they did not demonstrate that type of ill will that the\r\nemployer's actions in O'Brien did.  We think that the\r\ndistrict court properly concluded that these actions and\r\nstatements did not demonstrate \"anything more than a\r\npersonality conflict with Dr. McMillan.\"  For the most part,\r\nDr. Gambardella's actions were properly within the scope of\r\nhis duties as chief of staff at Angell, and, in any event,\r\nthey failed to evince malevolent intent.  No reasonable jury\r\ncould have concluded otherwise.\r\n    Dr. McMillan argues next that the district court erred by\r\ngranting the MSPCA, Dr. Thornton, and Dr. Gambardella summary\r\njudgment as to her claim that her termination was in\r\nretaliation for her filing of an administrative complaint of\r\nsex discrimination in 1989.  She asserts that the district\r\ncourt misapplied the law in ruling that she had failed to\r\nestablish a causal connection between the filing and her\r\ntermination because too much time had lapsed between the two\r\nevents.  She also argues that the court improperly viewed the\r\nfacts from the defendants' perspective.\r\n    We review the district court's grant of summary judgment to\r\ndefendants de novo.  See Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v.\r\nDaley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997).  Further, to\r\ndetermine whether the summary judgment record is sufficient\r\nto support a finding that the employment action was\r\nretaliatory, we review only those facts that were available\r\nat the summary judgment stage, construing all facts and\r\ninferences therefrom in favor of the plaintiff.  See Aybar v.\r\nCrispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    To succeed on a retaliation claim under both state and\r\nfederal law, when, as here, there is no direct evidence of\r\nretaliatory animus, a plaintiff must both establish a prima\r\nfacie case and prove that the defendants' legitimate business\r\nreasons for terminating the plaintiff were pretextual.  SeeFennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (discussing Title VII's analytical framework);\r\nLewis v. Gillette, Co., 22 F.3d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(observing that Massachusetts retaliation law parallels\r\nfederal law).  Specifically, to establish a prima facie case\r\nof retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in\r\nprotected conduct under federal or Massachusetts law; (2) she\r\nsuffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal\r\nconnection existed between the protected conduct and the\r\nadverse action.  See Fennell, 83 F.3d at 535.  Once the\r\nplaintiff has made a prima facie showing, the burden of\r\nproduction shifts to the defendant to articulate a\r\nlegitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its employment\r\ndecision.  See id.  If the defendant does so, the plaintiff\r\nmust show that the defendant's proffered reason was not, in\r\nfact, the real reason for the decision and that the decision\r\nwas the result of the defendant's retaliatory animus.  Seeid.\r\n    We conclude that Dr. McMillan did not establish a prima facie\r\ncase because she presented no evidence of a causal link\r\nbetween her termination and the filing of her complaint.  The\r\nstrongest argument Dr. McMillan makes in this regard is that\r\nDr. Gambardella urged her not to file an MCAD complaint,\r\nstating that her doing so would make their relationship\r\ndifficult.  But, in light of undisputed facts in the summary\r\njudgment record, this does not suggest a causal connection\r\nbetween Dr. McMillan's filing of the discrimination claim, on\r\none hand, and the actual deterioration and eventual\r\ntermination of the employment relationship, on the other. \r\nThe MSPCA and Dr. Gambardella asserted that Dr. McMillan had\r\nhad an acrimonious relationship with other department heads\r\nand staff veterinarians at Angell, that she refused to treat\r\nbirds after Angell refused to purchase her bird practice or\r\npay her separately for the time she spent with avian\r\npatients, and that Dr. Gambardella received complaints from\r\nstaff members about Dr. McMillan's attitude.  Indeed, Dr.\r\nGambardella stated that, by late 1991, his relationship with\r\nDr. McMillan had deteriorated to the extent that he told Dr.\r\nThornton that he would himself resign if Dr. McMillan were\r\nnot terminated.\r\n    In addition, we agree with the district court that, even if\r\nDr. McMillan had established a prima facie case, she did not\r\npresent material facts that would permit a reasonable jury to\r\nfind that Dr. Gambardella's explanation for her firing was\r\npretextual and influenced instead by a retaliatory motive. \r\nAlthough plaintiff presented evidence that she continued to\r\nwork hard and to maintain a good relationship with much of\r\nthe veterinary staff, she simply did not proffer evidence to\r\nrefute defendants' showing that the veterinary staff\r\ncomplained to Dr. Gambardella about her performance and\r\ndemeanor.  In light of this undisputed evidence, even if Dr.\r\nGambardella may have exercised arguably poor business\r\njudgment in terminating her, and in doing so in an abrupt,\r\nclumsy, and unfeeling manner, it would be unreasonable on the\r\nevidence for a factfinder to conclude that his explanation\r\nfor the termination was, in fact, not the true reason.  We\r\ntherefore decline to order a new trial on this issue.\r\n    Third, Dr. McMillan argues that the district court improperly\r\ngranted the MSPCA summary judgment on her claim that the\r\nMSPCA's failure to comply with the progressive discipline\r\npolicy outlined in its Rules and Regulations Memorandum\r\nconstituted a breach of contract because the policy was a\r\ncontract governing her employment.  She contends that the\r\ncourt improperly applied in a \"wooden\" fashion factors set\r\nforth in Jackson v. Action for Boston Community Dev., 403\r\nMass. 8, 14-15 (1988), for determining whether a personnel\r\nmanual's policy guidelines constitute a binding employment\r\nagreement.  For support, she relies on O'Brien, 422 Mass. at\r\n691-93, in which the SJC held that the terms of an employees'\r\nmanual become part of an implied employment contract if the\r\nparties so agree, even if the  terms of the manual have not\r\nbeen negotiated, and even if, in a continuing employment\r\nrelationship, an employee only reasonably believed that the\r\nemployer \"was presenting the manual as a statement of the\r\nconditions under which employment would continue.\"  Id. at\r\n693.\r\n      We agree with the district court's reasoning on this issue\r\nand its observation that, although personnel manuals may\r\nsometimes constitute an employment agreement, see Jackson,\r\n403 Mass. at 13, the facts Dr. McMillan alleged do not\r\nsupport such an inference.  As the district court observed,\r\n\"Dr. McMillan does not claim to have bargained for any of the\r\nterms of the manual, to have signed the manual, or to have\r\nexecuted any other employment agreement with the MSPCA. \r\nMoreover, the manual described itself as a disciplinary\r\nguideline that 'is not all inclusive.'\"  McMillan v. MSPCA,\r\n880 F. Supp. 900, 910 (D. Mass. 1995).  Contrary to Dr.\r\nMcMillan's assertion, the court's analysis was not an\r\napplication of inflexible prerequisites to finding an\r\nemployment contract.  Rather, the court's analysis employs\r\nthe factors appropriately, as mere guidelines in the\r\ndetermination.  See O'Brien, 422 Mass. at 692.  We do the\r\nsame.  In addition to the factors highlighted by the district\r\ncourt, we note additionally that there is no evidence that\r\nDr. McMillan reasonably expected that the MSPCA would follow\r\nthe procedures with regard to her conduct or that of other\r\nsupervisory veterinarians at Angell.\r\n    Dr. McMillan's next argument is that she should be granted a\r\nnew trial on her claim for emotional distress damages.  Dr.\r\nMcMillan withdrew that claim after the district court adopted\r\na magistrate's ruling ordering the disclosure of records of\r\nDr. McMillan's therapist, which defendants had requested\r\nduring discovery.  Dr. McMillan argues that we must review\r\nthis matter de novo, in light of Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U.S.\r\n1, 116 S. Ct. 1923 (1996), in which the Supreme Court\r\nrecognized a federal privilege against the compelled\r\ndisclosure of counseling records.  In the alternative, she\r\nargues that the district court erred as a matter of law and\r\nabused its discretion in its determination of the privilege\r\nissue.\r\n    We need not resolve these issues, however, because, as\r\ndefendants rightly point out, Dr. McMillan's withdrawal of\r\nher claim for emotional distress damages constituted a waiver\r\nof the claim.  This rule holds regardless whether new law has\r\nemerged which potentially may bolster a party's argument.\r\n    Finally, Dr. McMillan argues that the district court abused\r\nits discretion by determining that attorney's fees\r\nrepresenting work on Dr. McMillan's contract and emotional\r\ndistress claims were noncompensable and, accordingly, by\r\nreducing the attorney's fee award by twenty percent.  She\r\nargues that the court was wrong in concluding that the\r\ncontract claims were severable and not connected to the\r\ndiscrimination claims and thus not compensable.  Further, she\r\ncontends that the claims together represent no more than\r\nthree percent of the total time documented.\r\n    As the district court correctly observed, fee awards are\r\nappropriate only for successful claims; unsuccessful claims\r\nwarrant a fee award only if they are connected to the\r\nsuccessful ones.  Krewson v. City of Quincy, 74 F.3d 15, 19\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  Having determined that Dr. McMillan's\r\nunsuccessful emotional distress and contract claims were not\r\nconnected with her successful claims, the court thought\r\nappropriate \"some apportionment between successful and\r\nunsuccessful claims,\" and correspondingly reduced the award\r\nby twenty percent.\r\n    \"As a general rule, a fee-awarding court that makes a\r\nsubstantial reduction in either documented time or\r\nauthenticated rates should offer reasonably explicit\r\nfindings, for the court, in such circumstances, 'has a burden\r\nto spell out the whys and wherefores.'\"  Brewster v. Dukakis,\r\n3 F.3d 488, 493 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v.\r\nMetropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1988)). \r\nAlthough the district court did not explicitly state why it\r\nregarded the contract claims as unconnected to the\r\ndiscrimination claims, we do not think the court abused its\r\ndiscretion in making that determination and in denying fees\r\nfor the time spent on that claim,   or on the emotional\r\ndistress claim, which is even more clearly unrelated to Dr.\r\nMcMillan's successful claims.\r\n    It is not so easily discernable, however, that twenty percent\r\nwas a proper reduction.  Although the district court has\r\nconsiderable discretion in determining fee awards, and\r\nalthough, as defendants point out, the fee petition is not\r\namenable to easy analysis, our review of the fee petition\r\ndoes not convince us that the time plaintiff's counsel spent\r\non the contract and emotional distress issues could\r\nreasonably be regarded as twenty percent of the total time\r\ndocumented.    In such a situation, the district court\r\nshould, at a very minimum, make clear why it chose to reduce\r\nthe fee award by such a substantial percentage.  Because the\r\ncourt in this case provided no elaboration for the reduction,\r\nwe remand this issue to the district court for\r\nreconsideration.  \r\n                          III.\r\n                       CONCLUSION\r\n  We affirm the district court's denial of judgment as a matter\r\nof law on plaintiff's pay discrimination claims and, in part,\r\nthe jury's award of compensatory damages, and we vacate the\r\njury's award of punitive damages.  In addition, we remand for\r\na recalculation of the damages in light of our determination\r\nthat an amount representing lost benefits should not have\r\n been included in the award, and for recalculation of\r\nattorney's fees with regard to hourly compensation rates and\r\nthe fee reduction for time spent on plaintiff's contract and\r\n              emotional distress claims.\r\n                         SO ORDERED.\n",

STAHL, Circuit Judge.  In the late 1980s, Dr. Marjorie\r\nMcMillan, head of the radiology department for the\r\nMassachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\nAnimals (\"MSPCA\"), learned that she was being paid less than\r\nthe male heads of the organization's other departments. \r\nDefendants MSPCA and Dr. Gus Thornton now appeal the district\r\ncourt's denial of their motion to set aside verdicts in Dr.\r\nMcMillan's favor on her various pay discrimination claims. \r\nThey also appeal as excessive the jury's award of\r\ncompensatory and punitive damages, and the district court's\r\naward of attorney's fees.  Dr. McMillan cross-appeals the\r\ncourt's grant of judgment as a matter of law on her tortious\r\ninterference with contractual relations claim against\r\ndefendant Dr. Paul Gambardella, and its grant of summary\r\njudgment on her contract claims against the MSPCA and on her\r\nretaliation claim against all three defendants.  We affirm\r\nthe district court's ruling on the pay discrimination,\r\ntortious interference, contract, and retaliation claims, and,\r\nin part, the jury's compensatory damages verdict; reverse the\r\naward of punitive damages and compensatory damages\r\nrepresenting lost benefits; and vacate the award of\r\nattorney's fees with directions that it be recalculated after\r\nremand.\r\n                               I.\r\n            BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\r\n    We begin with an overview of general facts and prior\r\nproceedings, and leave more detailed recitations to the\r\n                appropriate contexts.\r\n  Defendant MSPCA is a charitable, non-profit organization that\r\ncombats cruelty to animals through educational programs and\r\nveterinary services.  It operates Angell Memorial Animal\r\nHospital (\"Angell\"), whose staff, during the relevant time\r\n period, totalled more than 200 employees, including\r\nveterinarians, interns, residents in post-graduate veterinary\r\ntraining, and technical and support staff.  Defendant Dr. Gus\r\nThornton began working at Angell in 1957, and was its chief\r\nof staff from 1966 until 1989, at which time he became\r\npresident of the MSPCA.  Defendant Dr. Paul Gambardella\r\nworked as a staff surgeon at Angell from 1975 until 1984, and\r\nas the interim director of surgery from 1984 until 1989, when\r\n      Dr. Thornton appointed him chief of staff.\r\n  Plaintiff Dr. Marjorie McMillan was first employed by Angell\r\nin 1969 and thereafter was employed in various capacities\r\nuntil she left in 1977 to work in private practice.  She\r\nreturned in 1981 as the director of the radiology department,\r\nemployed part time.  She left Angell again in 1984 to spend\r\n  one year completing coursework necessary for board\r\ncertification and returned to Angell in 1985, again as\r\ndirector of radiology on a part-time schedule.  From 1987\r\nuntil 1991, she worked full time as head of radiology.  In\r\naddition, from 1981 to 1991, she worked approximately seven\r\nhours each week at Windhover Bird Clinic (\"Windhover\"), a\r\npart-time private avian practice that she had established in\r\n               Walpole, Massachusetts.\r\n  Until 1988, Angell had seven veterinary departments: clinics,\r\ncardiology, intensive care, clinical pathology, pathology,\r\nsurgery, and radiology.  All of the departments were headed\r\nby veterinarians, who, in addition to fulfilling their\r\nclinical duties, also served as administrative directors of\r\ntheir departments.  During this time, Dr. Thornton was\r\nresponsible for negotiating veterinarians' initial salaries\r\nand for setting discretionary annual increases from a fixed\r\namount of funds.  Although the department directors were\r\nresponsible for such tasks as purchasing equipment, training\r\ninterns and residents, scheduling, and making budget and\r\ncompensation recommendations to Dr. Thornton, all of the\r\nstaff reported to Dr. Thornton rather than to the individual\r\n                      directors.\r\n  In 1985 Dr. Thornton initiated a plan to restructure Angell's\r\nmanagement, giving to the department directors greater\r\nresponsibility, including the authority to make hiring,\r\nfiring, compensation, and discipline decisions.  As part of\r\nthe reorganization, Dr. Thornton in 1988 consolidated\r\nAngell's seven departments into four departments: radiology,\r\n          medicine, surgery, and pathology.\r\n  Dr. McMillan did not know the salaries of other veterinarians\r\nemployed by Angell until 1987, when she learned that the\r\nsalary of a newly-hired radiologist was $38,000.  Dr.\r\nMcMillan, whose salary at that time was $41,000, consulted\r\nDr. Thornton and requested a raise so that her compensation\r\nwould be comparable to that of the other department heads. \r\nDr. Thornton eventually offered Dr. McMillan a raise to\r\n$47,000, which she did not accept because she had been\r\noffered a $50,000 salary for a non-administrative veterinary\r\nposition at Tufts University Veterinary School.  Dr. Thornton\r\nthen agreed to adjust Dr. McMillan's salary to $51,000,\r\n              effective in January 1988.\r\n  In 1989, Dr. McMillan discovered the disparity between her\r\nsalary and that of the other department heads at Angell when\r\na newspaper published a letter about the MSPCA that listed\r\nthe various salaries.  At the time, her salary was $58,000;\r\nher male counterparts in surgery, pathology, and medicine, by\r\ncontrast, were earning $73,000, $80,244, and $73,199,\r\nrespectively.  On the basis of the salary disparity, Dr.\r\nMcMillan filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission\r\n               Against Discrimination.\r\n   Also in 1989, Dr. Gambardella, who became chief of staff\r\nupon Dr. Thornton's accession to the MSPCA presidency, set\r\nout to reevaluate and to improve the level of department\r\nheads' compensation.  He began by creating job descriptions\r\nfor each of the department heads in which the list of duties\r\nfor the head of radiology was substantially the same as those\r\nfor the other department head positions.  He also consulted a\r\nstudy of the salaries at another major animal hospital and an\r\ninformal market survey, on the basis of which he tentatively\r\nsuggested to Kathleen Collins, Angell's human resources\r\ndirector, that the heads of radiology and surgery receive\r\n$88,000, the head of medicine, $90,000, and the head of\r\npathology, $95,000.  Collins then undertook an analysis of\r\nthe department head jobs in order to \"rationalize\" the\r\nMSPCA's salary structure, giving a range of points in a\r\nnumber of categories of responsibility.  On the basis of the\r\npoint totals, she determined an appropriate salary for each\r\nof the department heads.  On completion of the analysis, in\r\n1990, Dr. McMillan received a raise from $58,295 to $72,000,\r\nwhich was substantially larger than that received by any of\r\nthe other department heads.  \r\n    Also in 1990, Dr. McMillan entered into negotiations with\r\nAngell over the status of Windhover.  Dr. McMillan suggested\r\nthat Angell acquire her practice or, alternatively, that it\r\nrent her space so that she could carry on her bird practice\r\nthere or that it pay her a separate, additional amount for\r\nher treatment of Angell's avian patients.  When the\r\nnegotiations came to an impasse, Dr. McMillan refused to\r\ncontinue to treat birds at Angell, a duty to which she had\r\nbeen devoting approximately six hours per week.\r\n    In 1991, Dr. Gambardella began to receive complaints from\r\nveterinarians -- other department heads and members of the\r\nsurgery staff, in particular -- that Dr. McMillan was\r\nuncooperative and had created an atmosphere of animosity and\r\ninflexibility in the radiology department.  On November 21,\r\n1991, Dr. Gambardella summoned Dr. McMillan as she was\r\npreparing to perform a procedure on an anesthetized dog,\r\nfired her, gave her fifteen minutes to gather her belongings,\r\nand had her escorted out of the hospital.  She was told not\r\nto return and was thereafter excluded from the premises. \r\nAlthough Angell had adopted in March 1990 a discipline policy\r\ndirected at the correction of inappropriate behavior and\r\nretention of employees whenever possible, Dr. McMillan was\r\ngiven no advance warning of her termination.\r\n    On May 21, 1992, Dr. McMillan sued the MSPCA, Dr. Thornton,\r\nand Dr. Gambardella, alleging pay discrimination in violation\r\nof Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-1; the Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\"),\r\n29 U.S.C.  206; and the Massachusetts anti-discrimination\r\nstatute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, and Equal Rights Act,\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93,  102.  The complaint also alleged\r\nretaliation in violation of Title VII, the EPA, and Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 151B and ch. 272,  92A and 98; breach of\r\ncontract and negligent performance of contractual duties\r\nagainst the MSPCA; and tortious interference with contractual\r\nrelations against Dr. Thornton and Dr. Gambardella.  On March\r\n17, 1995, the district court awarded the MSPCA summary\r\njudgment on Dr. McMillan's claims for pay discrimination\r\nunder Title VII and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93,  102,\r\nretaliation under state and federal law, breach of contract\r\nand negligent performance of contractual duties, and tortious\r\ninterference with contractual relations against Dr. Thornton. \r\nThe court also held that damages against the MSPCA were\r\nlimited to $20,000, pursuant to the Massachusetts charitable\r\nimmunity law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231,  85K.  The court\r\nlater held that chapter 231 did not apply and granted Dr.\r\nMcMillan's motion for reconsideration of the limitation on\r\ndamages.\r\n    In December 1995, plaintiff tried to a jury the remaining\r\ncounts: pay discrimination in violation of the EPA against\r\nthe MSPCA and in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B\r\nagainst the MSPCA and Dr. Thornton, and tortious interference\r\nwith contractual relations against Dr. Gambardella.  The jury\r\nfound in her favor on all counts.  On Dr. McMillan's pay\r\ndiscrimination claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, the jury\r\nawarded $183,784.50 as back pay accrued from 1985 through\r\n1991, to which it added $178,915 for interest accrued from\r\n1985.  On her tortious interference claim against Dr.\r\nGambardella, it awarded $197,550 as back pay, adding\r\n$84,846.50 as interest and $99,375.23 as front pay.  Finally,\r\nthe jury assessed punitive damages against Dr. Thornton and\r\nthe MSPCA in the amount of $306,912.50.  On November 12,\r\n1996, the court awarded Dr. McMillan $447,928.81 in\r\nattorney's fees and $18,889 in costs.  On the same day, the\r\ntrial court set aside the jury verdict on the tortious\r\ninterference claim against Dr. Gambardella but declined to\r\nset aside or grant a new trial on the pay discrimination\r\nverdict or award of back pay and punitive damages.  This\r\nappeal and cross-appeal followed.\r\n                          II.\r\n                       DISCUSSION\r\n                 A.  Pay Discrimination\r\n  The MSPCA and Dr. Thornton contend that the trial court erred\r\nby denying their Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion for judgment as\r\na matter of law, thereby ruling that there was sufficient\r\n   evidence for a reasonable jury to find that they\r\nintentionally discriminated against Dr. McMillan, on the\r\nbasis of her sex, in setting her salary between 1985 and\r\n1991.  They first argue that the evidence was insufficient to\r\n    show that Dr. McMillan's skills, efforts, and\r\nresponsibilities as a radiologist and department head were\r\nsubstantially similar to those of the male department heads.   \r\nThe remainder of their argument addresses the issue of\r\npretext.  Focusing on evidentiary questions, defendants\r\ncontend that the trial court erred by admitting Dr.\r\nGambardella's preliminary suggestions about appropriate\r\ndepartment head salaries, and sporadic comments derogatory to\r\nwomen made by Dr. Thornton, as evidence that the reasons\r\nprovided by Dr. Thornton for the pay disparity were\r\npretextual.  They further assert that there was insufficient\r\nevidence that Dr. Thornton's stated reasons for his\r\ndeterminations of base salaries and annual salary increases\r\nwere pretextual.  Specifically, they contend that a\r\nstatistical analysis used to show pay differentials between\r\nmales and females at the MSPCA could not support the verdict,\r\nand that Dr. Thornton's \"stray remarks\" were insufficient to\r\nexpose as pretextual his purported method of establishing and\r\nraising salaries.  \r\n    Defendants challenge the pay discrimination verdicts under\r\nboth state and federal discrimination law.  To establish a\r\nprima facie case of sex discrimination based on salary\r\ndisparity under the federal Equal Pay Act, a plaintiff must\r\nshow that her employer was subject to the Act, and that she\r\nwas paid less than her male counterparts who were performing\r\nwork requiring substantially equal skill, effort, and\r\nresponsibility under similar working conditions.  Defendants\r\nmust then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\r\npay disparity can be explained by a legitimate factor such as\r\nseniority or performance.

Prima Facie Case\r\n    We agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could\r\nhave found that Dr. McMillan had satisfied her burden of\r\nestablishing a prima facie case of pay discrimination. \r\nContrary to defendants' assertion that plaintiff failed to\r\noffer evidence comparing the skill, effort, and\r\nresponsibilities of her position as radiology department head\r\nwith that of the other department heads, plaintiff proffered\r\ntestimony that the radiology department is comparable with\r\nthe other departments in all three respects.  In particular,\r\ntestimony from Dr. Neil Harpster, Angell's cardiology\r\ndepartment head from 1985 to 1988, and Dr. Allen Sisson, a\r\nstaff veterinarian, provided evidence both that the\r\nprocedures performed by Dr. McMillan in her job were among\r\nthe most technically difficult procedures performed by any\r\nveterinarian at Angell and that the hours Dr. McMillan spent\r\nat her job were comparable to those of the other department\r\nheads.  In addition, the evidence showed that Dr. McMillan\r\nsupervised more staff than did Dr. James Carpenter, the head\r\nof the pathology department, and that, in Kathleen Collins's\r\nanalysis of department head jobs in the late 1980s, radiology\r\nwas ranked equally with pathology and medicine in seven out\r\nof eight categories of responsibility.    Moreover, although\r\nthe job descriptions that Dr. Gambardella formulated in 1989,\r\nwithout more, are not dispositive, the fact that the job\r\nrequirements for all of the department heads were\r\nsubstantially the same is supportive of other evidence that\r\nthe department head positions required substantially equal\r\nskill, effort, and responsibility.  Finally, a market survey\r\npublished sometime in the first half of the 1980s and\r\nadmitted into evidence demonstrated that the average salaries\r\nof radiologists were comparable to those of other\r\nspecialists, indicating that radiology is not an\r\nintrinsically less demanding area of veterinary medicine. \r\nThe evidence was thus sufficient to support a finding that\r\nplaintiff had presented a prima facie case.\r\n    2.  Pretext\r\n  We turn next to the issue of pretext.    At trial, defendants\r\npresented several reasons to explain why Dr. McMillan was\r\npaid less than the other department heads.  Dr. Thornton\r\ntestified that, as chief of staff, he set a department head's\r\ncompensation by conducting an informal survey of what\r\nsimilarly situated veterinarians were being paid at other\r\ninstitutions and by negotiating compensation with the\r\nprospective department head.  He stated that, in general,\r\nradiologists commanded lower compensation than did\r\nveterinarians in other specialties.  He further testified\r\nthat, to determine yearly percentage salary increases, he\r\nevaluated each department head's productivity and\r\nresponsibilities.  Dr. Thornton stated that, in his view, the\r\nhead of medicine, Dr. Michael Bernstein, had significantly\r\nmore responsibilities, including the oversight of more staff,\r\nthan did Dr. McMillan as head of radiology.  Dr. Thornton\r\nlikewise claimed that the head of pathology, Dr. Carpenter,\r\nhad more responsibilities than did Dr. McMillan because he\r\nsupervised more staff, had a larger budget, and was\r\nnationally known, and because pathology, unlike radiology,\r\nincorporated several disciplines such as clinical and\r\nanatomic pathology.  The head of surgery, Dr. Gambardella at\r\nthe time, merited greater compensation in Dr. Thornton's view\r\nbecause he was accountable for the budget and staff hiring\r\nand discipline for the department, supervised more staff, and\r\nhad significant responsibility for patient care and client\r\ncontact.\r\n    Defendants make two primary arguments regarding the pretext\r\nprong of plaintiff's pay discrimination claim.  First, they\r\nargue that the jury's findings that Dr. Thornton's\r\nexplanations were pretextual are tainted because the district\r\ncourt improperly admitted into evidence (1) Dr. Gambardella's\r\npreliminary suggestions in 1989 regarding salary increases as\r\nproof of Dr. Thornton's state of mind throughout the time\r\nperiod that he set Dr. McMillan's salary and yearly\r\nincreases, and (2) evidence of sporadic distasteful remarks\r\nthat Dr. Thornton made to women colleagues in 1979 and 1989. \r\nSecond, defendants assert, in essence, that, even taking into\r\naccount all of the evidence actually admitted, plaintiff\r\nfailed to prove, as required under Massachusetts law, that\r\nDr. Thornton's stated procedures for setting salaries were\r\npretextual.\r\n    We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See United States v. Young, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  A judge should not exclude relevant evidence,\r\nunless its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403.  \"Only\r\nrarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances --\r\nwill we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a\r\ndistrict court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative\r\nweighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"  Freeman v.\r\nPackage Mach. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\n    The court's admission of testimony about Dr. Gambardella's\r\n1989 suggestions regarding salary increases was not an abuse\r\nof its discretion.  One of Dr. Thornton's stated reasons for\r\nsetting salaries at Angell as he did during the period from\r\n1985 to 1989 was that radiologists commanded lower salaries\r\non the market than did veterinarians in other specialties. \r\nThe issue was whether this reason was pretextual.  The\r\ninformal 1989 survey on which Dr. Gambardella based his\r\nsuggestions showed relative parity among salaries of\r\nradiologists and other specialists.  Accordingly, Dr.\r\nGambardella's suggestions were probative of whether radiology\r\nis intrinsically a less-valued veterinary specialty and,\r\ntherefore, of whether Dr. Thornton's stated reason was, in\r\nfact, the real reason.  They are probative also of Dr.\r\nThornton's credibility because they were based on what\r\nveterinarians in various specialties were worth in the\r\nmarket, the very factor on which Dr. Thornton purported to\r\nrely in setting salaries at Angell.  Further, although\r\ndefendants contend that, regardless of the status of\r\nradiology at other institutions, the radiology department at\r\nAngell was not equal to Angell's other departments with\r\nregard to the responsibilities required of its head, we think\r\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\ndetermining that Dr. Gambardella's testimony regarding salary\r\nparity at other institutions was not unfairly prejudicial to\r\ndefendants in their attempt to make this point.\r\n    Whether the court's admission into evidence of the so-called\r\nstray remarks was proper presents a more difficult question. \r\nThere is, of course, no question that Dr. Thornton's\r\nmotivation in paying Dr. McMillan less than the other\r\ndepartment heads was a material issue in the case.  We note\r\ninitially that stray remarks may properly constitute evidence\r\nof discriminatory intent for the jury to consider in\r\ncombination with other evidence.  See Bevan v.

In 1979 or 1980, he talked to a\r\nlab technician about warming up a vial of medicine in her\r\nbrassiere.  Approximately ten years later, he made a remark\r\nto the MSPCA's lobbyist about her cleavage and then later\r\nasked whether, to stop bad publicity about the MSPCA by a\r\nparticular reporter, she had slept with the reporter. \r\nArguably, at least, these remarks may have been relevant and\r\nprobative as to Dr. Thornton's motivation in setting the\r\nsalaries of male and female department heads, in the sense\r\nthat they evince a derogatory attitude toward women.\r\n    However, not only did the remarks not involve the employment\r\ndecision at issue, they did not involve employment at all. \r\nFurther, at least one of the remarks was made several years\r\nbefore any dispute arose over the pay disparity between Dr.\r\nMcMillan and other department heads.  Such factors heighten\r\nthe remoteness of the remarks, arguably to the point at which\r\nthey are no more probative than they are prejudicial. \r\nNonetheless, the question we must address in determining\r\nadmissibility is not whether we agree with the district court\r\nbut, rather, whether the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion.  See Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685127\"><a href=\"/opinion/685127/41-fed-r-evid-serv-94-prodliabrep-cch-p-14121-william-and-rita/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 1994).  We think that it did not. \r\nAlthough the comments were unrelated to Dr. McMillan's\r\nsituation, and although the remarks may, in the end, have\r\nfallen on the other side of the imprecise nexus/no-nexus\r\nboundary, the court's determination to admit the remarks for\r\nthe jury to consider with the other evidence was not so one-\r\nsided such that it did not act within its discretion.  \r\n    Defendants contend in addition that the district court erred\r\nby giving the jury an improper instruction on the relevance\r\nof Dr. Thornton's remarks.    They assert that the court both\r\nanalyzed and added to the evidence by equating Dr. Thornton's\r\nremarks with his attitude about the value of women when no\r\nevidentiary foundation supplied the nexus.  Further, they\r\nargue that the instruction misled the jury to believe that\r\nstray remarks alone were sufficient evidence of pretext.\r\n    Defendants' objections to the jury instructions were not\r\nclearly articulated at trial and, therefore, not properly\r\npreserved.    In such a situation, we review only for error\r\nresulting in a \"clear miscarriage of justice.\"  Transnational\r\nCorp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552772\"><a href=\"/opinion/552772/transnational-corp-v-rodio-ursillo-ltd-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1069 (1st Cir.\r\n1990).\r\n    In reviewing jury instructions such as these, we focus\r\nprincipally on \"whether they tended to confuse or mislead the\r\njury on the controlling issues.\"  Service Merchandise Co.,\r\nInc. v. Boyd Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428314\"><a href=\"/opinion/428314/service-merchandise-company-inc-v-the-boyd-corporation-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 950 (1st Cir. 1983).  In\r\nthis instance, we discern no problems with the judge's stray\r\nremarks instructions.  First, contrary to defendants'\r\nsuggestion, federal judges may comment on the evidence.  SeeLeshore v. County of Worcester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569093\"><a href=\"/opinion/569093/ruth-leshore-etc-v-county-of-worcester/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 474 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).  Second, in this case the judge merely made explicit\r\nwhat the jury might infer if it chose to credit the stray\r\nremarks.  This may be, as defendants assert, \"connect[ing]\r\nthe dots,\" but it is not a suggestion that a particular\r\nconclusion must be reached.  Moreover, the court made clear\r\nto the jury that it was equally plausible to regard the\r\nremarks as \"random and completely out of character,\" and thus\r\nto infer nothing at all about them.  Likewise, the\r\ninstructions in no way misled the jury to believe that the\r\nstray remarks might, alone, be sufficient to prove that\r\ndefendants' stated reasons for paying Dr. McMillan less were\r\nmere pretext.  That the jury \"might decide that a given\r\nremark is evidence of a discriminatory mindset\" seems to us\r\nto be nothing other than a restatement of why such evidence\r\nis presented to the jury in the first place; it implies\r\nnothing about how much or how little of such evidence is\r\nsufficient for the jury to find in the plaintiff's favor.  In\r\nany event, the instructions did not result in a \"clear\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\"\r\n    As to the sufficiency of the evidence of pretext, defendants\r\nattack the analysis of plaintiff's statistical expert, Dr.\r\nArlene Ash.  They argue that the analysis cannot support the\r\njury verdict because it did not incorporate variables that\r\nDr. Thornton argued he applied when he set initial salaries\r\nand determined annual incremental increases.  They also\r\ncontend that it was based on a legally insufficient sample\r\nsize.\r\n    We turn first to the argument that Dr. Ash's analysis ignored\r\nimportant factors.  Defendants assert that Dr. Ash's model\r\nshould have included such variables as market factors,\r\nnegotiations, veterinary experience, performance evaluations,\r\nproductivity, and veterinarians' overall contribution to the\r\nhospital.  As a preliminary matter we note that, although a\r\nfailure to include particular variables in a regression\r\nanalysis may diminish the probativeness of the analysis, \"it\r\ncan hardly be said, absent some other infirmity, that an\r\nanalysis which accounts for the major factors . . . 'must be\r\nconsidered unacceptable as evidence of discrimination.'\"  SeeBazemore v. Friday, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111746\"><a href=\"/opinion/111746/bazemore-v-friday/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 400 (1986).  Dr. Ash\r\nincorporated into the analysis such legitimate variables as\r\nveterinarians' seniority at Angell, department head status,\r\nboard-approved specialization, area of specialization, and\r\ndepartmental budget size.  Although the models she developed\r\nmay not have included every relevant variable, her testimony\r\nshows solid reasoning in her determinations to exclude\r\ncertain variables that the defendants argued should have been\r\nincluded.  We therefore reject this argument.\r\n    Defendants further assert that Dr. Ash's analysis was\r\neffectively based on an insufficient sample size because Dr.\r\nAsh used factors which could apply only to department heads. \r\nThis objection is opaque and unpersuasive.  Dr. Ash's choice\r\nof sample, which was the approximately forty-six\r\nveterinarians who worked at Angell from 1981 to 1991, was not\r\nfatally deficient.  The analysis made a distinction between\r\nthose veterinarians who were department heads and those who\r\nwere not.  Only one variable -- budget size -- was specific\r\nto department head status, and it was not applied to the\r\nveterinarians who were not department heads.\r\n    Defendants continue, however, arguing that statistical\r\nevidence \"should rarely be accorded any weight\" in disparate\r\ntreatment cases.  We agree that in a disparate treatment\r\ncase, such as this one, the necessary focus on the treatment\r\nof a particular individual appears incongruous with an\r\nanalysis that necessarily involves numerous individuals and\r\nthat, therefore, is intuitively more probative in the\r\ndisparate impact context.

Further,\r\nwe have held that \"[s]tatistical evidence is permissible on\r\nthe issue of pretext in a disparate treatment case since\r\n'statistics as to . . . employment policy and practice may be\r\nhelpful to a determination of whether [the employer's\r\nconduct] conformed to a general pattern of discrimination.'\" \r\nFreeman, 865 F.2d at 1342 (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\r\nGreen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 805 (1973)).  We agree with the court\r\nbelow that, in a case such as this, \"the jury could have\r\nfound a plausible connection between Dr. Thornton's treatment\r\nof women generally at Angell and his treatment of Dr.\r\nMcMillan in particular.\"\r\n    Leaving aside whether Dr. Ash's analysis was watertight in\r\nall respects, we think it important to note that Dr. Ash's\r\ntestimony was focused, perceptive, and understandably\r\ncompelling to the jury.  Reviewing the record, it is apparent\r\nto us that, whatever \"infirmities\" existed in her analysis,\r\nnone was so substantive that no reasonable jury could have\r\nrelied on it, along with the other evidence, in reaching a\r\nverdict.  Rather, if Dr. Ash's analysis omitted what\r\ndefendants argue are important variables, or was deficient in\r\nother respects, and thereby did not reflect whether Dr.\r\nThornton's salary decisions were based at least in part on\r\ngender, it was up to defendants to exploit and discredit the\r\nanalysis during cross examination.  Furthermore, although the\r\nconflicting expert testimony they provided placed Dr. Ash's\r\nanalysis into question, the jury was free to disregard that\r\ntestimony and place credence in that of Dr. Ash.  Indeed, as\r\nthe district court noted, although the defendants' expert,\r\nDr. Herbert Weisberg, disputed Dr. Ash's finding of a pattern\r\nof discrimination, he admitted that her model had produced\r\nstatistically significant results.  \r\n    In arguing that plaintiff did not show evidence of pretext,\r\nDefendants' position seems to be that, aside from evidence of\r\nDr. Thornton's stray remarks and Dr. Ash's statistical\r\nanalysis, there remains no basis on which the jury might\r\nreasonably have found pretext under Massachusetts law and pay\r\ndiscrimination under the EPA.  But in addition to the\r\nstatistical analysis, plaintiff offered other evidence,\r\nwhich, in combination with the statistical evidence, was\r\nsufficient to support a finding of pretext.  Although\r\ndefendants posited that the radiology department was smaller\r\nthan the other departments, plaintiff presented evidence\r\nthat, in fact, cardiology was the smallest department, with\r\nonly two employees under the supervision of the department\r\nhead.  The record reveals that the issue of seniority\r\nprovided an additional basis for a jury finding of pretext. \r\nDr. Thornton testified that both the number of years a\r\nveterinarian had been in practice and his or her seniority at\r\nAngell were factors he weighed in setting initial salaries\r\nfor a particular position.  And, indeed, it appears from the\r\nevidence that he did consider seniority in setting the\r\nsalaries of Dr. Gambardella when he became head of surgery\r\nand of Dr. Michael Aronsohn when he succeeded Dr. Gambardella\r\nin that position.  Dr. Thornton's testimony indicates,\r\nhowever, that he ignored seniority and years in practice in\r\nthe case of Dr. McMillan, treating her as a new hire when she\r\nreturned to Angell in 1985.    The testimony shows that, even\r\nthough Dr. McMillan in 1985 had spent two and a half years as\r\nradiology department director (albeit part time) and five\r\nyears at Angell in various capacities, Dr. Thornton did not\r\nconsider that experience in setting her salary.  Rather, he\r\ntestified that he based her salary on a survey that\r\nrecommended $29,000 to $50,000 for the least experienced\r\nradiologists, and that, in fact, he paid her $35,000 simply\r\nbecause he could.  But $35,000 was essentially the same\r\nsalary Dr. McMillan had been earning in 1983, before she\r\nspent a year away from Angell.    As for annual percentage\r\nincreases of salaries, although Dr. Thornton testified that\r\nhe based his decisions on subjective factors such as\r\nproductivity, contribution to the hospital, and interaction\r\nwith other employees, he also testified that he did not\r\nsystematically quantify contributions and interaction and\r\nthat he did not evaluate the radiology department on the\r\nbasis of productivity.  Finally, testimony from Dr. Bernstein\r\nand Dr. Aronsohn placed into question Dr. Thornton's\r\nassertion that some department heads were so-called \"strong\r\ndepartment heads,\" and had more authority on that basis. \r\nThus, a reasonable jury could have found that Dr. Thornton's\r\nstated reason for his salary decisions was not true or, in\r\nother words, pretextual.\r\n    Accordingly, because we think that there was sufficient\r\nproperly admitted evidence for a jury to find that Dr.\r\nThornton's stated reasons for the pay disparity were\r\npretextual, we choose not to disturb the district court's\r\ndenial of judgment as a matter of law with regard to the pay\r\ndiscrimination claims based on Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B and\r\non the Equal Pay Act.  \r\nB.  Damages\r\n    Defendants present a variety of arguments regarding\r\ncalculation of damages, most of which need not detain us\r\nlong.  At the outset, we note that we do not disturb a jury's\r\naward of damages unless it \"exceed[s] any rational appraisal\r\nor estimate\" of what the damages should be.  Kolb v.\r\nGoldring, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411646\"><a href=\"/opinion/411646/30-fair-emplpraccas-633-30-empl-prac-dec-p-33169-theodore-kolb-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871 (1st Cir. 1982) (internal\r\ncitation omitted).\r\n    Defendants argue that Dr. McMillan's back pay damages award\r\nshould be set aside or reduced because the award was\r\nexcessive and unsupported by the evidence.  They contend that\r\nthe jury's award of back pay based on an average of the\r\nsalaries of the male department heads between 1985 and 1991\r\nhas no legal basis.  We disagree.  As Dr. McMillan rightly\r\npoints out, the cases defendants rely on to support their\r\nargument, Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196064\"><a href=\"/opinion/196064/scarfo-v-cabletron-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 954\r\n(1st Cir. 1995) and E.E.O.C. v.

In Liggett &amp; Myers, the\r\ncourt rejected a calculation of back pay based on the average\r\nsalary in favor of a calculation based on the salary of the\r\nhighest paid employee comparator.  See 690 F.2d at 1074. \r\nAlthough Scarfo holds that back pay should be calculated by\r\ncomparing the plaintiff's salary to that of \"arguably\r\nequivalent\" employees, it in no way indicates that averaging\r\nthe salaries of two or more such employees is inappropriate. \r\nSee 54 F.3d at 954.  Here, averaging the salaries of the male\r\ndepartment heads was a rational approach.  In fact, in this\r\ncontext, a more appropriate method has not been proposed.  We\r\nthus find that the method the jury apparently used to\r\ndetermine the amount of the back pay award was not\r\ninappropriate.\r\n    Defendants next assert that Dr. McMillan is not entitled to\r\nrecovery, as part of her back pay award, for \"lost benefits\"\r\n-- health insurance, life insurance, and retirement\r\ncontributions -- because she did not prove that she had lost\r\nthem.  Plaintiff testified that she had been told that such\r\nbenefits constituted twenty-one percent of an employee's\r\nsalary and that, in her capacity as department head, she\r\nbudgeted twenty-one percent of her supervisees' salaries as\r\nbenefits.  On this basis, the jury awarded Dr. McMillan an\r\nadditional twenty-one percent of her back pay award to\r\nrepresent the value of the lost benefits.\r\n    Lost benefits are recoverable only if the plaintiff has\r\noffered evidence of out-of-pocket expenses for the same\r\nbenefits.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 965 (E.D. Pa. 1985).  In this case,\r\neven if the budgeted value of benefits corresponding to\r\nplaintiff's salary had been less than the budgeted value of\r\nbenefits corresponding to the salaries of the other\r\ndepartment heads, plaintiff presented no evidence that she\r\nincurred insurance expenses.  In addition, she presented no\r\nevidence that any employer-contributed retirement benefits\r\nwere tied to the amount of her salary.  Further, that\r\nbenefits may have amounted to twenty-one percent of her\r\nsupervisees' salaries does not mean that benefits constituted\r\nan equal percentage of higher salaries.  Indeed, it would be\r\nlogical to expect that employer insurance contributions at\r\nall salary levels were substantially the same and that,\r\ntherefore, benefits were a considerably lower percentage of\r\nhigher salaries.  Because there was no competent evidence\r\nfrom which a reasonable jury could conclude that Dr. McMillan\r\nsuffered any loss in benefits as a result of her lower\r\nsalary, Dr. McMillan's back pay award should be accordingly\r\nreduced by the amount of the lost benefits award.\r\n    Defendants' third argument is that we should import the\r\nthree-year cap on back pay liability under the EPA, see 29\r\nU.S.C.  255, to Dr. McMillan's state back pay award under\r\nchapter 151B.  This argument is without merit.  No court\r\ndecisions impose such a cap under Massachusetts law, and\r\ndefendants present no rationale as to why state law should be\r\nthe same as federal law.  Further, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,\r\nas interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\r\n(\"SJC\"), mandates \"make-whole relief,\" which encompasses\r\ndamages which are \"the natural and probable consequences of\r\nthe illegal conduct.\"  Conway v.

We thus\r\ndecline to adopt defendants' suggestion.\r\n    Fourth, defendants contend that Dr. McMillan's punitive\r\ndamages award against the MSPCA on her pay discrimination\r\nclaim should be set aside, or, alternatively, that a new\r\ntrial should be granted on the issue.  They challenge the\r\npunitive damages award on the basis that it was unwarranted,\r\nexcessive, and obtained as a result of irrelevant testimony\r\nabout Dr. Gambardella's termination of Dr. McMillan.  We\r\nagree with defendants that the award was unwarranted and\r\nexcessive.\r\n    In a lawsuit such as this one, in which state law provides\r\nthe basis of decision, \"the propriety of an award of punitive\r\ndamages for the conduct in question, and the factors the jury\r\nmay consider in determining their amount, are questions of\r\nstate law.\"  Browning-Ferris Ind. v.

In reviewing an award of punitive damages,\r\nour role is to determine whether the district court abused\r\nits discretion in determining that the jury's award of\r\npunitive damages was within the confines of state law and\r\nthat defendants are not entitled to a new trial or\r\nremittitur.  See id. at 279.  Although juries have wide\r\ndiscretion in determining the amount of punitive damages, and\r\nthe trial court has broad discretion to affirm the jury's\r\naward of damages, see Fishman v. Clancy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453182\"><a href=\"/opinion/453182/donna-fishman-v-william-j-clancey-donna-fishman-v-william-j-clancy/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489-90\r\n(1st Cir. 1985), appeals courts should reduce or set aside\r\nawards that are \"grossly excessive\" or \"shocking to the\r\nconscience,\" id. at 489 (citing LaForest v.

Although the\r\nstatute authorizes punitive damages, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n151B,  9, it does not specify when they should be awarded. \r\nHowever, other punitive damages provisions in Massachusetts\r\nlaw provide that such damages shall apply only on a finding\r\nthat defendants' conduct was wilful, wanton, or reckless,\r\nsee, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 229,  2, and the SJC has\r\nfurther refined the criteria, holding that punitive damages\r\nare warranted \"where a defendant's conduct warrants\r\ncondemnation and deterrence,\" Bain v. City of Springfield,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (1997).\r\n    Dr. McMillan contends that, because the jury found\r\nintentional discrimination, she was eligible for an award of\r\npunitive damages if the jury so decided in its discretion. \r\nWe observe, however, that nowhere does Massachusetts law\r\nstate that a finding of intentional discrimination\r\nnecessarily justifies an award of punitive damages.  This\r\naccords with the logic that, even in situations involving\r\nintentional misconduct, compensatory damages may provide\r\nsufficient punishment and deterrence.  See Smith v. Wade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110915\"><a href=\"/opinion/110915/smith-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (1983); see also Rowlett v.

Cf. Smith, 461 U.S. at 52 (observing that whether\r\npunitive damages are appropriate turns on whether the\r\ntortfeasor's conduct \"is of the sort that calls for\r\ndeterrence and punishment over and above that provided by\r\ncompensatory awards\").  It follows, then, that just as we may\r\nreview the record to determine whether a reasonable jury\r\ncould have found that the defendants intentionally\r\ndiscriminated against Dr. McMillan, we may also review the\r\nrecord to determine whether a reasonable jury could have\r\nfound defendants' conduct sufficiently worthy of condemnation\r\nand deterrence to justify exemplary damages.\r\n    Although we affirm the jury's finding of discrimination, we\r\ncannot say, on the basis of the record before us, that Dr.\r\nThornton's and the MSPCA's intentional misconduct calls for\r\npunishment and deterrence beyond that secured by the\r\ncompensatory award.  Determining what conduct rises to the\r\nlevel at which an award of punitive damages is appropriate is\r\na difficult task, but the evidence shows that the actions at\r\nissue in this case do not.  We therefore hold that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in upholding the award\r\nof punitive damages, and that the award of punitive damages\r\nin this case constitutes a grossly excessive award of damages\r\nthat shocks the conscience.  \r\n    Fifth, defendants argue that the MSPCA's liability is limited\r\nto $20,000 by a damages cap for charitable organizations\r\nunder the Massachusetts charitable immunity law, which\r\nprovides that liability for any \"cause of action based on\r\ntort brought against a [charitable] corporation\" shall not\r\nexceed $20,000 exclusive of interest and costs.  See Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 231,  85K.  Although this statute applies to\r\nnegligent, reckless, and intentional torts in the employment\r\ncontext, see St. Clair v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 25 Mass.\r\nApp. Ct. 662, 665-66 (1988), it has been unclear whether a\r\nclaim under chapter 151B is a \"cause of action based on tort\"\r\nand thus subject to the $20,000 limitation.  We conclude that\r\nit is not.\r\n    Defendants and plaintiff engage in extensive exercises of\r\ninterpretation to suggest the relevance of a variety of cases\r\nto this issue.  Ultimately, we agree with Dr. McMillan that\r\nLinkage Corp. v. Trustees of Boston Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27\r\n(1997), provides the most guidance.  In that case, the SJC\r\nheld that the chapter 231, section 85K damages limitation\r\ndoes not apply to damages awarded under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n93A, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute, on the\r\nbasis that chapter 93A \"creates an independent statutory\r\nbasis of liability\" and \"forbid[s] conduct not previously\r\nunlawful under the common law of contract and tort or under\r\nany prior statute,\" id. (internal citation omitted).  Like\r\nchapter 93A, chapter 151B creates rights that did not exist\r\nunder the common law, see, e.g., Melley v.

We think\r\nthat it was an abuse of discretion to award the same rate for\r\nall tasks performed by Dr. McMillan's counsel, without regard\r\nto the nature of the tasks.  Accordingly, we remand this\r\nissue in order that the court may determine those tasks which\r\ncould have been adequately performed by a less-experienced\r\nlawyer or by a secretary or paralegal.  The compensation for\r\ntasks so designated should be reduced to an appropriate\r\nlevel.\r\n    Finally, defendants argue that the trial court erred by\r\ncomputing interest on the back pay award from the date on\r\nwhich the cause of action accrued, rather than from the date\r\nplaintiff filed her complaint.  This argument has no merit. \r\nAs the district court stated, \"the purpose of interest is to\r\ninsure that the present value of an award fully compensates a\r\nplaintiff for her losses.\"  Moreover, the SJC has held that\r\nan award of interest may be used to make an aggrieved party\r\nwhole in chapter 151B actions.  See Conway, 402 Mass. at 390\r\nn.7.  Here, an award of interest from the date Dr. McMillan\r\nwas paid less than her counterparts comports with these\r\nstandards.\r\nC.  Cross-Appeal\r\n    Plaintiff cross-appeals from the district court's grant of\r\njudgment as a matter of law in favor of defendants setting\r\naside the jury's finding that Dr. Gambardella had tortiously\r\ninterfered with Dr. McMillan's employment relationship with\r\nthe MSPCA.  She argues that she presented ample evidence\r\nduring the trial to show that Dr. Gambardella's actions\r\nleading up to and including her termination were based on \"an\r\nimproper motive, active animosity and spite.\"  We do not\r\nagree.\r\n    Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the\r\nplaintiff, see Morrison, 108 F.3d at 436, we conclude that\r\nthe evidence did not permit a reasonable jury to find for the\r\nplaintiff.  Under Massachusetts law, to make out the tort of\r\nintentional interference with a contractual relationship, a\r\nplaintiff must present evidence of \"actual malice\" or a\r\n\"spiteful, malignant purpose, unrelated to the legitimate\r\ncorporate interest.\"  Shea v.

To support her claim of tortious\r\ninterference, Dr. McMillan points to O'Brien v. New England\r\nTel. &amp; Tel. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1996), in which the SJC\r\nheld reasonable a jury's finding that an employer tortiously\r\ninterfered with an employment relationship when he\r\nincessantly harassed employee, called her names in front of\r\ncoworkers, and actively sought to make her cry.  The facts of\r\nO'Brien are, however, much more egregious than those in this\r\ncase.  Insensitive though Dr. Gambardella's actions may have\r\nbeen, they did not demonstrate that type of ill will that the\r\nemployer's actions in O'Brien did.  We think that the\r\ndistrict court properly concluded that these actions and\r\nstatements did not demonstrate \"anything more than a\r\npersonality conflict with Dr. McMillan.\"  For the most part,\r\nDr. Gambardella's actions were properly within the scope of\r\nhis duties as chief of staff at Angell, and, in any event,\r\nthey failed to evince malevolent intent.  No reasonable jury\r\ncould have concluded otherwise.\r\n    Dr. McMillan argues next that the district court erred by\r\ngranting the MSPCA, Dr. Thornton, and Dr. Gambardella summary\r\njudgment as to her claim that her termination was in\r\nretaliation for her filing of an administrative complaint of\r\nsex discrimination in 1989.  She asserts that the district\r\ncourt misapplied the law in ruling that she had failed to\r\nestablish a causal connection between the filing and her\r\ntermination because too much time had lapsed between the two\r\nevents.  She also argues that the court improperly viewed the\r\nfacts from the defendants' perspective.\r\n    We review the district court's grant of summary judgment to\r\ndefendants de novo.  See Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v.\r\nDaley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197563\"><a href=\"/opinion/197563/associated-fisheries-v-us-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (1st Cir. 1997).  Further, to\r\ndetermine whether the summary judgment record is sufficient\r\nto support a finding that the employment action was\r\nretaliatory, we review only those facts that were available\r\nat the summary judgment stage, construing all facts and\r\ninferences therefrom in favor of the plaintiff.  See Aybar v.\r\nCrispin-Reyes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197430\"><a href=\"/opinion/197430/aybar-v-crispin-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    To succeed on a retaliation claim under both state and\r\nfederal law, when, as here, there is no direct evidence of\r\nretaliatory animus, a plaintiff must both establish a prima\r\nfacie case and prove that the defendants' legitimate business\r\nreasons for terminating the plaintiff were pretextual.  SeeFennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718191\"><a href=\"/opinion/718191/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1305-34-fedrserv3d-1566-rachel-l-fennell/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (discussing Title VII's analytical framework);\r\nLewis v. Gillette, Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195335\"><a href=\"/opinion/195335/lewis-v-gillette-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(observing that Massachusetts retaliation law parallels\r\nfederal law).  Specifically, to establish a prima facie case\r\nof retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in\r\nprotected conduct under federal or Massachusetts law; (2) she\r\nsuffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal\r\nconnection existed between the protected conduct and the\r\nadverse action.  See Fennell, 83 F.3d at 535.  Once the\r\nplaintiff has made a prima facie showing, the burden of\r\nproduction shifts to the defendant to articulate a\r\nlegitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its employment\r\ndecision.  See id.  If the defendant does so, the plaintiff\r\nmust show that the defendant's proffered reason was not, in\r\nfact, the real reason for the decision and that the decision\r\nwas the result of the defendant's retaliatory animus.  Seeid.\r\n    We conclude that Dr. McMillan did not establish a prima facie\r\ncase because she presented no evidence of a causal link\r\nbetween her termination and the filing of her complaint.  The\r\nstrongest argument Dr. McMillan makes in this regard is that\r\nDr. Gambardella urged her not to file an MCAD complaint,\r\nstating that her doing so would make their relationship\r\ndifficult.  But, in light of undisputed facts in the summary\r\njudgment record, this does not suggest a causal connection\r\nbetween Dr. McMillan's filing of the discrimination claim, on\r\none hand, and the actual deterioration and eventual\r\ntermination of the employment relationship, on the other. \r\nThe MSPCA and Dr. Gambardella asserted that Dr. McMillan had\r\nhad an acrimonious relationship with other department heads\r\nand staff veterinarians at Angell, that she refused to treat\r\nbirds after Angell refused to purchase her bird practice or\r\npay her separately for the time she spent with avian\r\npatients, and that Dr. Gambardella received complaints from\r\nstaff members about Dr. McMillan's attitude.  Indeed, Dr.\r\nGambardella stated that, by late 1991, his relationship with\r\nDr. McMillan had deteriorated to the extent that he told Dr.\r\nThornton that he would himself resign if Dr. McMillan were\r\nnot terminated.\r\n    In addition, we agree with the district court that, even if\r\nDr. McMillan had established a prima facie case, she did not\r\npresent material facts that would permit a reasonable jury to\r\nfind that Dr. Gambardella's explanation for her firing was\r\npretextual and influenced instead by a retaliatory motive. \r\nAlthough plaintiff presented evidence that she continued to\r\nwork hard and to maintain a good relationship with much of\r\nthe veterinary staff, she simply did not proffer evidence to\r\nrefute defendants' showing that the veterinary staff\r\ncomplained to Dr. Gambardella about her performance and\r\ndemeanor.  In light of this undisputed evidence, even if Dr.\r\nGambardella may have exercised arguably poor business\r\njudgment in terminating her, and in doing so in an abrupt,\r\nclumsy, and unfeeling manner, it would be unreasonable on the\r\nevidence for a factfinder to conclude that his explanation\r\nfor the termination was, in fact, not the true reason.  We\r\ntherefore decline to order a new trial on this issue.\r\n    Third, Dr. McMillan argues that the district court improperly\r\ngranted the MSPCA summary judgment on her claim that the\r\nMSPCA's failure to comply with the progressive discipline\r\npolicy outlined in its Rules and Regulations Memorandum\r\nconstituted a breach of contract because the policy was a\r\ncontract governing her employment.  She contends that the\r\ncourt improperly applied in a \"wooden\" fashion factors set\r\nforth in Jackson v. Action for Boston Community Dev., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2221330\"><a href=\"/opinion/2221330/jackson-v-action-for-boston-community-development-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14-15 (1988), for determining whether a personnel\r\nmanual's policy guidelines constitute a binding employment\r\nagreement.  For support, she relies on O'Brien, 422 Mass. at\r\n691-93, in which the SJC held that the terms of an employees'\r\nmanual become part of an implied employment contract if the\r\nparties so agree, even if the  terms of the manual have not\r\nbeen negotiated, and even if, in a continuing employment\r\nrelationship, an employee only reasonably believed that the\r\nemployer \"was presenting the manual as a statement of the\r\nconditions under which employment would continue.\"  Id. at\r\n693.\r\n      We agree with the district court's reasoning on this issue\r\nand its observation that, although personnel manuals may\r\nsometimes constitute an employment agreement, see Jackson,\r\n403 Mass. at 13, the facts Dr. McMillan alleged do not\r\nsupport such an inference.  As the district court observed,\r\n\"Dr. McMillan does not claim to have bargained for any of the\r\nterms of the manual, to have signed the manual, or to have\r\nexecuted any other employment agreement with the MSPCA. \r\nMoreover, the manual described itself as a disciplinary\r\nguideline that 'is not all inclusive.'\"  McMillan v. MSPCA,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1408417\"><a href=\"/opinion/1408417/mcmillan-v-massachusetts-soc-of-cruelty-to-animals/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 910 (D. Mass. 1995).  Contrary to Dr.\r\nMcMillan's assertion, the court's analysis was not an\r\napplication of inflexible prerequisites to finding an\r\nemployment contract.  Rather, the court's analysis employs\r\nthe factors appropriately, as mere guidelines in the\r\ndetermination.  See O'Brien, 422 Mass. at 692.  We do the\r\nsame.  In addition to the factors highlighted by the district\r\ncourt, we note additionally that there is no evidence that\r\nDr. McMillan reasonably expected that the MSPCA would follow\r\nthe procedures with regard to her conduct or that of other\r\nsupervisory veterinarians at Angell.\r\n    Dr. McMillan's next argument is that she should be granted a\r\nnew trial on her claim for emotional distress damages.  Dr.\r\nMcMillan withdrew that claim after the district court adopted\r\na magistrate's ruling ordering the disclosure of records of\r\nDr. McMillan's therapist, which defendants had requested\r\nduring discovery.  Dr. McMillan argues that we must review\r\nthis matter de novo, in light of Jaffee v. Redmond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118042\"><a href=\"/opinion/118042/jaffee-v-redmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118042\"><a href=\"/opinion/118042/jaffee-v-redmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1923</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996), in which the Supreme Court\r\nrecognized a federal privilege against the compelled\r\ndisclosure of counseling records.  In the alternative, she\r\nargues that the district court erred as a matter of law and\r\nabused its discretion in its determination of the privilege\r\nissue.\r\n    We need not resolve these issues, however, because, as\r\ndefendants rightly point out, Dr. McMillan's withdrawal of\r\nher claim for emotional distress damages constituted a waiver\r\nof the claim.  This rule holds regardless whether new law has\r\nemerged which potentially may bolster a party's argument.\r\n    Finally, Dr. McMillan argues that the district court abused\r\nits discretion by determining that attorney's fees\r\nrepresenting work on Dr. McMillan's contract and emotional\r\ndistress claims were noncompensable and, accordingly, by\r\nreducing the attorney's fee award by twenty percent.  She\r\nargues that the court was wrong in concluding that the\r\ncontract claims were severable and not connected to the\r\ndiscrimination claims and thus not compensable.  Further, she\r\ncontends that the claims together represent no more than\r\nthree percent of the total time documented.\r\n    As the district court correctly observed, fee awards are\r\nappropriate only for successful claims; unsuccessful claims\r\nwarrant a fee award only if they are connected to the\r\nsuccessful ones.  Krewson v. City of Quincy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  Having determined that Dr. McMillan's\r\nunsuccessful emotional distress and contract claims were not\r\nconnected with her successful claims, the court thought\r\nappropriate \"some apportionment between successful and\r\nunsuccessful claims,\" and correspondingly reduced the award\r\nby twenty percent.\r\n    \"As a general rule, a fee-awarding court that makes a\r\nsubstantial reduction in either documented time or\r\nauthenticated rates should offer reasonably explicit\r\nfindings, for the court, in such circumstances, 'has a burden\r\nto spell out the whys and wherefores.'\"  Brewster v. Dukakis,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194891\"><a href=\"/opinion/194891/brewster-v-dukakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v.\r\nMetropolitan Dist. Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506188\"><a href=\"/opinion/506188/united-states-v-metropolitan-district-commission-conservation-law/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 1988)). \r\nAlthough the district court did not explicitly state why it\r\nregarded the contract claims as unconnected to the\r\ndiscrimination claims, we do not think the court abused its\r\ndiscretion in making that determination and in denying fees\r\nfor the time spent on that claim,   or on the emotional\r\ndistress claim, which is even more clearly unrelated to Dr.\r\nMcMillan's successful claims.\r\n    It is not so easily discernable, however, that twenty percent\r\nwas a proper reduction.  Although the district court has\r\nconsiderable discretion in determining fee awards, and\r\nalthough, as defendants point out, the fee petition is not\r\namenable to easy analysis, our review of the fee petition\r\ndoes not convince us that the time plaintiff's counsel spent\r\non the contract and emotional distress issues could\r\nreasonably be regarded as twenty percent of the total time\r\ndocumented.    In such a situation, the district court\r\nshould, at a very minimum, make clear why it chose to reduce\r\nthe fee award by such a substantial percentage.  Because the\r\ncourt in this case provided no elaboration for the reduction,\r\nwe remand this issue to the district court for\r\nreconsideration.  \r\n                          III.\r\n                       CONCLUSION\r\n  We affirm the district court's denial of judgment as a matter\r\nof law on plaintiff's pay discrimination claims and, in part,\r\nthe jury's award of compensatory damages, and we vacate the\r\njury's award of punitive damages.  In addition, we remand for\r\na recalculation of the damages in light of our determination\r\nthat an amount representing lost benefits should not have\r\n been included in the award, and for recalculation of\r\nattorney's fees with regard to hourly compensation rates and\r\nthe fee reduction for time spent on plaintiff's contract and\r\n              emotional distress claims.\r\n                         SO ORDERED.\n</pre>",
