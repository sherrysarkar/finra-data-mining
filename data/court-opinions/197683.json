Upon careful  review  of the  briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nrecord, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion in  denying plaintiff's  1993 or  1995 motions  to\r\n\namend his complaint.  Even  in light of plaintiff's prior pro\r\n\nse  status and his various letters  and motions in 1990-1991,\r\n\nwe cannot say  that the district court was  required in 1990-\r\n\n1991  to offer plaintiff  any additional advice  or to create\r\n\nany  additional  opportunity  for   plaintiff  to  amend  his\r\n\ncomplaint. \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
