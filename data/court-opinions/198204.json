This is a single-issue criminal appeal in\r\nwhich the defendant argues that the police lacked reasonable\r\nsuspicion to stop the taxicab in which he was traveling.  The\r\nproper inquiry is fact-contingent, and an inquiring court must\r\nconsider the totality of the relevant circumstances.  See United\r\nStates v. Stanley, 915 F.2d 54, 55 (1st Cir. 1990).  Viewing the\r\ncircumstances here extant as a whole, through the eyes of\r\nreasonable, yet experienced, police officers, see United States v.\r\nTrullo, 809 F.2d 108, 112 (1st Cir. 1987), we have no doubt but\r\nthat the police had a sufficient basis reasonably to suspect that\r\nthe cab contained the individual who had attempted to commit the\r\ncrime.  See United States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nConsequently, the minimal intrusion that the stop entailed was\r\nfully justified.  See id.\r\n\nWe need go no further.  The judgment below will be\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",
