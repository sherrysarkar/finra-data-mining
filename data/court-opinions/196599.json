Appellant Linda Lambert  appeals from\r                                \r\n\nthe district court's decision revoking her term of supervised\r\n\nrelease and  sentencing her for violating a  condition of her\r\n\nsupervised  release.    Having  concluded  that  the   appeal\r\n\npresents no  substantial question of  law or fact,  we hereby\r\n\nsummarily  affirm the court's decision under Local Rule 27.1.\r\n\nFor the same  reason, we deny her motion  for release pending\r\n\nappeal.  See 18 U.S.C.   3143(b)(1)(B).  \r                        \r\n\n          Lambert's primary contention on appeal  is that the\r\n\ncourt did not  explicitly consider, apply, or  articulate the\r\n\nsentencing  factors  set  forth in  18  U.S.C.    3553(a)(1),\r\n\n(a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(6).  In this circuit, a sentencing\r\n\ncourt need not make explicit findings on statutory sentencing\r\n\nfactors, as  long as the  record reveals that the  court made\r\n\nimplicit findings  or otherwise evinced its  consideration of\r\n\nthe  relevant factors.   See, e.g., United  States v. Savoie,\r                                                                        \r\n\n985 F.2d 612,  618 (1st Cir. 1993) (restitution  order).  For\r\n\nthe reasons persuasively stated in the government's brief, we\r\n\nhave  no doubt  that the  district  court gave  the requisite\r\n\nthought to all applicable statutory sentencing factors.\r\n\n          Lambert's remaining contentions are also meritless.\r\n\nFirst,  in  sentencing  Lambert, the  court  was  required to\r\n\nconsider  applicable  United   States  Sentencing  Commission\r\n\npolicy   statements,  including   statements  pertaining   to\r\n\nsupervised   release   violations.      See   18   U.S.C.    \r                                                       \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n3553(a)(4)(B),  (5).    Second,  as  the  revocation  hearing\r\n\ntranscript makes plain,  the court had no  punitive intent in\r\n\nrevoking Lambert's term of supervised release  and sentencing\r\n\nher  as  it  did.   Rather,  it  sought  to devise  the  most\r\n\neffective  means to ensure  her rehabilitation from  the drug\r\n\nabuse behind her crime of conviction.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
