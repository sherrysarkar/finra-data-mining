Pedro Gómez-Genao, an illegal\n\nalien, was convicted of possessing with intent to distribute some\n\nthirteen bales of cocaine, smuggled from a beach in Puerto Rico, and\n\naiding and abetting two others to do the same.    21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\n\n(1994); 18 U.S.C. § 2 (1994).    He was also convicted of being in the\n\nUnited States illegally.   8 U.S.C. §§ 1326(a)(2) and (b)(2) (1994\n\n& Supp. II 1996).   He left a fake resident alien card with his\n\nphotograph on it at the scene of the crime.    He was sentenced to\n\ntwenty years.\n\n         Gómez-Genao appeals, arguing that his Sixth Amendment\n\nrights were violated by the government’s failure to identify a\n\nconfidential source, Graciano Santana, who was neither a witness to\n\nnor a participant in the crimes charged.    Santana’s role was\n\ndifferent.   He knew Gómez-Genao as \"Soler\" and Soler had indirectly\n\nand directly bragged to him about the drug smuggling, saying that he\n\nwould receive $1,000 per kilo of cocaine for his role.    Santana told\n\nthe police, who eventually identified Soler and located him.      The\n\ngovernment’s reasons for not turning over the name were fears for\n\nSantana’s safety.   The street value of the 325 bricks of smuggled\n\ncocaine was in the millions of dollars, a fact which suggests a large\n\ncriminal organization, which in turn underlies the government’s fear.\n\n         The government responded negatively to Gómez-Genao’s oral\n\nrequest, first raised in November 1999, for the identity of the\n\n                                -3-\n\fconfidential source.   It withheld the name from the Jencks material\n\nit provided on June 9, 2000.   Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657\n\n(1957).   Nonetheless, Gómez-Genao did not ever move that the\n\ngovernment be compelled to produce the name until June 12, 2000, two\n\ndays before the trial began.   Gómez-Genao was given the name of the\n\nconfidential source on June 14, just before trial.   He was given\n\nSantana’s criminal history as well, and used that history to cross-\n\nexamine Santana.   The name was given to Gómez-Genao before the court\n\nhad the opportunity to rule on the motion.\n\n          In order to protect the public interest in effective law\n\nenforcement, the government may withhold the identity of a\n\nconfidential source.   Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 59\n\n(1957).   There are limits to withholding that information where the\n\ndisclosure of the identity of the informant \"is relevant and helpful\n\nto the defense . . . or is essential to a fair determination of a\n\ncause . . . .\" Id. at 60-61.\n\n          Gómez-Genao bears the burden of persuasion that he was\n\nentitled to the information, a burden described as heavy.    United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104, 106 (1st Cir. 1998).   Had Gómez-\n\nGenao filed his motion earlier and given the district court time to\n\nrule on it before trial, and had the court so ruled, we would have\n\nreviewed that ruling for abuse of discretion.   United States v.\n\nLewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1335 (1st Cir. 1994).   However, Gómez-Genao\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fneither gave the court enough time to rule on the matter pre-trial,\n\nnor asked for a continuance, so he is ill-situated to complain.\n\n           On appeal, Gómez-Genao has shown neither a need for the\n\ninformation nor that he was prejudiced by not having the information\n\nbefore June 14.   See United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 921\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (\"[D]efendants have an obligation to provide at least\n\nsome explanation of how the informant's testimony would have\n\nsupported their alleged defenses.\").     We note that Gómez-Genao knew\n\nwho it was he had bragged to about the crime.     Santana was neither a\n\nparticipant in the crime, nor an observer of it.     At most he was a\n\ntipster.   When the informant is a tipster as opposed to a participant\n\nin the crime, disclosure of the informant's identity when there is a\n\nperceived threat is only required in exceptional circumstances under\n\nwhich it is vital to a fair trial.     Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1335.   Gómez-\n\nGenao speculates that if he had known the identity earlier, he could\n\nhave hired an investigator.   The investigator might have come up with\n\nsomething more, such as whether Santana and Gómez-Genao did eat lunch\n\ntogether in the cafeteria where the bragging occurred.     That is not\n\nenough.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f          United States Court of Appeals\n                    For the First Circuit\n                     ____________________\n\nNo. 01-1181\n\n\n                   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                           Appellee,\n\n                              v.\n\n                      PEDRO GÓMEZ-GENAO,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n                     ____________________\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n       [Hon.

Nonetheless, Gomez-Genao did not ever move that the  government be compelled to produce the name until June 12, 2000, two  days before the trial began.  Gomez-Genao was given the name of the  confidential source on June 14, just before trial.  He was given  Santana's criminal history as well, and used that history to cross-examine Santana.  The name was given to Gomez-Genao before the court  had the opportunity to rule on the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to protect the public interest in effective law  enforcement, the government may withhold the identity of a  confidential source.

There are limits to withholding that information where the  disclosure of the identity of the informant \"is relevant and helpful  to the defense . . . or is essential to a fair determination of a  cause . . . .\" Id. at 60-61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gomez-Genao bears the burden of persuasion that he was  entitled to the information, a burden described as heavy.  United  States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197938\"><a href=\"/opinion/197938/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 106 (1st Cir. 1998).  Had Gomez-Genao filed his motion earlier and given the district court time to  rule on it before trial, and had the court so ruled, we would have  reviewed that ruling for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195723\"><a href=\"/opinion/195723/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span>, 1335 (1st Cir. 1994).  However, Gomez-Genao  neither gave the court enough time to rule on the matter pre-trial,  nor asked for a continuance, so he is ill-situated to complain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gomez-Genao has shown neither a need for the  information nor that he was prejudiced by not having the information  before June 14.  See United States v. Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553838\"><a href=\"/opinion/553838/united-states-v-victor-martinez-united-states-of-america-v-hector-vidal/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 921  (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[D]efendants have an obligation to provide at least  some explanation of how the informant's testimony would have  supported their alleged defenses.\").  We note that Gomez-Genao knew  who it was he had bragged to about the crime.  Santana was neither a  participant in the crime, nor an observer of it.  At most he was a  tipster.  When the informant is a tipster as opposed to a participant  in the crime, disclosure of the informant's identity when there is a  perceived threat is only required in exceptional circumstances under  which it is vital to a fair trial.  Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1335.  Gomez-Genao speculates that if he had known the identity earlier, he could  have hired an investigator.  The investigator might have come up with  something more, such as whether Santana and Gomez-Genao did eat lunch  together in the cafeteria where the bragging occurred.  That is not  enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Eastern District of Virginia, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
