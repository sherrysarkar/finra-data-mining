The plea agreement required Santana\r\n\nto   cooperate   in  the   government's  investigation   of  drug\r\n\ntrafficking,  drug-related  murders,  firearms  trafficking,  and\r\n\nother criminal  violations, and to continue  to provide complete,\r\n\ntruthful  and accurate  information and  testimony on  an ongoing\r\n\nbasis.   In return, the  government agreed to  request a downward\r\n\ndeparture for \"substantial assistance.\"  \r\n\n          Santana contended below that  he complied with the plea\r\n\nagreement  by  providing information  which  the  government used\r\n\nagainst his codefendants,  and by  testifying at the  trial of  a\r\n\ncodefendant.   Thus, he argued, the government acted in bad faith\r\n\nby  refusing to  request a  downward departure.   The  government\r\n\nresponded, and  the district court agreed,  that Santana breached\r\n\nthe  plea agreement by failing  to disclose, inter  alia, all his\r                                                                  \r\n\nknowledge about  the drug-related murders, thereby  relieving the\r\n\ngovernment of  its contingent obligation.
