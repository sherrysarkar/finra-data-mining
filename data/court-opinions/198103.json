Berman, with whom Raskin &amp; Berman was on brief,\r\nfor appellant.\r\nEric Kempton Bradford, Office of the United States\r\nTrustee, with whom Paul W. Bridenhagen, Executive Office for United\r\nStates Trustees, was on brief, for amicus curiae J. Christopher\r\nMarshall, United States Trustee.\r\n\n                                     \r\n\n                   August 25, 1998\r\n                                     \r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  The question presented is the\r\nmeaning of \"substantial abuse\" under  707(b) of the Bankruptcy\r\nCode and the criteria by which it is measured.  This is a question\r\nof first instance in this circuit.  A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition\r\nof an individual debtor whose debts are primarily consumer debts\r\nmay be dismissed if the court finds that granting relief would be\r\na \"substantial abuse\" of the Chapter.  See 11 U.S.C.  707(b). \r\nRichard Lamanna sought relief from approximately $15,000\r\nof primarily consumer debt by filing for bankruptcy under Chapter\r\n7.  The bankruptcy court sua sponte dismissed Lamanna's petition as\r\na \"substantial abuse\" of Chapter 7 based on the finding that\r\nLamanna had sufficient disposable income to pay off his debts under\r\na Chapter 13 payment schedule.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\r\n(BAP) affirmed for the same reason.\r\nOn appeal, Lamanna argues that the BAP misconstrued \r\n707(b) as meaning that \"substantial abuse\" automatically exists\r\nwhere a debtor's income exceeds his expenses even minimally. \r\nLamanna says that his expenses are artificially low because he has\r\navoided normal expenses by living with his parents, and that it\r\ncannot constitute \"substantial abuse\" of the bankruptcy system for\r\na debtor to live with parents who subsidize his needs.  Lamanna\r\nalso says that \"substantial abuse\" under  707(b) refers only to\r\nacts of bad faith, and that there is no evidence of bad faith.\r\nAs amicus curiae, the United States Trustee argues that\r\nthe court did not apply a per se future income test.  He emphasizes\r\nthat Lamanna's schedules show that he can repay 100% of his debts\r\nout of future disposable income and that, despite ample\r\nopportunity, Lamanna presented no evidence of countervailing\r\nfactors which militated against dismissal.  The Trustee invites\r\nthis court to adopt the \"totality of circumstances\" test, employed\r\nby both the bankruptcy court and BAP, as the law of this circuit.\r\nWe adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test as the\r\nmeasure of \"substantial abuse\" under  707(b) of the Bankruptcy\r\nCode.  In doing so, we join the Fourth, Sixth, Eighth and Ninth\r\nCircuits in holding that a consumer debtor's ability to repay his\r\ndebts out of future disposable is not per se \"substantial abuse\"\r\nmandating dismissal.  At the same time, we do not require a court\r\nto look beyond the debtor's ability to repay if that factor\r\nwarrants the result.  We explicitly reject the notion that\r\n\"substantial abuse\" refers only to bad faith acts, although a court\r\nmay consider a debtor's bad faith acts in making its decision. \r\nApplying this test, we find that the BAP correctly decided that\r\nallowing Lamanna's petition would constitute a \"substantial abuse\"\r\nof Chapter 7, and affirm.\r\n                          I.\r\nRichard Lamanna, a Rhode Island resident, filed for\r\nbankruptcy under Chapter 7 on February 18, 1997.  Lamanna's\r\nschedules (Schedules F, I &amp; J), filed with his voluntary petition,\r\nshow that he has total unsecured debt of $15,911.96 which is\r\nprimarily consumer debt, his monthly income is $1,350.96, and his\r\nmonthly expenses are $580.  Lamanna's income therefore exceeds his\r\nexpenses by $770.96 per month, the amount of his disposable\r\nincome.  \r\nOn February 24, 1997, the bankruptcy court sua sponte\r\nordered Lamanna to show cause why his petition should not be\r\ndismissed as a \"substantial abuse\" of Chapter 7 under 11 U.S.C. \r\n707(b).  In the show cause order, the court noted that Lamanna's\r\nschedules showed that he was capable of paying 100% of his debts\r\nover three years under a Chapter 13 payment plan.  \r\nAt the show-cause hearing, Lamanna argued that his\r\nexpenses were artificially low because he was living with his\r\nparents.  Without that subsidy, he said, he could not limit his\r\nexpenses to $580 per month and would thus have no disposable income\r\nwith which to pay his debts.  Yet Lamanna acknowledged that his\r\nscheduled expenses and income were accurate and that he did not\r\nanticipate a change in living circumstances, i.e., moving out of\r\nhis parents' house, that would precipitate a rise in living\r\nexpenses.\r\nThe bankruptcy court, applying the \"totality of the\r\ncircumstances\" test, found \"substantial abuse\" and dismissed the\r\ncase.  The BAP affirmed on the same grounds.  Lamanna appeals.\r\n                         II.\r\nThe question of whether allowing Lamanna's bankruptcy\r\npetition would constitute \"substantial abuse\" of Chapter 7 under \r\n707(b) contains two components: first, the proper test by which\r\n\"substantial abuse\" is measured; second, whether, applying that\r\ntest, the BAP correctly decided the issue.  The facts are\r\nundisputed, and we review de novo the B.A.P.'s conclusions of law. \r\nSee In re Healthco Int'l, Inc., 132 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nA.  The \"totality of the circumstances\" test\r\nAlthough \"substantial abuse\" is not self-defining, the\r\nhistory and policies underlying  707(b) give content to its\r\nmeaning and purpose.  That history is well set out in previous\r\nopinions.  See In re Green, 934 F.2d 568, 570 (4th Cir. 1991); In\r\nre Krohn, 886 F.2d 123, 125-26 (6th Cir. 1989); In re Walton, 866\r\nF.2d 981, 983 (8th Cir. 1989); In re Kelly, 841 F.2d  908, 914 (9th\r\nCir. 1988).  We summarize the pertinent points.\r\nSection 707(b) was added to the Bankruptcy Code as part\r\nof the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. \r\nSee Pub. L. 98-353, 98 Stat. 333, 355 (1984) (codified in various\r\nsections of 11 U.S.C. and 28 U.S.C.) (the \"1984 Act\").  It\r\nauthorizes a bankruptcy court, either sua sponte or on the motion\r\nof the United States Trustee, to dismiss the Chapter 7 petition of\r\nan individual debtor who owes primarily consumer debts where\r\nallowing the petition would be a \"substantial abuse\" of Chapter 7. \r\nCongress chose neither to define \"substantial abuse\" in the 1984\r\nAct nor to leave specific guidance in legislative history. \r\nCongress thus left a flexible standard enabling courts to address\r\neach petition on its own merit.  \r\nThe primary impetus for the enactment of  707(b) was the\r\ncredit industry's unhappiness with the fact that consumer debtors\r\nwho were able to repay their debts had increasingly been filing for\r\nbankruptcy relief since the enactment of the 1978 Bankruptcy Act. \r\n\"Prior to 1984, debtors enjoyed a virtually unfettered right to a\r\n'fresh start' under Chapter 7, in exchange for liquidating their\r\nnonexempt assets for the benefit of their creditors.\" Green, 934\r\nF.2d at 570.  Section 707(b) was enacted to impose a restraint on\r\nconsumer debtors' access to Chapter 7 discharge by interposing\r\nbankruptcy courts as gatekeepers who could examine the worthiness\r\nof debtor petitions and dismiss those petitions deemed abusive. \r\nSee id.  As the Walton court summarized,  707(b) was \"aimed\r\nprimarily at stemming the use of Chapter 7 by unneedy debtors.\" \r\nWalton, 866 F.2d at 983.  See also Wayne R. Wells, Janell M. Kurtz\r\n&amp; Robert J. Calhoun, The Implementation of Bankruptcy Code Section\r\n707(b): The Law and the Reality, 39 Clev. St. L. Rev. 15, 28 (1991)\r\n(\"In enacting section 707(b), one concern was consumer debtors with\r\nthe ability to repay their debts were unfairly taking advantage of\r\nbankruptcy to obtain a discharge of indebtedness.\").  \"Substantial\r\nabuse\" thus attempts to moderate the tension between \"uphold[ing]\r\ncreditors' interests in obtaining repayment where such repayment\r\nwould not be a burden,\" Kelly, 841 F.2d at 914, and maintaining the\r\nability of worthy debtors to gain access to Chapter 7's substantial\r\nprotections.  Section 707(b)'s ambiguity is inherent in its\r\nfunction as a guide to equitable discretion.  \r\nWith \"substantial abuse\" lacking specific meaning, it has\r\nfallen to the courts to determine how \"substantial abuse\" ought to\r\nbe measured.  Although tests employed by various courts of appeals\r\ndo not employ precisely the same language, they share common\r\nelements.  First and foremost, it is agreed that a consumer\r\ndebtor's ability to repay his debts out of future disposable income\r\nis strong evidence of \"substantial abuse\".  See Green, 934 F.2d at\r\n572; Krohn, 886 F.2d at 126; Walton, 866 F.2d at 985; Kelly, 841\r\nF.2d at 914-15; see also 6 Lawrence P. King, Collier on Bankruptcy 707.04[4], at 720 (15th ed. rev. 1998) (\"The primary factor that\r\nmay indicate a substantial abuse is the ability of the debtor to\r\nrepay the debts out of future disposable income.\"). Kelly and\r\nWalton focus primarily upon ability to repay, while Green and Krohnemphasize the need to consider the \"totality of the circumstances.\" \r\nKrohn offers this test:\r\nIn determining whether to apply  707(b) to an\r\nindividual debtor, . . . a court should\r\nascertain from the totality of the\r\ncircumstances whether he is merely seeking an\r\nadvantage over his creditors, or is \"honest,\"\r\nin the sense that his relationship with his\r\ncreditors has been marked by essentially\r\nhonorable and undeceptive dealings, and\r\nwhether he is \"needy\" in the sense that his\r\nfinancial predicament warrants the discharge of\r\nhis debts in exchange for liquidation of his\r\nassets.  Substantial abuse can be predicated\r\nupon either lack of honesty or want of need.\r\n. . .\r\n     Among the factors to be considered in\r\ndeciding whether a debtor is needy is his\r\nability to repay his debts out of future\r\nearnings.  That factor alone may be sufficient\r\nto warrant dismissal.  For example, a court\r\nwould not be justified in concluding that a\r\ndebtor is needy and worthy of discharge, where\r\nhis disposable income permits liquidation of\r\nhis consumer debts with relative ease.  Other\r\nfactors relevant to need include whether the\r\ndebtor enjoys a stable source of future\r\nincome, whether he is eligible for adjustments\r\nof his debts through Chapter 13 of the\r\nBankruptcy Code, whether there are state\r\nremedies with the potential to ease his\r\nfinancial predicament, the degree of relief\r\nobtainable through private negotiations, and\r\nwhether his expenses can be reduced\r\nsignificantly without depriving him of\r\nadequate food, clothing, shelter and other\r\nnecessities.\r\n\nKrohn, 886 F.2d at 126-27 (citations omitted).  As described by\r\nKrohn, the \"totality of the circumstances\" test demands a\r\ncomprehensive review of the debtor's current and potential\r\nfinancial situation.\r\nWe adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test largely\r\nas it is described in Krohn.  In so doing, we reject any per se\r\nrules mandating dismissal for \"substantial abuse\" whenever the\r\ndebtor is able to repay his debt out of future disposable income,\r\nor forbidding dismissal on that basis alone.  Such strict\r\ninterpretations cannot be squared with the open-textured nature of\r\n707(b) and are inconsistent with  707(b)'s purpose of guiding,\r\nnot constraining, bankruptcy courts in the exercise of their\r\nequitable discretion.  We hold that a bankruptcy court may, but is\r\nnot required to, find \"substantial abuse\" if the debtor has an\r\nability to repay, in light of all of the circumstances.\r\nIn sum, in assessing the totality of a debtor's\r\ncircumstances, courts should regard the debtor's ability to repay\r\nout of future disposable income as the primary, but not necessarily\r\nconclusive, factor of \"substantial abuse.\"  The factors recited in\r\nKrohn should be regarded as a nonexclusive list of relevant\r\nconsiderations.\r\nB.  Application of the Standard\r\nApplying the \"totality of the circumstances\" test to\r\nLamanna's case results in affirmance of the dismissal of his\r\nChapter 7 petition for \"substantial abuse.\"  Lamanna's schedules\r\nshowed that he has sufficient disposable income to repay his debts\r\nunder a Chapter 13 repayment plan in three to five years.  There is\r\nno evidence that Lamanna's living situation was unstable or likely\r\nto change in the near future.  There is no evidence of other\r\nfactors that cast doubt on the stability of Lamanna's future income\r\nand expenses.  Although Lamanna's expenses are particularly low\r\nbecause he lives with his parents, this state of affairs, as the\r\nBAP noted, \"is not artificial; it is actual.\"  The court properly\r\nbased its decision on the current and foreseeable facts.  If\r\nLamanna's circumstances dramatically change, he is free to seek\r\nrelief anew.\r\nLamanna's argument that the court penalized him for\r\nliving with his parents (and thus having exceptionally low monthly\r\nexpenses) boils down to the notion that  707 requires the\r\nbankruptcy court to impute a minimum cost of living to a debtor and \r\nthen measure the debtor's actual income against the higher of the\r\nimputed minimum and the debtor's actual expenses.  Section 707 does\r\nnot contain such an implicit requirement, and this court will not\r\nwrite such a requirement into the statute.\r\nFinally, we reject Lamanna's argument that the court\r\nimposed a \"mechanically applied future income test\" in determining\r\nthat allowing Lamanna's petition would constitute \"substantial\r\nabuse\" of Chapter 7.  The BAP's decision was not mechanical; it was\r\nsimply uncomplicated.\r\n                         III.\r\nWe adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test as the\r\nmeasure of \"substantial abuse\" under  707(b) in this circuit. \r\nApplying this test, we hold that the court correctly decided to\r\ndismiss Lamanna's Chapter 7 petition.  The decision is affirmed. \r\nCosts are awarded to the United States Trustee.\n",

Congress chose neither to define \"substantial abuse\" in the 1984 Act nor to leave specific guidance in legislative history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Congress thus left a flexible standard enabling courts to address each petition on its own merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary impetus for the enactment of &#167; 707(b) was the credit industry's unhappiness with the fact that consumer debtors who were able to repay their debts had increasingly been filing for bankruptcy relief since the enactment of the 1978 Bankruptcy Act.  \"Prior to 1984, debtors enjoyed a virtually unfettered right to a 'fresh start' under Chapter 7, in exchange for liquidating their nonexempt assets for the benefit of their creditors.\"  Green, 934 F.2d at 570.  Section 707(b) was enacted to impose a restraint on consumer debtors' access to Chapter 7 discharge by interposing bankruptcy courts as gatekeepers who could examine the worthiness of debtor petitions and dismiss those petitions deemed abusive.  See id.   As the Walton court summarized, &#167; 707(b) was \"aimed primarily at stemming the use of Chapter 7 by unneedy debtors.\"  Walton, 866 F.2d at 983;  see also Wayne R. Wells, Janell M. Kurtz &amp; Robert J. Calhoun, The Implementation of Bankruptcy Code Section 707(b):  The Law and the Reality, 39 Clev.  St. L.Rev. 15, 28 (1991) ( \"In enacting section 707(b), one concern was consumer debtors with the ability to repay their debts were unfairly taking advantage of bankruptcy to obtain a discharge of indebtedness.\").  \"Substantial abuse\" thus attempts to moderate the tension between \"uphold[ing] creditors' interests in obtaining repayment where such repayment would not be a burden,\" Kelly, 841 F.2d at 914, and maintaining the ability of worthy debtors to gain access to Chapter 7's substantial protections.  Section 707(b)'s ambiguity is inherent in its function as a guide to equitable discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With \"substantial abuse\" lacking specific meaning, it has fallen to the courts to determine how \"substantial abuse\" ought to be measured.  Although tests employed by various courts of appeals do not employ precisely the same language, they share common elements.  First and foremost, it is agreed that a consumer debtor's ability to repay his debts out of future disposable income is strong evidence of \"substantial abuse\".  See Green, 934 F.2d at 572;  Krohn, 886 F.2d at 126;  Walton, 866 F.2d at 985;  Kelly, 841 F.2d at 914-15;  see also 6 Lawrence P. King, Collier on Bankruptcy p 707.04, at 720 (15th ed. rev.1998) (\"The primary factor that may indicate a substantial abuse is the ability of the debtor to repay the debts out of future disposable income.\").  Kelly and Walton focus primarily upon ability to repay, while Green and Krohn emphasize the need to consider the \"totality of the circumstances.\"  Krohn offers this test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>In determining whether to apply &#167; 707(b) to an individual debtor, ... a court should ascertain from the totality of the circumstances whether he is merely seeking an advantage over his creditors, or is \"honest,\" in the sense that his relationship with his creditors has been marked by essentially honorable and undeceptive dealings, and whether he is \"needy\" in the sense that his financial predicament warrants the discharge of his debts in exchange for liquidation of his assets.  Substantial abuse can be predicated upon either lack of honesty or want of need.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the factors to be considered in deciding whether a debtor is needy is his ability to repay his debts out of future earnings.  That factor alone may be sufficient to warrant dismissal.  For example, a court would not be justified in concluding that a debtor is needy and worthy of discharge, where his disposable income permits liquidation of his consumer debts with relative ease.  Other factors relevant to need include whether the debtor enjoys a stable source of future income, whether he is eligible for adjustments of his debts through Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, whether there are state remedies with the potential to ease his financial predicament, the degree of relief obtainable through private negotiations, and whether his expenses can be reduced significantly without depriving him of adequate food, clothing, shelter and other necessities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Krohn, 886 F.2d at 126-27 (citations omitted).  As described by Krohn, the \"totality of the circumstances\" test demands a comprehensive review of the debtor's current and potential financial situation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test largely as it is described in Krohn.   In so doing, we reject any per se rules mandating dismissal for \"substantial abuse\" whenever the debtor is able to repay his debt out of future disposable income, or forbidding dismissal on that basis alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Such strict interpretations cannot be squared with the open-textured nature of &#167; 707(b) and are inconsistent with &#167; 707(b)'s purpose of guiding, not constraining, bankruptcy courts in the exercise of their equitable discretion.  We hold that a bankruptcy court may, but is not required to, find \"substantial abuse\" if the debtor has an ability to repay, in light of all of the circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, in assessing the totality of a debtor's circumstances, courts should regard the debtor's ability to repay out of future disposable income as the primary, but not necessarily conclusive, factor of \"substantial abuse.\"   The factors recited in Krohn should be regarded as a nonexclusive list of relevant considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Application of the Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the \"totality of the circumstances\" test to Lamanna's case results in affirmance of the dismissal of his Chapter 7 petition for \"substantial abuse.\"   Lamanna's schedules showed that he has sufficient disposable income to repay his debts under a Chapter 13 repayment plan in three to five years.  There is no evidence that Lamanna's living situation was unstable or likely to change in the near future.  There is no evidence of other factors that cast doubt on the stability of Lamanna's future income and expenses.  Although Lamanna's expenses are particularly low because he lives with his parents, this state of affairs, as the BAP noted, \"is not artificial;  it is actual.\"   The court properly based its decision on the current and foreseeable facts.  If Lamanna's circumstances dramatically change, he is free to seek relief anew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lamanna's argument that the court penalized him for living with his parents (and thus having exceptionally low monthly expenses) boils down to the notion that &#167; 707 requires the bankruptcy court to impute a minimum cost of living to a debtor and then measure the debtor's actual income against the higher of the imputed minimum and the debtor's actual expenses.  Section 707 does not contain such an implicit requirement, and this court will not write such a requirement into the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject Lamanna's argument that the court imposed a \"mechanically applied future income test\" in determining that allowing Lamanna's petition would constitute \"substantial abuse\" of Chapter 7.

There is no evidence of bad faith in this case, he says, hence there is no \"substantial abuse\" warranting dismissal.  In Keniston, the court sought to avoid an analysis of the constitutionality of &#167; 707(b) under the Equal Protection Clause by interpreting &#167; 707(b) to provide an additional check on \"bad faith\" filings under &#167; 105(a).  This interpretation of &#167; 707(b) was specifically rejected in Snow and Haffner, and is not followed by any bankruptcy court in this circuit.  We also reject Keniston 's analysis.

This is a question of first instance in this circuit.  A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition of an individual debtor whose debts are primarily consumer debts may be dismissed if the court finds that granting relief would be a \"substantial abuse\" of the Chapter.  See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 707(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richard Lamanna sought relief from approximately $15,000 of primarily consumer debt by filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. The bankruptcy court sua sponte dismissed Lamanna's petition as a \"substantial abuse\" of Chapter 7 based on the finding that Lamanna had sufficient disposable income to pay off his debts under a Chapter 13 payment schedule.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) affirmed for the same reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lamanna argues that the BAP misconstrued &#167; 707(b) as meaning that \"substantial abuse\" automatically exists where a debtor's income exceeds his expenses even minimally.  Lamanna says that his expenses are artificially low because he has avoided normal expenses by living with his parents, and that it cannot constitute \"substantial abuse\" of the bankruptcy system for a debtor to live with parents who subsidize his needs.  Lamanna also says that \"substantial abuse\" under &#167; 707(b) refers only to acts of bad faith, and that there is no evidence of bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As amicus curiae, the United States Trustee argues that the court did not apply a per se future income test.  He emphasizes that Lamanna's schedules show that he can repay 100% of his debts out of future disposable income and that, despite ample opportunity, Lamanna presented no evidence of countervailing factors which militated against dismissal.  The Trustee invites this court to adopt the \"totality of circumstances\" test, employed by both the bankruptcy court and BAP, as the law of this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test as the measure of \"substantial abuse\" under &#167; 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.  In doing so, we join the Fourth, Sixth, Eighth and Ninth Circuits in holding that a consumer debtor's ability to repay his debts out of future disposable is not per se \"substantial abuse\" mandating dismissal.  At the same time, we do not require a court to look beyond the debtor's ability to repay if that factor warrants the result.  We explicitly reject the notion that \"substantial abuse\" refers only to bad faith acts, although a court may consider a debtor's bad faith acts in making its decision.  Applying this test, we find that the BAP correctly decided that allowing Lamanna's petition would constitute a \"substantial abuse\" of Chapter 7, and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richard Lamanna, a Rhode Island resident, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 on February 18, 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Lamanna's schedules (Schedules F, I &amp; J), filed with his voluntary petition, show that he has total unsecured debt of $15,911.96 which is primarily consumer debt,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> his monthly income is $1,350.96, and his monthly expenses are $580.

Kurtz &amp; Robert J. Calhoun, The Implementation of Bankruptcy Code Section 707(b):  The Law and the Reality, 39 Clev.  St. L.Rev. 15, 28 (1991) ( \"In enacting section 707(b), one concern was consumer debtors with the ability to repay their debts were unfairly taking advantage of bankruptcy to obtain a discharge of indebtedness.\").  \"Substantial abuse\" thus attempts to moderate the tension between \"uphold[ing] creditors' interests in obtaining repayment where such repayment would not be a burden,\" Kelly, 841 F.2d at 914, and maintaining the ability of worthy debtors to gain access to Chapter 7's substantial protections.  Section 707(b)'s ambiguity is inherent in its function as a guide to equitable discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With \"substantial abuse\" lacking specific meaning, it has fallen to the courts to determine how \"substantial abuse\" ought to be measured.  Although tests employed by various courts of appeals do not employ precisely the same language, they share common elements.  First and foremost, it is agreed that a consumer debtor's ability to repay his debts out of future disposable income is strong evidence of \"substantial abuse\".  See Green, 934 F.2d at 572;  Krohn, 886 F.2d at 126;  Walton, 866 F.2d at 985;  Kelly, 841 F.2d at 914-15;  see also 6 Lawrence P. King, Collier on Bankruptcy p 707.04, at 720 (15th ed. rev.1998) (\"The primary factor that may indicate a substantial abuse is the ability of the debtor to repay the debts out of future disposable income.\").  Kelly and Walton focus primarily upon ability to repay, while Green and Krohn emphasize the need to consider the \"totality of the circumstances.\"  Krohn offers this test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>In determining whether to apply &#167; 707(b) to an individual debtor, ... a court should ascertain from the totality of the circumstances whether he is merely seeking an advantage over his creditors, or is \"honest,\" in the sense that his relationship with his creditors has been marked by essentially honorable and undeceptive dealings, and whether he is \"needy\" in the sense that his financial predicament warrants the discharge of his debts in exchange for liquidation of his assets.  Substantial abuse can be predicated upon either lack of honesty or want of need.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the factors to be considered in deciding whether a debtor is needy is his ability to repay his debts out of future earnings.  That factor alone may be sufficient to warrant dismissal.  For example, a court would not be justified in concluding that a debtor is needy and worthy of discharge, where his disposable income permits liquidation of his consumer debts with relative ease.  Other factors relevant to need include whether the debtor enjoys a stable source of future income, whether he is eligible for adjustments of his debts through Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, whether there are state remedies with the potential to ease his financial predicament, the degree of relief obtainable through private negotiations, and whether his expenses can be reduced significantly without depriving him of adequate food, clothing, shelter and other necessities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Krohn, 886 F.2d at 126-27 (citations omitted).  As described by Krohn, the \"totality of the circumstances\" test demands a comprehensive review of the debtor's current and potential financial situation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test largely as it is described in Krohn.   In so doing, we reject any per se rules mandating dismissal for \"substantial abuse\" whenever the debtor is able to repay his debt out of future disposable income, or forbidding dismissal on that basis alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Such strict interpretations cannot be squared with the open-textured nature of &#167; 707(b) and are inconsistent with &#167; 707(b)'s purpose of guiding, not constraining, bankruptcy courts in the exercise of their equitable discretion.  We hold that a bankruptcy court may, but is not required to, find \"substantial abuse\" if the debtor has an ability to repay, in light of all of the circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, in assessing the totality of a debtor's circumstances, courts should regard the debtor's ability to repay out of future disposable income as the primary, but not necessarily conclusive, factor of \"substantial abuse.\"   The factors recited in Krohn should be regarded as a nonexclusive list of relevant considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Application of the Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the \"totality of the circumstances\" test to Lamanna's case results in affirmance of the dismissal of his Chapter 7 petition for \"substantial abuse.\"   Lamanna's schedules showed that he has sufficient disposable income to repay his debts under a Chapter 13 repayment plan in three to five years.  There is no evidence that Lamanna's living situation was unstable or likely to change in the near future.  There is no evidence of other factors that cast doubt on the stability of Lamanna's future income and expenses.  Although Lamanna's expenses are particularly low because he lives with his parents, this state of affairs, as the BAP noted, \"is not artificial;  it is actual.\"   The court properly based its decision on the current and foreseeable facts.  If Lamanna's circumstances dramatically change, he is free to seek relief anew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lamanna's argument that the court penalized him for living with his parents (and thus having exceptionally low monthly expenses) boils down to the notion that &#167; 707 requires the bankruptcy court to impute a minimum cost of living to a debtor and then measure the debtor's actual income against the higher of the imputed minimum and the debtor's actual expenses.  Section 707 does not contain such an implicit requirement, and this court will not write such a requirement into the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject Lamanna's argument that the court imposed a \"mechanically applied future income test\" in determining that allowing Lamanna's petition would constitute \"substantial abuse\" of Chapter 7. The BAP's decision was not mechanical;  it was simply uncomplicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test as the measure of \"substantial abuse\" under &#167; 707(b) in this circuit.  Applying this test, we hold that the court correctly decided to dismiss Lamanna's Chapter 7 petition.  The decision is affirmed.   Costs are awarded to the United States Trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lamanna signed and dated his petition, along with his schedules, on November 22, 1996.  During the four week period immediately prior to signing the documents, he charged $9,994.45 on credit cards and personal credit lines.  This amounts to 63% of Lamanna's total debt.  The Trustee suggests that this may be evidence of bad faith on Lamanna's part.  We decline to decide that issue.  The BAP did not make a finding regarding bad faith in deciding the case, and relied entirely on analysis of Lamanna's ability to repay</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Bankruptcy Code defines \"consumer debt\" as \"debt incurred by an individual primarily for a personal, family, or household purpose.\"  11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(8).

This report warns that \"the number of consumer bankruptcy cases filed each year has risen dramatically\" since enactment of the 1978 Bankruptcy Act.  Id. at 3.

These courts share the Krohn view that a debtor's ability to fund a Chapter 13 plan out of future disposable income is the primary, but not conclusive, factor to be considered in determining whether granting relief would constitute \"substantial abuse.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> For example, a debtor may have such an overwhelming ability to repay that that fact alone may warrant a conclusion of \"substantial abuse.\"   But see Green, 934 F.2d at 572 (stating that ability to pay is insufficient, without more, for \"substantial abuse\" finding)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Lamanna cites to a case from the bankruptcy court for the District of New Hampshire, In re Keniston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1905154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1905154/in-re-keniston/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span> (Bankr.D.N.H.1988), for the proposition that \"substantial abuse\" refers strictly to bad faith acts.  There is no evidence of bad faith in this case, he says, hence there is no \"substantial abuse\" warranting dismissal.  In Keniston, the court sought to avoid an analysis of the constitutionality of &#167; 707(b) under the Equal Protection Clause by interpreting &#167; 707(b) to provide an additional check on \"bad faith\" filings under &#167; 105(a).  This interpretation of &#167; 707(b) was specifically rejected in Snow and Haffner, and is not followed by any bankruptcy court in this circuit.  We also reject Keniston 's analysis.  As stated above, we regard bad faith as part of, but by no means the entirety of, the \"substantial abuse\" calculation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
