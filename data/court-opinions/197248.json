Morrison  against her  employer  Carleton Woolen\r\n\nMills,  Inc. (the  \"Company\"),  and two  of her  supervisors,\r\n\nMichael Riley and Lee Moody.  We affirm certain parts of  the\r\n\ndistrict court's judgment and reverse others.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          In  Count  I  of  her  amended  complaint, Morrison\r\n\nalleged  that she  was subjected  by  Carleton and  the other\r\n\ndefendants to  sexual harassment,  in violation of  the Maine\r\n\nHuman  Rights Act,  5 M.R.S.A.    4551, and Title  VII of the\r\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.   2000e et seq.  In Count\r                                                              \r\n\nII,  she alleged  violation  of the  same  state and  federal\r\n\nstatutes  by reason of sex discrimination.  In Counts III and\r\n\nIV,  Morrison alleged  that defendants  had subjected  her to\r\n\ndiscrimination on account of  disability, in violation of the\r\n\nMaine Human  Rights Act  and the Americans  with Disabilities\r\n\nAct of 1990 (the \"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.   12101 et seq.  \r                                                             \r\n\n          Trial before a jury began  in the district court on\r\n\nOctober  4, 1994.1  The Title VII claims of sexual harassment\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.   By consent  of the parties,  a United States  Magistrate\r\nJudge  presided   over  the   jury  trial   and  subsequently\r\ndetermined the various  non-jury issues.  28 U.S.C.    636(c)\r\n(West 1993).\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n(Count  I) and  sex (gender)  discrimination (Count  II) were\r\n\npresented to the jury  but only insofar as these  claims were\r\n\nbased upon conduct  occurring on or after  November 21, 1991,\r\n\nthe  effective  date  of the  1991  Civil  Rights  Act.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nLandgraf v. USI  Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994).  The ADA\r                                          \r\n\ndisability  discrimination  claim  (Count  IV)  was  likewise\r\n\npresented to the  jury.   However, the Maine  law claims  for\r\n\nsexual   harassment,   sex   discrimination  and   disability\r\n\ndiscrimination, and the Title VII claims for pre-November 21,\r\n\n1991  conduct did not go to the jury but rather were reserved\r\n\nfor later decision by the magistrate judge.\r\n\n          During the  jury trial, the court, upon defendants'\r\n\nmotion, dismissed as a matter of law all the claims (jury and\r\n\nnon-jury) against Moody and many of the claims against Riley,\r\n\nto  wit, the  claims  for sexual  harassment (Count  I) after\r\n\nNovember 21, 1991, for sex discrimination (Count II), and for\r\n\ndisability  discrimination (Counts  III and  IV).   The court\r\n\ndenied the  Company's motions  to dismiss the  claims against\r\n\nitself.\r\n\n          On October 14, 1994,  the jury returned verdicts in\r\n\nMorrison's  favor on  her  Title VII  post-November 21,  1991\r\n\nsexual  harassment claim  (Count  I) and  her ADA  disability\r\n\nclaim  (Count IV).    The jury  awarded  Morrison $50,000  in\r\n\ncompensatory damages  and $100,000 in punitive  damages.  The\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\njury  found against Morrison, and in favor of the Company, on\r\n\nher Title VII gender discrimination claim (Count II).\r\n\n          On April 10, 1995,  the court issued its Memorandum\r\n\nof Decision deciding the non-jury claims that it had reserved\r\n\nfor  bench determination.  On  Count I, the  court found that\r\n\nMorrison had been subjected to sexual harassment sufficiently\r\n\nsevere  and pervasive  to create  a hostile  work environment\r\n\nprior  to  November  21,  1991.   Consequently,  it  ruled in\r\n\nMorrison's favor, and against  the Company and Riley, on  her\r\n\nMaine  law sexual harassment claim, and also on her Title VII\r\n\nsexual  harassment claim  for conduct  prior to  November 21,\r\n\n1991.  The court  assessed a civil penalty for  $10,000 under\r\n\nstate law.  5 M.R.S.A.   4613(2)(B)(7) (West Supp. 1996).\r\n\n          On Count II (gender discrimination) the court found\r\n\nno  incidents  of gender  discrimination before  November 21,\r\n\n1991.   It, therefore, ruled  in favor of  the defendants and\r\n\nagainst  Morrison under  Title  VII.   The court  determined,\r\n\nhowever     contrary to the jury's Title VII verdict    that,\r\n\nafter  November  21, 1991,  Morrison  had  been subjected  to\r\n\ngender discrimination,  finding the Company liable  under the\r\n\nMaine Human  Rights Act.2   The  court declined,  however, to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.    In making  this finding,  the court  specifically noted\r\nthat,  in differing  with  the jury,  it  did not  intend  to\r\nsuggest that  the jury lacked sufficient  evidence from which\r\nto conclude  contrary to the  court's findings.   \"The  Court\r\nsimply  disagrees  with  the  jury's  conclusion  in  certain\r\nrespects.\"\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\naward  her back pay, because  it would be  duplicative of the\r\n\njury's damages award.\r\n\n          Finally, as to Count III, the court determined that\r\n\nplaintiff had  not been disabled within the  meaning of Maine\r\n\nlaw, and hence  found against Morrison and  for defendants on\r\n\nthe Maine law disability claim.  In determining that Morrison\r\n\nwas not disabled, the  court found that the Company  \"did not\r\n\nperceive her to be  unable to perform a major  life activity,\r\n\nspecifically  work.\"   The court  noted that the  Company had\r\n\nonly perceived Morrison as incapable of performing the single\r\n\nposition of floorperson.\r\n\n          Defendants'  post-trial motions  for judgment  as a\r\n\nmatter of law, for  new trial, and other relief  were denied.\r\n\nPlaintiff's own motion for new trial was also denied.\r\n\n          The Company and  Riley appeal, and Morrison  cross-\r\n\nappeals, from  the judgment  and the  rulings on the  various\r\n\nmotions  below.   Morrison  has  since  expressly waived  her\r\n\ncross-appeal from  the jury's adverse verdict  under Count II\r\n\n(gender discrimination).\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          The evidence at trial,  construed in the light most\r\n\nfavorable to Morrison, showed essentially the following.\r\n\n          On  August  23, 1983,  Morrison  was  hired by  the\r\n\nCompany to  work as a  \"spinner\" in the  spinning department.\r\n\nLater that year, Morrison bid on and was awarded the position\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nof \"sewer.\"   Months later,  she bid on  and was  awarded the\r\n\nposition  of  \"coner\"  in  the  yarn preparation  department.\r\n\nMorrison held  this position  from approximately May  of 1984\r\n\nuntil January of 1987.  All the positions held by Morrison up\r\n\nto this time were traditionally filled by female employees.\r\n\n          In December  1986, Morrison bid on  the position of\r\n\n\"temporary  floorperson\"  on  the  third shift  in  the  yarn\r\n\npreparation  department.  At  this time, Riley  was the shift\r\n\nsupervisor  on  the  third  shift  in  the  yarn  preparation\r\n\ndepartment.  Riley was angry with Morrison for bidding on the\r\n\nfloorperson position.   Prior to December  1986, Morrison had\r\n\nonce  had an angry encounter with Riley when they both worked\r\n\non the second shift.   Riley had screamed at her  for leaving\r\n\nher machine to go to the restroom.\r\n\n          A month later,  Morrison was awarded the  temporary\r\n\nfloorperson  position.  As  shift supervisor,  Riley approved\r\n\nher transfer  to the position and  certified her satisfactory\r\n\ncompletion of the  thirty-day probationary period.   However,\r\n\nhe had no  discretion under the  Company's contract with  the\r\n\nUnion to  refuse  a position  to  the most  senior  qualified\r\n\nperson who bid on it, which, in this case, was Morrison.\r\n\n          When Morrison told Fred DeVaudreuil, the department\r\n\nsupervisor and  Riley's superior,  that she had  been awarded\r\n\nthe floorperson  position, he asked her  to reconsider taking\r\n\nit.   He indicated that  the Company  was not happy  with her\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ngetting the job.   Morrison  believed that  he was  concerned\r\n\nthatshewould beinjured andassured himthatshe wouldbe careful.\r\n\n          In April 1987,  seven female employees  of Carleton\r\n\nfiled a formal grievance against  Riley, charging that he was\r\n\nharassing employees  at the Company by  yelling, making false\r\n\naccusations  and   threatening  their  jobs.     The  Company\r\n\nresponded by  stating  that it  did not  condone shouting  by\r\n\nanyone, but that employees  must recognize that they are  not\r\n\nat liberty \"to ignore management directives or to be tardy in\r\n\nfollowing them.\"   Ultimately,  this  grievance was  resolved\r\n\ninformally, with Plant Manager  Everett Owens advising  Riley\r\n\nabout the need to be more \"low key.\" \r\n\n          In  February 1988,  Morrison bid  on the  permanent\r\n\nopening  for the position of floorperson  on the third shift.\r\n\nOnce again,  Riley became  very angry, telling  Morrison that\r\n\nthe job  was not for her,  and that she was  taking jobs away\r\n\nfrom men.   Days after  Morrison was awarded  the floorperson\r\n\nbid, Riley told her that she was going to regret it, and that\r\n\nsooner or later he was going to get her out of the job.\r\n\n          The floorperson  is responsible for  bringing boxes\r\n\nof  yarn on bobbins to the machine operators, for taking full\r\n\ncones  of  yarn, weighing  them  and  storing them,  and  for\r\n\nchanging the warp  beams.   Changing a warp  beam, which  can\r\n\nweigh  up to 1,100 pounds when full of yarn, involves several\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nsteps.   First, the warp  is removed from  its cradle  with a\r\n\ncrow-bar type of tool.  The warp then drops about two inches,\r\n\nafter which it must be rolled to where it can be picked up by\r\n\na hydraulic lift and moved into a storage area.\r\n\n          Morrison remained in the floorperson position until\r\n\nMarch  of 1989.  During that  time various incidents occurred\r\n\nthat are relevant to the present action.\r\n\n          After changing  a warp beam, Morrison  went to wash\r\n\nher hands.  When  she left the restroom moments  later, Riley\r\n\nwas waiting for her.  He accused her of being in the restroom\r\n\nfor a long time and threatened to write her up.\r\n\n          Riley  took  Morrison   into  the  plant  manager's\r\n\noffice.  He then told her that he was a big person within the\r\n\nCompany and that \"any woman would be proud to have a man in a\r\n\nposition like this.\"\r\n\n          Several female employees  complained that the  room\r\n\nwas too hot because of the machinery.  They asked Riley if he\r\n\ncould open more of the ceiling vents.  Riley said he  thought\r\n\nthat they were just having \"hot flashes\", and walked away.\r\n\n          Riley threatened  to fire  Morrison if she  did not\r\n\ndrive  his  girlfriend  (and future  wife)  and  co-employee,\r\n\nJuanita Courtney, to her house from work during her shift.\r\n\n          Riley  told several  people in  Morrison's presence\r\n\nthat the  other female floorperson,  Linda Paul, was  able to\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nstay in such  a position  because she and  Moody patted  each\r\n\nother on the rearend.\r\n\n          Morrison reported a  problem with a box  of yarn to\r\n\nRiley, who told her she was probably so dumb she  created the\r\n\nproblem herself.\r\n\n          Riley told Morrison that Courtney was pregnant.  He\r\n\nsaid \"you thought  I was too old, didn't  you\", and \"I showed\r\n\nyou.\"\r\n\n          In March 1989, Morrison  accepted a position as the\r\n\nmedical clerk for  the Company  nurse, Lucille  Turner.   Two\r\n\nmonths later, Morrison  decided that she wanted to  return to\r\n\nher former position.\r\n\n          In October 1989, Morrison bid on a temporary coner,\r\n\nfixer and tender (\"fixer\") position.  Riley flew into a rage,\r\n\ntelling Morrison  that she was  \"stepping out of  bounds\" and\r\n\nthat \"her place was in the kitchen.\"\r\n\n          Thereafter,  Morrison  bid  on  a  permanent  fixer\r\n\nposition.  Riley told her fellow workers that if she got  the\r\n\njob, she would have to travel to a training seminar and share\r\n\na  motel room with Moody  and another male  worker.  Morrison\r\n\nvoided her bid  in an  effort to stop  speculation about  the\r\n\nseminar, and returned to her floorperson position.\r\n\n          In  June 1990, a  first shift  floorperson, William\r\n\nRogers,  asked Morrison to swap shifts with him.  Even though\r\n\nRiley  had moved to the  first shift, Morrison  agreed to the\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nswitch.  Riley told Morrison that he \"was not going to put up\r\n\nwith any bullshit on the first shift\" and that he \"had enough\r\n\nbitches in  the first shift.\"   Riley also called a  male co-\r\n\nworker  over to where he and Morrison were standing and began\r\n\npatting him in  the rearend, and told her that she would have\r\n\nto get used to such behavior in the first shift.\r\n\n          Riley and  Moody moved their desk  near the women's\r\n\nrestroom, explaining that they wanted  to watch the usage  of\r\n\nthe restroom so that  they could write female workers  up for\r\n\nabusing  the  privilege of  using the  restroom.   Also, they\r\n\nregularly made comments about  Morrison bending over boxes to\r\n\nthe point where she felt very uncomfortable having to do so.\r\n\n          Other incidents occurred between the spring of 1990\r\n\nand the fall of 1991.\r\n\n          Riley handed  Morrison a  piece of paper,  which he\r\n\nsaid was an  application for  a fixer position.   She  turned\r\n\nover  the paper and discovered, to her annoyance, that it was\r\n\nentitled \"Application for a Piece of Ass.\"  \r\n\n          Riley gave  Morrison an ink-blot that, when folded,\r\n\ndepicted various  sexual acts involving persons  and animals.\r\n\nHe called her  a \"dumb  broad\" for being  unable to  properly\r\n\nfold it, after  which he folded it for her.   Morrison became\r\n\nvery upset and called Riley a \"filthy pig.\"\r\n\n          Riley told Morrison that  Moody wanted to do \"funny\r\n\nthings\" to her  body, although Moody later denied ever making\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nsuch  a  comment.    On another  occasion,  Moody  approached\r\n\nMorrison and told her that he would like to see her naked.\r\n\n          Moody handed Morrison a document entitled \"Canadian\r\n\nCondom  Marketing  Board\", which  contained sexually-oriented\r\n\nattempts at humor.   Morrison  asked Moody why  he was  doing\r\n\nthis,  and he replied something  to the effect  that he takes\r\n\nhis orders from the office.\r\n\n          Riley  asked Morrison if she knew what a man with a\r\n\nten-inch penis eats for breakfast.  When she did not respond,\r\n\nhe proceeded to tell her what he had eaten for breakfast.\r\n\n          Riley  gave Morrison a  document entitled \"Proposed\r\n\nRestroom Policy.\"   This  document, another crude  attempt at\r\n\nhumor, informed employees that  if they occupied the bathroom\r\n\nstalls  for more  than  three minutes,  certain events  would\r\n\noccur,  including  the taking  of  their  photographs in  the\r\n\nstalls.\r\n\n          Riley regularly screamed and hollered at the  women\r\n\nemployees in  the yarn preparation department, but not at the\r\n\nmen.  If any  of the women indicated that they might complain\r\n\nabout  his behavior, he would tell them \"pay-back's a bitch.\"\r\n\n          During this  period of time, Morrison  went, on two\r\n\noccasions, to  the office  of Annette McGowan,  the Company's\r\n\npersonnel  manager,  to   complain  about  Riley's  harassing\r\n\nbehavior.  On  neither occasion was Morrison allowed to speak\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nwith  McGowan.   McGowan's secretary  told Morrison  that she\r\n\nwould  not be allowed to see McGowan without her supervisor's\r\n\npermission,  even  though  Morrison  informed  her  that  her\r\n\ncomplaint was about Riley, her supervisor.\r\n\n          In May 1991, Morrison injured her shoulder at work.\r\n\nShe  kept   working,  but   was  eventually   diagnosed  with\r\n\ntendinitis,  and told  to take  ibuprofen and  learn  to pace\r\n\nherself.\r\n\n          In October 1991, Morrison  injured her back at home\r\n\nwhile  she was making her bed.  Morrison went to the Belgrade\r\n\nRegional  Health  Center  where  she  saw  Gretchen  Hill,  a\r\n\nregistered  nurse-practitioner.    Hill found  that  Morrison\r\n\nappeared  to have  a lower lumbar  muscle strain  without any\r\n\ndisc problems.   Hill  informed Turner, the  Company's nurse,\r\n\nthat Morrison would be absent for one week.  \r\n\n          Morrison  returned to see Hill  one week later.  By\r\n\nthat time, the pain was  gone, although she was  experiencing\r\n\nsome stiffness.   Hill  was considering allowing  Morrison to\r\n\nreturn to work, so she called Turner again.  Turner suggested\r\n\nthat Morrison should be kept out of work  for two more weeks,\r\n\na suggestion that Hill accepted.\r\n\n          On November 8, 1991,  Hill issued Morrison a return\r\n\nto  work slip  for full  activity.   Hill testified  that she\r\n\nwould  have preferred Morrison to work  in a limited capacity\r\n\nfor a short period of time,  but she felt that Morrison could\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nsuccessfully return to  work without restriction.   Following\r\n\nanother  conversation with Turner,  Hill wrote a  new note on\r\n\nNovember 13, 1991, which suggested that Morrison be placed on\r\n\nlight  duty work  from November 11  through November  22, and\r\n\nthen return to regular duty.\r\n\n          Turner and  McGowan met with Morrison  and informed\r\n\nher that the Company had no light duty work available at  the\r\n\ntime.   McGowan then  offered Morrison the  option of bidding\r\n\ninto a  different position, or accepting a layoff slip, which\r\n\nwould entitle her to unemployment benefits.  Morrison did not\r\n\nwant  to lose  her floorperson  seniority  by bidding  into a\r\n\ndifferent position, so she accepted the layoff.\r\n\n          Morrison believed that she had medical clearance to\r\n\nreturn  to regular duty after  November 22, 1991,  and so, on\r\n\nNovember  25,   1991,  she  went  to   the  yarn  preparation\r\n\ndepartment and sought to  punch in.  Morrison could  not find\r\n\nher  own timecard, and asked  Moody where she  could find it.\r\n\nMoody responded by saying, \"Girlie, I don't know.  You're not\r\n\ncoming back to my department.  Go see nursie.\"  Morrison felt\r\n\n\"stupid.\"  \r\n\n          Turner told  Morrison that she remained  on layoff,\r\n\nand  that she had no authority to  allow her to work.  Turner\r\n\nadvised  Morrison to  speak with  McGowan.   McGowan informed\r\n\nMorrison that she did not have the authority to return her to\r\n\nwork absent medical clearance, and suggested that she see Dr.\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nBarron, the Company's physician.   On November 26,  1991, the\r\n\nnext day, Morrison went to see Dr. Barron.\r\n\n          The examination of Morrison consisted of the  nurse\r\n\ntaking her  blood pressure,  temperature and weight,  and the\r\n\ndoctor  asking her how she felt.  Dr. Barron advised Morrison\r\n\nthat  he would be going to view the floorperson position, but\r\n\nhe reported to her  (and wrote in  his office notes) that  he\r\n\nsaw no physical reason why she could not return to work.  \r\n\n          After  he  viewed  the  floorperson  position,  Dr.\r\n\nBarron wrote the following notation:\r\n\n          \"I  feel that  [Morrison] can do  most of\r\n          the  work without any problems.  However,\r\n          when  it   came  to  watching   the  warp\r\n          removed, I  felt  that this  was far  too\r\n          much for  a woman  with tendinitis  and a\r\n          back  problem.   I understand  that these\r\n          warps  weigh in  the neighborhood  of 500\r\n          pounds  and  the  manipulation of  moving\r\n          them onto  a hydraulic lift  is certainly\r\n          more than she  can do.  Over a  period of\r\n          time,  I feel that  she would be crippled\r\n          doing this job.  With tendinitis and back\r\n          problems within a year she will be out of\r\n          work    and    on    disability.       My\r\n          recommendation  is that she not be put on\r\n          this type of job.\"\r\n\nDr. Barron did not speak to Morrison's treating  physician or\r\n\nher  nurse-practitioner.     Dr.  Barron  disregarded   their\r\n\nopinions   which  indicated  that  Morrison  was  capable  of\r\n\nfulfilling  her  duties,  because   they  had  not  seen  the\r\n\nfloorperson position.   At the  time of  trial, Morrison  was\r\n\nstill  not permitted to  work in the  floorperson position on\r\n\nthe basis of Dr. Barron's evaluation.\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\n          On  November  23, 1992,  Morrison returned  to work\r\n\nafter she decided to bid  on a fixer position.   She received\r\n\nthe position,  although after a  month she was  \"bumped\", was\r\n\nlaid  off for a few  weeks, accepted a  creeler position, and\r\n\neventually returned as a  fixer.  After a dispute  over being\r\n\npaid  as   a  temporary  fixer,  Morrison   finally  attained\r\n\npermanent  fixer status.   Since  she returned,  Morrison has\r\n\nworked  primarily  on   the  third  shift,  under   different\r\n\nsupervisors from  Riley and  Moody.  Morrison  testified that\r\n\nshe had no problems  with Riley and Moody after  she returned\r\n\nas  they  stayed away  from  her.    The Company's  personnel\r\n\nmanager  told Morrison  that  she had  spoken  to the  people\r\n\nMorrison would be working with and that they would not harass\r\n\nher about her former complaints.  Morrison was to report back\r\n\nany complaints she might have. \r\n\n          Morrison  further  testified, however,  that, after\r\n\nher return, most of  her co-workers would no longer  speak to\r\n\nher.  She  felt that this  was due to  the fact that most  of\r\n\nthose  who   spoke  to   her  were  harassed   afterwards  by\r\n\nsupervisors  for doing so.  Also, the third shift supervisor,\r\n\nErnest  Clark,   often  criticized   Morrison  for   her  job\r\n\nperformance.  The Company,  moreover, never asked Morrison to\r\n\nsubstitute  when  the  floorperson  was  absent, even  though\r\n\nemployees  with   less  experience  were  asked   to  do  the\r\n\nfloorperson's job.   And finally, Morrison  became very upset\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\nand angry when  she saw  a petition,  expressing support  for\r\n\nRiley and Moody, being circulated among Carleton employees.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          Defendants appeal from  the adverse jury  verdicts,\r\n\nfrom  the adverse findings of the district court and from the\r\n\ndenial of various motions including their motion for judgment\r\n\nas a matter of law.\r\n\n          A federal district court may  not set aside a  jury\r\n\nverdict and direct the entry of a contrary verdict, unless no\r\n\nreasonable jury could have returned a  verdict adverse to the\r\n\nmoving  party.

See  29 C.F.R.   \r                                                           \r\n\n1604.11 (1996).

The Maine  courts have  relied on the  federal case  law\r\nsurrounding  Title  VII for  the  purpose  of construing  and\r\napplying the provisions of  the Maine Human Rights Act.   See\r                                                                         \r\nBowen v.

We find\r\n\nample record evidence to sustain these findings.\r\n\n          As  an  initial  matter,  we  turn  to  defendants'\r\n\ncontention that the federal and state statutes of limitations\r\n\ndo not allow us to look at any  conduct antedating the middle\r\n\nof  1991  in  support  of  the  hostile  environment  claims.\r\n\nSection  2000e-5(e)(1) of  Title VII provides  that claimants\r\n\nmust file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 300\r\n\ndays of the alleged  discriminatory act.  42 U.S.C.    2000e-\r\n\n5(e)(1) (West 1994).   Section 4613(2)(C) of  the Maine Human\r\n\nRights  Act states that \"[t]he action  shall be commenced not\r\n\nmore than two  years after the act of unlawful discrimination\r\n\ncomplained of.\"  5 M.R.S.A.   4613(2)(C) (West 1989).\r\n\n          Since Morrison  filed her  charge with the  EEOC on\r\n\nApril  23, 1992, and her complaint with the district court on\r\n\nSeptember 3,  1993, the  appellants argue that  only acts  of\r\n\nsexual  harassment occurring  after  June 27,  1991, for  her\r\n\nfederal  claim, and  after September 3,  1991, for  her state\r\n\nclaim, should  be considered in reviewing  the sufficiency of\r\n\nthe  evidence.  We disagree.   The district  court found that\r\n\nthe hostile environment  at Carleton had existed for a number\r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\nof  years  prior to  November 21,  1991 and  continued beyond\r\n\nSeptember 3, 1991.  We have held that there is no prohibition\r\n\non recovery  for earlier conduct if  the \"systemic violation\"\r\n\nextends into the limitation period. See Jensen v. Frank,  912\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d  517, 523 (1st Cir. 1990).  Here, the systemic violation\r\n\ncontinued without  interruption from  the late  1980's onward\r\n\nthrough September  3, 1991.   It was,  therefore, appropriate\r\n\nfor the district court to look at  defendants' conduct dating\r\n\nback to the  1980's, and  we may do  likewise, in  evaluating\r\n\nMorrison's federal and state sexual harassment claims.\r\n\n          From  the late 1980s  into the fall  of 1991, there\r\n\nwas ample  evidence of crude, demeaning and sexually-oriented\r\n\nbehavior  by  Riley  and  others  directed  at  Morrison.   A\r\n\nrational factfinder could conclude that the harassment was so\r\n\nsevere  or  pervasive  that  it created  a  work  environment\r\n\nabusive  to Morrison because of her gender.  Harris, 510 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 22.  There  is, indeed, evidence that the  harassment went\r\n\nso far as to adversely affect Morrison's ability to function,\r\n\nby  making  her  fearful  to  apply  for  certain  employment\r\n\nopportunities and undermining her  mental and emotional well-\r\n\nbeing.\r\n\n          Even so, the appellants  argue that the Company, as\r\n\nan entity,  cannot be  held liable  because Morrison  has not\r\n\nshown  that it knew, or should have known, of the harassment.\r\n\nMorrison did not complain of harassment to the Company during\r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\nthe period,  even though  there were procedures  available to\r\n\nfile such complaints.  This is a closer question, but we find\r\n\nsufficient evidence to support  the finding of the magistrate\r\n\njudge that the  Company knew  or should have  known that  the\r\n\nhostile  environment existed  despite plaintiff's  failure to\r\n\nuse official procedures to complain.  In April  1987, several\r\n\nfemale employees  of Carleton  had filed a  grievance against\r\n\nRiley,  alleging that he was  harassing them.   At that time,\r\n\nPlant  Manager Everett Owens told Riley to be more \"low key\",\r\n\nbut  never  took any  action  to discipline  or  more closely\r\n\nsupervise him.   In the years before the trial  of this case,\r\n\nUnion President Gwendolyn  Gatcomb brought several complaints\r\n\nconcerning  Riley's  behavior  to the  attention  of  Company\r\n\npersonnel.   In spite  of these  complaints, Riley  and other\r\n\nCarleton  supervisors  were allowed  to  continue  with their\r\n\nresponsibilities  and  their  harassing  conduct.    Morrison\r\n\ntestified  that  she had  tried to  bring  the matter  to the\r\n\nattention of Personnel Manager  Annette McGowan, but had been\r\n\nunable  to  see her.   The  magistrate  judge found  that the\r\n\nlayout of the mill was such that higher management \"could not\r\n\nhave missed the discriminatory  atmosphere that permeated the\r\n\ndepartment.\"  We are satisfied that the evidence sufficiently\r\n\nsupports  the   court's  above   finding,  and  can   see  no\r\n\njustification to disturb it on appeal.\r\n\n     2. After November 21, 1991\r                                           \r\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\n          For us to  affirm the  jury's award  of damages  to\r\n\nMorrison  on her Count  I Title VII  sexual harassment claim,\r\n\nthe  record  must reveal  evidence  of  conduct on  or  after\r\n\nNovember 21, 1991      the  effective date of the  1991 Civil\r\n\nRights  Act        sufficient   to  have  created  a  hostile\r\n\nenvironment  as that term is used under Title VII.  Landgraf,\r                                                                        \r\n\n511 U.S. at 244-45.  Hostile environment sexual harassment is\r\n\na  particular  species of  sex  discrimination.   The  EEOC's\r\n\nregulations, as  noted,  describe it  as \"[u]nwelcome  sexual\r\n\nadvances,  requests for  sexual favors,  and other  verbal or\r\n\nphysical conduct of a sexual nature . . . when . . . (3) such\r\n\nconduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering\r\n\nwith  an   individual's  work  performance  or   creating  an\r\n\nintimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\"  29\r\n\nC.F.R.    1604.11(a) (1996).   The Supreme Court  speaks of a\r\n\n\"workplace . . . permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation,\r\n\nridicule and  insult' . . . that is  'sufficiently severe  or\r\n\npervasive to  alter the  conditions of a  person's employment\r\n\nand  create an  abusive working  environment.'\"   Harris, 510\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. at 21 (citations omitted).\r\n\n          In  the  present  case, the  jury  heard  extensive\r\n\nevidence of the vulgar pre-November 21, 1991 incidents which,\r\n\nas we have held, amply support the magistrate judge's finding\r\n\nof hostile environment sexual harassment during that  earlier\r\n\ntime.   However, the jury's  task was to  determine Title VII\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\nliabilities and damages  for the  period from   November  21,\r\n\n1991  onward.  The jury  could take the  earlier conduct into\r\n\naccount  only to the extent  it was legally  relevant to what\r\n\nlater  happened     for  example,  to help  prove  the intent\r\n\nbehind an act committed after November 21, 1991, or the act's\r\n\nlikely effect on someone  like Morrison.  See, e.g.,  Fed. R.\r                                                               \r\n\nEvid. 402, 403, 404(b),  406, 412.   The earlier abuse is  no\r\n\nsubstitute for proof of actual sexual harassment occurring in\r\n\nthe post-November  21, 1991 period.   Because we  cannot find\r\n\nevidence  of sexually  abusive conduct  in this  later period\r\n\nsufficient  to support the jury's Title VII award under Count\r\n\nI, we are obliged to reverse that part of the verdict.  \r\n\n          From  October 19,  1991  until  November 23,  1992,\r\n\nMorrison  was  either on  medical  leave  or on  layoff  from\r\n\nCarleton, hence she could not, during that period,  have been\r\n\nsubjected to workplace abuse,  nor could her work performance\r\n\nat  Carleton have  been  interfered with  by abusive  conduct\r\n\nwhile there.  The only incident during that period that might\r\n\nbe  construed as  workplace  sexual  harassment  occurred  on\r\n\nNovember  25, 1991, when Morrison went to Carleton seeking to\r\n\nreturn to work.   Moody refused to let her  punch in, telling\r\n\nher she had  first to get medical clearance.   In turning her\r\n\naway, Moody called Morrison  \"Girlie\" and told her to  go see\r\n\n\"nursie\",  raising the  question whether  use of  these terms\r\n\nmade Moody's remark so  offensive as to support a  finding of\r\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n\nhostile environment  sexual harassment.   In order  to assess\r\n\nMoody's probable intent when  he spoke as he did  on November\r\n\n25,  1991 and  the reasonable  effect of  the phraseology  on\r\n\nMorrison,  see Harris,  510 U.S. at  22 (citing  Meritor Sav.\r                                                                         \r\n\nBank,  FSB,  477 U.S.  at 67),  the  jury could  consider the\r                      \r\n\nevidence of  Moody's and others' prior  offensive conduct and\r\n\nremarks in the period before November 21, 1991.  In light  of\r\n\nthat history, the jury  could reasonably construe Moody's use\r\n\nof the  terms \"Girlie\" and \"nursie\" as demeaning, rather than\r\n\nas merely light-hearted banter, and could also determine that\r\n\nMorrison  had reason to be offended.  Morrison testified that\r\n\nMoody's remark, made at  a time when \"everybody was  lined up\r\n\ngetting ready to punch in\", made her feel \"stupid.\"\r\n\n          We are  unable to  conclude, however,  that Moody's\r\n\n\"Girlie-nursie\" remark was, by  itself, a sufficient basis to\r\n\nhold  the  Company liable  to  Morrison under  her  Title VII\r\n\nsexual  harassment claim.   Morrison was  not working  at the\r\n\ntime.  Her contact  on this one  day with the Company's  work\r\n\nenvironment was fleeting.   There is no evidence  the Company\r\n\nknew  of or  sanctioned Moody's  particular phraseology.   We\r\n\nknow  of  no case  where a  single,  brief encounter  of this\r\n\nmildly offensive sort, at  a time when the plaintiff  was not\r\n\nactually working, and hence could not be affected in her work\r\n\nperformance and  conditions of  employment, has been  held to\r\n\ncreate a sexually hostile  workplace environment.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n                             -26-\r\r\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at  21 (conduct must be severe  or pervasive\r                  \r\n\nenough  to  create an  objectively  hostile  or abusive  work\r\n\nenvironment affecting employee's  conditions of  employment);\r\n\nChamberlin v. 101 Realty,  Inc., 915 F.2d 777, 783  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1990) (single or isolated remarks  do not establish a hostile\r\n\nenvironment).  Even assuming this incident, when coupled with\r\n\nthe more serious pre-November  21, 1991 incidents, might lead\r\n\na  rational  jury  to   conclude  that  the  earlier  abusive\r\n\nenvironment would have remained the same through November 25,\r\n\n1991, the fact that Morrison was not working at Carleton from\r\n\nNovember 21, 1991 until November 23,  1992    a year later   \r\n\nmakes  this conclusion  largely irrelevant  to her  claim for\r\n\ndamages  during this  period.  Morrison  could not  have been\r\n\ninjured by hostility at a workplace she did not attend.6\r\n\n          We realize that Morrison contends that she accepted\r\n\nlayoff status  only because  of the Company's  refusal during\r\n\nthis  period to let  her return to  her floorperson position.\r\n\nMorrison insists that the  refusal, while supposedly based on\r\n\nhealth  concerns, was  actually based  on the  Company's bias\r\n\nagainst women  working as  floorpersons.  The  jury, however,\r\n\nspecifically  rejected Morrison's  Count  II,  Title VII  sex\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.    Obviously, an  award  of $150,000  in compensatory  and\r\npunitive damages  would be patently excessive  for one mildly\r\noffensive  remark.    Even  supposing  the  workplace  itself\r\nremained potentially abusive  during Morrison's absence, this\r\nwould  be irrelevant while she  was on layoff  status and not\r\npresent.\r\n\n                             -27-\r\r\n\ndiscrimination claim  premised on such a  theory, finding for\r\n\nthe Company on Count  II.  The magistrate judge,  contrary to\r\n\nthe jury,  later upheld Morrison's  sex discrimination  claim\r\n\nunder Maine law, holding that the Company's refusal to  allow\r                           \r\n\nMorrison to go  back to her floorperson  position was gender-\r\n\nbased  and  discriminatory.     But  the  jury's  verdict  is\r\n\nconclusive  on the part of the Count II claim seeking damages\r\n\nunder Title  VII.  The jury found for Morrison on her Count I\r\n\nclaim of  hostile environment  sexual harassment, but,  as we\r\n\ndiscuss here, there was insufficient evidence of abuse during\r\n\nthe  post-November 21, 1991 period for us to affirm the award\r\n\nof damages under that theory.7 \r\n\n          Following the  period of  over a year  during which\r\n\nshe did not work at the  Company (from October 19, 1991 until\r\n\nNovember  23, 1992), Morrison finally returned  to work.  But\r\n\nthe  record covering  the period  after Morrison's  return to\r\n\nwork on  November  23, 1992  provides scant  support for  her\r\n\nhostile environment claim.  When she returned, she accepted a\r\n\ndifferent,  somewhat higher-paying position8, and reported to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.    The  jury's finding  against  Morrison  under Count  II\r\nrefutes any argument that  the jury based its Count  I sexual\r\nharassment   verdict  on   a   finding  that   Morrison   was\r\ndiscriminated against  when denied the opportunity  to return\r\nto  the floorperson  position.  Cf.  Chamberlin, 915  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n782-83.\r\n\n8.   The  Company's personnel manager testified  that, at the\r\ntime of  trial, a  fixer  was paid  $9.64 per  hour, while  a\r\nfloorperson  was  paid  $8.54  per hour.    Morrison  herself\r\ntestified that a  similar pay difference existed in 1989 when\r\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\nnew  supervisors.   There is  no evidence  that, in  this new\r\n\nposition,  her  supervisors, or  any  other  person for  that\r\n\nmatter,  subjected  her   to  \"discriminatory   intimidation,\r\n\nridicule  and insult\", Harris, 510  U.S. at 21,  much less to\r                                         \r\n\nsexually   offensive,  embarrassing  or   vulgar  conduct  or\r\n\nremarks,  or other sex-based conduct or  remarks, such as had\r\n\noccurred prior to November 21, 1991 when she was working as a\r\n\nfloorperson  under  Riley.   The Company's  personnel manager\r\n\nadvised  her that  employees  had been  warned  to treat  her\r\n\nfairly and equitably,  and that  she was  to report  anything\r\n\noffensive  immediately  so   that  it  could   be  corrected.\r\n\nMorrison did not thereafter  complain of sexual harassment to\r\n\nCompany personnel.   Morrison conceded that  her old nemeses,\r\n\nRiley and Moody, stayed away from her, and never harassed her\r\n\nafter she returned to work.  Morrison, nonetheless, points to\r\n\ncertain incidents  that  occurred during  this later  period,\r\n\nwhich,  according  to  her,  gave  rise  to  a  hostile  work\r\n\nenvironment at Carleton.\r\n\n          Morrison  testified that  most of  the  people with\r\n\nwhom  she had worked  for years would no  longer speak to her\r\n\nwhen she  returned to work  in November 23,  1992, ostensibly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nshe  had  briefly worked  as a  fixer.   There  was  a period\r\nshortly after  her return  when she  was \"bumped\",  laid off,\r\nreturned  as  a creeler,  and  ultimately  restored to  fixer\r\nstatus.  Morrison and  the Company thereafter skirmished over\r\nher fixer pay  scale, whether it was temporary  or permanent;\r\neventually she got the permanent rating.\r\n\n                             -29-\r\r\n\nbecause discouraged by  management from  doing so.   The  few\r\n\nthat  did were reprimanded  by their  supervisors afterwards.\r\n\nMorrison felt  that some  of her  co-workers would  no longer\r\n\ncooperate  with  her,  thereby   making  her  job  much  more\r\n\ndifficult, and that one of her new supervisors, Ernest Clark,\r\n\nwould occasionally assign her  excessive work.  Ernest Clark,\r\n\naccording to Morrison,  would also follow her around and look\r\n\nfor flaws in her work, and would often blame her for mistakes\r\n\nthat  were not of her own doing.  Morrison further complained\r\n\nthat,  for  some  time after  she  had  completed a  training\r\n\nperiod, she  received temporary pay, instead  of regular pay,\r\n\nfor her work as a fixer, and that, despite her seniority, she\r\n\nnever was asked to  fill in for those employees  with higher-\r\n\nranking jobs  within the  Company.  Lastly,  Morrison claimed\r\n\nthat  she saw  a  petition expressing  support for  Riley and\r\n\nMoody circulating throughout the  Company, an event that, she\r\n\nsays, led her to seek professional counselling.  \r\n\n          Morrison argues that she does not need to show that\r\n\nmanagement's conduct  during this later period was \"expressly\r\n\nsexual\"  in  order  to  establish  a  sexually  hostile  work\r\n\nenvironment based  on gender discrimination.   We accept that\r\n\nmany different  forms of  offensive behavior may  be included\r\n\nwithin  the   definition   of  hostile   environment   sexual\r\n\nharassment.  See Spain v. Gallegos, 26 F.3d 439, 447 (3d Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1994) (employee  can show  that there  is a sexually  hostile\r\n\n                             -30-\r\r\n\nwork    environment    \"without   proving    blatant   sexual\r\n\nmisconduct.\").  However, the  overtones of such behavior must\r\n\nbe, at the very least, sex-based,  so as to be a recognizable\r\n\nform of sex discrimination.  McKinney v. Dole, 765 F.2d 1129,\r                                                         \r\n\n1138  (D.C.  Cir. 1985).    Merely  because a  supervisor  is\r\n\noverbearing or  fellow employees  unsociable and hard  to get\r\n\nalong  with, does not suffice  unless underlying motives of a\r\n\nsexual  or  gender  discriminatory  nature   are  implicated.\r\n\nSpain, 26 F.3d at 449.\r                 \r\n\n          The  post-November  23,  1992  conduct  alleged  by\r\n\nMorrison  occurred over  a year  after the  earlier sexually-\r\n\nexplicit misconduct  by the  other supervisors in  her former\r\n\nposition.    The later  conduct, as  said,  was not  the kind\r\n\nassociated  with  a  claim  for  hostile  environment  sexual\r\n\nharassment.   See, e.g., Gross  v. Burggraf  Constr. Co.,  53\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 1531, 1546  (10th Cir. 1995) (employee did not establish\r\n\na gender-based  hostile environment by  showing that employer\r\n\nreprimanded  her in  front  of other  employees, grilled  her\r\n\nabout some plans to bring discrimination charges against him,\r\n\nand  told her \"she  was skating on  thin ice.\").   It was not\r\n\nshown  that   Supervisor  Clark's  harshness  was   based  on\r\n\nannoyance with her  as a  woman, or because  he regarded  the\r\n\nfixer position as off limits for women.  A connection between\r\n\nMorrison's gender and the incidents she complains of  was not\r\n\nestablished.   The record contains no  evidence that Morrison\r\n\n                             -31-\r\r\n\ncomplained to the  Company that  she was  being subjected  at\r\n\nthis  time to further  sexual harassment or  that the Company\r\n\nknew  or  should  have   believed  that  Morrison  was  being\r\n\nsubjected  to  sexual  harassment   then.    If  the  Company\r\n\ndeliberately  sought to  isolate or  punish Morrison  for her\r\n\nearlier complaints of harassment,  by telling other employees\r\n\nnot  to speak  to her,  such conduct  might have  supported a\r\n\nclaim   for   unlawful  retaliation,   but  not   for  sexual\r\n\nharassment.9   The evidence  presented by Morrison  is simply\r\n\ninsufficient to  establish a post-November  21, 1991 sexually\r\n\nhostile work environment created  by severe or pervasive sex-\r\n\nbased harassment.\r\n\n          Morrison seeks to overcome  the deficiencies in the\r\n\nevidence  by  contending  that the  more  recent,  non-sexual\r\n\nincidents could be linked to the pattern of vulgar, sexually-\r\n\nrelated  misconduct that  occurred at  Carleton prior  to the\r\n\neffective  date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.  Morrison urges\r\n\nthat  the later incidents could be evaluated by the jury, not\r\n\nin  isolation, but rather as  a continuation of  what she and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has a separate\r\nstatutory provision, not at issue here, making it an unlawful\r\nemployment practice for  an employer to discriminate  against\r\nan individual  because of his  or her having  opposed another\r\nunlawful  practice or made a charge under the subchapter.  42\r\nU.S.C.    2000e-3(a) (West 1994);  see also Fennell  v. First\r                                                                         \r\nStep  Designs,  Ltd.,  83  F.3d  526,  535  (1st  Cir.  1996)\r                                \r\n(outlining the elements of a retaliation claim).\r\n\n                             -32-\r\r\n\nother employees encountered  at the  Company before  November\r\n\n21, 1991.\r\n\n          This point  might have arguable  merit relative  to\r\n\nMoody's \"Girlie-nursie\" remark on  November 25, 1991, were it\r\n\nnot for the isolated nature of this incident, occurring as it\r\n\ndid when Morrison was  on continuous leave, hence not  at the\r\n\nworkplace so as  to be exposed to a  hostile environment.  As\r\n\nto the events after  her return to work on November 23, 1992,\r\n\nthe pre-November 21, 1991  harassment was too remote in  time\r\n\nand  character  to  transform  the  later  conduct  into  the\r\n\ndifferent  kind of behavior needed to support a damages claim\r\n\nfor  hostile  environment  sexual harassment.    Morrison, by\r\n\nthen, was  working in a new position  with other supervisors.\r\n\nTo  establish that  she  was entitled  to  damages for  being\r\n\nsubjected to  hostile environment discrimination  during this\r\n\nlater period, she had  to show some conduct within  that time\r\n\nframe fitting  into a  cognizable definition of  abusive work\r\n\nenvironment  harassment.   If this  were not so,  the Company\r\n\nwould  be held  liable for  conduct which  it would  not have\r\n\nknown  was either improper or a source of potential liability\r\n\nunder the \"hostile environment\" theory at issue.\r\n\n          In light  of the foregoing, we hold  that there was\r\n\ninsufficient evidence from which a rational  factfinder could\r\n\nconclude that  Morrison was  subjected to a  sexually hostile\r\n\nwork environment at Carleton after November 21, 1991. \r\n\n                             -33-\r\r\n\nB. Gender Discrimination (Count II)\r                                               \r\n\n          In  Count  II,  the  district court  ruled  in  the\r\n\nCompany's  favor on  Morrison's  federal claim,  finding that\r\n\nthere   were  no  incidents  of  sex  discrimination  against\r\n\nMorrison prior to  November 21, 1991.10   The district court,\r                          \r\n\nhowever,   held    that   Morrison   had    established   sex\r\n\ndiscrimination after November 21,  1991, and entered judgment\r\n\nin her  favor  under  Maine  law.   We  find  that  there  is\r\n\nsufficient  evidence  in  the  record below  to  support  the\r\n\ncourt's  state law  ruling  and, accordingly,  we affirm  its\r\n\njudgment in this respect.\r\n\n          The district  court first  found that Morrison  was\r\n\nnot  permitted  to  return  to her  floorperson  position  on\r\n\nNovember  25,  1991  \"because of  Lucille  Turner's,  Annette\r\n\nMcGowan's, and Dr. Barron's  perception that women would more\r\n\nlikely be  severely injured in the  floorperson position than\r\n\nwould men.\"  The record permits the inference that Morrison's\r\n\ninjury  was  temporary  and  not  especially  serious.    The\r\n\nevidence  shows   that  Turner   convinced  Hill  to   extend\r\n\nMorrison's layoff,  and later suggested that  Morrison should\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  As  with   Count  I,  the  issue   of  whether  Carleton\r\ndiscriminated  because  of  gender  against   Morrison  after\r\nNovember  21, 1991 in violation of Title VII was presented to\r\nthe jury.  The  jury found against Morrison on that claim, as\r\nnoted.  The magistrate  judge subsequently found otherwise on\r\nthe  same  facts for  purposes  of Morrison's  Maine  law sex\r\ndiscrimination  claim,  finding  gender discrimination  after\r\nNovember 21,  1991  based on  the  Company's refusal  to  let\r\nMorrison continue in the floorperson position.\r\n\n                             -34-\r\r\n\nnot be allowed to  return to the floorperson position.   When\r\n\nMorrison was given the choice of either accepting a layoff or\r\n\nleaving the floorperson position,  McGowan told her that \"she\r\n\nshould have seen this  coming because . . . [the Company] did\r\n\nnot want [her]  on the job.\"  Finally, even though Dr. Barron\r\n\ntalked  extensively  with  Turner about  Morrison's  physical\r\n\ncondition, he refused to  consult with her treating physician\r\n\nor her nurse-practitioner, both  of whom felt she was  fit to\r\n\nperform her  floorperson duties, in recommending  that she be\r\n\nkept out of the job.\r\n\n          The district  court stated  that  it was  satisfied\r\n\nthat \"a man presenting the same medical history and clearance\r\n\nto return to work would have been immediately permitted to do\r\n\nso.\"  The record  below gives credence to this  statement, as\r\n\ntwo long-time Carleton  employees, William Rogers and  Norman\r\n\nWilliams, testified  that the  Company has permitted  them to\r\n\nremain in  their physically-demanding jobs,  despite the fact\r\n\nthat they  have, respectively, a  chronic back problem  and a\r\n\nruptured cervical disc.   Moreover, Leland Rice, who,  at one\r\n\ntime,  worked as a floorperson  at Carleton, and  who is only\r\n\nfive  foot  three inches  tall and  weighs  no more  than 140\r\n\npounds, testified that he did not find any aspect of the job,\r\n\nincluding  the removal of the warp beam, to be very difficult\r\n\nto perform.    It  could  be found,  therefore,  that,  while\r\n\nCarleton  seized upon  Morrison's  relatively  minor  medical\r\n\n                             -35-\r\r\n\nproblems  to exclude  her from  the floorperson  position, it\r\n\nallowed other male employees,  with more serious ailments and\r\n\nless physical abilities, to continue working for the Company.\r\n\n          It  is  true,  to  be  sure,  that  there  was also\r\n\nevidence    suggesting     that    legitimate    health-based\r\n\nconsiderations  had motivated  the Company's  decision.   But\r\n\nthis  is the  kind of  matter  best sorted  out by  the trial\r\n\ncourt.  There was sufficient evidence to support a reasonable\r\n\ntrier's  finding that  Morrison was  rejected because  of her\r\n\ngender.  The court  was entitled to conclude  that Morrison's\r\n\nsex  \"was  a substantial  motivating  factor  in the  adverse\r\n\nemployment  decision.\"   Cumpiano v.  Banco  Santander Puerto\r                                                                         \r\n\nRico, 902 F.2d 148, 155  (1st Cir. 1990).  Finding  no error,\r                \r\n\nwe affirm.   We also hold  that, on remand, the  court should\r\n\nreopen  the issue  of  back pay  given  our vacation  of  the\r\n\ndamages awards under Counts I and IV.\r\n\nC. Disability Discrimination (Count IV)\r                                                   \r\n\n          In  Count  IV,  the  jury  returned  a  verdict  in\r\n\nMorrison's favor on her  federal ADA claim.  When  this claim\r\n\nwas  submitted to the jury, the court correctly told the jury\r\n\nthat Morrison  could recover only  for violations of  the Act\r\n\noccurring  on or after July  26, 1992, the  effective date of\r\n\nthe Act.  Because the record reveals no evidence of any post-\r\n\nJuly  26, 1992  violations,  we are  obliged to  overturn the\r\n\nverdict.  \r\n\n                             -36-\r\r\n\n          Ever  since the  ADA became  effective on  July 26,\r\n\n1992, the courts have  consistently held that the Act  is not\r\n\nretroactive.  Miller  v. CBC  Cos., 908 F.  Supp. 1054,  1062\r                                              \r\n\n(D.N.H. 1995) (\"there is little doubt the First Circuit would\r\n\ndecline to  extend the continuing violation  theory to permit\r\n\n[plaintiff]   to   recover   for  the   defendants'   pre-ADA\r\n\nconduct.\").  As a  result, to uphold  a claim under the  ADA,\r\n\nthere must  be evidence  that the claimant  was discriminated\r\n\nagainst because of a disability on or after July 26, 1992.\r\n\n          Morrison's discrimination claim, however,  is based\r\n\non Carleton's rejection of  her request, made in the  fall of\r\n\n1991, to be  allowed to continue in  the floorperson position\r\n\nthat  she had previously held.  The Company's decision to bar\r\n\nher from the position  was effectively made, and communicated\r\n\nto  her, in November 1991, eight  months before the statute's\r\n\neffective date.  While  Morrison grieved the decision through\r\n\nher   union,  in  proceedings   strenuously  pursued  through\r\n\nFebruary  of 1992,  and  while the  grievance process  itself\r\n\nappears  to  have continued  into 1993,  when the  matter was\r\n\nstated  to  be  arbitrated,  its subject  was  the  Company's\r\n\nalleged  unfair practice in the  fall of 1991.   Morrison has\r\n\nnot  pointed to  additional incidents that  took place  on or\r\n\nafter July 26, 1992, which constituted separate violations of\r\n\nthe ADA during the later period.    \r\n\n                             -37-\r\r\n\n          The regulations promulgated pursuant to the ADA add\r\n\nnothing to  Morrison's  claim.   These  regulations  prohibit\r\n\ndisability  discrimination with  respect  to \"  . . . layoff,\r\n\ntermination, right to return from layoff, and rehiring.\"   29\r                                                    \r\n\nC.F.R.    1630.4(b)  (1996) (emphasis  added).   However, the\r\n\ndenial  of any right Morrison  had to return  from layoff was\r\n\ncomplete  well before July 26, 1992.  Morrison was denied the\r\n\nfloorperson  position in the fall of 1991 after she sought to\r\n\nreturn from  medical leave.   By  then  Morrison had  already\r\n\naccepted a layoff slip in lieu of bidding on another job, and\r\n\nremained on layoff until November 23, 1992, when she accepted\r\n\nthe \"fixer\" position  with the Company.   Morrison would have\r\n\nus  find a continuing violation,  based on a  theory that not\r\n\nrestoring her to her old  floorperson position formed part of\r\n\na continuous  chain of  misconduct extending beyond  the July\r\n\n26, 1992 deadline.  But the Company's inaction is not enough.\r\n\nAs  we  said  in  a somewhat  analogous  situation,  \"'it was\r\n\nincumbent upon  [her] to allege facts  giving some indication\r\n\nthat    the   later   refusals   were   themselves   separate\r\n\n. . . violations.'\"  Velazquez v.  Chardon, 736 F.2d 831, 833\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1984) (quoting Goldman v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 607\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1014, 1018 (1st Cir. 1979)).\r\n\n          As    Morrison    does    not   demonstrate    that\r\n\ndiscriminatory  conduct  forming a  basis  of  her ADA  claim\r\n\noccurred  after  July  26,  1992,  we  need  not  decide  the\r\n\n                             -38-\r\r\n\nCompany's  further  contention that  Morrison's  claim failed\r\n\nbecause  her   purported   disability  did   not   meet   the\r\n\ndefinitional  requirements of the Act.  There may be merit to\r\n\nthis and related substantive contentions, but we do not reach\r\n\nthem  because   Morrison's  asserted  violation  of  the  ADA\r\n\noccurred prior to July 26, 1992.\r\n\nD. Riley's Individual Liability\r                                           \r\n\n          In footnotes in  their briefs, the parties  contest\r\n\nwhether  Riley  can  be held  liable  under  Count  I in  his\r\n\nindividual capacity for violations of Title VII and the Maine\r\n\nHuman  Rights Act.  We  deal separately with  the federal and\r\n\nthe state aspects of this issue.\r\n\n     1. Individual Liability under Title VII\r                                                        \r\n\n          Title VII defines \"employer\",  in relevant part, as\r\n\n\"a  person engaged in an industry  affecting commerce who has\r\n\nfifteen  or  more employees  . . . and  any agent  of  such a\r\n\nperson.\"    42  U.S.C.    2000e(b)  (West  1994).   There  is\r\n\ncontroversy over  whether this  language  allows a  corporate\r\n\nsupervisor, such as Riley, to be sued as the \"agent of such a\r\n\nperson.\"   Several circuits have held \"No.\"  See, e.g., Tomka\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d  1295, 1313-17 (2d  Cir. 1995); but\r                                                                         \r\n\nsee id. at 1318-24 (Judge Parker's dissenting opinion).   The\r                   \r\n\nquestion has no very obvious answer.\r\n\n          We decline to answer it here.  The district court's\r\n\nruling that Riley was liable under Title VII for pre-November\r\n\n                             -39-\r\r\n\n21,  1991 sexual harassment (Count I) has little or no actual\r\n\nimpact on Riley that we can discern.  Neither the Company nor\r\n\nRiley were or can be held  answerable in damages for the pre-\r\n\nNovember  21, 1991 conduct, and  it is not  apparent that any\r\n\nother available type of federal relief can be applied against\r\n\nRiley notwithstanding  the court's  determination that  he is\r\n\nliable under Title VII.  In such circumstances, and given the\r\n\nabsence  of  developed  argument  by  the  parties and  of  a\r\n\nreasoned disposition  of this question by the court below, we\r\n\nare not inclined to seize this  opportunity to create circuit\r\n\nprecedent on this relatively complex issue.\r\n\n     2. Individual Liability under the Maine Human Rights Act\r                                                                         \r\n\n          In   finding  Riley   liable,  together   with  his\r\n\nemployer, under  Maine state law for  sexual harassment under\r\n\nCount  I,   the  court  imposed  a   $10,000  civil  penalty.\r\n\nAuthority  for the penalty is found in the Maine Human Rights\r\n\nAct.   5 M.R.S.A.   4613(2)(B)(7) (West Supp. 1996).  Riley's\r\n\nliability for  that penalty  is apparently joint  and several\r\n\nwith the Company's.   The state  law judgment against  Riley,\r\n\ntherefore, is not  merely academic, as was the  adverse Title\r\n\nVII finding, supra.\r                              \r\n\n          Still, we  are disinclined to rule at  this time on\r\n\nwhether or not Maine law  allows individual liability.  While\r\n\narguably the different language of the Maine law more clearly\r\n\nallows individual liability  than does Title VII, there is no\r\n\n                             -40-\r\r\n\nrelevant state court precedent.  A  federal district court in\r\n\nMaine  has  construed  the  law  as   disallowing  individual\r                                                             \r\n\nliability, relying on the  federal precedent that trends that\r\n\nway.

Appellants'  objection  to  allowing\r\n\nindividual  recovery here was not set out in the statement of\r\n\nissues  in their  brief, and  consists of  one sentence  in a\r\n\nfootnote, together with a citation to Quiron and a subsequent\r                                                        \r\n\ncase.

See Wright,  Miller,  Cooper  and\r                                           \r\n\nGressman, Federal  Practice and  Procedure, Vol. 16,    3974,\r                                                      \r\n\nn.1 (West 1977 &amp; Supp. 1996).  The district court  itself did\r\n\nnot  have occasion  to discuss  the issue,  although appellee\r\n\nconcedes that  defendants  raised it  in one  of their  trial\r\n\nmotions.  Riley is  represented by the same attorneys  as the\r\n\nCompany and, for all  that appears, may never be  required by\r\n\nhis  employer  to share  personally  in  the  payment of  the\r\n\n$10,000 penalty.\r\n\n          Under   these  circumstances,  we  think  the  most\r\n\nsatisfactory  way  to  handle  the issue  is  to  vacate  the\r\n\nindividual judgment  against Riley  under Count I  and remand\r\n\nwith  instructions that,  if either  party wishes,  the court\r\n\n                             -41-\r\r\n\nshall reopen, and expressly  rule upon, the issue  of whether\r\n\nthe Maine Human Rights Act provides for individual liability.\r\n\nIn  so doing, the court  may, in its  discretion, certify the\r\n\nquestion to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.  This course\r\n\nwill  ensure  either a  reasoned  decision  or a  dispositive\r\n\nruling by Maine's  highest court.   It will  also enable  the\r\n\nparties and the court to drop the matter if, as the  parties'\r\n\ncasual treatment suggests, it is of no  practical interest to\r\n\nthem.\r\n\n          The legal questions  of individual liability  under\r\n\nboth  Title VII and  the Maine statute  are significant ones.\r\n\nPrecisely  because this is so, we  do not wish to decide them\r\n\nin the fragmented, undeveloped setting in which they appear.\r\n\n                              V.\r\n\n          We affirm the district  court's rulings on Counts I\r\n\nand  II, except  we vacate  the finding  against  Riley under\r\n\nCount I.

Morrison against her employer Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc.  (the \"Company\"), and two of her supervisors, Michael Riley and Lee Moody.  We affirm certain parts of the district court's judgment and reverse others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count I of her amended complaint, Morrison alleged that she was subjected by Carleton and the other defendants to sexual harassment, in violation of the Maine Human Rights Act, 5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4551, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq.   In Count II, she alleged violation of the same state and federal statutes by reason of sex discrimination.  In Counts III and IV, Morrison alleged that defendants had subjected her to discrimination on account of disability, in violation of the Maine Human Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the \"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial before a jury began in the district court on October 4, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Title VII claims of sexual harassment (Count I) and sex (gender) discrimination (Count II) were presented to the jury but only insofar as these claims were based upon conduct occurring on or after November 21, 1991, the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).  The ADA disability discrimination claim (Count IV) was likewise presented to the jury.  However, the Maine law claims for sexual harassment, sex discrimination and disability discrimination, and the Title VII claims for pre-November 21, 1991 conduct did not go to the jury but rather were reserved for later decision by the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the jury trial, the court, upon defendants' motion, dismissed as a matter of law all the claims (jury and non-jury) against Moody and many of the claims against Riley, to wit, the claims for sexual harassment (Count I) after November 21, 1991, for sex discrimination (Count II), and for disability discrimination (Counts III and IV).  The court denied the Company's motions to dismiss the claims against itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 1994, the jury returned verdicts in Morrison's favor on her Title VII post-November 21, 1991 sexual harassment claim (Count I) and her ADA disability claim (Count IV).  The jury awarded Morrison $50,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages.  The jury found against Morrison, and in favor of the Company, on her Title VII gender discrimination claim (Count II).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 10, 1995, the court issued its Memorandum of Decision deciding the non-jury claims that it had reserved for bench determination.  On Count I, the court found that Morrison had been subjected to sexual harassment sufficiently severe and pervasive to create a hostile work environment prior to November 21, 1991.  Consequently, it ruled in Morrison's favor, and against the Company and Riley, on her Maine law sexual harassment claim, and also on her Title VII sexual harassment claim for conduct prior to November 21, 1991.  The court assessed a civil penalty for $10,000 under state law.  5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4613(2)(B)(7) (West Supp.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Count II (gender discrimination) the court found no incidents of gender discrimination before November 21, 1991.  It, therefore, ruled in favor of the defendants and against Morrison under Title VII.  The court determined, however--contrary to the jury's Title VII verdict--that, after November 21, 1991, Morrison had been subjected to gender discrimination, finding the Company liable under the Maine Human Rights Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court declined, however, to award her back pay, because it would be duplicative of the jury's damages award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as to Count III, the court determined that plaintiff had not been disabled within the meaning of Maine law, and hence found against Morrison and for defendants on the Maine law disability claim.  In determining that Morrison was not disabled, the court found that the Company \"did not perceive her to be unable to perform a major life activity, specifically work.\"   The court noted that the Company had only perceived Morrison as incapable of performing the single position of floorperson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law, for new trial, and other relief were denied.  Plaintiff's own motion for new trial was also denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company and Riley appeal, and Morrison cross-appeals, from the judgment and the rulings on the various motions below.  Morrison has since expressly waived her cross-appeal from the jury's adverse verdict under Count II (gender discrimination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence at trial, construed in the light most favorable to Morrison, showed essentially the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 23, 1983, Morrison was hired by the Company to work as a \"spinner\" in the spinning department.  Later that year, Morrison bid on and was awarded the position of \"sewer.\"   Months later, she bid on and was awarded the position of \"coner\" in the yarn preparation department.  Morrison held this position from approximately May of 1984 until January of 1987.  All the positions held by Morrison up to this time were traditionally filled by female employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1986, Morrison bid on the position of \"temporary floorperson\" on the third shift in the yarn preparation department.  At this time, Riley was the shift supervisor on the third shift in the yarn preparation department.  Riley was angry with Morrison for bidding on the floorperson position.  Prior to December 1986, Morrison had once had an angry encounter with Riley when they both worked on the second shift.  Riley had screamed at her for leaving her machine to go to the restroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A month later, Morrison was awarded the temporary floorperson position.  As shift supervisor, Riley approved her transfer to the position and certified her satisfactory completion of the thirty-day probationary period.  However, he had no discretion under the Company's contract with the Union to refuse a position to the most senior qualified person who bid on it, which, in this case, was Morrison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Morrison told Fred DeVaudreuil, the department supervisor and Riley's superior, that she had been awarded the floorperson position, he asked her to reconsider taking it.  He indicated that the Company was not happy with her getting the job.  Morrison believed that he was concerned that she would be injured and assured him that she would be careful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1987, seven female employees of Carleton filed a formal grievance against Riley, charging that he was harassing employees at the Company by yelling, making false accusations and threatening their jobs.  The Company responded by stating that it did not condone shouting by anyone, but that employees must recognize that they are not at liberty \"to ignore management directives or to be tardy in following them.\"   Ultimately, this grievance was resolved informally, with Plant Manager Everett Owens advising Riley about the need to be more \"low key.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1988, Morrison bid on the permanent opening for the position of floorperson on the third shift.  Once again, Riley became very angry, telling Morrison that the job was not for her, and that she was taking jobs away from men.  Days after Morrison was awarded the floorperson bid, Riley told her that she was going to regret it, and that sooner or later he was going to get her out of the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The floorperson is responsible for bringing boxes of yarn on bobbins to the machine operators, for taking full cones of yarn, weighing them and storing them, and for changing the warp beams.  Changing a warp beam, which can weigh up to 1,100 pounds when full of yarn, involves several steps.  First, the warp is removed from its cradle with a crow-bar type of tool.  The warp then drops about two inches, after which it must be rolled to where it can be picked up by a hydraulic lift and moved into a storage area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison remained in the floorperson position until March of 1989.  During that time various incidents occurred that are relevant to the present action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After changing a warp beam, Morrison went to wash her hands.  When she left the restroom moments later, Riley was waiting for her.  He accused her of being in the restroom for a long time and threatened to write her up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley took Morrison into the plant manager's office.  He then told her that he was a big person within the Company and that \"any woman would be proud to have a man in a position like this.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several female employees complained that the room was too hot because of the machinery.  They asked Riley if he could open more of the ceiling vents.  Riley said he thought that they were just having \"hot flashes\", and walked away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley threatened to fire Morrison if she did not drive his girlfriend (and future wife) and co-employee, Juanita Courtney, to her house from work during her shift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley told several people in Morrison's presence that the other female floorperson, Linda Paul, was able to stay in such a position because she and Moody patted each other on the rearend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison reported a problem with a box of yarn to Riley, who told her she was probably so dumb she created the problem herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley told Morrison that Courtney was pregnant.  He said \"you thought I was too old, didn't you\", and \"I showed you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1989, Morrison accepted a position as the medical clerk for the Company nurse, Lucille Turner.  Two months later, Morrison decided that she wanted to return to her former position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1989, Morrison bid on a temporary coner, fixer and tender (\"fixer\") position.  Riley flew into a rage, telling Morrison that she was \"stepping out of bounds\" and that \"her place was in the kitchen.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Morrison bid on a permanent fixer position.  Riley told her fellow workers that if she got the job, she would have to travel to a training seminar and share a motel room with Moody and another male worker.  Morrison voided her bid in an effort to stop speculation about the seminar, and returned to her floorperson position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1990, a first shift floorperson, William Rogers, asked Morrison to swap shifts with him.  Even though Riley had moved to the first shift, Morrison agreed to the switch.  Riley told Morrison that he \"was not going to put up with any bullshit on the first shift\" and that he \"had enough bitches in the first shift.\"   Riley also called a male coworker over to where he and Morrison were standing and began patting him in the rearend, and told her that she would have to get used to such behavior in the first shift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley and Moody moved their desk near the women's restroom, explaining that they wanted to watch the usage of the restroom so that they could write female workers up for abusing the privilege of using the restroom.  Also, they regularly made comments about Morrison bending over boxes to the point where she felt very uncomfortable having to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other incidents occurred between the spring of 1990 and the fall of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley handed Morrison a piece of paper, which he said was an application for a fixer position.  She turned over the paper and discovered, to her annoyance, that it was entitled \"Application for a Piece of Ass.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley gave Morrison an ink-blot that, when folded, depicted various sexual acts involving persons and animals.  He called her a \"dumb broad\" for being unable to properly fold it, after which he folded it for her.  Morrison became very upset and called Riley a \"filthy pig.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley told Morrison that Moody wanted to do \"funny things\" to her body, although Moody later denied ever making such a comment.  On another occasion, Moody approached Morrison and told her that he would like to see her naked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moody handed Morrison a document entitled \"Canadian Condom Marketing Board\", which contained sexually-oriented attempts at humor.  Morrison asked Moody why he was doing this, and he replied something to the effect that he takes his orders from the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley asked Morrison if she knew what a man with a ten-inch penis eats for breakfast.  When she did not respond, he proceeded to tell her what he had eaten for breakfast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley gave Morrison a document entitled \"Proposed Restroom Policy.\"   This document, another crude attempt at humor, informed employees that if they occupied the bathroom stalls for more than three minutes, certain events would occur, including the taking of their photographs in the stalls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley regularly screamed and hollered at the women employees in the yarn preparation department, but not at the men.  If any of the women indicated that they might complain about his behavior, he would tell them \"pay-back's a bitch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period of time, Morrison went, on two occasions, to the office of Annette McGowan, the Company's personnel manager, to complain about Riley's harassing behavior.  On neither occasion was Morrison allowed to speak with McGowan.  McGowan's secretary told Morrison that she would not be allowed to see McGowan without her supervisor's permission, even though Morrison informed her that her complaint was about Riley, her supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1991, Morrison injured her shoulder at work.  She kept working, but was eventually diagnosed with tendinitis, and told to take ibuprofen and learn to pace herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1991, Morrison injured her back at home while she was making her bed.  Morrison went to the Belgrade Regional Health Center where she saw Gretchen Hill, a registered nurse-practitioner.  Hill found that Morrison appeared to have a lower lumbar muscle strain without any disc problems.  Hill informed Turner, the Company's nurse, that Morrison would be absent for one week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison returned to see Hill one week later.  By that time, the pain was gone, although she was experiencing some stiffness.  Hill was considering allowing Morrison to return to work, so she called Turner again.  Turner suggested that Morrison should be kept out of work for two more weeks, a suggestion that Hill accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1991, Hill issued Morrison a return to work slip for full activity.  Hill testified that she would have preferred Morrison to work in a limited capacity for a short period of time, but she felt that Morrison could successfully return to work without restriction.  Following another conversation with Turner, Hill wrote a new note on November 13, 1991, which suggested that Morrison be placed on light duty work from November 11 through November 22, and then return to regular duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner and McGowan met with Morrison and informed her that the Company had no light duty work available at the time.  McGowan then offered Morrison the option of bidding into a different position, or accepting a layoff slip, which would entitle her to unemployment benefits.  Morrison did not want to lose her floorperson seniority by bidding into a different position, so she accepted the layoff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison believed that she had medical clearance to return to regular duty after November 22, 1991, and so, on November 25, 1991, she went to the yarn preparation department and sought to punch in.  Morrison could not find her own timecard, and asked Moody where she could find it.  Moody responded by saying, \"Girlie, I don't know.  You're not coming back to my department.  Go see nursie.\"   Morrison felt \"stupid.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner told Morrison that she remained on layoff, and that she had no authority to allow her to work.  Turner advised Morrison to speak with McGowan.  McGowan informed Morrison that she did not have the authority to return her to work absent medical clearance, and suggested that she see Dr. Barron, the Company's physician.  On November 26, 1991, the next day, Morrison went to see Dr. Barron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The examination of Morrison consisted of the nurse taking her blood pressure, temperature and weight, and the doctor asking her how she felt.  Dr. Barron advised Morrison that he would be going to view the floorperson position, but he reported to her (and wrote in his office notes) that he saw no physical reason why she could not return to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After he viewed the floorperson position, Dr. Barron wrote the following notation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>\"I feel that [Morrison] can do most of the work without any problems.  However, when it came to watching the warp removed, I felt that this was far too much for a woman with tendinitis and a back problem.  I understand that these warps weigh in the neighborhood of 500 pounds and the manipulation of moving them onto a hydraulic lift is certainly more than she can do.  Over a period of time, I feel that she would be crippled doing this job.  With tendinitis and back problems within a year she will be out of work and on disability.  My recommendation is that she not be put on this type of job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Barron did not speak to Morrison's treating physician or her nurse-practitioner.  Dr. Barron disregarded their opinions which indicated that Morrison was capable of fulfilling her duties, because they had not seen the floorperson position.  At the time of trial, Morrison was still not permitted to work in the floorperson position on the basis of Dr. Barron's evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 23, 1992, Morrison returned to work after she decided to bid on a fixer position.  She received the position, although after a month she was \"bumped\", was laid off for a few weeks, accepted a creeler position, and eventually returned as a fixer.  After a dispute over being paid as a temporary fixer, Morrison finally attained permanent fixer status.  Since she returned, Morrison has worked primarily on the third shift, under different supervisors from Riley and Moody.  Morrison testified that she had no problems with Riley and Moody after she returned as they stayed away from her.  The Company's personnel manager told Morrison that she had spoken to the people Morrison would be working with and that they would not harass her about her former complaints.  Morrison was to report back any complaints she might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison further testified, however, that, after her return, most of her co-workers would no longer speak to her.  She felt that this was due to the fact that most of those who spoke to her were harassed afterwards by supervisors for doing so.  Also, the third shift supervisor, Ernest Clark, often criticized Morrison for her job performance.  The Company, moreover, never asked Morrison to substitute when the floorperson was absent, even though employees with less experience were asked to do the floorperson's job.

Under Title VII, \"unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when:  (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;  (2) submission or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such an individual;  or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1604.11(a) (1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.

We said that an employer \"is liable upon a finding of hostile environment sexual harassment perpetrated by its supervisors upon employees if an official representing that institution knew, or ... should have known, of the harassment's occurrence, unless that official can show that he or she took appropriate steps to halt it.\"  Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 901.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimants under Title VII were, until recently, limited to the equitable remedies of injunctive relief and back pay.  The 1991 Civil Rights Act, which became effective on November 21, 1991, amended Title VII, and, for the first time, authorized individuals alleging intentional unlawful discrimination to seek compensatory and punitive damages against their employers.  The 1991 Act also conferred upon Title VII plaintiffs the right to a trial by jury.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)-(c) (West 1994).  In Landgraf, the Supreme Court held that the right to such damages and to a jury trial did not apply to conduct that occurred prior to the effective date of the Act, i.e. prior to November 21, 1991.

Insofar as the Title VII harassment claim was for conduct prior to that date, it was tried to the magistrate judge, who also determined in its entirety Morrison's claim that the alleged sexual harassment violated the Maine Human Rights Act.  Because Title VII damages were only recoverable for post-November 21, 1991 sexual harassment, that date assumes great importance here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Before November 21, 1991</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pre-November 21, 1991 period, as to which the magistrate judge rather than the jury was the trier of fact, the court determined under Count I that Morrison \"was subjected to sexual harassment sufficiently 'severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment' \", quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370.   The court also found that Morrison \" 'subjectively perceive[d] the environment to be abusive.' \"  Id.  This hostile environment was found to have existed prior to November 21, 1991, and the Company was found to have known about it, or should have known about it, because it was so pervasive.  The Company's plant manager and plant supervisor<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> were found to have worked in the same general area as plaintiff and Riley, \"and could not have missed the discriminatory atmosphere that permeated the department.\"   Based on these conclusions, the court found against the Company and Riley on Morrison's claims of hostile environment sexual harassment under Maine law and under Title VII for conduct occurring before November 21, 1991.  We find ample record evidence to sustain these findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we turn to defendants' contention that the federal and state statutes of limitations do not allow us to look at any conduct antedating the middle of 1991 in support of the hostile environment claims.  Section 2000e-5(e)(1) of Title VII provides that claimants must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1) (West 1994).  Section 4613(2)(C) of the Maine Human Rights Act states that \"[t]he action shall be commenced not more than two years after the act of unlawful discrimination complained of.\"  5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4613(2)(C) (West 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Morrison filed her charge with the EEOC on April 23, 1992, and her complaint with the district court on September 3, 1993, the appellants argue that only acts of sexual harassment occurring after June 27, 1991, for her federal claim, and after September 3, 1991, for her state claim, should be considered in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.  We disagree.  The district court found that the hostile environment at Carleton had existed for a number of years prior to November 21, 1991 and continued beyond September 3, 1991.  We have held that there is no prohibition on recovery for earlier conduct if the \"systemic violation\" extends into the limitation period.  See Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 523 (1st Cir.1990).  Here, the systemic violation continued without interruption from the late 1980's onward through September 3, 1991.  It was, therefore, appropriate for the district court to look at defendants' conduct dating back to the 1980's, and we may do likewise, in evaluating Morrison's federal and state sexual harassment claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the late 1980s into the fall of 1991, there was ample evidence of crude, demeaning and sexually-oriented behavior by Riley and others directed at Morrison.  A rational factfinder could conclude that the harassment was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to Morrison because of her gender.  Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 370-71.   There is, indeed, evidence that the harassment went so far as to adversely affect Morrison's ability to function, by making her fearful to apply for certain employment opportunities and undermining her mental and emotional well-being.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, the appellants argue that the Company, as an entity, cannot be held liable because Morrison has not shown that it knew, or should have known, of the harassment.  Morrison did not complain of harassment to the Company during the period, even though there were procedures available to file such complaints.  This is a closer question, but we find sufficient evidence to support the finding of the magistrate judge that the Company knew or should have known that the hostile environment existed despite plaintiff's failure to use official procedures to complain.  In April 1987, several female employees of Carleton had filed a grievance against Riley, alleging that he was harassing them.  At that time, Plant Manager Everett Owens told Riley to be more \"low key\", but never took any action to discipline or more closely supervise him.  In the years before the trial of this case, Union President Gwendolyn Gatcomb brought several complaints concerning Riley's behavior to the attention of Company personnel.  In spite of these complaints, Riley and other Carleton supervisors were allowed to continue with their responsibilities and their harassing conduct.  Morrison testified that she had tried to bring the matter to the attention of Personnel Manager Annette McGowan, but had been unable to see her.  The magistrate judge found that the layout of the mill was such that higher management \"could not have missed the discriminatory atmosphere that permeated the department.\"   We are satisfied that the evidence sufficiently supports the court's above finding, and can see no justification to disturb it on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. After November 21, 1991</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For us to affirm the jury's award of damages to Morrison on her Count I Title VII sexual harassment claim, the record must reveal evidence of conduct on or after November 21, 1991--the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act--sufficient to have created a hostile environment as that term is used under Title VII.  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 244-45, 114 S.Ct. at 1486-87.   Hostile environment sexual harassment is a particular species of sex discrimination.  The EEOC's regulations, as noted, describe it as \"[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature ... when ... (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1604.11(a) (1996).  The Supreme Court speaks of a \"workplace ... permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult' ... that is 'sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of a person's employment and create an abusive working environment.' \"  Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the jury heard extensive evidence of the vulgar pre-November 21, 1991 incidents which, as we have held, amply support the magistrate judge's finding of hostile environment sexual harassment during that earlier time.  However, the jury's task was to determine Title VII liabilities and damages for the period from November 21, 1991 onward.  The jury could take the earlier conduct into account only to the extent it was legally relevant to what later happened--for example, to help prove the intent behind an act committed after November 21, 1991, or the act's likely effect on someone like Morrison.  See, e.g., Fed.R.Evid. 402, 403, 404(b), 406, 412.  The earlier abuse is no substitute for proof of actual sexual harassment occurring in the post-November 21, 1991 period.  Because we cannot find evidence of sexually abusive conduct in this later period sufficient to support the jury's Title VII award under Count I, we are obliged to reverse that part of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From October 19, 1991 until November 23, 1992, Morrison was either on medical leave or on layoff from Carleton, hence she could not, during that period, have been subjected to workplace abuse, nor could her work performance at Carleton have been interfered with by abusive conduct while there.  The only incident during that period that might be construed as workplace sexual harassment occurred on November 25, 1991, when Morrison went to Carleton seeking to return to work.  Moody refused to let her punch in, telling her she had first to get medical clearance.  In turning her away, Moody called Morrison \"Girlie\" and told her to go see \"nursie\", raising the question whether use of these terms made Moody's remark so offensive as to support a finding of hostile environment sexual harassment.  In order to assess Moody's probable intent when he spoke as he did on November 25, 1991 and the reasonable effect of the phraseology on Morrison, see Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 370-71 (citing Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405-06), the jury could consider the evidence of Moody's and others' prior offensive conduct and remarks in the period before November 21, 1991.  In light of that history, the jury could reasonably construe Moody's use of the terms \"Girlie\" and \"nursie\" as demeaning, rather than as merely light-hearted banter, and could also determine that Morrison had reason to be offended.  Morrison testified that Moody's remark, made at a time when \"everybody was lined up getting ready to punch in\", made her feel \"stupid.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unable to conclude, however, that Moody's \"Girlie-nursie\" remark was, by itself, a sufficient basis to hold the Company liable to Morrison under her Title VII sexual harassment claim.  Morrison was not working at the time.  Her contact on this one day with the Company's work environment was fleeting.  There is no evidence the Company knew of or sanctioned Moody's particular phraseology.  We know of no case where a single, brief encounter of this mildly offensive sort, at a time when the plaintiff was not actually working, and hence could not be affected in her work performance and conditions of employment, has been held to create a sexually hostile workplace environment.  See, e.g., Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (conduct must be severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment affecting employee's conditions of employment);  Chamberlin v. 101 Realty, Inc., 915 F.2d 777, 783 (1st Cir.1990) (single or isolated remarks do not establish a hostile environment).  Even assuming this incident, when coupled with the more serious pre-November 21, 1991 incidents, might lead a rational jury to conclude that the earlier abusive environment would have remained the same through November 25, 1991, the fact that Morrison was not working at Carleton from November 21, 1991 until November 23, 1992--a year later--makes this conclusion largely irrelevant to her claim for damages during this period.  Morrison could not have been injured by hostility at a workplace she did not attend.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We realize that Morrison contends that she accepted layoff status only because of the Company's refusal during this period to let her return to her floorperson position.  Morrison insists that the refusal, while supposedly based on health concerns, was actually based on the Company's bias against women working as floorpersons.  The jury, however, specifically rejected Morrison's Count II, Title VII sex discrimination claim premised on such a theory, finding for the Company on Count II.  The magistrate judge, contrary to the jury, later upheld Morrison's sex discrimination claim under Maine law, holding that the Company's refusal to allow Morrison to go back to her floorperson position was gender-based and discriminatory.  But the jury's verdict is conclusive on the part of the Count II claim seeking damages under Title VII.  The jury found for Morrison on her Count I claim of hostile environment sexual harassment, but, as we discuss here, there was insufficient evidence of abuse during the post-November 21, 1991 period for us to affirm the award of damages under that theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the period of over a year during which she did not work at the Company (from October 19, 1991 until November 23, 1992), Morrison finally returned to work.  But the record covering the period after Morrison's return to work on November 23, 1992 provides scant support for her hostile environment claim.  When she returned, she accepted a different, somewhat higher-paying position<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>, and reported to new supervisors.  There is no evidence that, in this new position, her supervisors, or any other person for that matter, subjected her to \"discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult\", Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370, much less to sexually offensive, embarrassing or vulgar conduct or remarks, or other sex-based conduct or remarks, such as had occurred prior to November 21, 1991 when she was working as a floorperson under Riley.  The Company's personnel manager advised her that employees had been warned to treat her fairly and equitably, and that she was to report anything offensive immediately so that it could be corrected.  Morrison did not thereafter complain of sexual harassment to Company personnel.  Morrison conceded that her old nemeses, Riley and Moody, stayed away from her, and never harassed her after she returned to work.  Morrison, nonetheless, points to certain incidents that occurred during this later period, which, according to her, gave rise to a hostile work environment at Carleton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison testified that most of the people with whom she had worked for years would no longer speak to her when she returned to work in November 23, 1992, ostensibly because discouraged by management from doing so.  The few that did were reprimanded by their supervisors afterwards.  Morrison felt that some of her co-workers would no longer cooperate with her, thereby making her job much more difficult, and that one of her new supervisors, Ernest Clark, would occasionally assign her excessive work.  Ernest Clark, according to Morrison, would also follow her around and look for flaws in her work, and would often blame her for mistakes that were not of her own doing.  Morrison further complained that, for some time after she had completed a training period, she received temporary pay, instead of regular pay, for her work as a fixer, and that, despite her seniority, she never was asked to fill in for those employees with higher-ranking jobs within the Company.  Lastly, Morrison claimed that she saw a petition expressing support for Riley and Moody circulating throughout the Company, an event that, she says, led her to seek professional counselling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison argues that she does not need to show that management's conduct during this later period was \"expressly sexual\" in order to establish a sexually hostile work environment based on gender discrimination.  We accept that many different forms of offensive behavior may be included within the definition of hostile environment sexual harassment.  See Spain v. Gallegos, 26 F.3d 439, 447 (3d Cir.1994) (employee can show that there is a sexually hostile work environment \"without proving blatant sexual misconduct.\").  However, the overtones of such behavior must be, at the very least, sex-based, so as to be a recognizable form of sex discrimination.  McKinney v. Dole, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 (D.C.Cir.1985).  Merely because a supervisor is overbearing or fellow employees unsociable and hard to get along with, does not suffice unless underlying motives of a sexual or gender discriminatory nature are implicated.  Spain, 26 F.3d at 449.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The post-November 23, 1992 conduct alleged by Morrison occurred over a year after the earlier sexually-explicit misconduct by the other supervisors in her former position.  The later conduct, as said, was not the kind associated with a claim for hostile environment sexual harassment.  See, e.g., Gross v. Burggraf Constr.  Co., 53 F.3d 1531, 1546 (10th Cir.1995) (employee did not establish a gender-based hostile environment by showing that employer reprimanded her in front of other employees, grilled her about some plans to bring discrimination charges against him, and told her \"she was skating on thin ice.\").  It was not shown that Supervisor Clark's harshness was based on annoyance with her as a woman, or because he regarded the fixer position as off limits for women.  A connection between Morrison's gender and the incidents she complains of was not established.  The record contains no evidence that Morrison complained to the Company that she was being subjected at this time to further sexual harassment or that the Company knew or should have believed that Morrison was being subjected to sexual harassment then.  If the Company deliberately sought to isolate or punish Morrison for her earlier complaints of harassment, by telling other employees not to speak to her, such conduct might have supported a claim for unlawful retaliation, but not for sexual harassment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The evidence presented by Morrison is simply insufficient to establish a post-November 21, 1991 sexually hostile work environment created by severe or pervasive sex-based harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison seeks to overcome the deficiencies in the evidence by contending that the more recent, non-sexual incidents could be linked to the pattern of vulgar, sexually-related misconduct that occurred at Carleton prior to the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.  Morrison urges that the later incidents could be evaluated by the jury, not in isolation, but rather as a continuation of what she and other employees encountered at the Company before November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This point might have arguable merit relative to Moody's \"Girlie-nursie\" remark on November 25, 1991, were it not for the isolated nature of this incident, occurring as it did when Morrison was on continuous leave, hence not at the workplace so as to be exposed to a hostile environment.  As to the events after her return to work on November 23, 1992, the pre-November 21, 1991 harassment was too remote in time and character to transform the later conduct into the different kind of behavior needed to support a damages claim for hostile environment sexual harassment.  Morrison, by then, was working in a new position with other supervisors.  To establish that she was entitled to damages for being subjected to hostile environment discrimination during this later period, she had to show some conduct within that time frame fitting into a cognizable definition of abusive work environment harassment.  If this were not so, the Company would be held liable for conduct which it would not have known was either improper or a source of potential liability under the \"hostile environment\" theory at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the foregoing, we hold that there was insufficient evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that Morrison was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment at Carleton after November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Gender Discrimination (Count II)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count II, the district court ruled in the Company's favor on Morrison's federal claim, finding that there were no incidents of sex discrimination against Morrison prior to November 21, 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The district court, however, held that Morrison had established sex discrimination after November 21, 1991, and entered judgment in her favor under Maine law.  We find that there is sufficient evidence in the record below to support the court's state law ruling and, accordingly, we affirm its judgment in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first found that Morrison was not permitted to return to her floorperson position on November 25, 1991 \"because of Lucille Turner's, Annette McGowan's, and Dr. Barron's perception that women would more likely be severely injured in the floorperson position than would men.\"   The record permits the inference that Morrison's injury was temporary and not especially serious.  The evidence shows that Turner convinced Hill to extend Morrison's layoff, and later suggested that Morrison should not be allowed to return to the floorperson position.  When Morrison was given the choice of either accepting a layoff or leaving the floorperson position, McGowan told her that \"she should have seen this coming because ... [the Company] did not want [her] on the job.\"   Finally, even though Dr. Barron talked extensively with Turner about Morrison's physical condition, he refused to consult with her treating physician or her nurse-practitioner, both of whom felt she was fit to perform her floorperson duties, in recommending that she be kept out of the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that it was satisfied that \"a man presenting the same medical history and clearance to return to work would have been immediately permitted to do so.\"   The record below gives credence to this statement, as two longtime Carleton employees, William Rogers and Norman Williams, testified that the Company has permitted them to remain in their physically-demanding jobs, despite the fact that they have, respectively, a chronic back problem and a ruptured cervical disc.  Moreover, Leland Rice, who, at one time, worked as a floorperson at Carleton, and who is only five foot three inches tall and weighs no more than 140 pounds, testified that he did not find any aspect of the job, including the removal of the warp beam, to be very difficult to perform.  It could be found, therefore, that, while Carleton seized upon Morrison's relatively minor medical problems to exclude her from the floorperson position, it allowed other male employees, with more serious ailments and less physical abilities, to continue working for the Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, to be sure, that there was also evidence suggesting that legitimate health-based considerations had motivated the Company's decision.  But this is the kind of matter best sorted out by the trial court.  There was sufficient evidence to support a reasonable trier's finding that Morrison was rejected because of her gender.  The court was entitled to conclude that Morrison's sex \"was a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 155 (1st Cir.1990).  Finding no error, we affirm.  We also hold that, on remand, the court should reopen the issue of back pay given our vacation of the damages awards under Counts I and IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Disability Discrimination (Count IV)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count IV, the jury returned a verdict in Morrison's favor on her federal ADA claim.  When this claim was submitted to the jury, the court correctly told the jury that Morrison could recover only for violations of the Act occurring on or after July 26, 1992, the effective date of the Act.  Because the record reveals no evidence of any post-July 26, 1992 violations, we are obliged to overturn the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ever since the ADA became effective on July 26, 1992, the courts have consistently held that the Act is not retroactive.  Miller v. CBC Cos., 908 F.Supp. 1054, 1062 (D.N.H.1995) (\"there is little doubt the First Circuit would decline to extend the continuing violation theory to permit [plaintiff] to recover for the defendants' pre-ADA conduct.\").  As a result, to uphold a claim under the ADA, there must be evidence that the claimant was discriminated against because of a disability on or after July 26, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison's discrimination claim, however, is based on Carleton's rejection of her request, made in the fall of 1991, to be allowed to continue in the floorperson position that she had previously held.  The Company's decision to bar her from the position was effectively made, and communicated to her, in November 1991, eight months before the statute's effective date.  While Morrison grieved the decision through her union, in proceedings strenuously pursued through February of 1992, and while the grievance process itself appears to have continued into 1993, when the matter was stated to be arbitrated, its subject was the Company's alleged unfair practice in the fall of 1991.  Morrison has not pointed to additional incidents that took place on or after July 26, 1992, which constituted separate violations of the ADA during the later period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations promulgated pursuant to the ADA add nothing to Morrison's claim.  These regulations prohibit disability discrimination with respect to \" ... layoff, termination, right to return from layoff, and rehiring.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.4(b) (1996) (emphasis added).  However, the denial of any right Morrison had to return from layoff was complete well before July 26, 1992.  Morrison was denied the floorperson position in the fall of 1991 after she sought to return from medical leave.  By then Morrison had already accepted a layoff slip in lieu of bidding on another job, and remained on layoff until November 23, 1992, when she accepted the \"fixer\" position with the Company.  Morrison would have us find a continuing violation, based on a theory that not restoring her to her old floorperson position formed part of a continuous chain of misconduct extending beyond the July 26, 1992 deadline.  But the Company's inaction is not enough.  As we said in a somewhat analogous situation, \" 'it was incumbent upon [her] to allege facts giving some indication that the later refusals were themselves separate ... violations.' \"  Velazquez v. Chardon, 736 F.2d 831, 833 (1st Cir.1984) (quoting Goldman v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 607 F.2d 1014, 1018 (1st Cir.1979)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Morrison does not demonstrate that discriminatory conduct forming a basis of her ADA claim occurred after July 26, 1992, we need not decide the Company's further contention that Morrison's claim failed because her purported disability did not meet the definitional requirements of the Act.  There may be merit to this and related substantive contentions, but we do not reach them because Morrison's asserted violation of the ADA occurred prior to July 26, 1992.D. Riley's Individual Liability</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In footnotes in their briefs, the parties contest whether Riley can be held liable under Count I in his individual capacity for violations of Title VII and the Maine Human Rights Act.  We deal separately with the federal and the state aspects of this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Individual Liability under Title VII</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII defines \"employer\", in relevant part, as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees ... and any agent of such a person.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(b) (West 1994).  There is controversy over whether this language allows a corporate supervisor, such as Riley, to be sued as the \"agent of such a person.\"   Several circuits have held \"No.\" See, e.g., Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1313-17 (2d Cir.1995);  but see id. at 1318-24 (Judge Parker's dissenting opinion).  The question has no very obvious answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to answer it here.  The district court's ruling that Riley was liable under Title VII for pre-November 21, 1991 sexual harassment (Count I) has little or no actual impact on Riley that we can discern.  Neither the Company nor Riley were or can be held answerable in damages for the pre-November 21, 1991 conduct, and it is not apparent that any other available type of federal relief can be applied against Riley notwithstanding the court's determination that he is liable under Title VII.  In such circumstances, and given the absence of developed argument by the parties and of a reasoned disposition of this question by the court below, we are not inclined to seize this opportunity to create circuit precedent on this relatively complex issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Individual Liability under the Maine Human Rights Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding Riley liable, together with his employer, under Maine state law for sexual harassment under Count I, the court imposed a $10,000 civil penalty.  Authority for the penalty is found in the Maine Human Rights Act. 5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4613(2)(B)(7) (West Supp.1996).  Riley's liability for that penalty is apparently joint and several with the Company's.  The state law judgment against Riley, therefore, is not merely academic, as was the adverse Title VII finding, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we are disinclined to rule at this time on whether or not Maine law allows individual liability.  While arguably the different language of the Maine law more clearly allows individual liability than does Title VII, there is no relevant state court precedent.  A federal district court in Maine has construed the law as disallowing individual liability, relying on the federal precedent that trends that way.  Quiron v. L.N. Violette Co. Inc., 897 F.Supp. 18, 20-21 (D.Me.1995).  Appellants' objection to allowing individual recovery here was not set out in the statement of issues in their brief, and consists of one sentence in a footnote, together with a citation to Quiron and a subsequent case.  We have said that a party owes this court \"developed argumentation.\"  United States v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 393 (1st Cir.1995);  cf.  Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir.1993) (casual mention in footnote, without citation, not enough).  See Wright, Miller, Cooper and Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure, Vol. 16, &#167; 3974, n. 1 (West 1977 &amp; Supp.1996).  The district court itself did not have occasion to discuss the issue, although appellee concedes that defendants raised it in one of their trial motions.  Riley is represented by the same attorneys as the Company and, for all that appears, may never be required by his employer to share personally in the payment of the $10,000 penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we think the most satisfactory way to handle the issue is to vacate the individual judgment against Riley under Count I and remand with instructions that, if either party wishes, the court shall reopen, and expressly rule upon, the issue of whether the Maine Human Rights Act provides for individual liability.  In so doing, the court may, in its discretion, certify the question to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.  This course will ensure either a reasoned decision or a dispositive ruling by Maine's highest court.  It will also enable the parties and the court to drop the matter if, as the parties' casual treatment suggests, it is of no practical interest to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal questions of individual liability under both Title VII and the Maine statute are significant ones.  Precisely because this is so, we do not wish to decide them in the fragmented, undeveloped setting in which they appear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's rulings on Counts I and II, except we vacate the finding against Riley under Count I. We reverse the jury's verdicts on Counts I and IV.  We vacate the court's amended judgment and remand for further proceedings, and for the entry of a new judgment, not inconsistent with this opinion.  Upon remand the district court shall reopen the question of back pay and any other available form of relief that may now be appropriate under the affirmed claims given our reversal of the jury's verdicts under Counts I and IV.  The parties shall bear their own costs of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By consent of the parties, a United States Magistrate Judge presided over the jury trial and subsequently determined the various non-jury issues.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c) (West 1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In making this finding, the court specifically noted that, in differing with the jury, it did not intend to suggest that the jury lacked sufficient evidence from which to conclude contrary to the court's findings.  \"The Court simply disagrees with the jury's conclusion in certain respects.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Maine courts have relied on the federal case law surrounding Title VII for the purpose of construing and applying the provisions of the Maine Human Rights Act.

In Count II, she alleged violation of the same state and federal statutes by reason of sex discrimination.  In Counts III and IV, Morrison alleged that defendants had subjected her to discrimination on account of disability, in violation of the Maine Human Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the \"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial before a jury began in the district court on October 4, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Title VII claims of sexual harassment (Count I) and sex (gender) discrimination (Count II) were presented to the jury but only insofar as these claims were based upon conduct occurring on or after November 21, 1991, the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.

However, the Maine law claims for sexual harassment, sex discrimination and disability discrimination, and the Title VII claims for pre-November 21, 1991 conduct did not go to the jury but rather were reserved for later decision by the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the jury trial, the court, upon defendants' motion, dismissed as a matter of law all the claims (jury and non-jury) against Moody and many of the claims against Riley, to wit, the claims for sexual harassment (Count I) after November 21, 1991, for sex discrimination (Count II), and for disability discrimination (Counts III and IV).

On Count I, the court found that Morrison had been subjected to sexual harassment sufficiently severe and pervasive to create a hostile work environment prior to November 21, 1991.  Consequently, it ruled in Morrison's favor, and against the Company and Riley, on her Maine law sexual harassment claim, and also on her Title VII sexual harassment claim for conduct prior to November 21, 1991.

It, therefore, ruled in favor of the defendants and against Morrison under Title VII.

In determining that Morrison was not disabled, the court found that the Company \"did not perceive her to be unable to perform a major life activity, specifically work.\"   The court noted that the Company had only perceived Morrison as incapable of performing the single position of floorperson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law, for new trial, and other relief were denied.

Morrison held this position from approximately May of 1984 until January of 1987.  All the positions held by Morrison up to this time were traditionally filled by female employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1986, Morrison bid on the position of \"temporary floorperson\" on the third shift in the yarn preparation department.  At this time, Riley was the shift supervisor on the third shift in the yarn preparation department.  Riley was angry with Morrison for bidding on the floorperson position.  Prior to December 1986, Morrison had once had an angry encounter with Riley when they both worked on the second shift.  Riley had screamed at her for leaving her machine to go to the restroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A month later, Morrison was awarded the temporary floorperson position.  As shift supervisor, Riley approved her transfer to the position and certified her satisfactory completion of the thirty-day probationary period.  However, he had no discretion under the Company's contract with the Union to refuse a position to the most senior qualified person who bid on it, which, in this case, was Morrison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Morrison told Fred DeVaudreuil, the department supervisor and Riley's superior, that she had been awarded the floorperson position, he asked her to reconsider taking it.  He indicated that the Company was not happy with her getting the job.  Morrison believed that he was concerned that she would be injured and assured him that she would be careful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1987, seven female employees of Carleton filed a formal grievance against Riley, charging that he was harassing employees at the Company by yelling, making false accusations and threatening their jobs.  The Company responded by stating that it did not condone shouting by anyone, but that employees must recognize that they are not at liberty \"to ignore management directives or to be tardy in following them.\"   Ultimately, this grievance was resolved informally, with Plant Manager Everett Owens advising Riley about the need to be more \"low key.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1988, Morrison bid on the permanent opening for the position of floorperson on the third shift.  Once again, Riley became very angry, telling Morrison that the job was not for her, and that she was taking jobs away from men.  Days after Morrison was awarded the floorperson bid, Riley told her that she was going to regret it, and that sooner or later he was going to get her out of the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The floorperson is responsible for bringing boxes of yarn on bobbins to the machine operators, for taking full cones of yarn, weighing them and storing them, and for changing the warp beams.  Changing a warp beam, which can weigh up to 1,100 pounds when full of yarn, involves several steps.  First, the warp is removed from its cradle with a crow-bar type of tool.  The warp then drops about two inches, after which it must be rolled to where it can be picked up by a hydraulic lift and moved into a storage area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison remained in the floorperson position until March of 1989.

When she left the restroom moments later, Riley was waiting for her.  He accused her of being in the restroom for a long time and threatened to write her up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley took Morrison into the plant manager's office.  He then told her that he was a big person within the Company and that \"any woman would be proud to have a man in a position like this.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several female employees complained that the room was too hot because of the machinery.  They asked Riley if he could open more of the ceiling vents.  Riley said he thought that they were just having \"hot flashes\", and walked away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley threatened to fire Morrison if she did not drive his girlfriend (and future wife) and co-employee, Juanita Courtney, to her house from work during her shift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley told several people in Morrison's presence that the other female floorperson, Linda Paul, was able to stay in such a position because she and Moody patted each other on the rearend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison reported a problem with a box of yarn to Riley, who told her she was probably so dumb she created the problem herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley told Morrison that Courtney was pregnant.  He said \"you thought I was too old, didn't you\", and \"I showed you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1989, Morrison accepted a position as the medical clerk for the Company nurse, Lucille Turner.  Two months later, Morrison decided that she wanted to return to her former position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1989, Morrison bid on a temporary coner, fixer and tender (\"fixer\") position.  Riley flew into a rage, telling Morrison that she was \"stepping out of bounds\" and that \"her place was in the kitchen.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Morrison bid on a permanent fixer position.  Riley told her fellow workers that if she got the job, she would have to travel to a training seminar and share a motel room with Moody and another male worker.  Morrison voided her bid in an effort to stop speculation about the seminar, and returned to her floorperson position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1990, a first shift floorperson, William Rogers, asked Morrison to swap shifts with him.  Even though Riley had moved to the first shift, Morrison agreed to the switch.  Riley told Morrison that he \"was not going to put up with any bullshit on the first shift\" and that he \"had enough bitches in the first shift.\"   Riley also called a male coworker over to where he and Morrison were standing and began patting him in the rearend, and told her that she would have to get used to such behavior in the first shift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley and Moody moved their desk near the women's restroom, explaining that they wanted to watch the usage of the restroom so that they could write female workers up for abusing the privilege of using the restroom.  Also, they regularly made comments about Morrison bending over boxes to the point where she felt very uncomfortable having to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other incidents occurred between the spring of 1990 and the fall of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley handed Morrison a piece of paper, which he said was an application for a fixer position.  She turned over the paper and discovered, to her annoyance, that it was entitled \"Application for a Piece of Ass.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley gave Morrison an ink-blot that, when folded, depicted various sexual acts involving persons and animals.  He called her a \"dumb broad\" for being unable to properly fold it, after which he folded it for her.  Morrison became very upset and called Riley a \"filthy pig.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley told Morrison that Moody wanted to do \"funny things\" to her body, although Moody later denied ever making such a comment.  On another occasion, Moody approached Morrison and told her that he would like to see her naked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moody handed Morrison a document entitled \"Canadian Condom Marketing Board\", which contained sexually-oriented attempts at humor.  Morrison asked Moody why he was doing this, and he replied something to the effect that he takes his orders from the office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley asked Morrison if she knew what a man with a ten-inch penis eats for breakfast.  When she did not respond, he proceeded to tell her what he had eaten for breakfast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley gave Morrison a document entitled \"Proposed Restroom Policy.\"   This document, another crude attempt at humor, informed employees that if they occupied the bathroom stalls for more than three minutes, certain events would occur, including the taking of their photographs in the stalls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley regularly screamed and hollered at the women employees in the yarn preparation department, but not at the men.  If any of the women indicated that they might complain about his behavior, he would tell them \"pay-back's a bitch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period of time, Morrison went, on two occasions, to the office of Annette McGowan, the Company's personnel manager, to complain about Riley's harassing behavior.  On neither occasion was Morrison allowed to speak with McGowan.  McGowan's secretary told Morrison that she would not be allowed to see McGowan without her supervisor's permission, even though Morrison informed her that her complaint was about Riley, her supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1991, Morrison injured her shoulder at work.  She kept working, but was eventually diagnosed with tendinitis, and told to take ibuprofen and learn to pace herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1991, Morrison injured her back at home while she was making her bed.  Morrison went to the Belgrade Regional Health Center where she saw Gretchen Hill, a registered nurse-practitioner.  Hill found that Morrison appeared to have a lower lumbar muscle strain without any disc problems.  Hill informed Turner, the Company's nurse, that Morrison would be absent for one week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison returned to see Hill one week later.  By that time, the pain was gone, although she was experiencing some stiffness.  Hill was considering allowing Morrison to return to work, so she called Turner again.  Turner suggested that Morrison should be kept out of work for two more weeks, a suggestion that Hill accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 1991, Hill issued Morrison a return to work slip for full activity.  Hill testified that she would have preferred Morrison to work in a limited capacity for a short period of time, but she felt that Morrison could successfully return to work without restriction.  Following another conversation with Turner, Hill wrote a new note on November 13, 1991, which suggested that Morrison be placed on light duty work from November 11 through November 22, and then return to regular duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner and McGowan met with Morrison and informed her that the Company had no light duty work available at the time.  McGowan then offered Morrison the option of bidding into a different position, or accepting a layoff slip, which would entitle her to unemployment benefits.  Morrison did not want to lose her floorperson seniority by bidding into a different position, so she accepted the layoff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison believed that she had medical clearance to return to regular duty after November 22, 1991, and so, on November 25, 1991, she went to the yarn preparation department and sought to punch in.  Morrison could not find her own timecard, and asked Moody where she could find it.  Moody responded by saying, \"Girlie, I don't know.  You're not coming back to my department.  Go see nursie.\"   Morrison felt \"stupid.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner told Morrison that she remained on layoff, and that she had no authority to allow her to work.  Turner advised Morrison to speak with McGowan.  McGowan informed Morrison that she did not have the authority to return her to work absent medical clearance, and suggested that she see Dr. Barron, the Company's physician.  On November 26, 1991, the next day, Morrison went to see Dr. Barron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The examination of Morrison consisted of the nurse taking her blood pressure, temperature and weight, and the doctor asking her how she felt.  Dr. Barron advised Morrison that he would be going to view the floorperson position, but he reported to her (and wrote in his office notes) that he saw no physical reason why she could not return to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After he viewed the floorperson position, Dr. Barron wrote the following notation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>\"I feel that [Morrison] can do most of the work without any problems.  However, when it came to watching the warp removed, I felt that this was far too much for a woman with tendinitis and a back problem.  I understand that these warps weigh in the neighborhood of 500 pounds and the manipulation of moving them onto a hydraulic lift is certainly more than she can do.  Over a period of time, I feel that she would be crippled doing this job.  With tendinitis and back problems within a year she will be out of work and on disability.  My recommendation is that she not be put on this type of job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Barron did not speak to Morrison's treating physician or her nurse-practitioner.  Dr. Barron disregarded their opinions which indicated that Morrison was capable of fulfilling her duties, because they had not seen the floorperson position.  At the time of trial, Morrison was still not permitted to work in the floorperson position on the basis of Dr. Barron's evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 23, 1992, Morrison returned to work after she decided to bid on a fixer position.  She received the position, although after a month she was \"bumped\", was laid off for a few weeks, accepted a creeler position, and eventually returned as a fixer.  After a dispute over being paid as a temporary fixer, Morrison finally attained permanent fixer status.  Since she returned, Morrison has worked primarily on the third shift, under different supervisors from Riley and Moody.  Morrison testified that she had no problems with Riley and Moody after she returned as they stayed away from her.  The Company's personnel manager told Morrison that she had spoken to the people Morrison would be working with and that they would not harass her about her former complaints.  Morrison was to report back any complaints she might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison further testified, however, that, after her return, most of her co-workers would no longer speak to her.  She felt that this was due to the fact that most of those who spoke to her were harassed afterwards by supervisors for doing so.  Also, the third shift supervisor, Ernest Clark, often criticized Morrison for her job performance.  The Company, moreover, never asked Morrison to substitute when the floorperson was absent, even though employees with less experience were asked to do the floorperson's job.  And finally, Morrison became very upset and angry when she saw a petition, expressing support for Riley and Moody, being circulated among Carleton employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants appeal from the adverse jury verdicts, from the adverse findings of the district court and from the denial of various motions including their motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal district court may not set aside a jury verdict and direct the entry of a contrary verdict, unless no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to the moving party.

Before November 21, 1991</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pre-November 21, 1991 period, as to which the magistrate judge rather than the jury was the trier of fact, the court determined under Count I that Morrison \"was subjected to sexual harassment sufficiently 'severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment' \", quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370.   The court also found that Morrison \" 'subjectively perceive[d] the environment to be abusive.' \"  Id.  This hostile environment was found to have existed prior to November 21, 1991, and the Company was found to have known about it, or should have known about it, because it was so pervasive.  The Company's plant manager and plant supervisor<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> were found to have worked in the same general area as plaintiff and Riley, \"and could not have missed the discriminatory atmosphere that permeated the department.\"   Based on these conclusions, the court found against the Company and Riley on Morrison's claims of hostile environment sexual harassment under Maine law and under Title VII for conduct occurring before November 21, 1991.  We find ample record evidence to sustain these findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we turn to defendants' contention that the federal and state statutes of limitations do not allow us to look at any conduct antedating the middle of 1991 in support of the hostile environment claims.  Section 2000e-5(e)(1) of Title VII provides that claimants must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1) (West 1994).  Section 4613(2)(C) of the Maine Human Rights Act states that \"[t]he action shall be commenced not more than two years after the act of unlawful discrimination complained of.\"  5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4613(2)(C) (West 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Morrison filed her charge with the EEOC on April 23, 1992, and her complaint with the district court on September 3, 1993, the appellants argue that only acts of sexual harassment occurring after June 27, 1991, for her federal claim, and after September 3, 1991, for her state claim, should be considered in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.  We disagree.  The district court found that the hostile environment at Carleton had existed for a number of years prior to November 21, 1991 and continued beyond September 3, 1991.  We have held that there is no prohibition on recovery for earlier conduct if the \"systemic violation\" extends into the limitation period.  See Jensen v. Frank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547202\"><a href=\"/opinion/547202/53-fair-emplpraccas-1450-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40191-donald-a-jensen/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 523 (1st Cir.1990).  Here, the systemic violation continued without interruption from the late 1980's onward through September 3, 1991.  It was, therefore, appropriate for the district court to look at defendants' conduct dating back to the 1980's, and we may do likewise, in evaluating Morrison's federal and state sexual harassment claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the late 1980s into the fall of 1991, there was ample evidence of crude, demeaning and sexually-oriented behavior by Riley and others directed at Morrison.  A rational factfinder could conclude that the harassment was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to Morrison because of her gender.  Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 370-71.   There is, indeed, evidence that the harassment went so far as to adversely affect Morrison's ability to function, by making her fearful to apply for certain employment opportunities and undermining her mental and emotional well-being.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, the appellants argue that the Company, as an entity, cannot be held liable because Morrison has not shown that it knew, or should have known, of the harassment.  Morrison did not complain of harassment to the Company during the period, even though there were procedures available to file such complaints.  This is a closer question, but we find sufficient evidence to support the finding of the magistrate judge that the Company knew or should have known that the hostile environment existed despite plaintiff's failure to use official procedures to complain.  In April 1987, several female employees of Carleton had filed a grievance against Riley, alleging that he was harassing them.  At that time, Plant Manager Everett Owens told Riley to be more \"low key\", but never took any action to discipline or more closely supervise him.  In the years before the trial of this case, Union President Gwendolyn Gatcomb brought several complaints concerning Riley's behavior to the attention of Company personnel.  In spite of these complaints, Riley and other Carleton supervisors were allowed to continue with their responsibilities and their harassing conduct.  Morrison testified that she had tried to bring the matter to the attention of Personnel Manager Annette McGowan, but had been unable to see her.  The magistrate judge found that the layout of the mill was such that higher management \"could not have missed the discriminatory atmosphere that permeated the department.\"   We are satisfied that the evidence sufficiently supports the court's above finding, and can see no justification to disturb it on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. After November 21, 1991</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For us to affirm the jury's award of damages to Morrison on her Count I Title VII sexual harassment claim, the record must reveal evidence of conduct on or after November 21, 1991--the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act--sufficient to have created a hostile environment as that term is used under Title VII.  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 244-45, 114 S.Ct. at 1486-87.   Hostile environment sexual harassment is a particular species of sex discrimination.  The EEOC's regulations, as noted, describe it as \"[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature ... when ... (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1604.11(a) (1996).  The Supreme Court speaks of a \"workplace ... permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult' ... that is 'sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of a person's employment and create an abusive working environment.' \"  Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the jury heard extensive evidence of the vulgar pre-November 21, 1991 incidents which, as we have held, amply support the magistrate judge's finding of hostile environment sexual harassment during that earlier time.  However, the jury's task was to determine Title VII liabilities and damages for the period from November 21, 1991 onward.  The jury could take the earlier conduct into account only to the extent it was legally relevant to what later happened--for example, to help prove the intent behind an act committed after November 21, 1991, or the act's likely effect on someone like Morrison.  See, e.g., Fed.R.Evid. 402, 403, 404(b), 406, 412.  The earlier abuse is no substitute for proof of actual sexual harassment occurring in the post-November 21, 1991 period.  Because we cannot find evidence of sexually abusive conduct in this later period sufficient to support the jury's Title VII award under Count I, we are obliged to reverse that part of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From October 19, 1991 until November 23, 1992, Morrison was either on medical leave or on layoff from Carleton, hence she could not, during that period, have been subjected to workplace abuse, nor could her work performance at Carleton have been interfered with by abusive conduct while there.  The only incident during that period that might be construed as workplace sexual harassment occurred on November 25, 1991, when Morrison went to Carleton seeking to return to work.  Moody refused to let her punch in, telling her she had first to get medical clearance.  In turning her away, Moody called Morrison \"Girlie\" and told her to go see \"nursie\", raising the question whether use of these terms made Moody's remark so offensive as to support a finding of hostile environment sexual harassment.  In order to assess Moody's probable intent when he spoke as he did on November 25, 1991 and the reasonable effect of the phraseology on Morrison, see Harris, 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. at 370-71 (citing Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405-06), the jury could consider the evidence of Moody's and others' prior offensive conduct and remarks in the period before November 21, 1991.  In light of that history, the jury could reasonably construe Moody's use of the terms \"Girlie\" and \"nursie\" as demeaning, rather than as merely light-hearted banter, and could also determine that Morrison had reason to be offended.  Morrison testified that Moody's remark, made at a time when \"everybody was lined up getting ready to punch in\", made her feel \"stupid.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unable to conclude, however, that Moody's \"Girlie-nursie\" remark was, by itself, a sufficient basis to hold the Company liable to Morrison under her Title VII sexual harassment claim.  Morrison was not working at the time.  Her contact on this one day with the Company's work environment was fleeting.  There is no evidence the Company knew of or sanctioned Moody's particular phraseology.  We know of no case where a single, brief encounter of this mildly offensive sort, at a time when the plaintiff was not actually working, and hence could not be affected in her work performance and conditions of employment, has been held to create a sexually hostile workplace environment.  See, e.g., Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370 (conduct must be severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment affecting employee's conditions of employment);  Chamberlin v. 101 Realty, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548932\"><a href=\"/opinion/548932/54-fair-emplpraccas-101-54-empl-prac-dec-p-40282-katherine-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span>, 783 (1st Cir.1990) (single or isolated remarks do not establish a hostile environment).  Even assuming this incident, when coupled with the more serious pre-November 21, 1991 incidents, might lead a rational jury to conclude that the earlier abusive environment would have remained the same through November 25, 1991, the fact that Morrison was not working at Carleton from November 21, 1991 until November 23, 1992--a year later--makes this conclusion largely irrelevant to her claim for damages during this period.  Morrison could not have been injured by hostility at a workplace she did not attend.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We realize that Morrison contends that she accepted layoff status only because of the Company's refusal during this period to let her return to her floorperson position.  Morrison insists that the refusal, while supposedly based on health concerns, was actually based on the Company's bias against women working as floorpersons.  The jury, however, specifically rejected Morrison's Count II, Title VII sex discrimination claim premised on such a theory, finding for the Company on Count II.  The magistrate judge, contrary to the jury, later upheld Morrison's sex discrimination claim under Maine law, holding that the Company's refusal to allow Morrison to go back to her floorperson position was gender-based and discriminatory.  But the jury's verdict is conclusive on the part of the Count II claim seeking damages under Title VII.  The jury found for Morrison on her Count I claim of hostile environment sexual harassment, but, as we discuss here, there was insufficient evidence of abuse during the post-November 21, 1991 period for us to affirm the award of damages under that theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the period of over a year during which she did not work at the Company (from October 19, 1991 until November 23, 1992), Morrison finally returned to work.  But the record covering the period after Morrison's return to work on November 23, 1992 provides scant support for her hostile environment claim.  When she returned, she accepted a different, somewhat higher-paying position<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>, and reported to new supervisors.  There is no evidence that, in this new position, her supervisors, or any other person for that matter, subjected her to \"discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult\", Harris, 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. at 370, much less to sexually offensive, embarrassing or vulgar conduct or remarks, or other sex-based conduct or remarks, such as had occurred prior to November 21, 1991 when she was working as a floorperson under Riley.  The Company's personnel manager advised her that employees had been warned to treat her fairly and equitably, and that she was to report anything offensive immediately so that it could be corrected.  Morrison did not thereafter complain of sexual harassment to Company personnel.  Morrison conceded that her old nemeses, Riley and Moody, stayed away from her, and never harassed her after she returned to work.  Morrison, nonetheless, points to certain incidents that occurred during this later period, which, according to her, gave rise to a hostile work environment at Carleton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison testified that most of the people with whom she had worked for years would no longer speak to her when she returned to work in November 23, 1992, ostensibly because discouraged by management from doing so.  The few that did were reprimanded by their supervisors afterwards.  Morrison felt that some of her co-workers would no longer cooperate with her, thereby making her job much more difficult, and that one of her new supervisors, Ernest Clark, would occasionally assign her excessive work.  Ernest Clark, according to Morrison, would also follow her around and look for flaws in her work, and would often blame her for mistakes that were not of her own doing.  Morrison further complained that, for some time after she had completed a training period, she received temporary pay, instead of regular pay, for her work as a fixer, and that, despite her seniority, she never was asked to fill in for those employees with higher-ranking jobs within the Company.  Lastly, Morrison claimed that she saw a petition expressing support for Riley and Moody circulating throughout the Company, an event that, she says, led her to seek professional counselling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison argues that she does not need to show that management's conduct during this later period was \"expressly sexual\" in order to establish a sexually hostile work environment based on gender discrimination.  We accept that many different forms of offensive behavior may be included within the definition of hostile environment sexual harassment.  See Spain v. Gallegos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672052\"><a href=\"/opinion/672052/ellen-v-spain-v-tony-e-gallegos-chairman-equal-employment-opportunity/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span>, 447 (3d Cir.1994) (employee can show that there is a sexually hostile work environment \"without proving blatant sexual misconduct.\").  However, the overtones of such behavior must be, at the very least, sex-based, so as to be a recognizable form of sex discrimination.  McKinney v. Dole, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454492\"><a href=\"/opinion/454492/iris-mckinney-v-honorable-elizabeth-dole-secretary-of-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, 1138 (D.C.Cir.1985).  Merely because a supervisor is overbearing or fellow employees unsociable and hard to get along with, does not suffice unless underlying motives of a sexual or gender discriminatory nature are implicated.  Spain, 26 F.3d at 449.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The post-November 23, 1992 conduct alleged by Morrison occurred over a year after the earlier sexually-explicit misconduct by the other supervisors in her former position.  The later conduct, as said, was not the kind associated with a claim for hostile environment sexual harassment.  See, e.g., Gross v. Burggraf Constr.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695507\"><a href=\"/opinion/695507/68-fair-emplpraccas-bna-88-66-empl-prac-dec-p-43689-42-fed-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1531</span></a></span>, 1546 (10th Cir.1995) (employee did not establish a gender-based hostile environment by showing that employer reprimanded her in front of other employees, grilled her about some plans to bring discrimination charges against him, and told her \"she was skating on thin ice.\").  It was not shown that Supervisor Clark's harshness was based on annoyance with her as a woman, or because he regarded the fixer position as off limits for women.  A connection between Morrison's gender and the incidents she complains of was not established.  The record contains no evidence that Morrison complained to the Company that she was being subjected at this time to further sexual harassment or that the Company knew or should have believed that Morrison was being subjected to sexual harassment then.  If the Company deliberately sought to isolate or punish Morrison for her earlier complaints of harassment, by telling other employees not to speak to her, such conduct might have supported a claim for unlawful retaliation, but not for sexual harassment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The evidence presented by Morrison is simply insufficient to establish a post-November 21, 1991 sexually hostile work environment created by severe or pervasive sex-based harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison seeks to overcome the deficiencies in the evidence by contending that the more recent, non-sexual incidents could be linked to the pattern of vulgar, sexually-related misconduct that occurred at Carleton prior to the effective date of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.  Morrison urges that the later incidents could be evaluated by the jury, not in isolation, but rather as a continuation of what she and other employees encountered at the Company before November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This point might have arguable merit relative to Moody's \"Girlie-nursie\" remark on November 25, 1991, were it not for the isolated nature of this incident, occurring as it did when Morrison was on continuous leave, hence not at the workplace so as to be exposed to a hostile environment.  As to the events after her return to work on November 23, 1992, the pre-November 21, 1991 harassment was too remote in time and character to transform the later conduct into the different kind of behavior needed to support a damages claim for hostile environment sexual harassment.  Morrison, by then, was working in a new position with other supervisors.  To establish that she was entitled to damages for being subjected to hostile environment discrimination during this later period, she had to show some conduct within that time frame fitting into a cognizable definition of abusive work environment harassment.  If this were not so, the Company would be held liable for conduct which it would not have known was either improper or a source of potential liability under the \"hostile environment\" theory at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the foregoing, we hold that there was insufficient evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that Morrison was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment at Carleton after November 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Gender Discrimination (Count II)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count II, the district court ruled in the Company's favor on Morrison's federal claim, finding that there were no incidents of sex discrimination against Morrison prior to November 21, 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The district court, however, held that Morrison had established sex discrimination after November 21, 1991, and entered judgment in her favor under Maine law.  We find that there is sufficient evidence in the record below to support the court's state law ruling and, accordingly, we affirm its judgment in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first found that Morrison was not permitted to return to her floorperson position on November 25, 1991 \"because of Lucille Turner's, Annette McGowan's, and Dr. Barron's perception that women would more likely be severely injured in the floorperson position than would men.\"   The record permits the inference that Morrison's injury was temporary and not especially serious.  The evidence shows that Turner convinced Hill to extend Morrison's layoff, and later suggested that Morrison should not be allowed to return to the floorperson position.  When Morrison was given the choice of either accepting a layoff or leaving the floorperson position, McGowan told her that \"she should have seen this coming because ... [the Company] did not want [her] on the job.\"   Finally, even though Dr. Barron talked extensively with Turner about Morrison's physical condition, he refused to consult with her treating physician or her nurse-practitioner, both of whom felt she was fit to perform her floorperson duties, in recommending that she be kept out of the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that it was satisfied that \"a man presenting the same medical history and clearance to return to work would have been immediately permitted to do so.\"   The record below gives credence to this statement, as two longtime Carleton employees, William Rogers and Norman Williams, testified that the Company has permitted them to remain in their physically-demanding jobs, despite the fact that they have, respectively, a chronic back problem and a ruptured cervical disc.  Moreover, Leland Rice, who, at one time, worked as a floorperson at Carleton, and who is only five foot three inches tall and weighs no more than 140 pounds, testified that he did not find any aspect of the job, including the removal of the warp beam, to be very difficult to perform.  It could be found, therefore, that, while Carleton seized upon Morrison's relatively minor medical problems to exclude her from the floorperson position, it allowed other male employees, with more serious ailments and less physical abilities, to continue working for the Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, to be sure, that there was also evidence suggesting that legitimate health-based considerations had motivated the Company's decision.  But this is the kind of matter best sorted out by the trial court.  There was sufficient evidence to support a reasonable trier's finding that Morrison was rejected because of her gender.  The court was entitled to conclude that Morrison's sex \"was a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 155 (1st Cir.1990).

When this claim was submitted to the jury, the court correctly told the jury that Morrison could recover only for violations of the Act occurring on or after July 26, 1992, the effective date of the Act.  Because the record reveals no evidence of any post-July 26, 1992 violations, we are obliged to overturn the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ever since the ADA became effective on July 26, 1992, the courts have consistently held that the Act is not retroactive.  Miller v. CBC Cos., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></span>, 1062 (D.N.H.1995) (\"there is little doubt the First Circuit would decline to extend the continuing violation theory to permit [plaintiff] to recover for the defendants' pre-ADA conduct.\").  As a result, to uphold a claim under the ADA, there must be evidence that the claimant was discriminated against because of a disability on or after July 26, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morrison's discrimination claim, however, is based on Carleton's rejection of her request, made in the fall of 1991, to be allowed to continue in the floorperson position that she had previously held.  The Company's decision to bar her from the position was effectively made, and communicated to her, in November 1991, eight months before the statute's effective date.  While Morrison grieved the decision through her union, in proceedings strenuously pursued through February of 1992, and while the grievance process itself appears to have continued into 1993, when the matter was stated to be arbitrated, its subject was the Company's alleged unfair practice in the fall of 1991.  Morrison has not pointed to additional incidents that took place on or after July 26, 1992, which constituted separate violations of the ADA during the later period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations promulgated pursuant to the ADA add nothing to Morrison's claim.  These regulations prohibit disability discrimination with respect to \" ... layoff, termination, right to return from layoff, and rehiring.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.4(b) (1996) (emphasis added).  However, the denial of any right Morrison had to return from layoff was complete well before July 26, 1992.  Morrison was denied the floorperson position in the fall of 1991 after she sought to return from medical leave.  By then Morrison had already accepted a layoff slip in lieu of bidding on another job, and remained on layoff until November 23, 1992, when she accepted the \"fixer\" position with the Company.  Morrison would have us find a continuing violation, based on a theory that not restoring her to her old floorperson position formed part of a continuous chain of misconduct extending beyond the July 26, 1992 deadline.

Riley's Individual Liability</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In footnotes in their briefs, the parties contest whether Riley can be held liable under Count I in his individual capacity for violations of Title VII and the Maine Human Rights Act.  We deal separately with the federal and the state aspects of this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Individual Liability under Title VII</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII defines \"employer\", in relevant part, as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees ... and any agent of such a person.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(b) (West 1994).  There is controversy over whether this language allows a corporate supervisor, such as Riley, to be sued as the \"agent of such a person.\"   Several circuits have held \"No.\" See, e.g., Tomka v. Seiler Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705166\"><a href=\"/opinion/705166/carole-tomka-v-the-seiler-corporation-daniel-lucey-david-polonsky-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1295</span></a></span>, 1313-17 (2d Cir.1995);  but see id. at 1318-24 (Judge Parker's dissenting opinion).  The question has no very obvious answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to answer it here.  The district court's ruling that Riley was liable under Title VII for pre-November 21, 1991 sexual harassment (Count I) has little or no actual impact on Riley that we can discern.  Neither the Company nor Riley were or can be held answerable in damages for the pre-November 21, 1991 conduct, and it is not apparent that any other available type of federal relief can be applied against Riley notwithstanding the court's determination that he is liable under Title VII.  In such circumstances, and given the absence of developed argument by the parties and of a reasoned disposition of this question by the court below, we are not inclined to seize this opportunity to create circuit precedent on this relatively complex issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Individual Liability under the Maine Human Rights Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding Riley liable, together with his employer, under Maine state law for sexual harassment under Count I, the court imposed a $10,000 civil penalty.  Authority for the penalty is found in the Maine Human Rights Act. 5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4613(2)(B)(7) (West Supp.1996).  Riley's liability for that penalty is apparently joint and several with the Company's.  The state law judgment against Riley, therefore, is not merely academic, as was the adverse Title VII finding, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we are disinclined to rule at this time on whether or not Maine law allows individual liability.  While arguably the different language of the Maine law more clearly allows individual liability than does Title VII, there is no relevant state court precedent.  A federal district court in Maine has construed the law as disallowing individual liability, relying on the federal precedent that trends that way.  Quiron v. L.N. Violette Co. Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></span>, 20-21 (D.Me.1995).  Appellants' objection to allowing individual recovery here was not set out in the statement of issues in their brief, and consists of one sentence in a footnote, together with a citation to Quiron and a subsequent case.  We have said that a party owes this court \"developed argumentation.\"  United States v. Caraballo-Cruz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196024\"><a href=\"/opinion/196024/united-states-v-caraballo-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 393 (1st Cir.1995);  cf.

See Wright, Miller, Cooper and Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure, Vol. 16, &#167; 3974, n. 1 (West 1977 &amp; Supp.1996).  The district court itself did not have occasion to discuss the issue, although appellee concedes that defendants raised it in one of their trial motions.  Riley is represented by the same attorneys as the Company and, for all that appears, may never be required by his employer to share personally in the payment of the $10,000 penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we think the most satisfactory way to handle the issue is to vacate the individual judgment against Riley under Count I and remand with instructions that, if either party wishes, the court shall reopen, and expressly rule upon, the issue of whether the Maine Human Rights Act provides for individual liability.  In so doing, the court may, in its discretion, certify the question to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.  This course will ensure either a reasoned decision or a dispositive ruling by Maine's highest court.  It will also enable the parties and the court to drop the matter if, as the parties' casual treatment suggests, it is of no practical interest to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal questions of individual liability under both Title VII and the Maine statute are significant ones.

We reverse the jury's verdicts on Counts I and IV.  We vacate the court's amended judgment and remand for further proceedings, and for the entry of a new judgment, not inconsistent with this opinion.  Upon remand the district court shall reopen the question of back pay and any other available form of relief that may now be appropriate under the affirmed claims given our reversal of the jury's verdicts under Counts I and IV.  The parties shall bear their own costs of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By consent of the parties, a United States Magistrate Judge presided over the jury trial and subsequently determined the various non-jury issues.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c) (West 1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In making this finding, the court specifically noted that, in differing with the jury, it did not intend to suggest that the jury lacked sufficient evidence from which to conclude contrary to the court's findings.  \"The Court simply disagrees with the jury's conclusion in certain respects.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Maine courts have relied on the federal case law surrounding Title VII for the purpose of construing and applying the provisions of the Maine Human Rights Act.

There was a period shortly after her return when she was \"bumped\", laid off, returned as a creeler, and ultimately restored to fixer status.
