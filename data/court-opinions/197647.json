By order dated  October 9,  1997, we directed  the\r\n\ndistrict court to file a  written report amplifying the basis for\r\n\nthe extent of the  departure.  The court  promptly complied.   We\r\n\nthen  afforded   the  parties  an  opportunity  for  supplemental\r\n\nbriefing.\r\n\n          We have  carefully examined  the record,  including but\r\n\nnot  limited  to   the  presentence  investigation  report,   the\r\n\ntranscript  of the sentencing  hearing, and the  district court's\r\n\nsupplementary  report of its  departure findings.

Our review also  convinces us that the district court\r\n\nfollowed the proper protocol and  did not abuse its discretion in\r\n\ndetermining the  extent of the  departure.

From the very\r\n\ninception of the federal sentencing guidelines, we have cautioned\r\n\nthat \"[s]entencing appeals  prosecuted . . . in  the tenuous hope\r\n\nthat lightning may strike ought not to be dignified with exegetic\r\n\nopinions, intricate factual synthesis, or full-dress explications\r\n\nof accepted legal principles.\"  United States v.
