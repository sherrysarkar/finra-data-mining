Hector M.

Wilk was on brief for\nappellant.\n   Camille Velez-Rive, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and John Teakell, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\nMay 20, 1999\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  The government arrested\ndefendant-appellant Raymond Hernndez Albino (\"Hernndez\") and\nseveral other men in a drug sting in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. \nHernndez was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced.  On appeal,\nhe argues that the court made a series of mistakes both during\ntrial and at sentencing.  We are unpersuaded by his claims of error\nand affirm.\n                        I. Background\nTestimony at trial revealed the following: On April 17,\n1997, two government informants contacted Armando Cabrera Vargas\n(\"Cabrera\") regarding the sale of a number of kilograms of cocaine. \nCabrera, in turn, went to see Orlando Ramirez Ortiz (\"Ramirez\"),\nand introduced Ramirez to the government informants.  With Cabrera\nacting as middleman, the parties agreed that Ramirez would purchase\nseven kilograms of cocaine for $123,500.\nRamirez's problem was that he did not actually have that\nmuch money, so he approached his long-time friend Hernndez for a\nloan for Ramirez's \"business.\"  When Hernndez asked for more\ndetails, Ramirez offered vague assurances that he was sure of what\nhe was doing and that the money would be repaid.  Although\nHernndez was reluctant to lend this sizeable amount of capital\nwithout knowing the specifics of the business deal, he agreed to\nthe transaction after Ramirez pledged his house and business as\ncollateral.  On April 23, 1997, the day the drug deal was to take\nplace, Ramirez finally informed Hernndez that the money was being\nused to purchase cocaine.  When pressed at trial by prosecutors,\nRamirez conceded that Hernndez, still unsure about whether the\ntransaction would be consummated, demanded to be present and carry\nthe money.\nWhen the time came, Ramirez called Hernndez and told him\nto come to the back of the Villa Real Hotel, where the exchange was\nto take place.  When Hernndez arrived in his Toyota 4Runner truck,\nRamirez got in and inspected the money, which was in a sports gear\nbag.  At that moment, one of the informants selling the drugs\ncalled Ramirez on his cellular phone and instructed Ramirez to\ndrive to the front of the hotel.  In front of the hotel the\ninformant approached Hernndez's truck, and told Hernndez and\nRamirez that \"the Colombian\" drug supplier (in reality an\nundercover government agent named Roln) wanted to come check out\nthe money.  When Hernndez inquired, Ramirez explained that Roln\nowned the cocaine.  Roln inspected the money and departed\nallegedly to retrieve the drugs.  Instead, he gave other agents the\nsignal to arrest Hernndez and Ramirez.\nWhen Hernndez was arrested, agents discovered in his\nwaistband a concealed 9 millimeter handgun, which he had a valid\npermit to carry.  The agents did not thoroughly search the vehicle\nat the scene but during a later inventory search found a different\n9 millimeter gun with an obliterated serial number under the front\npassenger seat where Ramirez had been sitting.\nHernandez was indicted on three counts: 1) conspiracy to\npossess the seven kilograms of cocaine with the intent to\ndistribute; 2) carrying a firearm during and in relation to the\ndrug crime; and 3) possessing the gun with the obliterated serial\nnumber.  Hernandez pled not guilty to all three charges.\nRamirez and Cabrera were also indicted, but both pled\nguilty and agreed to cooperate with the government in return for\nthe government's promise to recommend leniency in sentencing. \nDuring a three day trial in mid-November 1997, the government\ncalled Ramirez as a witness.  While Ramirez was on the stand, the\ncourt found him at times reluctant to testify and unresponsive to\nthe government's questions, so it permitted the prosecutors to ask\ncertain leading questions.\nThe case was eventually sent to the jury, and it began\ndeliberating.  Approximately two and one half hours later, the jury\nsent a note to the judge saying that \"[t]he jury has not been able\nto come to a guilty or not guilty verdict.  We are at an impasse.\" \nThe judge consulted with counsel, and sent the following response,\nto which counsel did not object:\n  All of you are equally honest and\nconscientious jurors who have heard the same\nevidence.  All of you share an equal desire to\narrive at a verdict.  Each of you should ask\nyourself whether you should question the\ncorrectness of your present position.  I\nremind you that in your deliberations you are\nto consider the instructions as a whole. \nPlease continue the deliberations.\n\nAfter deliberating for another hour, the jury found Hernndez\nguilty of both count 1, conspiracy to possess cocaine with the\nintent to distribute, and count 2, possession of a gun during and\nin relation to a drug crime, but acquitted him on count 3,\npossession of the gun found under Ramirez's seat.\nHernndez was subsequently sentenced to 181 months of\nimprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release,\nand a special assessment of $200.  This appeal ensued.\n                        II. Discussion\nHernndez argues that his conviction and sentence were\nimproper due to a number of alleged errors.  While none of his\nclaims is meritorious, three are worthy of developed consideration.\nA. The court's supplemental charge\nHernndez claims that the court erred when it responded\nto the jury's impasse with the supplemental jury instruction, often\ndescribed as a \"dynamite\" charge or an Allen charge, after Allen v.\nUnited States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896).  Counsel did not object at the\ntime, and hence we review only for plain error.  See Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 52(b); United States v. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.\n1998).\nPlain error analysis requires four steps.  First, an\nerror must have been committed.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S.\n725, 732-33 (1993).  Second, the error must be plain or obvious. \nId. at 734.  Third, the plain error must \"affect[] substantial\nrights,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), which generally means that it must\nhave been prejudicial, see Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.  Finally,\nbecause Rule 52(b) is discretionary, we must be convinced that the\nerror \"'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public\nreputation of judicial proceedings[]'\" before we will order a new\ntrial.  Id. at 736 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S.\n157, 160 (1936)).\ni. The Error.  Any supplemental instruction in response\nto a jury's deadlock can have a significant coercive effect by\nintimating that some jury members should capitulate to others'\nviews, or by suggesting that the members should compromise their\nrational positions in order to reach an agreement.  See United\nStates v. Angiulo, 485 F.2d 37, 39 (1st Cir. 1973).  Although\nfederal courts have long sanctioned the use of supplemental charges\nin the face of an apparent impasse, see Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484\nU.S. 231, 237 (1988), we have warned that such action should be\nundertaken with \"great caution and only when absolutely necessary,\"\nUnited States v. Flannery, 451 F.2d 880, 883 (1st Cir. 1971).  \nConcerned about the instruction's potentially coercive\neffect, we have required that it contain three specific elements to\nmoderate any prejudice.  See United States v. Paniagua-Ramos, 135\nF.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 1998).  First, in order that the burden of\nreconsideration is not shouldered exclusively by those jury members\nholding the minority view, the court should expressly instruct both\nthe minority and the majority to reexamine their positions.  See\nAngiulo, 485 F.2d at 39.  Second, the instruction should\nacknowledge that the jury has the right not to agree.  See Jenkins\nv. United States, 380 U.S. 445, 446 (1965) (per curiam).  Third,\nthe court should remind the jury that the burden of proving guilt\nbeyond a reasonable doubt remains, as always, with the government. \nSee Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d at 197.\nThe charge at issue did not meet these criteria.  While\nit could be argued that the first element was satisfied because\neach person was instructed to question the correctness of his or\nher position, the instruction did not address either of the other\ntwo requirements in any manner whatsoever.  Although we have\nconsistently refrained from offering any definite wording for an\nAllen charge, the instruction should have referenced in some way\nall three essential elements.  The court's failure to do so was\nerror.\nThe government presents a somewhat tautological argument\nin response.  It claims that the omission of two elements was not\nerroneous because the instruction was not an Allen charge, and it\nwas not an Allen charge because it did not follow the accepted\nformat, i.e., it did not contain all three elements.  In addition\nto protecting any supplemental instruction such as this one from\njudicial review for consistency with the three Allen criteria, the\ngovernment's argument ignores our explicit ruling that \"any\nsupplemental instruction which urges the jury to return to its\ndeliberations must include the three balancing elements stated\nabove.\"  Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 40 (emphasis added).\nii. The Clarity of the Error.  It is equally obvious that\nthe second requirement, i.e., that the error is clear, has also\nbeen met.  We first discussed the three elements in Flannery in\n1971, and have followed them with unwavering devotion ever since. \nWe have addressed them on a number of occasions, even describing\nthem as \"essential,\" United States v. Vachon, 869 F.2d 653, 659\n(1st Cir. 1989).  The district court's failure to mention either of\nthe last two elements constituted plain error.\niii. Affecting substantial rights.  Although the error\nwas plain, we may not reverse Hernndez's conviction and order a\nnew trial unless the error \"affect[ed] substantial rights.\"  Fed.\nR. Crim. P. 52(b).  In a challenge to an improper Allen charge, the\nrelevant inquiry revolves around whether the charge \"in its context\nand under all the circumstances\" coerced the jury into convicting\nhim.  Lowenfield, 484 U.S. at 237.  Hernndez's counsel below\nadmitted that the charge was \"not coercive in the least.\"  We\nagree, based on both the length of deliberations after the Allen\ncharge and the verdict's internal consistency.  See United States\nv. Plunk, 153 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th Cir. 1998); Paniagua-Ramos, 135\nF.3d at 199.\nThe length of deliberations in this case negates any\nsuggestion of coercion.  The jury's task was relatively\nstraightforward.  The government claimed Hernndez joined Cabrera's\nand Ramirez's drug conspiracy because Hernndez lent Ramirez the\nmoney after learning that it would be used to purchase drugs. \nHernndez's defense was that he was \"merely present\" when the drug\ndeal occurred.  Deciding which version of events to believe was a\nrelatively uncomplicated exercise.  It appears that the jury\nrecognized as much and seemed to expect that deliberations would be\nswift: they complained of an impasse after deliberating for only\ntwo and one half hours.  After the judge sent the written\nsupplemental instruction, the jury deliberated for another hour.  \nNumerous courts have found no coercion under similar\ncircumstances.  See Green v. French, 143 F.3d 865, 886 (4th Cir.\n1998) (concluding that a one hour deliberation after a supplemental\nAllen instruction failed to suggest coercion);  United States v.\nHernandez, 105 F.3d 1330, 1334 (9th Cir. 1997) (stating that\ndeliberations of 40 minutes after Allen charge did not \"raise the\nspecter of coercion\"); United States v. Smith, 635 F.2d 716, 721-22\n(8th Cir. 1980) (finding no coercion when jury deliberated forty-\nfive minutes after Allen charge, in addition to previous three hour\ntotal deliberations).  We note, however, that these cases do not\nestablish a formula, but rather are illustrative of the principle\nthat sufficient additional time can help to establish an absence of\ncoercion.  That principle is particularly applicable in this case,\nwhere the total time of deliberation was roughly 3 hours, of which\nthe deliberations after the Allen charge represented almost one\nthird.\nThe other relevant circumstance in this case, namely, the\nverdict's internal consistency, also implies an absence of\ncoercion.  As noted earlier, Hernndez was convicted of conspiring\nto possess cocaine with the intent to distribute.  He was also\nconvicted of possession of a gun, either the one on his person or\nthe one under Ramirez's seat, during and in relation to the drug\ncrime.  Finally, he was acquitted of possessing the gun with an\nobliterated serial number which was found underneath Ramirez's\nseat.  The jury's verdict indicates that it found Hernndez guilty\nof the drug crime and of possession of his own gun, but rejected\nthe government's argument that he constructively possessed the\nfirearm under Ramirez's seat.  The internal consistency of this\nresult suggests a nuanced analysis and reasoned decision.  See\nPlunk, 153 F.3d at 1027 (concluding that \"the fact that the jury\nrendered a mixed verdict [on independent counts] . . . suggests\nthat it reviewed the evidence rationally and independently\"); cf.\nPaniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d at 199 (finding confusion when jury\nconvicted defendant of conspiracy but acquitted him on the\nunderlying substantive charge, because evidence suggested defendant\nwas either innocent of both or guilty of both).  \nBecause the jury was not coerced, the court's error did\nnot affect Hernndez's substantial rights, and we will not reverse\nhis conviction due to the erroneous Allen charge.\nB. Carrying a gun \"during and in relation to\" a drug crime\nHernndez challenges two related aspects of the jury\ninstructions on count two, namely, the failure to give a specific\nunanimity charge on which gun was carried, and the omission of the\nwords \"knowing\" and \"in relation to\" from certain portions of the\ninstructions.\ni. Unanimity on which gun was carried.  Hernndez claims\nthat the court committed plain error because the jury was not\ninstructed that it had to agree which gun Hernndez carried before\nhe could be convicted.  Raised for the first time on appeal, this\nclaim is also reviewed for plain error.\nIn this case no error was committed.  The court was not\nrequired to give a specific unanimity instruction because the jury,\nin fact, was not required to agree on the specific gun carried. \nAlthough Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(a) requires that a\ncriminal conviction be unanimous, the jury need not necessarily\nagree on the facts underlying that conviction.  See United States\nv. Tarvers, 833 F.2d 1068, 1074 (1st Cir. 1987) (unanimity\ngenerally not required with respect to a specific act underlying an\nelement of a charged offense).  When the government alleges in a\nsingle count that the defendant committed the offense by one or\nmore specified means, the Supreme Court has \"never suggested that\nin returning general verdicts in such cases the jurors should be\nrequired to agree on a single means of commission, any more than\nthe indictments were required to specify one alone.\"  Schad v.\nArizona, 501 U.S. 624, 631 (1991); see also United States v.\nReeder, 170 F.3d 93, 105 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that the jury must\nagree that the government has proven all the elements of an offense\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, but \"it need not agree on the means by\nwhich all the elements were accomplished\").\nAlthough unanimity is required when such a determination\nmatters for sentencing purposes, see United States v. Melvin, 27\nF.3d 710, 715 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding enhanced mandatory sentence\nresulting from one particular firearm not supportable when the jury\nmight have concluded that defendant possessed a different firearm\nnot subject to the enhancement), the jury need not reach unanimous\nagreement on the identity of the weapon when the defendant is\ncharged with violating  924(c) due to possession of more than one\nfirearm and none of the weapons justifies more than the statutory\nminimum sentence.  See United States v. Correa-Ventura, 6 F.3d\n1070, 1075-87 (5th Cir. 1993) (concluding that specific unanimity\nwas not required when  924(c) conviction could have been based on\nany one of ten weapons seized).\nii. Omission of \"knowing\" and \"in relation to\" during\ninstructions.  Next, Hernndez argues that the court committed\nplain error by omitting both \"knowing\" and \"in relation to\" from\nthe instructions.  He argues that his licensed pistol had no\nrelationship to the drug offense and that he did not knowingly\ncarry the weapon found under Ramirez's seat.  Consequently, the\ninstructions allowed the jury to convict him either for his routine\npossession of a concealed weapon as authorized by his permit or\nwithout knowing the gun was under Ramirez's seat.\nThe court instructed the jury as follows:\n  Now, Count Two of the indictment charges the\ndefendant with carrying a pistol or firearm\nduring and in relation to a drug trafficking\ntransaction. \n  . . . \n  Now, two essential elements are required to be\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to\nestablish the offense charged in Count Two of\nthe indictment.  And these are as follows:\nFirst, that the defendant committed a drug\ntrafficking crime for which he may be\nprosecuted in a court of the United States. \nAnd second, that during the commission of that\ncrime, the defendant carried a firearm.\n\n  The fact that a person may have a permit to\ncarry a weapon is irrelevant in this matter. \nThe issue is whether the firearm was carried\nduring and in relation to the commission of\nthe crime.\n\nHernndez's counsel failed to object to this instruction, and it is\nalso reviewed for plain error.  \nWhen presented with a strikingly similar situation in\nUnited States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1156 (1st Cir.\n1995), we found that the omission of \"in relation to\" did not\nconstitute plain error.  However, Hernndez argues that Luciano-\nMosquera was decided before the Supreme Court's decision in United\nStates v. Johnson, 520 U.S. 461 (1997), in which the Court found\nthe omission of an element of an offense to be plainly erroneous. \nThe government asserts, in response, that the court used the phrase\n\"in relation to\" both before identifying the specific elements and\nafter, when it said that the \"issue is whether the firearm was\ncarried during and in relation to the commission of the crime.\" \nRather than wade into the murky waters of defining the elements of\nthis crime, cf. United States v. Munoz, 143 F.3d 632, 637 (2d Cir.\n1998) (discussing a challenge to \"the 'in relation to' element of\n924(c)(1)\"); United States v. Currier, 151 F.3d 39, 41 (1st Cir.\n1997) (describing \"during and in relation to\" as a single element),\nwe will assume, arguendo, both that the court's failure to mention\nit as a separate element was error and that the error was plain.\nHere again Hernndez has failed to meet his burden of\nproving that his substantial rights were affected.  See Olano, 507\nU.S. at 734 (\"It is the defendant rather than the Government who\nbears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\").  To\ndemonstrate prejudice Hernndez must show that the court's omission\naffected the outcome of the trial.  See id.  We are convinced that\nthe outcome was not affected, and the result would have been\nprecisely the same.  First, the jury found that he was an active\nparticipant in the drug deal, and rejected his \"mere presence\"\ndefense.  Second, it was undisputed that he was carrying a\nconcealed weapon, albeit with a permit.  Third, apart from the\nexistence of the permit itself, there was no reason to believe that\nthe gun was not \"in relation to\" the drug crime.  The jury heard no\nevidence that he routinely carried the gun for self-protection, or,\nfor that matter, that he had ever carried it on any other occasion. \nEspecially in light of the court's mentioning \"in relation to\"\nearlier, and its final statement that the \"issue is whether the\nfirearm was carried during and in relation to the commission of the\ncrime,\" Hernndez has failed to convince us that, had the court\nrepeated the \"in relation to\" requirement as a explicit element,\nthe jury would not have convicted him of possessing his weapon\nduring and in relation to the drug crime.\nHe also claims that the court failed to include a\nknowledge requirement in its instruction, and the jury therefore\ncould have convicted him of carrying the gun under Ramirez's seat\neven though he was unaware of it.  The simple response to this\ncontention is that the statute does not include an explicit\nknowledge requirement, undoubtedly because it would be redundant. \nThe statute applies an additional punishment for \"any person who,\nduring and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking\ncrime . . . uses or carries a firearm[.]\"  18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1). \nThe fact that the gun is carried \"in relation to\" the drug crime\nrequires that the defendant have an identified reason for carrying\nthe weapon.  See Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 238 (1993)\n(\"The phrase 'in relation to' thus, at a minimum, clarifies that\nthe firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the\ndrug trafficking crime;  its presence or involvement cannot be the\nresult of accident or coincidence.\").  It is logically impossible\nfor an individual to carry something for a specified purpose\nwithout knowingly carrying it.  See United States v. Padilla, 751\nF. Supp. 761 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (noting that  924(c)(1)'s terms\n\"necessarily include a knowledge element\").  If the jury found that\nhe had constructively carried the gun under Ramirez's seat \"in\nrelation to\" the drug transaction, by definition it determined that\nhe knowingly carried it.\nC. Ramirez's leniency in return for cooperation\nRelying on United States v. Singleton, 144 F.3d 1343\n(10th Cir. 1998) (\"Singleton I\"), Hernndez argues that his\nconviction was improper because the government violated the anti-\nbribery statute, 18 U.S.C.  201(c)(2), by promising something of\nvalue to Ramirez, namely, a lenient sentence recommendation, in\nreturn for his testimony against Hernndez.\nThis argument was not raised in the district court, and\nis subject to review only for plain error.  See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n52(b).  \"At a minimum, [a] court of appeals cannot correct an error\npursuant to Rule 52(b) unless the error is clear under current\nlaw.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.\nAt the time of Hernndez's conviction in November 1997,\nno court had yet found a promise of leniency by the government in\nreturn for cooperation to be a violation of the anti-bribery\nstatute.  Singleton I, issued the following year, was viewed as a\nsignificant departure from existing precedent, was roundly\nquestioned, and was swiftly vacated and reversed en banc.  See\nUnited States v. Singleton, 165 F.3d 1297 (10th Cir. 1999) (en\nbanc) (\"Singleton II\").  Every circuit and virtually every court\nfacing the issue has criticized Singleton I's reasoning.  See,\ne.g., United States v. Condon, 170 F.3d. 687, 688-89 (7th Cir.\n1999) United States v. Ramsey, 165 F.3d 980, 986 (D.C. Cir. 1999);\nUnited States v. Lowery, 166 F.3d 1119, 1123 (11th Cir. 1999); but\nsee United States v. Fraguela, 1998 WL 560352 (E.D. La. Aug. 27,\n1998), vacated on other grounds, 1998 WL 910219 (E.D. La. Oct. 7,\n1998).  In light of the lack of any previous caselaw, and the\noverwhelming condemnation of Singleton I, it is beyond question\nthat Singleton I's holding is not \"clear under current law.\" \nConsequently, the court did not commit plain error in admitting\nRamirez's testimony.D. Other claims of error\nHernndez presents four other bases on which we might\nrule that his conviction and sentence were improper.  Because we\nare entirely unpersuaded by these other arguments, we decline to\naddress any of them in more than a brief comment.\nHernndez posits that the district court improperly\ndenied his motion to suppress the 9 millimeter gun found under the\npassenger seat.  Warrantless inventory searches must be conducted\naccording to standardized procedures.  See United States v.\nInfante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 503 (1st Cir. 1994).  The court found\nthat the government followed official Drug Enforcement\nAdministration policy in this case, and that finding is not clearly\nerroneous, see United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.\n1994).  Therefore the search and seizure of the gun were lawful.  \nHe also argues that the trial court permitted the\ngovernment to pose leading questions and to impeach Ramirez\nimproperly.  The court's rulings in this area are reviewed for\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Mulinelli-Navas, 111\nF.3d 983, 990 (1st Cir. 1997).   A review of the transcript reveals\nthat, at times, Ramirez was unresponsive or showed a lack of\nunderstanding.  The court was well within the bounds of its\ndiscretion in permitting the government to clarify his testimony by\nleading Ramirez and, when appropriate, impeaching him.\nHernndez suggests that for sentencing purposes the\ngovernment did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he\nknew the type or quantity of drugs involved.   Although Ramirez\ninitially denied mentioning the drug involved, he eventually\nadmitted that, on the day the deal was to take place, he told\nHernndez that the money would be used to purchase cocaine.  While\nthere was equivocal evidence about whether Ramirez told Hernndez\nabout the quantity, the court ruled that Hernndez knew or\nreasonably could have foreseen that the $123,500 loan would\npurchase more than five kilograms.  This finding cannot be\ndescribed as clearly erroneous.  See United States v.\nMiranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 524 (1st Cir. 1996).\nFinally, claiming that his actions constituted aberrant\nbehavior, Hernndez moved for a downward departure.  The court\nrefused to grant Hernndez's motion, stating that merely because\n\"[g]ood people do bad things\" \"doesn't mean that those [actions]\nare aberrant behaviors.\"  Unless the district court misapprehends\nthe guidelines or misconstrues its authority to depart, we do not\nhave jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions not to depart\nfrom sentences imposed under the Guidelines.

Hernandez was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced.  On appeal, he argues that the court made a series of mistakes both during trial and at sentencing.  We are unpersuaded by his claims of error and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony at trial revealed the following:  On April 17, 1997, two government informants contacted Armando Cabrera Vargas (\"Cabrera\") regarding the sale of a number of kilograms of cocaine.  Cabrera, in turn, went to see Orlando Ramirez Ortiz (\"Ramirez\"), and introduced Ramirez to the government informants.  With Cabrera acting as middleman, the parties agreed that Ramirez would purchase seven kilograms of cocaine for $123,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez's problem was that he did not actually have that much money, so he approached his long-time friend Hernandez for a loan for Ramirez's \"business.\"   When Hernandez asked for more details, Ramirez offered vague assurances that he was sure of what he was doing and that the money would be repaid.  Although Hernandez was reluctant to lend this sizeable amount of capital without knowing the specifics of the business deal, he agreed to the transaction after Ramirez pledged his house and business as collateral.  On April 23, 1997, the day the drug deal was to take place, Ramirez finally informed Hernandez that the money was being used to purchase cocaine.  When pressed at trial by prosecutors, Ramirez conceded that Hernandez, still unsure about whether the transaction would be consummated, demanded to be present and carry the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the time came, Ramirez called Hernandez and told him to come to the back of the Villa Real Hotel, where the exchange was to take place.  When Hernandez arrived in his Toyota 4Runner truck, Ramirez got in<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and inspected the money, which was in a sports gear bag.  At that moment, one of the informants selling the drugs called Ramirez on his cellular phone and instructed Ramirez to drive to the front of the hotel.  In front of the hotel the informant approached Hernandez's truck, and told Hernandez and Ramirez that \"the Colombian\" drug supplier (in reality an undercover government agent named Roln) wanted to come check out the money.  When Hernandez inquired, Ramirez explained that Roln owned the cocaine.  Roln inspected the money and departed allegedly to retrieve the drugs.  Instead, he gave other agents the signal to arrest Hernandez and Ramirez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Hernandez was arrested, agents discovered in his waistband a concealed 9 millimeter handgun, which he had a valid permit to carry.  The agents did not thoroughly search the vehicle at the scene but during a later inventory search found a different 9 millimeter gun with an obliterated serial number under the front passenger seat where Ramirez had been sitting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez was indicted on three counts:  (1) conspiracy to possess the seven kilograms of cocaine with the intent to distribute;  (2) carrying a firearm during and in relation to the drug crime;  and (3) possessing the gun with the obliterated serial number.  Hernandez pled not guilty to all three charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez and Cabrera were also indicted, but both pled guilty and agreed to cooperate with the government in return for the government's promise to recommend leniency in sentencing.  During a three day trial in mid-November 1997, the government called Ramirez as a witness.  While Ramirez was on the stand, the court found him at times reluctant to testify and unresponsive to the government's questions, so it permitted the prosecutors to ask certain leading questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was eventually sent to the jury, and it began deliberating.  Approximately two and one half hours later, the jury sent a note to the judge saying that \"[t]he jury has not been able to come to a guilty or not guilty verdict.  We are at an impasse.\"   The judge consulted with counsel, and sent the following response, to which counsel did not object:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>All of you are equally honest and conscientious jurors who have heard the same evidence.  All of you share an equal desire to arrive at a verdict.  Each of you should ask yourself whether you should question the correctness of your present position.  I remind you that in your deliberations you are to consider the instructions as a whole.  Please continue the deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberating for another hour, the jury found Hernandez guilty of both count 1, conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute, and count 2, possession of a gun during and in relation to a drug crime, but acquitted him on count 3, possession of the gun found under Ramirez's seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez was subsequently sentenced to 181 months of imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $200.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that his conviction and sentence were improper due to a number of alleged errors.  While none of his claims is meritorious, three are worthy of developed consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The court's supplemental charge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez claims that the court erred when it responded to the jury's impasse with the supplemental jury instruction, often described as a \"dynamite\" charge or an Allen charge, after Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896).  Counsel did not object at the time, and hence we review only for plain error.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  United States v. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plain error analysis requires four steps.  First, an error must have been committed.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  Second, the error must be plain or obvious.  Id. at 734.   Third, the plain error must \"affect[ ] substantial rights,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), which generally means that it must have been prejudicial, see Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.   Finally, because Rule 52(b) is discretionary, we must be convinced that the error \" 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings[ ]' ]' \" before we will order a new trial.  Id. at 736 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. The Error.   Any supplemental instruction in response to a jury's deadlock can have a significant coercive effect by intimating that some jury members should capitulate to others' views, or by suggesting that the members should compromise their rational positions in order to reach an agreement.  See United States v. Angiulo, 485 F.2d 37, 39 (1st Cir.1973).  Although federal courts have long sanctioned the use of supplemental charges in the face of an apparent impasse, see Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231, 237, 108 S.Ct. 546, 98 L.Ed.2d 568 (1988), we have warned that such action should be undertaken with \"great caution and only when absolutely necessary,\" United States v. Flannery, 451 F.2d 880, 883 (1st Cir.1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned about the instruction's potentially coercive effect, we have required that it contain three specific elements to moderate any prejudice.  See United States v. Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir.1998).  First, in order that the burden of reconsideration is not shouldered exclusively by those jury members holding the minority view, the court should expressly instruct both the minority and the majority to reexamine their positions.  See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39.   Second, the instruction should acknowledge that the jury has the right not to agree.  See Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445, 446, 85 S.Ct. 1059, 13 L.Ed.2d 957 (1965) (per curiam).  Third, the court should remind the jury that the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains, as always, with the government.  See Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d at 197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge at issue did not meet these criteria.  While it could be argued that the first element was satisfied because each person was instructed to question the correctness of his or her position, the instruction did not address either of the other two requirements in any manner whatsoever.  Although we have consistently refrained from offering any definite wording for an Allen charge, the instruction should have referenced in some way all three essential elements.  The court's failure to do so was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presents a somewhat tautological argument in response.  It claims that the omission of two elements was not erroneous because the instruction was not an Allen charge, and it was not an Allen charge because it did not follow the accepted format, i.e., it did not contain all three elements.  In addition to protecting any supplemental instruction such as this one from judicial review for consistency with the three Allen criteria, the government's argument ignores our explicit ruling that \"any supplemental instruction which urges the jury to return to its deliberations must include the three balancing elements stated above.\"  Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 40 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii.  The Clarity of the Error.   It is equally obvious that the second requirement, i.e., that the error is clear, has also been met.  We first discussed the three elements in Flannery in 1971, and have followed them with unwavering devotion ever since.  We have addressed them on a number of occasions, even describing them as \"essential,\" United States v. Vachon, 869 F.2d 653, 659 (1st Cir.1989).  The district court's failure to mention either of the last two elements constituted plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii.  Affecting substantial rights.   Although the error was plain, we may not reverse Hernandez's conviction and order a new trial unless the error \"affect[ed] substantial rights.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  In a challenge to an improper Allen charge, the relevant inquiry revolves around whether the charge \"in its context and under all the circumstances\" coerced the jury into convicting him.  Lowenfield, 484 U.S. at 237.   Hernandez's counsel below admitted that the charge was \"not coercive in the least.\"   We agree, based on both the length of deliberations after the Allen charge and the verdict's internal consistency.  See United States v. Plunk, 153 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th Cir.1998);  Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d at 199.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The length of deliberations in this case negates any suggestion of coercion.  The jury's task was relatively straightforward.  The government claimed Hernandez joined Cabrera's and Ramirez's drug conspiracy because Hernandez lent Ramirez the money after learning that it would be used to purchase drugs.  Hernandez's defense was that he was \"merely present\" when the drug deal occurred.  Deciding which version of events to believe was a relatively uncomplicated exercise.  It appears that the jury recognized as much and seemed to expect that deliberations would be swift:  they complained of an impasse after deliberating for only two and one half hours.  After the judge sent the written supplemental instruction, the jury deliberated for another hour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous courts have found no coercion under similar circumstances.  See Green v. French, 143 F.3d 865, 886 (4th Cir.1998) (concluding that a one hour deliberation after a supplemental Allen instruction failed to suggest coercion);  United States v. Hernandez, 105 F.3d 1330, 1334 (9th Cir.1997) (stating that deliberations of 40 minutes after Allen charge did not \"raise the specter of coercion\");  United States v. Smith, 635 F.2d 716, 721-22 (8th Cir.1980) (finding no coercion when jury deliberated forty-five minutes after Allen charge, in addition to previous three hour total deliberations).  We note, however, that these cases do not establish a formula, but rather are illustrative of the principle that sufficient additional time can help to establish an absence of coercion.  That principle is particularly applicable in this case, where the total time of deliberation was roughly 3 1/2 hours, of which the deliberations after the Allen charge represented almost one third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other relevant circumstance in this case, namely, the verdict's internal consistency, also implies an absence of coercion.  As noted earlier, Hernandez was convicted of conspiring to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute.  He was also convicted of possession of a gun, either the one on his person or the one under Ramirez's seat, during and in relation to the drug crime.  Finally, he was acquitted of possessing the gun with an obliterated serial number which was found underneath Ramirez's seat.  The jury's verdict indicates that it found Hernandez guilty of the drug crime and of possession of his own gun, but rejected the government's argument that he constructively possessed the firearm under Ramirez's seat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The internal consistency of this result suggests a nuanced analysis and reasoned decision.  See Plunk, 153 F.3d at 1027 (concluding that \"the fact that the jury rendered a mixed verdict [on independent counts] ... suggests that it reviewed the evidence rationally and independently\");  cf.  Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d at 199 (finding confusion when jury convicted defendant of conspiracy but acquitted him on the underlying substantive charge, because evidence suggested defendant was either innocent of both or guilty of both).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury was not coerced, the court's error did not affect Hernandez's substantial rights, and we will not reverse his conviction due to the erroneous Allen charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>B. Carrying a gun \"during and in relation to\" a drug crime</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez challenges two related aspects of the jury instructions on count two, namely, the failure to give a specific unanimity charge on which gun was carried, and the omission of the words \"knowing\" and \"in relation to\" from certain portions of the instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. Unanimity on which gun was carried.   Hernandez claims that the court committed plain error because the jury was not instructed that it had to agree which gun Hernandez carried before he could be convicted.  Raised for the first time on appeal, this claim is also reviewed for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case no error was committed.  The court was not required to give a specific unanimity instruction because the jury, in fact, was not required to agree on the specific gun carried.  Although Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(a) requires that a criminal conviction be unanimous, the jury need not necessarily agree on the facts underlying that conviction.  See United States v. Tarvers, 833 F.2d 1068, 1074 (1st Cir.1987) (unanimity generally not required with respect to a specific act underlying an element of a charged offense).  When the government alleges in a single count that the defendant committed the offense by one or more specified means, the Supreme Court has \"never suggested that in returning general verdicts in such cases the jurors should be required to agree on a single means of commission, any more than the indictments were required to specify one alone.\"  Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624, 631, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555 (1991);  see also United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 105 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that the jury must agree that the government has proven all the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, but \"it need not agree on the means by which all the elements were accomplished\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although unanimity is required when such a determination matters for sentencing purposes, see United States v. Melvin, 27 F.3d 710, 715 (1st Cir.1994) (finding enhanced mandatory sentence resulting from one particular firearm not supportable when the jury might have concluded that defendant possessed a different firearm not subject to the enhancement), the jury need not reach unanimous agreement on the identity of the weapon when the defendant is charged with violating &#167; 924(c) due to possession of more than one firearm and none of the weapons justifies more than the statutory minimum sentence.  See United States v. Correa-Ventura, 6 F.3d 1070, 1075-87 (5th Cir.1993) (concluding that specific unanimity was not required when &#167; 924(c) conviction could have been based on any one of ten weapons seized).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii.  Omission of \"knowing\" and \"in relation to\" during instructions.   Next, Hernandez argues that the court committed plain error by omitting both \"knowing\" and \"in relation to\" from the instructions.  He argues that his licensed pistol had no relationship to the drug offense and that he did not knowingly carry the weapon found under Ramirez's seat.  Consequently, the instructions allowed the jury to convict him either for his routine possession of a concealed weapon as authorized by his permit or without knowing the gun was under Ramirez's seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>Now, Count Two of the indictment charges the defendant with carrying a pistol or firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking transaction....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Now, two essential elements are required to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish the offense charged in Count Two of the indictment.  And these are as follows:  First, that the defendant committed a drug trafficking crime for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.  And second, that during the commission of that crime, the defendant carried a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>The fact that a person may have a permit to carry a weapon is irrelevant in this matter.  The issue is whether the firearm was carried during and in relation to the commission of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez's counsel failed to object to this instruction, and it is also reviewed for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When presented with a strikingly similar situation in United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1156 (1st Cir.1995), we found that the omission of \"in relation to\" did not constitute plain error.  However, Hernandez argues that Luciano-Mosquera was decided before the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997), in which the Court found the omission of an element of an offense to be plainly erroneous.  The government asserts, in response, that the court used the phrase \"in relation to\" both before identifying the specific elements and after, when it said that the \"issue is whether the firearm was carried during and in relation to the commission of the crime.\"   Rather than wade into the murky waters of defining the elements of this crime, cf.  United States v. Munoz, 143 F.3d 632, 637 (2d Cir.1998) (discussing a challenge to \"the 'in relation to' element of &#167; 924(c)(1)\");  United States v. Currier, 151 F.3d 39, 41 (1st Cir.1998) (describing \"during and in relation to\" as a single element), we will assume, arguendo, both that the court's failure to mention it as a separate element was error and that the error was plain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here again Hernandez has failed to meet his burden of proving that his substantial rights were affected.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 734 (\"It is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\").  To demonstrate prejudice Hernandez must show that the court's omission affected the outcome of the trial.  See id.   We are convinced that the outcome was not affected, and the result would have been precisely the same.  First, the jury found that he was an active participant in the drug deal, and rejected his \"mere presence\" defense.  Second, it was undisputed that he was carrying a concealed weapon, albeit with a permit.  Third, apart from the existence of the permit itself, there was no reason to believe that the gun was not \"in relation to\" the drug crime.  The jury heard no evidence that he routinely carried the gun for self-protection, or, for that matter, that he had ever carried it on any other occasion.  Especially in light of the court's mentioning \"in relation to\" earlier, and its final statement that the \"issue is whether the firearm was carried during and in relation to the commission of the crime,\" Hernandez has failed to convince us that, had the court repeated the \"in relation to\" requirement as a explicit element, the jury would not have convicted him of possessing his weapon during and in relation to the drug crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He also claims that the court failed to include a knowledge requirement in its instruction, and the jury therefore could have convicted him of carrying the gun under Ramirez's seat even though he was unaware of it.  The simple response to this contention is that the statute does not include an explicit knowledge requirement, undoubtedly because it would be redundant.  The statute applies an additional punishment for \"any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm[.]\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  The fact that the gun is carried \"in relation to\" the drug crime requires that the defendant have an identified reason for carrying the weapon.  See Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993) (\"The phrase 'in relation to' thus, at a minimum, clarifies that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime;  its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\").  It is logically impossible for an individual to carry something for a specified purpose without knowingly carrying it.  See United States v. Padilla, 751 F.Supp. 761 (N.D.Ill.1990) (noting that &#167; 924(c)(1)'s terms \"necessarily include a knowledge element\").

Singleton, 144 F.3d 1343 (10th Cir.1998) (\"Singleton I \"), Hernandez argues that his conviction was improper because the government violated the anti-bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c)(2), by promising something of value to Ramirez, namely, a lenient sentence recommendation, in return for his testimony against Hernandez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument was not raised in the district court, and is subject to review only for plain error.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  \"At a minimum, [a] court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule 52(b) unless the error is clear under current law.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Hernandez's conviction in November 1997, no court had yet found a promise of leniency by the government in return for cooperation to be a violation of the anti-bribery statute.  Singleton I, issued the following year, was viewed as a significant departure from existing precedent, was roundly questioned, and was swiftly vacated and reversed en banc.  See United States v. Singleton, 165 F.3d 1297 (10th Cir.1999) (en banc) (\"Singleton II \").  Every circuit and virtually every court facing the issue has criticized Singleton I 's reasoning.  See, e.g., United States v. Condon, 170 F.3d 687, 688-89 (7th Cir.1999) United States v. Ramsey, 165 F.3d 980, 986 (D.C.Cir.1999);  United States v. Lowery, 166 F.3d 1119, 1123 (11th Cir.1999);  but see United States v. Fraguela, 1998 WL 560352 (E.D.La. Aug.27, 1998), vacated on other grounds, 1998 WL 910219 (E.D.La. Oct.7, 1998).  In light of the lack of any previous caselaw, and the overwhelming condemnation of Singleton I, it is beyond question that Singleton I's holding is not \"clear under current law.\"   Consequently, the court did not commit plain error in admitting Ramirez's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Other claims of error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez presents four other bases on which we might rule that his conviction and sentence were improper.  Because we are entirely unpersuaded by these other arguments, we decline to address any of them in more than a brief comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez posits that the district court improperly denied his motion to suppress the 9 millimeter gun found under the passenger seat.  Warrantless inventory searches must be conducted according to standardized procedures.  See United States v. Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 503 (1st Cir.1994).  The court found that the government followed official Drug Enforcement Administration policy in this case, and that finding is not clearly erroneous, see United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994).  Therefore the search and seizure of the gun were lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He also argues that the trial court permitted the government to pose leading questions and to impeach Ramirez improperly.  The court's rulings in this area are reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Mulinelli-Navas, 111 F.3d 983, 990 (1st Cir.1997).  A review of the transcript reveals that, at times, Ramirez was unresponsive or showed a lack of understanding.  The court was well within the bounds of its discretion in permitting the government to clarify his testimony by leading Ramirez and, when appropriate, impeaching him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez suggests that for sentencing purposes the government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he knew the type or quantity of drugs involved.  Although Ramirez initially denied mentioning the drug involved, he eventually admitted that, on the day the deal was to take place, he told Hernandez that the money would be used to purchase cocaine.  While there was equivocal evidence about whether Ramirez told Hernandez about the quantity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the court ruled that Hernandez knew or reasonably could have foreseen that the $123,500 loan would purchase more than five kilograms.  This finding cannot be described as clearly erroneous.  See United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 524 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, claiming that his actions constituted aberrant behavior, Hernandez moved for a downward departure.  The court refused to grant Hernandez's motion, stating that merely because \"[g]ood people do bad things\" \"doesn't mean that those [actions] are aberrant behaviors.\"   Unless the district court misapprehends the guidelines or misconstrues its authority to depart, we do not have jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions not to depart from sentences imposed under the Guidelines.  See United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560 (1st Cir.1996).  The district court neither misapprehended the guidelines nor misconstrued its authority;  it simply found that such a departure was unwarranted.  We lack any authority to countermand its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> It is unclear whether Cabrera was also present in the truck, but we decline to address the conflict in testimony because Cabrera's presence is irrelevant to the issues before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We acknowledge that it is theoretically possible that the jury found Hernandez had constructively possessed the weapon under Ramirez's seat but found that the government had failed to prove that he knew that its serial number had been obliterated, an element in the jury's instructions.

Hernandez was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced.  On appeal, he argues that the court made a series of mistakes both during trial and at sentencing.  We are unpersuaded by his claims of error and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony at trial revealed the following:  On April 17, 1997, two government informants contacted Armando Cabrera Vargas (\"Cabrera\") regarding the sale of a number of kilograms of cocaine.  Cabrera, in turn, went to see Orlando Ramirez Ortiz (\"Ramirez\"), and introduced Ramirez to the government informants.  With Cabrera acting as middleman, the parties agreed that Ramirez would purchase seven kilograms of cocaine for $123,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez's problem was that he did not actually have that much money, so he approached his long-time friend Hernandez for a loan for Ramirez's \"business.\"   When Hernandez asked for more details, Ramirez offered vague assurances that he was sure of what he was doing and that the money would be repaid.  Although Hernandez was reluctant to lend this sizeable amount of capital without knowing the specifics of the business deal, he agreed to the transaction after Ramirez pledged his house and business as collateral.  On April 23, 1997, the day the drug deal was to take place, Ramirez finally informed Hernandez that the money was being used to purchase cocaine.  When pressed at trial by prosecutors, Ramirez conceded that Hernandez, still unsure about whether the transaction would be consummated, demanded to be present and carry the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the time came, Ramirez called Hernandez and told him to come to the back of the Villa Real Hotel, where the exchange was to take place.  When Hernandez arrived in his Toyota 4Runner truck, Ramirez got in<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and inspected the money, which was in a sports gear bag.  At that moment, one of the informants selling the drugs called Ramirez on his cellular phone and instructed Ramirez to drive to the front of the hotel.  In front of the hotel the informant approached Hernandez's truck, and told Hernandez and Ramirez that \"the Colombian\" drug supplier (in reality an undercover government agent named Roln) wanted to come check out the money.  When Hernandez inquired, Ramirez explained that Roln owned the cocaine.  Roln inspected the money and departed allegedly to retrieve the drugs.  Instead, he gave other agents the signal to arrest Hernandez and Ramirez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Hernandez was arrested, agents discovered in his waistband a concealed 9 millimeter handgun, which he had a valid permit to carry.  The agents did not thoroughly search the vehicle at the scene but during a later inventory search found a different 9 millimeter gun with an obliterated serial number under the front passenger seat where Ramirez had been sitting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez was indicted on three counts:  (1) conspiracy to possess the seven kilograms of cocaine with the intent to distribute;  (2) carrying a firearm during and in relation to the drug crime;  and (3) possessing the gun with the obliterated serial number.  Hernandez pled not guilty to all three charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez and Cabrera were also indicted, but both pled guilty and agreed to cooperate with the government in return for the government's promise to recommend leniency in sentencing.  During a three day trial in mid-November 1997, the government called Ramirez as a witness.  While Ramirez was on the stand, the court found him at times reluctant to testify and unresponsive to the government's questions, so it permitted the prosecutors to ask certain leading questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was eventually sent to the jury, and it began deliberating.  Approximately two and one half hours later, the jury sent a note to the judge saying that \"[t]he jury has not been able to come to a guilty or not guilty verdict.  We are at an impasse.\"   The judge consulted with counsel, and sent the following response, to which counsel did not object:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>All of you are equally honest and conscientious jurors who have heard the same evidence.  All of you share an equal desire to arrive at a verdict.  Each of you should ask yourself whether you should question the correctness of your present position.

Please continue the deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberating for another hour, the jury found Hernandez guilty of both count 1, conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute, and count 2, possession of a gun during and in relation to a drug crime, but acquitted him on count 3, possession of the gun found under Ramirez's seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez was subsequently sentenced to 181 months of imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $200.

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that his conviction and sentence were improper due to a number of alleged errors.

Third, the plain error must \"affect[ ] substantial rights,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), which generally means that it must have been prejudicial, see Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.

Any supplemental instruction in response to a jury's deadlock can have a significant coercive effect by intimating that some jury members should capitulate to others' views, or by suggesting that the members should compromise their rational positions in order to reach an agreement.  See United States v. Angiulo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"313577\"><a href=\"/opinion/313577/united-states-v-gennaro-j-angiulo/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1973).  Although federal courts have long sanctioned the use of supplemental charges in the face of an apparent impasse, see Lowenfield v. Phelps, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111978\"><a href=\"/opinion/111978/lowenfield-v-phelps/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 237, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111978\"><a href=\"/opinion/111978/lowenfield-v-phelps/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See United States v. Paniagua-Ramos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197771\"><a href=\"/opinion/197771/united-states-v-paniagua-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 197 (1st Cir.1998).  First, in order that the burden of reconsideration is not shouldered exclusively by those jury members holding the minority view, the court should expressly instruct both the minority and the majority to reexamine their positions.  See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39.   Second, the instruction should acknowledge that the jury has the right not to agree.  See Jenkins v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107018\"><a href=\"/opinion/107018/jenkins-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span>, 446, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107018\"><a href=\"/opinion/107018/jenkins-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span> (1965) (per curiam).  Third, the court should remind the jury that the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains, as always, with the government.  See Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d at 197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge at issue did not meet these criteria.  While it could be argued that the first element was satisfied because each person was instructed to question the correctness of his or her position, the instruction did not address either of the other two requirements in any manner whatsoever.  Although we have consistently refrained from offering any definite wording for an Allen charge, the instruction should have referenced in some way all three essential elements.  The court's failure to do so was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presents a somewhat tautological argument in response.  It claims that the omission of two elements was not erroneous because the instruction was not an Allen charge, and it was not an Allen charge because it did not follow the accepted format, i.e., it did not contain all three elements.  In addition to protecting any supplemental instruction such as this one from judicial review for consistency with the three Allen criteria, the government's argument ignores our explicit ruling that \"any supplemental instruction which urges the jury to return to its deliberations must include the three balancing elements stated above.\"  Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 40 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii.  The Clarity of the Error.   It is equally obvious that the second requirement, i.e., that the error is clear, has also been met.  We first discussed the three elements in Flannery in 1971, and have followed them with unwavering devotion ever since.  We have addressed them on a number of occasions, even describing them as \"essential,\" United States v. Vachon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519496\"><a href=\"/opinion/519496/united-states-v-adelard-vachon/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 659 (1st Cir.1989).  The district court's failure to mention either of the last two elements constituted plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii.  Affecting substantial rights.   Although the error was plain, we may not reverse Hernandez's conviction and order a new trial unless the error \"affect[ed] substantial rights.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  In a challenge to an improper Allen charge, the relevant inquiry revolves around whether the charge \"in its context and under all the circumstances\" coerced the jury into convicting him.  Lowenfield, 484 U.S. at 237.   Hernandez's counsel below admitted that the charge was \"not coercive in the least.\"   We agree, based on both the length of deliberations after the Allen charge and the verdict's internal consistency.  See United States v. Plunk, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757527\"><a href=\"/opinion/757527/98-cal-daily-op-serv-6726-98-daily-journal-dar-11939-98-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1011</span></a></span>, 1027 (9th Cir.1998);  Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d at 199.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The length of deliberations in this case negates any suggestion of coercion.  The jury's task was relatively straightforward.  The government claimed Hernandez joined Cabrera's and Ramirez's drug conspiracy because Hernandez lent Ramirez the money after learning that it would be used to purchase drugs.  Hernandez's defense was that he was \"merely present\" when the drug deal occurred.  Deciding which version of events to believe was a relatively uncomplicated exercise.  It appears that the jury recognized as much and seemed to expect that deliberations would be swift:  they complained of an impasse after deliberating for only two and one half hours.  After the judge sent the written supplemental instruction, the jury deliberated for another hour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous courts have found no coercion under similar circumstances.

We note, however, that these cases do not establish a formula, but rather are illustrative of the principle that sufficient additional time can help to establish an absence of coercion.  That principle is particularly applicable in this case, where the total time of deliberation was roughly 3 1/2 hours, of which the deliberations after the Allen charge represented almost one third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other relevant circumstance in this case, namely, the verdict's internal consistency, also implies an absence of coercion.  As noted earlier, Hernandez was convicted of conspiring to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute.  He was also convicted of possession of a gun, either the one on his person or the one under Ramirez's seat, during and in relation to the drug crime.  Finally, he was acquitted of possessing the gun with an obliterated serial number which was found underneath Ramirez's seat.  The jury's verdict indicates that it found Hernandez guilty of the drug crime and of possession of his own gun, but rejected the government's argument that he constructively possessed the firearm under Ramirez's seat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The internal consistency of this result suggests a nuanced analysis and reasoned decision.  See Plunk, 153 F.3d at 1027 (concluding that \"the fact that the jury rendered a mixed verdict [on independent counts] ... suggests that it reviewed the evidence rationally and independently\");  cf.  Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d at 199 (finding confusion when jury convicted defendant of conspiracy but acquitted him on the underlying substantive charge, because evidence suggested defendant was either innocent of both or guilty of both).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury was not coerced, the court's error did not affect Hernandez's substantial rights, and we will not reverse his conviction due to the erroneous Allen charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>B.

Unanimity on which gun was carried.

The court was not required to give a specific unanimity instruction because the jury, in fact, was not required to agree on the specific gun carried.  Although Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(a) requires that a criminal conviction be unanimous, the jury need not necessarily agree on the facts underlying that conviction.  See United States v.

Omission of \"knowing\" and \"in relation to\" during instructions.   Next, Hernandez argues that the court committed plain error by omitting both \"knowing\" and \"in relation to\" from the instructions.  He argues that his licensed pistol had no relationship to the drug offense and that he did not knowingly carry the weapon found under Ramirez's seat.  Consequently, the instructions allowed the jury to convict him either for his routine possession of a concealed weapon as authorized by his permit or without knowing the gun was under Ramirez's seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>Now, Count Two of the indictment charges the defendant with carrying a pistol or firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking transaction....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Now, two essential elements are required to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish the offense charged in Count Two of the indictment.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span> (1997), in which the Court found the omission of an element of an offense to be plainly erroneous.  The government asserts, in response, that the court used the phrase \"in relation to\" both before identifying the specific elements and after, when it said that the \"issue is whether the firearm was carried during and in relation to the commission of the crime.\"   Rather than wade into the murky waters of defining the elements of this crime, cf.  United States v. Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754213\"><a href=\"/opinion/754213/united-states-v-juan-r-munoz-aka-john-doe-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>, 637 (2d Cir.1998) (discussing a challenge to \"the 'in relation to' element of &#167; 924(c)(1)\");  United States v.

See Olano, 507 U.S. at 734 (\"It is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\").  To demonstrate prejudice Hernandez must show that the court's omission affected the outcome of the trial.  See id.   We are convinced that the outcome was not affected, and the result would have been precisely the same.  First, the jury found that he was an active participant in the drug deal, and rejected his \"mere presence\" defense.  Second, it was undisputed that he was carrying a concealed weapon, albeit with a permit.  Third, apart from the existence of the permit itself, there was no reason to believe that the gun was not \"in relation to\" the drug crime.  The jury heard no evidence that he routinely carried the gun for self-protection, or, for that matter, that he had ever carried it on any other occasion.  Especially in light of the court's mentioning \"in relation to\" earlier, and its final statement that the \"issue is whether the firearm was carried during and in relation to the commission of the crime,\" Hernandez has failed to convince us that, had the court repeated the \"in relation to\" requirement as a explicit element, the jury would not have convicted him of possessing his weapon during and in relation to the drug crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He also claims that the court failed to include a knowledge requirement in its instruction, and the jury therefore could have convicted him of carrying the gun under Ramirez's seat even though he was unaware of it.  The simple response to this contention is that the statute does not include an explicit knowledge requirement, undoubtedly because it would be redundant.  The statute applies an additional punishment for \"any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm[.]\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  The fact that the gun is carried \"in relation to\" the drug crime requires that the defendant have an identified reason for carrying the weapon.  See Smith v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 238, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although Ramirez initially denied mentioning the drug involved, he eventually admitted that, on the day the deal was to take place, he told Hernandez that the money would be used to purchase cocaine.  While there was equivocal evidence about whether Ramirez told Hernandez about the quantity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the court ruled that Hernandez knew or reasonably could have foreseen that the $123,500 loan would purchase more than five kilograms.  This finding cannot be described as clearly erroneous.  See United States v.
