The\r\n\nprices of Computervision's  stock and notes fell sharply.  On\r\n\nthe day after this announcement, the first  investor suit was\r\n\nfiled.   Computervision  and the  IPO underwriters  were sued\r\n\nunder Sections 11  and 12(2)  of the Securities  Act of  1933\r\n\n(the  \"Securities   Act\").      The   investors   also   sued\r\n\nComputervision's principal officers  and directors,  alleging\r\n\ncontrolling  person   liability  under  Section  15   of  the\r\n\nSecurities Act.   Plaintiffs  asserted that  they represented\r\n\nthe class  of investors who  purchased common stock  or notes\r\n\nbetween August 14, 1992 and September 29, 1992.  The district\r\n\ncourt,  after   lengthy   pre-trial  proceedings   and   full\r\n\ndiscovery,  both dismissed  the case  for failure to  state a\r\n\nclaim and denied  as futile plaintiffs'  motion for leave  to\r\n\nfile  a second amended  complaint.  See  In re Computervision\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp. Sec.  Litig. (\"Computervision  II\"), 914 F.

Mass. 1996).\r\n\n          The  investors  appeal  from  the  denial of  their\r\n\nmotion for leave to amend, arguing that their proposed second\r\n\namended  complaint (the \"Proposed Complaint\") passed the Rule\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n12(b)(6)  threshold.     They  say  the  Proposed   Complaint\r\n\nadequately alleged violations of  the securities laws in that\r\n\nthe   Prospectus1   for    the   IPO   contained   actionable\r\n\nmisrepresentations,\"half-truths\" or  omissions regarding: (1)\r\n\nthe  factors considered  in  determining the  prices for  the\r\n\nofferings; (2) certain mid-quarter  information for the third\r\n\nquarter of  1992; (3) the importance  of Computervision's low\r\n\nbacklog; (4)  the latest release of  Computervision's key new\r\n\nsoftware product,  CADDS  5, which  Computervision  said  was\r\n\ncommercially shipping  when (plaintiffs say) it  was not, and\r\n\nthe development and commercial prospects of CADDS 5.\r\n\n          We affirm,  although our reasoning as  to the first\r\n\nclaim differs from that of the district court.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n                          Background\r                                                \r\n\n          Computervision   is  a  leading  supplier  of  work\r\n\nstation-based  computer  aided  design  and   computer  aided\r\n\nmanufacturing  (\"CAD/CAM\") software  and related  services to\r\n\nthe  mechanical  design  automation  market.    Its  software\r\n\nproducts  are utilized  in the  design  of complex  parts and\r\n\nassemblies   for  the   automotive,   aerospace,  and   other\r\n\nmechanical industries.   Its products enable  users to reduce\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  term \"Prospectus\" will  be used  throughout although\r\nthere were two prospectuses, one for stock and one for notes.\r\nThe  parties  treat  them   as  identical  for  all  material\r\npurposes. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe    time   required   for   designing,   engineering   and\r\n\nmanufacturing a  product  before market  introduction.   This\r\n\n\"time-to-market\" is  a key factor  in ensuring  profitability\r\n\nand competitiveness.2\r\n\n          The company  was organized  in 1972 under  the name\r\n\nPrime  Computer, Inc.3  Until 1988, Prime was in the business\r\n\nof  making  and selling  computer  systems.   In  1988, Prime\r\n\nacquired  Computervision Corporation,  a leading  supplier of\r\n\nCAD/CAM hardware and software products.  In 1989, the company\r\n\nwas  acquired  by DR  Holdings,  and shifted  its  focus from\r\n\ncomputer  systems  to  the   CAD/CAM  market.    A  principal\r\n\nshareholder of  DR Holdings, Shearson Holdings,4 provided the\r\n\ncompany with a  $500 million bridge  loan in connection  with\r\n\nthe  acquisition.  That bridge loan was intended to be repaid\r\n\nwith the proceeds from a high-yield bond offering.   However,\r\n\nthat  offering  never  occurred  and  Computervision  instead\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  At the  time of the IPO, Computervision  had an installed\r\nbase  of 58,000  units,  predominantly in  North America  and\r\nEurope.    In  1991,  international  revenues  accounted  for\r\napproximately 66% of its total revenues.\r\n\n3.  The company's name was changed to Computervision Corp. at\r\nthe time of the IPO at issue  here.  For clarity, we refer to\r\nthe company as \"Computervision\" throughout.\r\n\n4.  Shearson  Holdings is  the  parent company  of a  co-lead\r\nunderwriter for the IPO,  Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc.   In\r\naddition  to Shearson  Holdings and  its  affiliate, Shearson\r\nLehman Brothers  Capital  Partners II,  L.P.,  the  principal\r\nshareholders  of DR  Holdings  were J.H.  Whitney  &amp; Co.  and\r\naffiliates and  the Prudential Insurance  Company of  America\r\nand affiliates.    \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nrefinanced  the bridge loan with  $500 million in  notes.  In\r\n\nDecember  1991, interest  on the  notes was  itself converted\r\n\nfrom cash  payments to  payments \"in kind,\"  i.e., additional\r                                                             \r\n\nnotes. \r\n\n          The proceeds  from the  IPO were intended  to repay\r\n\nhalf  the principal  amount,  of the  notes held  by Shearson\r\n\nHoldings, with the rest  of the debt to Shearson  Holdings to\r\n\nbe converted to Computervision common stock or written off by\r\n\nShearson.   Both  Shearson  Holdings and  DR Holdings  signed\r\n\n\"lock-up\"  agreements, promising  not  to sell  their  equity\r\n\npositions  in  Computervision until  a  year  after the  IPO.\r\n\nPlaintiffs  posit  that Computervision's  worsening financial\r\n\ncondition5 placed Shearson  Holdings' investment in  jeopardy\r\n\nby  increasing  the  likelihood  that   Computervision  would\r\n\ndefault on  its debt to  Shearson Holdings.   Allegedly,  the\r\n\nsolution  was to take the company public and use the proceeds\r\n\nto repay a substantial  portion of the debt.   Plaintiffs say\r\n\nthat defendants believed that if Computervision was not taken\r\n\npublic  during  the  summer  of  1992,  the  opportunity  for\r\n\nShearson Holdings to recoup its investment would be lost.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  In  the  three  and  a  half  years  prior  to  the  IPO,\r\nComputervision  suffered close to  $1 billion in  losses.  In\r\n1989, its net losses were $281 million; in 1990, $71 million;\r\nin 1991, $461 million;  and for the first six months of 1992,\r\n$143  million.    Computervision's CAD/CAM  revenues  for the\r\nfirst  six  months   of  1992  decreased   by  5%  from   the\r\ncorresponding  period in  1991.   However, software  revenues\r\nfrom  the CADDS  line  increased 10%  from the  corresponding\r\nperiod in 1991.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          On   August  14,  1992,  Computervision  sold  $600\r\n\nmillion  of securities in a registered IPO.  The offering was\r\n\ncomposed of 25 million shares of  common stock at $12 a share\r\n\n(for a total of $300 million); $125 million of 10-7/8% Senior\r\n\nNotes  due   1997;  and   $175  million  of   11-3/8%  Senior\r\n\nSubordinated Notes  due 1999.   The Computervision IPO  was a\r\n\nfirm-commitment  underwriting,  in  which   the  underwriters\r\n\npurchased  the securities  from the  company and  assumed the\r\n\nrisk that the market  would not accept the securities  at the\r\n\nprice  set.   See Shaw  v. Digital  Equipment Corp.,  82 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1194,  1200 n.1 (1st  Cir. 1996).   Shearson Lehman Brothers,\r\n\nInc.,  Donaldson,  Lufkin  &amp; Jenrette  Securities  Corp., The\r\n\nFirst Boston Corp., and Hambrecht &amp; Quist, Inc., were the co-\r\n\nlead underwriters  for the domestic offering,  representing a\r\n\nsyndicate of over forty firms.\r\n\n          On   September  29,  1992,   six  weeks  after  the\r\n\noffering,  Computervision  announced  that  its  revenue  and\r\n\noperating results  for the  third quarter  of  1992 would  be\r\n\nbelow  expectations.  Within a day, the stock price fell 30%,\r\n\nto  $6.25, and  the notes  were  trading at  approximately 8%\r\n\nbelow face value. \r\n\n          On  October 22, 1992, Computervision quantified its\r\n\nresults for the  third quarter, which ended  on September 27,\r\n\n1992.   Computervision had suffered a net loss of roughly $88\r\n\nmillion,  including  a   $25  million  non-recurring   charge\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\noccasioned by  its decision to  lay off more than  11% of its\r\n\nwork force.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n        Description of Actions and Procedural History\r                                                                 \r\n\n          On September 30, 1992, one day after Computervision\r\n\nannounced that its operating results for the third quarter of\r\n\n1992 would be lower than expected, plaintiffs filed the first\r\n\nof eighteen separate complaints.  In addition to claims under\r\n\nSections 11, 12(2) and  15 of the Securities Act,  plaintiffs\r\n\nasserted  a  violation of  Section  10(b)  of the  Securities\r\n\nExchange Act of 1934 and negligent misrepresentation.\r\n\n          The  eighteen actions  were  consolidated into  one\r\n\nclass  action  and  on  June  11,  1993,  plaintiffs  filed a\r\n\nCorrected  Supplemental  Consolidated  Amended  Class  Action\r\n\nComplaint  (the  \"1993  Amended  Complaint\").6   Among  other\r\n\nthings,    the  1993   Amended  Complaint  alleged  that  the\r\n\nProspectus:  (i)  distorted Computervision's  earning trends;\r\n\n(ii) omitted disclosure of known uncertainties impacting upon\r\n\nComputervision's operating results; (iii)  omitted disclosure\r\n\nof the  increasing likelihood  that  Computervision would not\r\n\nmeet its internally projected  results for 1992; (iv) omitted\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The 1993 Amended  Complaint formally withdrew any  claims\r\nof  fraud under  section 10(b).   Nevertheless,  the district\r\ncourt ruled that the complaint sounded in fraud and that Fed.\r\nR.  Civ. P. 9(b)'s strict pleading standards applied.  See In\r                                                                         \r\nre Computervision Corp. Sec. Litig.

While the motion\r\n\nwas  under advisement,  discovery commenced.   Discovery  was\r\n\nextensive.   Plaintiffs reviewed more than  130,000 documents\r\n\nand  deposed  over   twenty  witnesses.     Plaintiffs   have\r\n\nrepresented that,  should the case be reinstated, it does not\r\n\nrequire the reopening of discovery.\r\n\n          On November 22, 1994, the district court issued its\r\n\ndecision,  dismissing  all  but   a  sliver  of  the  claims,\r\n\nprimarily on  the grounds  that  they failed  to satisfy  the\r\n\nrequirements  of  Fed.

The  stipulation was to  be\r\n\neffective  the day  after  the district  court  ruled on  the\r                                     \r\n\nmotion for leave to amend.  \r\n\n          On May 1,  1995, plaintiffs moved for leave to file\r\n\nthe  Proposed  Complaint  at  issue here.    The  court heard\r\n\nargument  on  September  13,  1995,  and  a  week  later,  on\r\n\nSeptember  20, denied  the motion  for leave  to amend.   The\r\n\nbasis for  the  denial was  futility,  in that  the  Proposed\r\n\nComplaint failed to state a  claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\r\n\nThe  court  dismissed  the  case, entered  judgment  for  the\r\n\ndefendants, and promised a full opinion.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs filed their notice of  appeal on October\r\n\n20,  1995.  Subsequently, on  February 12, 1996, the district\r\n\ncourt  issued   an  opinion  setting   forth  the   rationale\r\n\nunderlying its September 1995  order.

Pursuant to  the  parties' Rule  16.1(D) Joint  Statement\r\nfiled  December   28,  1994,  plaintiffs'   proposed  amended\r\ncomplaint and  summary judgment  motions were served  but not\r\nfiled with the court.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nthat that claim  failed because: (a)  the Prospectus had  not\r\n\nwarranted  or insured the  appropriateness of the securities'\r\n\nprices; and (b) the  claim was keyed to the  nondisclosure of\r\n\ninternal projections, which were not required to be disclosed\r\n\nin any  event.  Id. at 719-20.  The district court ruled that\r                               \r\n\nplaintiffs'  other  misrepresentation  claims,   relating  to\r\n\nbacklog and  CADDS  5,  failed because  they  were  based  on\r\n\nunreasonable inferences drawn  by reading  statements in  the\r\n\nProspectus  out of  context.8   Id. at  719-22.

Standard of Review\r                                  \r\n\n          This appeal  lies from the district  court's denial\r\n\nof  plaintiffs' motion  to  file an  amended complaint.   The\r\n\nmotion  was  denied  after   full  discovery  and  after  the\r\n\ndismissal of an earlier complaint.  The  district court ruled\r\n\nthat amendment  would be futile.  The parties disagreed then,\r\n\nas they do now,  over the proper standard for  analyzing this\r\n\nmotion  to amend.   See id. at  719.   Plaintiffs argued that\r                                       \r\n\nleave  to  amend should  be  \"freely  given when  justice  so\r\n\nrequires,\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).

Since   there   were  no   actionable   misstatements  or\r\nomissions,    the    court    held   that    the    negligent\r\nmisrepresentation  claim against  the underwriters  failed as\r\nwell.

In\r                         \r\n\nthat  context, a plaintiff's motion to amend is an attempt to\r\n\nalter  the shape  of  the case  in  order to  defeat  summary\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          Here  plaintiffs served the  motion to amend before\r                                                                         \r\n\ndefendants moved  for summary judgment.

This is  not a\r                                    \r\n\nsituation in which plaintiffs  seek amendment solely to avert\r\n\nimminent defeat.  Cf. Cowen v.

But  the main  thrust  of\r\n\nplaintiffs'  claims is  not based  on any  duty to  disclose.\r\n\nRather,  they  say  that  this is  primarily  an  affirmative\r\n\nmisrepresentation or half-truth case.\r\n\n          The Proposed  Complaint centers on  the claim  that\r\n\nComputervision affirmatively misrepresented that the offering\r\n\nprice  was set  after the  exercise of  due diligence  by the\r\n\nunderwriters, but  that in  fact the diligence  exercised was\r\n\ndeficient  in  that  the  most current  information  was  not\r\n\nconsidered.    In  addition,  plaintiffs   contend  that  the\r\n\nProspectus  omitted certain  mid-quarter information  for the\r\n\nthird quarter of 1992 and contained material misstatements or\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nomissions regarding Computervision's backlog and the state of\r\n\nits latest software product, CADDS 5. \r\n\n          The district  court held that  the Prospectus would\r\n\nnot bear the characterizations  plaintiffs sought to place on\r\n\nit, and  that the allegedly actionable \"representations\" were\r\n\nno more than unreasonable  inferences drawn by plaintiffs and\r\n\nunsupported by the surrounding  language.

Plaintiffs  argue that  the district\r\n\ncourt erred and that  they should have been allowed  to amend\r\n\ntheir complaint.\r\n\n          Defendants  respond  by asserting  that plaintiffs'\r\n\npricing claims reduce to an argument that the securities were\r\n\nmispriced  because  their  prices   fell  subsequent  to  the\r\n\nofferings, and  that the omission of  mid-quarter information\r\n\nclaims  reduce   to  nothing  more  than   an  argument  that\r\n\nComputervision   was  required   to  disclose   its  internal\r\n\nforecasts.     Plaintiffs'   position,  defendants   say,  is\r                     \r\n\nuntenable because the securities  laws impose no duty upon  a\r\n\ncompany  to either  provide  a warranty  as  to price  or  to\r\n\ndisclose  internal  projections.    They also  say  that  the\r\n\nalleged misstatements concerning backlog  and CADDS 5 are not\r\n\nactionably misleading  when considered in the  context of the\r\n\nProspectus as a whole. \r\n\n1.

Computervision had\r\n\nbeen owned by an entity, one of whose principal shareholders,\r\n\nShearson  Holdings, was  affiliated with  one of  the co-lead\r\n\nunderwriters,  Shearson Lehman  Brothers.   As a  result, the\r\n\nProspectus informed investors:\r\n\n          Under the provisions of Schedule E to the\r\n          By-laws  of  the National  Association of\r\n          Securities  Dealers Inc. (\"NASD\"),   when\r\n          NASD  members  such  as  Shearson  Lehman\r\n          Brothers   Inc.,   participate   in   the\r\n          distribution     of    an     affiliate's\r\n          securities, the public offering price can\r\n          be no  higher than that recommended  by a\r\n          \"qualified    independent    underwriter\"\r\n          meeting certain standards.\r\n\nHambrecht  &amp; Quist (for  the stock) and  Donaldson Lufkin and\r\n\nFirst Boston (for the  notes) assumed the obligations of  due\r\n\ndiligence  as   to  the  public  offering   prices,  and  the\r\n\nProspectus explicitly represented that they had done so.\r\n\n          This   representation   in   the    Prospectus   is\r\n\nsignificant in two respects.  First, the fact that one of the\r\n\nlead underwriters was affiliated with a principal shareholder\r\n\nof Computervision arguably gave  that underwriter a reason to\r\n\ninflate  the offering  prices.   Second,  the Prospectus,  in\r\n\neffect, explicitly  assured  the  members  of  the  investing\r\n\npublic that,  despite the link between  Shearson Holdings and\r\n\nShearson  Lehman  Brothers, they  had  no reason  to  fear an\r\n\ninflated price.  The  Prospectus made a selling point  out of\r\n\nthe  fact  that independent  underwriters  had  performed due\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ndiligence, set maximum prices,  and thus acted as gatekeepers\r\n\nagainst  possible misdeeds by  Shearson Holdings and Shearson\r\n\nLehman  Brothers.

Defendants argue  that the Proposed Complaint  sounds in\r\nfraud and hence  we should apply Fed. R. Civ.

Since  the Proposed\r\nComplaint  fails to  meet even  the  lower threshold  of Rule\r\n12(b)(6) in the procedural  posture in which it comes  to us,\r\nwe do not decide whether Rule 9(b) is applicable.   \r\n\n14.

Lefkowitz v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., 804 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n154, 156  (1st  Cir. 1986)  (rejecting plaintiff's  suggested\r\n\ninferences  as  insufficiently  grounded  in  fact).    Here,\r\n\nplaintiffs provide none.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs'  1993  Amended  Complaint  acknowledged\r\n\nthat  the \"Stock  Offering Price was  twice lowered  from its\r\n\ninitial $19  per share price  [as of  May 1992] to  its final\r\n\nprice of $12 per  share\" in August 1992.   Plaintiffs suggest\r\n\nthat  these  downward  adjustments  in  price  reflected  the\r\n\ndisappointing results for the second quarter of 1992, but not\r\n\nthe negative  information from the  first seven weeks  of the\r\n\nthird quarter of 1992.  However,  plaintiffs' claim that data\r\n\nfrom the first seven  weeks of the third quarter  was ignored\r\n\nboth lacks factual support and is belied by context.\r\n\n          Not  only did  Computervision and  the underwriters\r\n\nlower the initially planned stock offering price by more than\r\n\n30%, but the Prospectus abounds with warnings that the market\r\n\nprice might dip lower once trading commenced.  The Prospectus\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nexplicitly  warned  that  an  investment  in  the  securities\r\n\ninvolved  a  high degree  of  risk;  that Computervision  was\r\n\nhighly leveraged;  that it  operated in a  highly competitive\r\n\nenvironment and that  its products might  not be accepted  by\r\n\ncustomers; and that  there had been a  history of significant\r\n\nlosses  for at  least three  years.   As discussed,  price is\r\n\nessentially  a forecast  of  future earnings.   Reducing  the\r\n\nprice  from $19 to $12 showed a reduced expectation of future\r                                                               \r\n\nearnings.   Plaintiffs give us  no basis from  which to infer\r\n\nthat this  reduction in  price factored in  the disappointing\r\n\nsecond   quarter  results,   but  did  not   incorporate  the\r\n\ninformation  from   the  first  seven  weeks   of  the  third\r\n\nquarter.15    Additionally,  the cautionary  language  as  to\r\n\npotential price  drops belies plaintiffs' claim  that certain\r\n\ndisappointing third quarter information was not considered. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  Plaintiffs'  own Proposed Complaint  states that pricing\r\nmeetings were held up to August  13, 1992, the day before the\r\noffering, and that the $12 price was established at a meeting\r\non that  day.   Similarly, the  price recommendations  of the\r\nindependent underwriters were not delivered  until August 13,\r\n1992.\r\n    Plaintiffs, in  paragraphs 51 through 60  of the Proposed\r\nComplaint,  purport  to  describe the  pricing  process  that\r\nComputervision  and its  underwriters  went through.    These\r\nparagraphs mention an IPO  Plan prepared by Computervision as\r\none of the pieces  of data considered by the  underwriters in\r               \r\ntheir  due diligence  work.   The Proposed  Complaint alleges\r\nthat the IPO Plan did not fully reflect the information as to\r\nthe first seven weeks of the third quarter of 1992.  However,\r\nwe cannot  reasonably infer that the  alleged shortcomings of\r\nthe IPO  plan  (or other  company  forecasts) mean  that  the\r                                             \r\nunderwriters did not consider up-to-date information.\r                        \r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\n          Furthermore, the factual  context of the  offerings\r\n\nprovides  no support  for  the inference  plaintiffs seek  to\r\n\ndraw.   Here the offering  was conducted pursuant  to a firm-\r\n\ncommitment underwriting, in  which the underwriters  bore all\r\n\nthe initial risk that  the offering prices may have  been set\r\n\ntoo  high.16    Further,  as  part  of  the   offering,  both\r\n\nShearson Holdings  and DR  Holdings agreed  to lock up  their\r\n\nComputervision stock  holdings for  an entire year  after the\r\n\nofferings,  thereby decreasing any  incentive they would have\r\n\nhad  to inflate the short-term stock price as of the offering\r\n\ndate.\r\n\n          It  has  been  over  three years  since  the  first\r\n\ncomplaint  in this  case was filed  and plaintiffs  have been\r\n\nallowed  full   discovery.    In  this   procedural  setting,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  Although one of  the lead underwriters, Shearson  Lehman\r                             \r\nBrothers,  was  affiliated  with a  principal  shareholder of\r\nComputervision,  the offering also  involved three other lead\r                                                                         \r\nunderwriters, Donaldson Lufkin, First Boston, and Hambrecht &amp;\r                        \r\nQuist  (who also  played the  roles of  qualified independent\r\nunderwriters).

Further, the  lead underwriters\r                             \r\nrepresented a syndicate of over forty underwriters.

Thus,  the  alleged\r\n\nnondisclosures  fell neither  within the  ambit of  17 C.F.R.\r\n\n  229.303(a) or Shaw.  \r                                \r\n\n          Indeed,  of the  three alleged  nondisclosures, the\r\n\nonly  one  that  plaintiffs  compare  to  hard  data  is  the\r\n\nnondisclosure  as to  domestic bookings.    Plaintiffs assert\r\n\nthat  domestic bookings as of week seven of the third quarter\r\n\nof 1992  were lower  than the  corresponding numbers  for the\r\n\nprior  five  quarters.     But   the  Prospectus   explicitly\r\n\nrepresented that Computervision suffered  cyclical variations\r\n\nin  quarterly  results,  with  its first  and  third  quarter\r\n\nresults typically  being lower than  those of the  second and\r\n\nfourth quarters.   Given  those fluctuations, the  meaningful\r\n\ncomparison of  Computervision's  third quarter  1992  booking\r\n\nnumbers is to those of the  third quarter of 1991.  See Capri\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n21.  The    SEC    itself   distinguishes    \"forward-looking\r\ninformation\" from  \"presently  known data  which will  impact\r\nupon future operating results, such as known future increases\r\nin  the  costs of  labor or  materials.\"   Instruction  7, 17\r\nC.F.R.   229.303(a).  \r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\nOptics Profit Sharing v.

And that comparison is unavailing.22\r\n\n          As we said in Shaw, \"we reject any bright-line rule\r                                        \r\n\nthat  an issuer engaging in a public offering is obligated to\r\n\ndisclose  interim   operating  results  for  the  quarter  in\r\n\nprogress  whenever  it  perceives the  possibility  that  the\r\n\nquarter's results  may disappoint  the market.\"   82 F.3d  at\r\n\n1210.    We further  noted in  Shaw  that when  the allegedly\r                                               \r\n\nundisclosed  information  (here  only  seven  weeks into  the\r\n\nquarter   --  and   where   mid-quarter  results   were   not\r\n\nparticularly   predictive23)  is  more  remote  in  time  and\r\n\ncausation  from the  ultimate events  of which  it supposedly\r\n\nforewarns, a nondisclosure  claim becomes  \"indistinguishable\r\n\nfrom  a  claim  that  the issuer  should  have  divulged  its\r\n\ninternal predictions about what would come of the undisclosed\r\n\ninformation.\"   Id.   That  quarterly results  for  the third\r                               \r\n\nquarter  of  1992 did  in  fact  turn out  to  be  lower than\r\n\nexpected  is not enough to  produce the inference  that as of\r\n\nthe offering date Computervision had hard mid-quarter results\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n22.  The relevant numbers are  $2.5 million in domestic sales\r\nbookings as  of week seven  of the third quarter  of 1992 and\r\n$3.3 million for  the same period in 1991  -- a difference of\r\n$800,000, or less than  1% of the budgeted revenues  for that\r\nquarter.  This difference was immaterial as a matter of law.\r\n\n23.  Indeed,  the Prospectus  specifically warns  that early-\r\nquarter  results are  not  necessarily  predictive because  a\r\nsubstantial portion  of both orders  and shipments  typically\r\noccur in the last month of the quarter.\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\nthat would have predicted a material departure in the end-of-\r\n\nquarter results.24\r\n\n3.

See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1204-\r                                                       \r\n06  (describing the statutory scheme in the context of a Form\r\nS-3 shelf offering).  \r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\n($26,875,000)   to   that   entering   the   second   quarter\r\n\n($39,897,000) -- a difference of approximately $13 million or\r\n\nthirty-two percent.\r\n\n          There  is a threshold flaw in plaintiffs' argument.\r\n\nAs   Item  101(c)(1)(viii)   itself  says,   the  appropriate\r\n\ncomparison  is  not  to   the  numbers  from  an  immediately\r\n\npreceding quarter, but to those from a comparable date in the\r\n\npreceding  fiscal  year.   17  C.F.R.    229.101(c)(1)(viii).\r\n\nThis   is  particularly  true   here,  where  the  Prospectus\r\n\nspecifically  stated that Computervision tended to experience\r\n\nseasonal  declines  in  revenues   in  its  first  and  third\r\n\nquarters.    See  Capri  Optics,    950  F.2d  at  10  (where\r                                           \r\n\ndefendant's business was seasonal,  it was not meaningful for\r\n\nplaintiffs to compare results for  the quarter in question to\r\n\nthose for the immediately preceding quarter).\r\n\n          Even  if  quarter-to-next-quarter comparisons  were\r\n\nappropriate,   Computervision's   failure  to   provide  more\r\n\nspecific  information is nonetheless not actionable.  Roughly\r\n\nadjusting the numbers for seasonality, they show only a minor\r\n\ndrop  in initial  backlog  levels (as  fractions of  budgeted\r\n\nquarterly revenues) between the  second and third quarters of\r\n\n1992.26   This minor drop  of a  few percent is  not adequate\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n26.  As the  defendants point  out, plaintiffs' numbers  have\r\nmeaning only if  they are  adjusted for  seasonality.   While\r\ninitial  backlog levels for the second  and third quarters of\r\n1992   were   $39,897,000   and  $26,875,000,   respectively,\r\nComputervision's  budgeted revenues  for those  quarters were\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\nto support the  claim that the  difference in backlog  levels\r                                                      \r\n\nbetween quarters  was  material and  hence required  specific\r\n\nbacklog numbers to be disclosed.   Where a variable, although\r\n\nmaterial, is of only minor predictive value, disclosure of  a\r\n\nrough estimate of that variable's  value can obviate the need\r\n\nfor more specific disclosure.  Cf. Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1211 n.21\r                                                   \r\n\n(disclosure of a \"soft\" projection may, in some cases, render\r\n\nthe  \"hard\" information underlying  the projection immaterial\r\n\nas a matter of fact or of law).  Indeed, disclosure of only a\r\n\nrough  estimate  may  keep  investors  from  attaching  undue\r\n\nimportance to minor shifts in the variable's value and avoids\r\n\nthe  risk of  \"burying  the [investors]  in  an avalanche  of\r\n\ntrivial information.\"   San  Leandro Emergency  Medical Group\r                                                                         \r\n\nProfit Sharing Plan v.

When  the\r\ninitial  backlog levels for the two quarters are looked at as\r\nfractions of  the budgeted  revenues for those  quarters, the\r\nresult is  25% for the second quarter and 22.2% for the third\r\nquarter -- a difference of less than 3%.\r\n     The district court, in Computervision II, noted that the\r                                                         \r\nProposed Complaint calculated initial  backlog levels for the\r\nsecond and third quarters  of 1992 as a percentage  of actual\r                                                                         \r\nrevenues  (for  the second  quarter) and  forecasted revenues\r                                                                         \r\n(for  the  third  quarter),  respectively,  and  found  a  9%\r\ndifference between the two percentages.  914 F.

Nevertheless, we note\r\nthat our conclusion would not be different whether we used 3%\r\nor 9%.      \r\n\n                             -44-\r                                          44\r\r\n\n(2d  Cir. 1996)  (quoting TSC  Industries, Inc.  v.

In   sum,   plaintiffs  have   no   claim   that\r\n\nComputervision's general statement  that backlog was  usually\r\n\nlow,  without  the  disclosure   of  specific  numbers,   was\r\n\nmaterially  misleading  as  of  the  effective  date  of  the\r\n\noffering.

Plaintiffs misread the Prospectus.\r\n\n          The statement  in the Prospectus does  not say that\r\n\ninformation  on  backlog  is  insignificant   or  immaterial.\r\n\nInstead, it says that such information should not be taken as\r\n\nrepresentative.  The  statement cautions investors that  they\r\n\nshould not  take  backlog levels  as  necessarily  predicting\r\n\nresults for future periods.   In addition, there is  at least\r\n\none other statement on  the very same page of  the Prospectus\r\n\n                             -45-\r                                          45\r\r\n\nthat warns investors that  data available early in  a quarter\r\n\n(i.e., opening backlog) is not necessarily a strong predictor\r                 \r\n\nof quarterly results because:\r\n\n          a  substantial  portion of  the Company's\r\n          orders and shipments  typically occur  in\r\n          the   last   month   of   each   quarter.\r\n          Therefore  . .  .  unexpected  delays  or\r\n          actions . . . could result in significant\r\n          quarterly  fluctuations in  the Company's\r\n          operating results.\r\n\nHence, when read in context,  Computervision's statement that\r\n\nbacklog was not representative of sales was plainly a warning\r\n\nthat  investors should  not  draw too  many conclusions  from\r\n\nbacklog  figures, and not a statement that backlog itself was\r\n\nimmaterial or insignificant.\r\n\n          (iii) Shipments Within Thirty Days\r                                                        \r\n\n          Plaintiffs' final  argument on backlog is  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court  erred  in  concluding   that  the  statement\r\n\n\"shipments are generally made within thirty days of receiving\r\n\nan order\" was not materially false or misleading.  Plaintiffs\r\n\npoint  to a backlog aging  analysis from the  seventh week of\r\n\nthe  third quarter of 1992,  which indicates that  39% of the\r\n\nbacklog balance, at that time, was to be shipped in more than\r\n\nthirty  days.  The first  problem with the  argument is that,\r\n\nalthough plaintiffs attack  the word  \"generally,\" they  base\r\n\ntheir  claim solely on data  from one portion  of one quarter\r\n\nand fail to allege anything meaningful about Computervision's\r\n\ngeneral practice.  Second, even if one portion of one quarter\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\ncould  be  taken   as  representative,  plaintiffs'   factual\r\n\nallegations  would  not  support  a  misrepresentation claim.\r\n\nPlaintiffs  allege that  approximately  sixty-one percent  of\r\n\norders were shipped out in less than thirty days, six percent\r\n\nwere shipped  in between thirty  and sixty days,  and thirty-\r\n\nthree  percent   were  shipped  in  more   than  sixty  days.\r\n\nComputervision's statement said that shipments were generally\r\n\nmade  within thirty days of receiving an order, not that they\r\n\nwere always  made within thirty days.  That sixty-one percent\r\n\nof orders in one  portion of one quarter were  shipped within\r\n\nthirty days  is perfectly consistent with  the statement that\r\n\norders were generally shipped within  thirty days.  There was\r\n\nno material misrepresentation.\r\n\n4.  CADDS 5\r                       \r\n\n          Plaintiffs' final allegations  focus on  statements\r\n\nconcerning  CADDS  5,  Computervision's  then-newest  CAD/CAM\r\n\nsoftware  product  and  the  centerpiece of  the  firm's  new\r\n\nbusiness strategy.   Plaintiffs  allege  that the  Prospectus\r\n\nmade  two sets  of material  misstatements or  omissions with\r\n\nrespect to  CADDS 5: (i) the  Prospectus misrepresented that,\r\n\nas  of June 1992, CADDS  5 was a  \"successful product,\" being\r\n\nshipped  in \"volume,\"  i.e., to  thousands of  customers; and\r                                       \r\n\n(ii) the Prospectus materially overstated CADDS 5's potential\r\n\nfor  success  when,  in  fact,  the  product  was beset  with\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\nproblems.  As with the backlog claims, we affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's rejection of the CADDS 5 claims.\r\n\n          (i) Successful Product Shipping in Volume\r                                                               \r\n\n          Plaintiffs'  Proposed  Complaint  alleged that  the\r\n\n\"Prospectus[] misrepresented  CADDS 5 as a successful product\r\n\ncommercially  shipping in  volume.\"   The Proposed  Complaint\r\n\nthen  defined  \"`[v]olume  commercial  shipments'\"  as  those\r\n\n\"involving several thousand customers.\"   The language in the\r\n\nProspectus,  however,   neither  refers  to  CADDS   5  as  a\r\n\n\"successful product shipping in  volume,\" nor to shipments to\r\n\n\"several  thousand customers;\" those  descriptions are wholly\r\n\nthe plaintiffs'  own.  The  plain language of  the Prospectus\r\n\nspeaks for itself:\r\n\n          Beta testing  of  CADDS 5  (release  2.0)\r\n          commenced  in March  1992 with 24  of the\r                                                       \r\n          Company's  largest  CADDS  customers  and\r                                                          \r\n          early  introduction  sales  commenced  in\r\n          April  1992.    Commercial  shipments  of\r\n          CADDS 5 (release 2.0)  began in June 1992\r\n          and as of June  28, 1992, Release 2.0 had\r                                                               \r\n          been  shipped  to 32  customers (emphasis\r                                                     \r\n\n          added).\r\n\nFar from  alluding to thousands of  customers, the Prospectus\r\n\nspecified the  number of  customers to  whom the product  had\r                     \r\n\nbeen shipped  -- 24 in the  beta testing stage and  32 in the\r\n\ncommercial shipping stage.   Plaintiffs' assertion that  this\r\n\nprecise statement can be interpreted as implying that CADDS 5\r\n\nwas  being shipped, or was ready to be shipped, to thousands,\r\n\nis baseless.\r\n\n                             -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\n          Further, the Prospectus  was replete with  language\r\n\ncautioning  investors that  the  market in  general (i.e.,  a\r                                                                     \r\n\nlarge  volume of customers) had  not accepted CADDS  5 as yet\r\n\nand that the  product might need  further enhancements.   For\r\n\nexample,  the Prospectus stated  that although Computervision\r\n\nhoped to replace its \"declining hardware revenues and margins\r\n\nwith sales  of higher margin CAD/CAM  software products . . .\r\n\n[n]o  assurance  can  be  given  that  the  Company  will  be\r                                                                         \r\n\nsuccessful in achieving this objective\" (emphasis added).

Dataproducts\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp., 976 F.2d 497, 502 (9th Cir. 1992).\r                 \r\n\n          A  duty  to  disclose  technical  or  developmental\r\n\nproblems  with  a product  may  arise where  a  company makes\r\n\nstrongly optimistic or concrete statements about that product\r\n\nthat  are in  stark contrast  to its  internal reports.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nSerabian, 24 F.3d at  363-65 (sustaining Section 10(b) claims\r                    \r\n\nwhere there  was a  \"contrast between what  company officials\r\n\nwere  hearing  internally  . . .  and what  the  company  was\r\n\ntelling the public at the same time\" (emphasis in original)).\r                                               \r\n\nBut,  in this  case,  the statements  about  CADDS 5  in  the\r\n\nProspectus  were  not  so  optimistic  as  to  be  materially\r\n\nmisleading about the existence of developmental or commercial\r\n\n                             -50-\r                                          50\r\r\n\ndifficulties with CADDS 5.   To the contrary,  the Prospectus\r\n\nfrequently  alludes to the  uncertainties associated with the\r\n\nrelease of a new product.     The  key statements  identified\r\n\nby the  plaintiffs are  that Computervision expected  CADDS 5\r\n\n\"to broaden the  number of customers in  existing accounts as\r\n\nwell  as attract  new  customers,\"  and that  \"Computervision\r\n\nbelieves  that CADDS 4X and CADDS 5  are likely to be used in\r\n\ntandem by major accounts in  the foreseeable future.\"   These\r\n\nstatements, whether  read in isolation  or in the  context of\r\n\nComputervision's numerous warnings that  CADDS 5 might not be\r\n\naccepted   by   the    market   and   might    need   further\r\n\nenhancements,27  suggest,  at most,  the  hope  that CADDS  5\r\n\nwill eventually gain acceptance  in the market.  Such  a hope\r\n\nis not  unusual for a company  releasing a new product.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nVeriFone I,  784 F.

Computervision's statements did  not rise\r\n\nto  the level of optimism  or certainty that  would make them\r\n\nmaterially misleading in the absence of disclosure of initial\r\n\ndevelopmental problems the product was  facing.

Six weeks later, on September 29, 1992, Computervision announced that its revenues and operating results for the third quarter of 1992 would be lower than expected.  The prices of Computervision's stock and notes fell sharply.  On the day after this announcement, the first investor suit was filed.  Computervision and the IPO underwriters were sued under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\").  The investors also sued Computervision's principal officers and directors, alleging controlling person liability under Section 15 of the Securities Act.  Plaintiffs asserted that they represented the class of investors who purchased common stock or notes between August 14, 1992 and September 29, 1992.  The district court, after lengthy pre-trial proceedings and full discovery, both dismissed the case for failure to state a claim and denied as futile plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.  See In re Computervision Corp. Secs.  Litig.

They say the Proposed Complaint adequately alleged violations of the securities laws in that the Prospectus<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for the IPO contained actionable misrepresentations, \"half-truths\" or omissions regarding:  (1) the factors considered in determining the prices for the offerings;  (2) certain mid-quarter information for the third quarter of 1992;  (3) the importance of Computervision's low backlog;  (4) the latest release of Computervision's key new software product, CADDS 5, which Computervision said it was commercially shipping when (plaintiffs say) it was not;  and (5) the development and commercial prospects of CADDS 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm, although our reasoning as to the first claim differs from that of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Computervision is a leading supplier of work station-based computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (\"CAD/CAM\") software and related services to the mechanical design automation market.  Its software products are utilized in the design of complex parts and assemblies for the automotive, aerospace, and other mechanical industries.  Its products enable users to reduce the time required for designing, engineering and manufacturing a product before market introduction.  This \"time-to-market\" is a key factor in ensuring profitability and competitiveness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company was organized in 1972 under the name Prime Computer, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Until 1988, Prime was in the business of making and selling computer systems.  In 1988, Prime acquired Computervision Corporation, a leading supplier of CAD/CAM hardware and software products.  In 1989, the company was acquired by DR Holdings, and shifted its focus from computer systems to the CAD/CAM market.  A principal shareholder of DR Holdings, Shearson Holdings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> provided the company with a $500 million bridge loan in connection with the acquisition.  That bridge loan was intended to be repaid with the proceeds from a high-yield bond offering.  However, that offering never occurred and Computervision instead refinanced the bridge loan with $500 million in notes.  In December 1991, interest on the notes was itself converted from cash payments to payments \"in kind,\" i.e., additional notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proceeds from the IPO were intended to repay half the principal amount, of the notes held by Shearson Holdings, with the rest of the debt to Shearson Holdings to be converted to Computervision common stock or written off by Shearson.  Both Shearson Holdings and DR Holdings signed \"lock-up\" agreements, promising not to sell their equity positions in Computervision until a year after the IPO.  Plaintiffs posit that Computervision's worsening financial condition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> placed Shearson Holdings' investment in jeopardy by increasing the likelihood that Computervision would default on its debt to Shearson Holdings.  Allegedly, the solution was to take the company public and use the proceeds to repay a substantial portion of the debt.  Plaintiffs say that defendants believed that if Computervision was not taken public during the summer of 1992, the opportunity for Shearson Holdings to recoup its investment would be lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 14, 1992, Computervision sold $600 million of securities in a registered IPO.  The offering was composed of 25 million shares of common stock at $12 a share (for a total of $300 million);  $125 million of 10-7/8% Senior Notes due 1997;  and $175 million of 11-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 1999.  The Computervision IPO was a firm-commitment underwriting, in which the underwriters purchased the securities from the company and assumed the risk that the market would not accept the securities at the price set.  See Shaw v. Digital Equipment Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1200 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996).  Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., The First Boston Corp., and Hambrecht &amp; Quist, Inc., were the co-lead underwriters for the domestic offering, representing a syndicate of over forty firms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1992, six weeks after the offering, Computervision announced that its revenue and operating results for the third quarter of 1992 would be below expectations.  Within a day, the stock price fell 30%, to $6.25, and the notes were trading at approximately 8% below face value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, 1992, Computervision quantified its results for the third quarter, which ended on September 27, 1992.  Computervision had suffered a net loss of roughly $88 million, including a $25 million non-recurring charge occasioned by its decision to lay off more than 11% of its work force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Description of Actions and Procedural History</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1992, one day after Computervision announced that its operating results for the third quarter of 1992 would be lower than expected, plaintiffs filed the first of eighteen separate complaints.  In addition to claims under Sections 11, 12(2) and 15 of the Securities Act, plaintiffs asserted a violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The eighteen actions were consolidated into one class action and on June 11, 1993, plaintiffs filed a Corrected Supplemental Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the \"1993 Amended Complaint\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Among other things, the 1993 Amended Complaint alleged that the Prospectus:  (i) distorted Computervision's earning trends;  (ii) omitted disclosure of known uncertainties impacting upon Computervision's operating results;  (iii) omitted disclosure of the increasing likelihood that Computervision would not meet its internally projected results for 1992;  (iv) omitted disclosure of known declines in the demand for Computervision's services and products;  and (v) omitted disclosure of software development problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 23, 1993, the district court heard argument on defendants' motion to dismiss.  While the motion was under advisement, discovery commenced.  Discovery was extensive.  Plaintiffs reviewed more than 130,000 documents and deposed over twenty witnesses.  Plaintiffs have represented that, should the case be reinstated, it does not require the reopening of discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1994, the district court issued its decision, dismissing all but a sliver of the claims, primarily on the grounds that they failed to satisfy the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and 9(b).  See Computervision I, 869 F.Supp. at 64.   The district court noted that the Prospectus warned investors of the risks involved and that, with one exception, the alleged misrepresentations were made in a context that adequately \"bespoke caution.\"  Id. at 60-61.   As to the omissions, the court noted that these, in large part, referred either to information that was effectively disclosed, or to information for which there was no duty to disclose.  Id. at 62-63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1995, plaintiffs served a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.  Defendants served their opposition to that motion on February 24, 1995 and moved for summary judgment on the sole allegation surviving the district court's 1994 decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The parties then entered into a Stipulation of Dismissal, dismissing, with prejudice, the surviving claim.  The stipulation was to be effective the day after the district court ruled on the motion for leave to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 1995, plaintiffs moved for leave to file the Proposed Complaint at issue here.  The court heard argument on September 13, 1995, and a week later, on September 20, denied the motion for leave to amend.  The basis for the denial was futility, in that the Proposed Complaint failed to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  The court dismissed the case, entered judgment for the defendants, and promised a full opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal on October 20, 1995.  Subsequently, on February 12, 1996, the district court issued an opinion setting forth the rationale underlying its September 1995 order.  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 717-22.   The one claim that had given the district court pause at oral argument was the allegation that the Prospectus had misrepresented that the securities were \"appropriately\" priced.  The district court nevertheless ruled that that claim failed because:  (a) the Prospectus had not warranted or insured the appropriateness of the securities' prices;  and (b) the claim was keyed to the nondisclosure of internal projections, which were not required to be disclosed in any event.  Id. at 719-20.   The district court ruled that plaintiffs' other misrepresentation claims, relating to backlog and CADDS 5, failed because they were based on unreasonable inferences drawn by reading statements in the Prospectus out of context.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Id. at 719-22.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal lies from the district court's denial of plaintiffs' motion to file an amended complaint.  The motion was denied after full discovery and after the dismissal of an earlier complaint.  The district court ruled that amendment would be futile.  The parties disagreed then, as they do now, over the proper standard for analyzing this motion to amend.  See id. at 719.   Plaintiffs argued that leave to amend should be \"freely given when justice so requires,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 719.   Defendants embraced the more stringent \"substantial and convincing evidence\" standard set forth in Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir.1994).  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 719.   The district court did not decide the issue, finding the question academic \"as the plaintiffs cannot maintain this action under either standard.\"  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 719.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denial of a motion to file an amended complaint is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 880 (1st Cir.1991);  see also Arazie v. Mullane, 2 F.3d 1456, 1464-65 (7th Cir.1993) (noting, however, that the relevant pleading standards must be kept in mind when applying the abuse of discretion standard).  Rule 15(a) provides that \"leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"   Unless there appears to be an adequate reason for the denial of leave to amend (e.g., undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, futility of amendment, prejudice), we will not affirm it.  Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was no finding that plaintiffs acted in bad faith, or in an effort to prolong litigation.  Nor was there a finding that defendants would have been prejudiced by the amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Ward Electronics Serv., Inc. v. First Commercial Bank, 819 F.2d 496, 496-97 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the dismissal rested on other grounds.  The district court's order explicitly states:  \"the motion to further amend the complaint is denied as futile.\"  \"Futility\" means that the complaint, as amended, would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  See 3 Moore's Federal Practice p 15.08, at 15-80 (2d ed.1993);  see also Vargas v. McNamara, 608 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1979).  In reviewing for \"futility,\" the district court applies the same standard of legal sufficiency as applies to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  3 Moore's, p 15.08, at 15-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gold standard, which requires that proposed amendments have substantial merit and be supported by substantial and convincing evidence, is inapplicable for several reasons.  To date, it has only been applied where the motion to amend is made after a defendant has moved for summary judgment.  See e.g., Gold, 30 F.3d at 253;  Torres-Matos v. St. Lawrence Garment Co., 901 F.2d 1144, 1146 (1st Cir.1990);  Cowen v. Bank United of Texas, FSB, 1995 WL 38978, at * 9 (N.D.Ill.), aff'd 70 F.3d 937 (7th Cir.1995);  Carey v. Beans, 500 F.Supp. 580, 582 (E.D.Pa.1980), aff'd, 659 F.2d 1065 (3d Cir.1981);  Artman v. International Harvester Co., 355 F.Supp. 476, 481 (W.D.Pa.1972).  In that context, a plaintiff's motion to amend is an attempt to alter the shape of the case in order to defeat summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here plaintiffs served the motion to amend before defendants moved for summary judgment.  Further, the claims in the summary judgment motion were dropped by agreement of the parties and, as a result, no summary judgment motion was pending when the district court considered the motion to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Gold apply by analogy.  This is not a situation in which plaintiffs seek amendment solely to avert imminent defeat.  Cf. Cowen v. Bank United of Texas, FSB, 70 F.3d 937, 944 (7th Cir.1995).  Nor is this a situation in which it is rational to presume that defendants would be prejudiced by amendment.  Cf. Carey, 500 F.Supp. at 582 (calling prejudice to non-movant the \" 'touchstone for the denial of the amendment' \") (quoting Cornell &amp; Co. v. OSHRC, 573 F.2d 820, 823 (3d Cir.1978)).  Although, under these circumstances, plaintiffs could be guilty of undue delay or prejudice to defendants might exist, the district court made no such finding.  Further, the district court did not rely on Gold and its reasoning was almost purely a legal futility analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we look at whether the district court correctly determined that the Proposed Complaint failed to meet the pleading standards of Rule 12(b)(6).  There is no practical difference, in terms of review, between a denial of a motion to amend based on futility and the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  See Motorcity of Jacksonville, Ltd. v. Southeast Bank, 83 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.1996);  see also Keweenaw Bay Indian Community v. Michigan, 11 F.3d 1341, 1348 (6th Cir.1993).  Review is de novo.  See, e.g., Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir.1994) (motions to dismiss are reviewed de novo ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Securities Law Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Sections 11 and 12(2) are enforcement mechanisms for the mandatory disclosure requirements of the Securities Act.\"  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1201.   Section 11 imposes liability on signers of a registration statement and on underwriters, among others, if the registration statement \"contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77k(a).  Section 12(2) provides that any person who \"offers or sells\" a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication that contains a materially false statement or that \"omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading\" shall be liable to any \"person purchasing such security from him.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77l(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we said in Shaw, there is a strong affirmative duty of disclosure in the context of a public offering.  82 F.3d at 1202.   The same may be even more emphatically true in an initial public offering, where the securities have not before been publicly traded.  Cf. Marcel Kahan, Securities Laws and the Social Costs of \"Inaccurate\" Stock Prices, 41 Duke L.J. 977, 1014-15 (1992).  But the main thrust of plaintiffs' claims is not based on any duty to disclose.  Rather, they say that this is primarily an affirmative misrepresentation or half-truth case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Proposed Complaint centers on the claim that Computervision affirmatively misrepresented that the offering price was set after the exercise of due diligence by the underwriters, but that in fact the diligence exercised was deficient in that the most current information was not considered.  In addition, plaintiffs contend that the Prospectus omitted certain mid-quarter information for the third quarter of 1992 and contained material misstatements or omissions regarding Computervision's backlog and the state of its latest software product, CADDS 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the Prospectus would not bear the characterizations plaintiffs sought to place on it, and that the allegedly actionable \"representations\" were no more than unreasonable inferences drawn by plaintiffs and unsupported by the surrounding language.  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 719.   Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred and that they should have been allowed to amend their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants respond by asserting that plaintiffs' pricing claims reduce to an argument that the securities were mispriced because their prices fell subsequent to the offerings, and that the omission of mid-quarter information claims reduce to nothing more than an argument that Computervision was required to disclose its internal forecasts.   Plaintiffs' position, defendants say, is untenable because the securities laws impose no duty upon a company to either provide a warranty as to price or to disclose internal projections.  They also say that the alleged misstatements concerning backlog and CADDS 5 are not actionably misleading when considered in the context of the Prospectus as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Pricing/Due Diligence Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Computervision IPO was unusual in one respect which has bearing on plaintiffs' claims.  Computervision had been owned by an entity, one of whose principal shareholders, Shearson Holdings, was affiliated with one of the co-lead underwriters, Shearson Lehman Brothers.  As a result, the Prospectus informed investors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Under the provisions of Schedule E to the By-laws of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc.  (\"NASD\"), when NASD members such as Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., participate in the distribution of an affiliate's securities, the public offering price can be no higher than that recommended by a \"qualified independent underwriter\" meeting certain standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hambrecht &amp; Quist (for the stock) and Donaldson Lufkin and First Boston (for the notes) assumed the obligations of due diligence as to the public offering prices, and the Prospectus explicitly represented that they had done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This representation in the Prospectus is significant in two respects.  First, the fact that one of the lead underwriters was affiliated with a principal shareholder of Computervision arguably gave that underwriter a reason to inflate the offering prices.  Second, the Prospectus, in effect, explicitly assured the members of the investing public that, despite the link between Shearson Holdings and Shearson Lehman Brothers, they had no reason to fear an inflated price.  The Prospectus made a selling point out of the fact that independent underwriters had performed due diligence, set maximum prices, and thus acted as gatekeepers against possible misdeeds by Shearson Holdings and Shearson Lehman Brothers.

Coffee, Re-Engineering Corporate Disclosure:  The Coming Debate Over Company Registration, 52 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 1143, 1168 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) The Pricing Claims in the Proposed Complaint</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Prospectus described the process by which Computervision and its underwriters arrived at prices for the offering:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>Prior to the Share Offerings there has been no public market for the Common Stock.  The initial public offering price was determined by negotiation among the Company, the Representatives and the Lead Managers.

The price of the Notes was also too high, causing their yields to be too low.  The Stock Prospectus stated that among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were \"estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the Company.\"   By the time of the Offerings, however, those estimates were no longer valid.   As of the date of the Offerings, the Company's revenues, bookings, visibility and backlog were all substantially below the plan prepared by Computervision and reviewed by the underwriters in connection with their due diligence and pricing for the Offerings (the \"IPO Plan\"), as well as the Company's other internal plans and forecasts (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The Stock Prospectus represented that the initial public offering price for the Stock was based upon, among other things, \"estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the Company....\" The Prospectuses also stated that \"qualified independent underwriters\" had recommended the initial public offering price for the Shares and the yields on the Notes.  Those formal, written recommendations were based on factors including \"estimates of the business potential of the company\" and on the \"economic, market, financial and other conditions\" as they existed on August 13, 1992, the day before the effective date of the Offerings.  Contrary to the representations in the Prospectuses, the price of the Shares and the yields on the Notes did not properly reflect the business potential, earnings prospects or financial condition of Computervision as of that date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Different claims, which require different analyses, appear to be asserted in these paragraphs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) District Court's Characterization of the Pricing Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dismissing the action, the district court characterized plaintiffs' claim as being that the prices set for the securities were inappropriate.

Price can be characterized as a present value calculation of the firm's future streams of earnings or dividends.  See In re VeriFone Secs.  Litig. (\"VeriFone I \"), 784 F.Supp. 1471, 1479 (N.D.Cal.1992) (\"securities prices on national exchanges reflect ... the expected future cash flows from the security\"), aff'd, 11 F.3d 865 (9th Cir.1993);  Richard A. Brealey and Stewart C. Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance, 61-63 (4th ed.1991);  cf. Niagara Hudson Power Corp. v. Leventritt, 340 U.S. 336, 339 &amp; n. 7, 71 S.Ct. 341, 343 &amp; n. 7, 95 L.Ed. 319 (1951) (approving the SEC's valuation of warrants in terms of current expectations of future events);  Pommer v.

See In re VeriFone Secs.  Litig. (\"VeriFone II \"), 11 F.3d 865, 871 (9th Cir.1993) (earnings forecasts made on reasonable basis not actionable);  Wielgos, 892 F.2d at 518;  Marx v. Computer Sciences Corp., 507 F.2d 485, 489-90 (9th Cir.1974).  Forecasts are not guarantees of, or insurance policies for, a firm's future performance, nor are they understood as such by reasonable investors.  Kowal v. MCI Communications Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C.Cir.1994);  Raab v. General Physics Corp., 4 F.3d 286, 290 (4th Cir.1993).  Hence, to the extent plaintiffs' \"price\" claim rests on either the fact that the initial offering prices fell shortly after the offering or the fact that Computervision's third quarter earnings turned out to be worse than expected, it fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Cf. Pommer, 961 F.2d at 623 (\"[S]ecurities laws approach matters from an ex ante perspective.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) Plaintiffs' Characterization of the Pricing Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, however, argue that their attack is not on the appropriateness of the offering prices themselves.  Instead, they assert that their claim before the district court was that the Prospectus materially misrepresented that:  (a) certain types of information were considered by the underwriters and Computervision in determining prices for the offering, when, in fact, the most current information of those types was not considered (or, if considered, was ignored);  and (b) the underwriters did due diligence in estimating the prices, when they did not because they did not consider the most current information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, the explicit statements in the Prospectus that certain factors were considered and that due diligence was done are required by law to be true as of the effective date of the offering.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77k(a) (liability attaches for misstatements in a prospectus at the time such part becomes effective);  see also 3A Harold S. Bloomenthal, Securities and Federal Corporate Law &#167; 8.23, at 8-102 (1993) (\"[T]he prospectus for purposes of section 11 speaks as of the date the registration statement becomes effective.\").  Thus, plaintiffs assert that, to the extent current information up to the date of the offering was not incorporated into the prices, the statements in the Prospectus presented a misleading half-truth because they suggested that the underwriters and Computervision took into consideration current estimates of business potential and earnings prospects.  Cf. Virginia Bankshares v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1098, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 2761, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991) (literally accurate statement deceptive because only a half-truth).  As a general matter, we agree that such a theory, if sufficiently supported, could make out a viable legal claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be asked whether the alleged misstatements are actionable, given that they were made in the context of offering prices, which as noted, are essentially forecasts of future earnings.  While forecasts are not actionable merely because they do not come true, they may be actionable to the extent they are not reasonably based on, or are inconsistent with, the facts at the time the forecast is made.  See Kowal, 16 F.3d at 1278;  cf. Virginia Bankshares, 501 U.S. at 1093-94, 111 S.Ct. at 2758-59 (board of directors' statement that merger price was \"fair\" was actionable to the extent it was not based on, or was inconsistent with, existing and available facts);  Serabian, 24 F.3d at 361 (\"predictions about the future that prove to be off the mark likewise are immunized unless plaintiffs meet their burden of demonstrating intentional deception\");  Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 776 (3d Cir.)  (prediction violates securities laws if it is made without a genuine belief or reasonable basis), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 946, 106 S.Ct. 342, 88 L.Ed.2d 290 (1985);  Billard v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 683 F.2d 51, 56-57 (2d Cir.1982) (\"Although the fairness of the offering price is not a valid basis for an action under Sections 10(b) and 14(e) ..., a statement that experts have examined the price and certified it as fair may well be a material misrepresentation if those experts have advised the offeror that the price is unfair.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The types of data which the plaintiffs allege should have been considered are, in general terms, within the realm of data relevant to the determination of price.  The alleged misstatement as to factors that were considered, as of the effective date of the offering, lists the following factors:  (i) the company's historical performance;  (ii) estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the company;  and (iii) market prices of, and financial and operating data concerning, comparable companies with publicly traded equity securities.  This list of factors is, in effect, a laundry list of general factors that would likely be considered in any reasonable estimation of price.  Cf. Lucian Arye Bebchuk and Marcel Kahan, Fairness Opinions:  How Fair Are They And What Can Be Done About It, 1989 Duke L.J. 27, 34-35 (1989) (listing methods of estimating fair price);  cf. generally Ronald J. Gilson and Reinier H. Kraakman, The Mechanisms of Market Efficiency, 70 Va.  L.Rev. 549 (1984) (describing the types of information that are incorporated into securities prices).  Therefore, if the defendants did not actually consider current information in the broad categories of data they claimed to have looked at, it is possible that plaintiffs would have a reasonable basis claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The due diligence claim also comes down to one that the setting of the price was done without a reasonable basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The statement in the Prospectus that the independent underwriters conducted due diligence was an affirmative statement that a reasonable investigation of the company was done and that, using that and other relevant information, a fair price was estimated.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 77k(b)(3) (due diligence defense under Section 11 requires \"reasonable investigation\") &amp; 77l(2) (due diligence under Section 12 defined as \"exercise of reasonable care\");  Software Toolworks, 50 F.3d at 621 (9th Cir.1994) (noting that the two articulations of due diligence are \"similar,\" if not identical).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law on due diligence is sparse, but for our purposes it makes clear that certain inactions may constitute a failure to perform due diligence.  First, a failure to continue to investigate the company up to the effective date of the offering is likely to be a failure to do due diligence.  See Software Toolworks, 50 F.3d at 625 &amp; n. 2 (intra-quarterly information available before the effective date of offering not taken into account by underwriters);   Escott v. BarChris Constr.  Corp., 283 F.Supp. 643, 690 (S.D.N.Y.1968) (where registration statement became effective on May 16, 1961, attorney did not make reasonable investigation where he failed to discover that statements made in January had become inaccurate by May);  see also 3A Bloomenthal, Securities and Federal Corporate Law &#167; 8.23, at 8-102-03.  Second, it also may be a failure of due diligence to rely solely on management representations as to the state of the company where those representations can reasonably be verified.  See Software Toolworks, 50 F.3d at 625-26 (inadequate for underwriters to rely on company's assurances as to its financial condition where underwriters had access to all available information);  BarChris, 283 F.Supp. at 696-97 (\"underwriters must make some reasonable attempt to verify the data submitted to them\").  Notwithstanding these generalities, the specifics of plaintiffs' factual claims must be scrutinized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iv) Rule 12(b)(6)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next and dispositive question is whether there are sufficient factual allegations as to plaintiffs' theory in the Proposed Complaint for it to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  We are mindful that the case comes to us after over three years of litigation and full discovery.  We thus look more closely at the factual allegations to see if they support the legal conclusions pled.  As this court said in Resolution Trust Corp. v.

But [plaintiff's] complaint against [defendant] is deficient;  this litigation has persisted for almost two years;  and yet even now [plaintiff] is unable to explain what exactly [defendant] did that is wrongful....

See Software Toolworks, 50 F.3d at 625-26 &amp; n. 2.   However, it is plaintiffs' responsibility to plead factual allegations, not hypotheticals, sufficient to reasonably allow the inference that the defendants actually did not consider the up-to-date data as of the offering date.  Cf. Lefkowitz v. Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., 804 F.2d 154, 156 (1st Cir.1986) (rejecting plaintiff's suggested inferences as insufficiently grounded in fact).  Here, plaintiffs provide none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' 1993 Amended Complaint acknowledged that the \"Stock Offering Price was twice lowered from its initial $19 per share price [as of May 1992] to its final price of $12 per share\" in August 1992.  Plaintiffs suggest that these downward adjustments in price reflected the disappointing results for the second quarter of 1992, but not the negative information from the first seven weeks of the third quarter of 1992.  However, plaintiffs' claim that data from the first seven weeks of the third quarter was ignored both lacks factual support and is belied by context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did Computervision and the underwriters lower the initially planned stock offering price by more than 30%, but the Prospectus abounds with warnings that the market price might dip lower once trading commenced.  The Prospectus explicitly warned that an investment in the securities involved a high degree of risk;  that Computervision was highly leveraged;  that it operated in a highly competitive environment and that its products might not be accepted by customers;  and that there had been a history of significant losses for at least three years.  As discussed, price is essentially a forecast of future earnings.  Reducing the price from $19 to $12 showed a reduced expectation of future earnings.  Plaintiffs give us no basis from which to infer that this reduction in price factored in the disappointing second quarter results, but did not incorporate the information from the first seven weeks of the third quarter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Additionally, the cautionary language as to potential price drops belies plaintiffs' claim that certain disappointing third quarter information was not considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the factual context of the offerings provides no support for the inference plaintiffs seek to draw.  Here the offering was conducted pursuant to a firm-commitment underwriting, in which the underwriters bore all the initial risk that the offering prices may have been set too high.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Further, as part of the offering, both Shearson Holdings and DR Holdings agreed to lock up their Computervision stock holdings for an entire year after the offerings, thereby decreasing any incentive they would have had to inflate the short-term stock price as of the offering date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been over three years since the first complaint in this case was filed and plaintiffs have been allowed full discovery.  In this procedural setting, plaintiffs' bald and factually unsupported hypothesis that the underwriters failed to obtain and use up-to-date information is not, standing alone, sufficient.  Cf. Driscoll, 985 F.2d at 48 (dismissal proper where after almost two years of litigation plaintiffs' complaint contained no factual allegations to support its legal conclusions);  Gooley, 851 F.2d at 515 (if, \"despite multiple opportunities to finetune the complaint, a naked conclusion, unanchored in any meaningful set of factual averments\" is the asserted basis for relief, dismissal may follow);  Dewey, 694 F.2d at 3-4 (dismissal proper where plaintiff, despite having eight months to make original complaint more specific, was not able to \"fill in the gaps\" in a \"skeletal set of bland allegations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, all the Proposed Complaint alleges is that, by the close of trading on September 30, 1992, the prices of Computervision's securities fell because of an announcement on September 29 that third quarter earnings were going to be lower than expected.  However, the assertion that the future fell below projections is not enough in itself to render the projection actionable.  See Kowal, 16 F.3d at 1278 (failure to meet performance projections \"supports no inference\" that projection lacked a reasonable basis when made);  cf. Virginia Bankshares, 501 U.S. at 1092-94, 111 S.Ct. at 2758-59 (describing the type of hard, contemporaneous facts that could show a statement about the adequacy of price to be false).  A ruling to the contrary would magnify the risk of nuisance litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  The district court was justified in viewing the Proposed Complaint's pricing claims as no more than an attempt to seek a warranty of the accuracy of price, and therefore as insufficient.  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 720.  Rule 12(b)(6) may set a low threshold, but it is real.  Gooley, 851 F.2d at 514.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Mid-Quarter Information</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs assert that, as of week seven of the third quarter of 1992, the following intra-quarterly information was known, and should have been disclosed:  (i) third quarter domestic bookings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> were only about 24% of Computervision's internal forecasts for those weeks, and significantly below bookings at comparable points in the past five quarters;  (ii) Computervision's international sales were also short of internal forecasts;  and (iii) Computervision had a shortfall of $40 million in visible<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> orders from its internal forecasts and IPO Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But alleged deviations from internal forecasts, without more, do not produce a duty to disclose in the Prospectus.  We recognize that investors may find information about a firm's internal projections and forecasts to be important.  See Frank H. Easterbrook and Daniel R. Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 305 (1991);  cf. Virginia Bankshares, 501 U.S. at 1090-91, 111 S.Ct. at 2757 (statement of opinion by a board of directors can be materially significant because investors know that directors usually have knowledge and expertise far exceeding that of the normal investor).  Nonetheless, the federal securities laws focus on the mandatory disclosure of backward-looking hard information, not forecasts.  See Easterbrook and Fischel, Corporate Law, at 305-06.  A firm has the option to disclose its internal projections, but is not required to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  See In re Lyondell Petrochemical Co. Secs.  Litig., 984 F.2d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.1993);  In re Convergent Technologies Secs.  Litig., 948 F.2d 507, 516 (9th Cir.1991) (as amended on denial of rehearing en banc);  see also Arazie, 2 F.3d at 1468;  Wielgos, 892 F.2d at 516.  \"The federal securities laws impose no obligation upon an issuer to disclose forward-looking information such as internal projections, estimates of future performance, forecasts, budgets, and similar data.\"  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1209.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' nondisclosure claims fail because they base their allegations solely on discrepancies between actual (but undisclosed) intra-quarterly information and Computervision's undisclosed internal projections.  Cf. VeriFone I, 784 F.Supp. at 1484 (in order to assert a valid claim under the securities laws, plaintiffs must \"establish a link between a misleading statement or implication in the prospectus and an actual fact, not a speculation about the future, omitted from the document\").  The mere fact that intra-quarterly results lagged behind internal projections does not, without more, require disclosure.  See In re Worlds of Wonder Secs.  Litig., 35 F.3d 1407, 1419 (9th Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 185, 133 L.Ed.2d 123 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs try to buttress their claims by referring to SEC Regulation S-K, Item 303, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a)(3)(ii) which requires that \"known trends and uncertainties\" about results of operations be disclosed in the management's discussion and analysis section of certain SEC filings.  This rule, however, has to be read in light of the SEC's instruction to this paragraph which expressly states that forward-looking information need not be disclosed.  17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a), Instruction 7;  VeriFone II, 11 F.3d at 870;  Lyondell, 984 F.2d at 1053.   Given this context, the phrase \"known trends and uncertainties\" has to be understood as referring to those trends discernible from hard information alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  Here, unlike in Shaw, the undisclosed hard information pled did not indicate a \"substantial likelihood that the quarter would turn out to be an extreme departure from publicly known trends and uncertainties.\"  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1194.   Thus, the alleged nondisclosures fell neither within the ambit of 17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a) or Shaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, of the three alleged nondisclosures, the only one that plaintiffs compare to hard data is the nondisclosure as to domestic bookings.  Plaintiffs assert that domestic bookings as of week seven of the third quarter of 1992 were lower than the corresponding numbers for the prior five quarters.  But the Prospectus explicitly represented that Computervision suffered cyclical variations in quarterly results, with its first and third quarter results typically being lower than those of the second and fourth quarters.  Given those fluctuations, the meaningful comparison of Computervision's third quarter 1992 booking numbers is to those of the third quarter of 1991.  See Capri Optics Profit Sharing v.  Digital Equip.  Corp., 950 F.2d 5, 10 (1st Cir.1991).  And that comparison is unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we said in Shaw, \"we reject any bright-line rule that an issuer engaging in a public offering is obligated to disclose interim operating results for the quarter in progress whenever it perceives the possibility that the quarter's results may disappoint the market.\"  82 F.3d at 1210.   We further noted in Shaw that when the allegedly undisclosed information (here only seven weeks into the quarter--and where mid-quarter results were not particularly predictive<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>) is more remote in time and causation from the ultimate events of which it supposedly forewarns, a nondisclosure claim becomes \"indistinguishable from a claim that the issuer should have divulged its internal predictions about what would come of the undisclosed information.\"  Id.  That quarterly results for the third quarter of 1992 did in fact turn out to be lower than expected is not enough to produce the inference that as of the offering date Computervision had hard mid-quarter results that would have predicted a material departure in the end-of-quarter results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Backlog</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs separately allege that the Prospectus contained three material misstatements and omissions relating to backlog.  One paragraph of the Prospectus is the subject of these claims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>Shipments are generally made within 30 days of receiving an order.   In light of the short time between order and shipment of the Company's products, the Company generally has relatively little backlog at any given date, and the Company does not believe that backlog is representative of potential sales for any future period (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs say that:  (i) Computervision was required to, but failed to disclose the dollar amount of backlog orders;  (ii) Computervision misrepresented that backlog data was not significant to its results;  and (iii) the statement, \"shipments are generally made within 30 days of receiving an order,\" was false.  \"Backlog\" is the dollar amount, on any given day, of orders received for which product has not yet been shipped.  We address these claims in turn and find no error in the district court's rejection of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Dollar Amounts of Backlog</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Item 101 of Regulation S-K requires that a prospectus disclose \"to the extent material, ... [t]he dollar amount of backlog orders believed to be firm, as of a recent date and as of a comparable date in the preceding fiscal year.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.101(c)(1)(viii) (emphasis added).  Information is material when there is a reasonable likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1219;  Wielgos, 892 F.2d at 517.   The Prospectus disclosed that backlog levels were usually low.  But, plaintiffs argue that that disclosure was not enough.  They argue that the specific backlog numbers were material and hence required to be disclosed.  This is so, they say, because backlog entering the third quarter of 1992 was unusually low.  Plaintiffs support their argument by comparing the backlog entering the third quarter of 1992 ($26,875,000) to that entering the second quarter ($39,897,000)--a difference of approximately $13 million or thirty-two percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a threshold flaw in plaintiffs' argument.  As Item 101(c)(1)(viii) itself says, the appropriate comparison is not to the numbers from an immediately preceding quarter, but to those from a comparable date in the preceding fiscal year.  17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.101(c)(1)(viii).  This is particularly true here, where the Prospectus specifically stated that Computervision tended to experience seasonal declines in revenues in its first and third quarters.  See Capri Optics, 950 F.2d at 10 (where defendant's business was seasonal, it was not meaningful for plaintiffs to compare results for the quarter in question to those for the immediately preceding quarter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if quarter-to-next-quarter comparisons were appropriate, Computervision's failure to provide more specific information is nonetheless not actionable.  Roughly adjusting the numbers for seasonality, they show only a minor drop in initial backlog levels (as fractions of budgeted quarterly revenues) between the second and third quarters of 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  This minor drop of a few percent is not adequate to support the claim that the difference in backlog levels between quarters was material and hence required specific backlog numbers to be disclosed.  Where a variable, although material, is of only minor predictive value, disclosure of a rough estimate of that variable's value can obviate the need for more specific disclosure.  Cf. Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1211 n. 21 (disclosure of a \"soft\" projection may, in some cases, render the \"hard\" information underlying the projection immaterial as a matter of fact or of law).  Indeed, disclosure of only a rough estimate may keep investors from attaching undue importance to minor shifts in the variable's value and avoids the risk of \"burying the [investors] in an avalanche of trivial information.\"  San Leandro Emergency Medical Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos., 75 F.3d 801, 810 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 448, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 2132, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976));  Convergent, 948 F.2d at 516 (same).  In sum, plaintiffs have no claim that Computervision's general statement that backlog was usually low, without the disclosure of specific numbers, was materially misleading as of the effective date of the offering.  Worlds of Wonder, 35 F.3d at 1419;  cf. Backman v. Polaroid Corp., 910 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1990) (en banc) (\"Disclosing that Polavision was being sold below cost was not [materially] misleading by reason of not saying how much below.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Immateriality of Backlog</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that the Prospectus, in stating that \"the Company does not believe that backlog is representative of potential sales for any future period,\" in effect falsely suggested that backlog was not significant to Computervision's results.  Plaintiffs misread the Prospectus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement in the Prospectus does not say that information on backlog is insignificant or immaterial.  Instead, it says that such information should not be taken as representative.  The statement cautions investors that they should not take backlog levels as necessarily predicting results for future periods.  In addition, there is at least one other statement on the very same page of the Prospectus that warns investors that data available early in a quarter (i.e., opening backlog) is not necessarily a strong predictor of quarterly results because:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>a substantial portion of the Company's orders and shipments typically occur in the last month of each quarter.  Therefore ... unexpected delays or actions ... could result in significant quarterly fluctuations in the Company's operating results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, when read in context, Computervision's statement that backlog was not representative of sales was plainly a warning that investors should not draw too many conclusions from backlog figures, and not a statement that backlog itself was immaterial or insignificant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) Shipments Within Thirty Days</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' final argument on backlog is that the district court erred in concluding that the statement \"shipments are generally made within thirty days of receiving an order\" was not materially false or misleading.  Plaintiffs point to a backlog aging analysis from the seventh week of the third quarter of 1992, which indicates that 39% of the backlog balance, at that time, was to be shipped in more than thirty days.  The first problem with the argument is that, although plaintiffs attack the word \"generally,\" they base their claim solely on data from one portion of one quarter and fail to allege anything meaningful about Computervision's general practice.  Second, even if one portion of one quarter could be taken as representative, plaintiffs' factual allegations would not support a misrepresentation claim.  Plaintiffs allege that approximately sixty-one percent of orders were shipped out in less than thirty days, six percent were shipped in between thirty and sixty days, and thirty-three percent were shipped in more than sixty days.  Computervision's statement said that shipments were generally made within thirty days of receiving an order, not that they were always made within thirty days.  That sixty-one percent of orders in one portion of one quarter were shipped within thirty days is perfectly consistent with the statement that orders were generally shipped within thirty days.  There was no material misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. CADDS 5</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' final allegations focus on statements concerning CADDS 5, Computervision's then-newest CAD/CAM software product and the centerpiece of the firm's new business strategy.  Plaintiffs allege that the Prospectus made two sets of material misstatements or omissions with respect to CADDS 5:  (i) the Prospectus misrepresented that, as of June 1992, CADDS 5 was a \"successful product,\" being shipped in \"volume,\" i.e., to thousands of customers;  and (ii) the Prospectus materially overstated CADDS 5's potential for success when, in fact, the product was beset with problems.  As with the backlog claims, we affirm the district court's rejection of the CADDS 5 claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Successful Product Shipping in Volume</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' Proposed Complaint alleged that the \"Prospectus[ ] misrepresented CADDS 5 as a successful product commercially shipping in volume.\"   The Proposed Complaint then defined \" '[v]olume commercial shipments' \" as those \"involving several thousand customers.\"   The language in the Prospectus, however, neither refers to CADDS 5 as a \"successful product shipping in volume,\" nor to shipments to \"several thousand customers\"; those descriptions are wholly the plaintiffs' own.  The plain language of the Prospectus speaks for itself:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>Beta testing of CADDS 5 (release 2.0) commenced in March 1992 with 24 of the Company's largest CADDS customers and early introduction sales commenced in April 1992.  Commercial shipments of CADDS 5 (release 2.0) began in June 1992 and as of June 28, 1992, Release 2.0 had been shipped to 32 customers.  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from alluding to thousands of customers, the Prospectus specified the number of customers to whom the product had been shipped--24 in the beta testing stage and 32 in the commercial shipping stage.  Plaintiffs' assertion that this precise statement can be interpreted as implying that CADDS 5 was being shipped, or was ready to be shipped, to thousands, is baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Prospectus was replete with language cautioning investors that the market in general (i.e., a large volume of customers) had not accepted CADDS 5 as yet and that the product might need further enhancements.  For example, the Prospectus stated that although Computervision hoped to replace its \"declining hardware revenues and margins with sales of higher margin CAD/CAM software products ... [n]o assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in achieving this objective.\"  (emphasis added).  In addition, the Prospectus warned that \"customer acceptance of CADDS 5 is critical \" to continued customer purchase of Computervision's existing software product, CADDS 4X, that the \"delayed release of CADDS 5 (Release 2.0) resulted in customers delaying product purchases \" and that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>the CAD/CAM industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions and product enhancements....  There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products ... [or] that new customers will change to the Company's new products even if they are judged to be superior.  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Computervision's statement that it had commercially shipped CADDS 5 software to 32 customers must be viewed in the context of the Prospectus' numerous cautionary statements that CADDS 5 might never be accepted by the market.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1213 (if a statement is couched in cautionary language that disclaims the drawing of a particular inference, a claim that the statement was materially misleading may fail as a matter of law).  The context confirms that any possible misleading inference that might be drawn from Computervision's statement is properly deemed immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Misleading Optimistic Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' final claim is that certain optimistic statements in the Prospectus regarding the development and commercial prospects of CADDS 5 were materially misleading in light of Computervision's alleged nondisclosure of problems the product was facing.  See, e.g., Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 502 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A duty to disclose technical or developmental problems with a product may arise where a company makes strongly optimistic or concrete statements about that product that are in stark contrast to its internal reports.  Cf. Serabian, 24 F.3d at 363-65 (sustaining Section 10(b) claims where there was a \"contrast between what company officials were hearing internally ... and what the company was telling the public at the same time \" (emphasis in original)).  But, in this case, the statements about CADDS 5 in the Prospectus were not so optimistic as to be materially misleading about the existence of developmental or commercial difficulties with CADDS 5. To the contrary, the Prospectus frequently alludes to the uncertainties associated with the release of a new product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key statements identified by the plaintiffs are that Computervision expected CADDS 5 \"to broaden the number of customers in existing accounts as well as attract new customers,\" and that \"Computervision believes that CADDS 4X and CADDS 5 are likely to be used in tandem by major accounts in the foreseeable future.\"   These statements, whether read in isolation or in the context of Computervision's numerous warnings that CADDS 5 might not be accepted by the market and might need further enhancements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> suggest, at most, the hope that CADDS 5 will eventually gain acceptance in the market.  Such a hope is not unusual for a company releasing a new product.  Cf. VeriFone I, 784 F.Supp. at 1484 (\"securities laws presume that skilled investors are aware that a corporation's performance with a new product ... is unlikely to replicate past successes\").  Computervision's statements did not rise to the level of optimism or certainty that would make them materially misleading in the absence of disclosure of initial developmental problems the product was facing.  Cf. Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1219 n. 33 (cautiously optimistic statements, expressing at most a hope for a positive future, do not trigger a duty to update);  San Leandro, 75 F.3d at 811 (subdued generally optimistic statements constituted nothing more than puffery and were not actionable);  In re Time Warner Inc. Secs.  Litig., 9 F.3d 259, 267 (2d Cir.1993) (statements at issue lacked \"definite positive projections\" of the sort that would require later correction), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1397, 128 L.Ed.2d 70 (1994).  Further, the statements here are markedly less enthusiastic than the statements that other courts have found actionable.  See Hanon, 976 F.2d at 501-02 (company's press release stated that new product had received \"strong interest and high acclaim from users and analysts alike\" and its special features were \"rapidly making [it] ... one of the most popular in [the company's] line\");  In re Apple Computer Secs.  Litig., 886 F.2d 1109, 1118-19 (9th Cir.1989) (company executives stated that new computer product would be \"phenomenally successful the first year out of the chute\" and would make company's \"growth before this look small\"), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 943, 110 S.Ct. 3229, 110 L.Ed.2d 676 (1990).  Computervision's mild statements of hope, couched in strongly cautionary language, cannot be said to have become materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The term \"Prospectus\" will be used throughout although there were two prospectuses, one for stock and one for notes.

In particular, at the time of the Offerings, Computervision's U.S. sales were materially below sales at comparable points in the prior five quarters.  Both U.S. and international sales were substantially below the Company's plans.  In addition, Computervision had a $40 million shortfall in visible orders needed to reach its quarterly budget.  The Underwriters failed to perform adequate due diligence on Computervision's actual revenues, sales, orders, bookings and visibility for the seven weeks during the Third Quarter before the Offerings.  The Underwriters were required to but did not obtain information necessary to verify the Company's false statements that such results were \"more or less where they were expected to be.\"   To the extent the Underwriters obtained any information from the Company concerning these results, the Stock and Notes were mispriced because the initial offering price and the yields, as well as Underwriters' recommendations, did not take into account these low levels of sales and the $40 million order shortfall.   Therefore, the representation in the Stock prospectus that the offering price was based upon \"estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the Company\" was false and misleading, as were the representations in the Prospectuses concerning the recommendations of the qualified independent underwriters.  (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p>The Underwriters failed to perform adequate due diligence on the Company's actual sales, orders, bookings, visibility and backlog for the first seven weeks of the Third Quarter before the Offerings.  The Underwriters were required to but either failed to obtain and review or ignored information about actual sales, orders, bookings, visibility and backlog necessary to verify the Company's statements that they were more or less on track.

Second, the Prospectus cautioned investors as to the possibility that no market for the securities would develop or be sustained after the offering.  These cautionary statements in the Prospectus are, in and of themselves, reason to find this claim not actionable.

The Proposed Complaint alleges that the IPO Plan did not fully reflect the information as to the first seven weeks of the third quarter of 1992.

Six weeks later, on September 29, 1992, Computervision announced that its revenues and operating results for the third quarter of 1992 would be lower than expected.  The prices of Computervision's stock and notes fell sharply.  On the day after this announcement, the first investor suit was filed.  Computervision and the IPO underwriters were sued under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\").  The investors also sued Computervision's principal officers and directors, alleging controlling person liability under Section 15 of the Securities Act.  Plaintiffs asserted that they represented the class of investors who purchased common stock or notes between August 14, 1992 and September 29, 1992.  The district court, after lengthy pre-trial proceedings and full discovery, both dismissed the case for failure to state a claim and denied as futile plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.

They say the Proposed Complaint adequately alleged violations of the securities laws in that the Prospectus<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for the IPO contained actionable misrepresentations, \"half-truths\" or omissions regarding:  (1) the factors considered in determining the prices for the offerings;  (2) certain mid-quarter information for the third quarter of 1992;  (3) the importance of Computervision's low backlog;  (4) the latest release of Computervision's key new software product, CADDS 5, which Computervision said it was commercially shipping when (plaintiffs say) it was not;  and (5) the development and commercial prospects of CADDS 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm, although our reasoning as to the first claim differs from that of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Computervision is a leading supplier of work station-based computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (\"CAD/CAM\") software and related services to the mechanical design automation market.  Its software products are utilized in the design of complex parts and assemblies for the automotive, aerospace, and other mechanical industries.  Its products enable users to reduce the time required for designing, engineering and manufacturing a product before market introduction.  This \"time-to-market\" is a key factor in ensuring profitability and competitiveness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company was organized in 1972 under the name Prime Computer, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Until 1988, Prime was in the business of making and selling computer systems.  In 1988, Prime acquired Computervision Corporation, a leading supplier of CAD/CAM hardware and software products.  In 1989, the company was acquired by DR Holdings, and shifted its focus from computer systems to the CAD/CAM market.  A principal shareholder of DR Holdings, Shearson Holdings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> provided the company with a $500 million bridge loan in connection with the acquisition.  That bridge loan was intended to be repaid with the proceeds from a high-yield bond offering.  However, that offering never occurred and Computervision instead refinanced the bridge loan with $500 million in notes.  In December 1991, interest on the notes was itself converted from cash payments to payments \"in kind,\" i.e., additional notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proceeds from the IPO were intended to repay half the principal amount, of the notes held by Shearson Holdings, with the rest of the debt to Shearson Holdings to be converted to Computervision common stock or written off by Shearson.  Both Shearson Holdings and DR Holdings signed \"lock-up\" agreements, promising not to sell their equity positions in Computervision until a year after the IPO.  Plaintiffs posit that Computervision's worsening financial condition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> placed Shearson Holdings' investment in jeopardy by increasing the likelihood that Computervision would default on its debt to Shearson Holdings.  Allegedly, the solution was to take the company public and use the proceeds to repay a substantial portion of the debt.  Plaintiffs say that defendants believed that if Computervision was not taken public during the summer of 1992, the opportunity for Shearson Holdings to recoup its investment would be lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 14, 1992, Computervision sold $600 million of securities in a registered IPO.  The offering was composed of 25 million shares of common stock at $12 a share (for a total of $300 million);  $125 million of 10-7/8% Senior Notes due 1997;  and $175 million of 11-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 1999.  The Computervision IPO was a firm-commitment underwriting, in which the underwriters purchased the securities from the company and assumed the risk that the market would not accept the securities at the price set.  See Shaw v. Digital Equipment Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196753\"><a href=\"/opinion/196753/shaw-v-digital/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1200 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996).  Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., The First Boston Corp., and Hambrecht &amp; Quist, Inc., were the co-lead underwriters for the domestic offering, representing a syndicate of over forty firms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1992, six weeks after the offering, Computervision announced that its revenue and operating results for the third quarter of 1992 would be below expectations.  Within a day, the stock price fell 30%, to $6.25, and the notes were trading at approximately 8% below face value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, 1992, Computervision quantified its results for the third quarter, which ended on September 27, 1992.  Computervision had suffered a net loss of roughly $88 million, including a $25 million non-recurring charge occasioned by its decision to lay off more than 11% of its work force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Description of Actions and Procedural History</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1992, one day after Computervision announced that its operating results for the third quarter of 1992 would be lower than expected, plaintiffs filed the first of eighteen separate complaints.  In addition to claims under Sections 11, 12(2) and 15 of the Securities Act, plaintiffs asserted a violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The eighteen actions were consolidated into one class action and on June 11, 1993, plaintiffs filed a Corrected Supplemental Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the \"1993 Amended Complaint\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Among other things, the 1993 Amended Complaint alleged that the Prospectus:  (i) distorted Computervision's earning trends;  (ii) omitted disclosure of known uncertainties impacting upon Computervision's operating results;  (iii) omitted disclosure of the increasing likelihood that Computervision would not meet its internally projected results for 1992;  (iv) omitted disclosure of known declines in the demand for Computervision's services and products;  and (v) omitted disclosure of software development problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 23, 1993, the district court heard argument on defendants' motion to dismiss.  While the motion was under advisement, discovery commenced.  Discovery was extensive.  Plaintiffs reviewed more than 130,000 documents and deposed over twenty witnesses.  Plaintiffs have represented that, should the case be reinstated, it does not require the reopening of discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1994, the district court issued its decision, dismissing all but a sliver of the claims, primarily on the grounds that they failed to satisfy the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and 9(b).  See Computervision I, 869 F.Supp. at 64.   The district court noted that the Prospectus warned investors of the risks involved and that, with one exception, the alleged misrepresentations were made in a context that adequately \"bespoke caution.\"  Id. at 60-61.   As to the omissions, the court noted that these, in large part, referred either to information that was effectively disclosed, or to information for which there was no duty to disclose.  Id. at 62-63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1995, plaintiffs served a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.  Defendants served their opposition to that motion on February 24, 1995 and moved for summary judgment on the sole allegation surviving the district court's 1994 decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The parties then entered into a Stipulation of Dismissal, dismissing, with prejudice, the surviving claim.  The stipulation was to be effective the day after the district court ruled on the motion for leave to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 1995, plaintiffs moved for leave to file the Proposed Complaint at issue here.  The court heard argument on September 13, 1995, and a week later, on September 20, denied the motion for leave to amend.  The basis for the denial was futility, in that the Proposed Complaint failed to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  The court dismissed the case, entered judgment for the defendants, and promised a full opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal on October 20, 1995.  Subsequently, on February 12, 1996, the district court issued an opinion setting forth the rationale underlying its September 1995 order.  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 717-22.   The one claim that had given the district court pause at oral argument was the allegation that the Prospectus had misrepresented that the securities were \"appropriately\" priced.  The district court nevertheless ruled that that claim failed because:  (a) the Prospectus had not warranted or insured the appropriateness of the securities' prices;  and (b) the claim was keyed to the nondisclosure of internal projections, which were not required to be disclosed in any event.  Id. at 719-20.   The district court ruled that plaintiffs' other misrepresentation claims, relating to backlog and CADDS 5, failed because they were based on unreasonable inferences drawn by reading statements in the Prospectus out of context.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Id. at 719-22.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal lies from the district court's denial of plaintiffs' motion to file an amended complaint.  The motion was denied after full discovery and after the dismissal of an earlier complaint.  The district court ruled that amendment would be futile.  The parties disagreed then, as they do now, over the proper standard for analyzing this motion to amend.  See id. at 719.   Plaintiffs argued that leave to amend should be \"freely given when justice so requires,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 719.   Defendants embraced the more stringent \"substantial and convincing evidence\" standard set forth in Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195523\"><a href=\"/opinion/195523/resolution-v-gold/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 253 (1st Cir.1994).  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 719.   The district court did not decide the issue, finding the question academic \"as the plaintiffs cannot maintain this action under either standard.\"  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 719.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denial of a motion to file an amended complaint is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558579\"><a href=\"/opinion/558579/richard-romani-v-shearson-lehman-hutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span>, 880 (1st Cir.1991);  see also Arazie v.

Rule 15(a) provides that \"leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"   Unless there appears to be an adequate reason for the denial of leave to amend (e.g., undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, futility of amendment, prejudice), we will not affirm it.  Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was no finding that plaintiffs acted in bad faith, or in an effort to prolong litigation.  Nor was there a finding that defendants would have been prejudiced by the amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See Ward Electronics Serv., Inc. v. First Commercial Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488752\"><a href=\"/opinion/488752/ward-electronics-service-inc-v-first-commercial-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 496-97 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the dismissal rested on other grounds.  The district court's order explicitly states:  \"the motion to further amend the complaint is denied as futile.\"  \"Futility\" means that the complaint, as amended, would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  See 3 Moore's Federal Practice p 15.08, at 15-80 (2d ed.1993);  see also Vargas v. McNamara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371007\"><a href=\"/opinion/371007/harold-vargas-v-robert-c-mcnamara-iii-v-sidmar-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1979).  In reviewing for \"futility,\" the district court applies the same standard of legal sufficiency as applies to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  3 Moore's, p 15.08, at 15-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gold standard, which requires that proposed amendments have substantial merit and be supported by substantial and convincing evidence, is inapplicable for several reasons.  To date, it has only been applied where the motion to amend is made after a defendant has moved for summary judgment.  See e.g., Gold, 30 F.3d at 253;  Torres-Matos v. St. Lawrence Garment Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540330\"><a href=\"/opinion/540330/ines-torres-matos-v-st-lawrence-garment-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></a></span>, 1146 (1st Cir.1990);  Cowen v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 481 (W.D.Pa.1972).  In that context, a plaintiff's motion to amend is an attempt to alter the shape of the case in order to defeat summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here plaintiffs served the motion to amend before defendants moved for summary judgment.  Further, the claims in the summary judgment motion were dropped by agreement of the parties and, as a result, no summary judgment motion was pending when the district court considered the motion to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Gold apply by analogy.  This is not a situation in which plaintiffs seek amendment solely to avert imminent defeat.  Cf. Cowen v. Bank United of Texas, FSB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708195\"><a href=\"/opinion/708195/linwood-cowen-and-jean-cowen-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-all-others/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span>, 944 (7th Cir.1995).  Nor is this a situation in which it is rational to presume that defendants would be prejudiced by amendment.  Cf. Carey, 500 F.Supp. at 582 (calling prejudice to non-movant the \" 'touchstone for the denial of the amendment' \") (quoting Cornell &amp; Co. v. OSHRC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354330\"><a href=\"/opinion/354330/6-osh-casbna-1436-1978-oshd-cch-p-22646-cornell-and-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, 823 (3d Cir.1978)).  Although, under these circumstances, plaintiffs could be guilty of undue delay or prejudice to defendants might exist, the district court made no such finding.  Further, the district court did not rely on Gold and its reasoning was almost purely a legal futility analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we look at whether the district court correctly determined that the Proposed Complaint failed to meet the pleading standards of Rule 12(b)(6).  There is no practical difference, in terms of review, between a denial of a motion to amend based on futility and the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  See Motorcity of Jacksonville, Ltd. v. Southeast Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718300\"><a href=\"/opinion/718300/motorcity-of-jacksonville-ltd-a-limited-partnership-by-and-through-its/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1317</span></a></span>, 1323 (11th Cir.1996);  see also Keweenaw Bay Indian Community v.

Securities Law Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Sections 11 and 12(2) are enforcement mechanisms for the mandatory disclosure requirements of the Securities Act.\"  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1201.   Section 11 imposes liability on signers of a registration statement and on underwriters, among others, if the registration statement \"contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77k(a).  Section 12(2) provides that any person who \"offers or sells\" a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication that contains a materially false statement or that \"omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading\" shall be liable to any \"person purchasing such security from him.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77l(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we said in Shaw, there is a strong affirmative duty of disclosure in the context of a public offering.  82 F.3d at 1202.   The same may be even more emphatically true in an initial public offering, where the securities have not before been publicly traded.  Cf. Marcel Kahan, Securities Laws and the Social Costs of \"Inaccurate\" Stock Prices, 41 Duke L.J. 977, 1014-15 (1992).  But the main thrust of plaintiffs' claims is not based on any duty to disclose.  Rather, they say that this is primarily an affirmative misrepresentation or half-truth case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Proposed Complaint centers on the claim that Computervision affirmatively misrepresented that the offering price was set after the exercise of due diligence by the underwriters, but that in fact the diligence exercised was deficient in that the most current information was not considered.  In addition, plaintiffs contend that the Prospectus omitted certain mid-quarter information for the third quarter of 1992 and contained material misstatements or omissions regarding Computervision's backlog and the state of its latest software product, CADDS 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the Prospectus would not bear the characterizations plaintiffs sought to place on it, and that the allegedly actionable \"representations\" were no more than unreasonable inferences drawn by plaintiffs and unsupported by the surrounding language.  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 719.   Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred and that they should have been allowed to amend their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants respond by asserting that plaintiffs' pricing claims reduce to an argument that the securities were mispriced because their prices fell subsequent to the offerings, and that the omission of mid-quarter information claims reduce to nothing more than an argument that Computervision was required to disclose its internal forecasts.   Plaintiffs' position, defendants say, is untenable because the securities laws impose no duty upon a company to either provide a warranty as to price or to disclose internal projections.  They also say that the alleged misstatements concerning backlog and CADDS 5 are not actionably misleading when considered in the context of the Prospectus as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Pricing/Due Diligence Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Computervision IPO was unusual in one respect which has bearing on plaintiffs' claims.  Computervision had been owned by an entity, one of whose principal shareholders, Shearson Holdings, was affiliated with one of the co-lead underwriters, Shearson Lehman Brothers.

First, the fact that one of the lead underwriters was affiliated with a principal shareholder of Computervision arguably gave that underwriter a reason to inflate the offering prices.  Second, the Prospectus, in effect, explicitly assured the members of the investing public that, despite the link between Shearson Holdings and Shearson Lehman Brothers, they had no reason to fear an inflated price.  The Prospectus made a selling point out of the fact that independent underwriters had performed due diligence, set maximum prices, and thus acted as gatekeepers against possible misdeeds by Shearson Holdings and Shearson Lehman Brothers.

Those formal, written recommendations were based on factors including \"estimates of the business potential of the company\" and on the \"economic, market, financial and other conditions\" as they existed on August 13, 1992, the day before the effective date of the Offerings.

Hence, to the extent plaintiffs' \"price\" claim rests on either the fact that the initial offering prices fell shortly after the offering or the fact that Computervision's third quarter earnings turned out to be worse than expected, it fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Cf.

Instead, they assert that their claim before the district court was that the Prospectus materially misrepresented that:  (a) certain types of information were considered by the underwriters and Computervision in determining prices for the offering, when, in fact, the most current information of those types was not considered (or, if considered, was ignored);  and (b) the underwriters did due diligence in estimating the prices, when they did not because they did not consider the most current information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, the explicit statements in the Prospectus that certain factors were considered and that due diligence was done are required by law to be true as of the effective date of the offering.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77k(a) (liability attaches for misstatements in a prospectus at the time such part becomes effective);  see also 3A Harold S. Bloomenthal, Securities and Federal Corporate Law &#167; 8.23, at 8-102 (1993) (\"[T]he prospectus for purposes of section 11 speaks as of the date the registration statement becomes effective.\").  Thus, plaintiffs assert that, to the extent current information up to the date of the offering was not incorporated into the prices, the statements in the Prospectus presented a misleading half-truth because they suggested that the underwriters and Computervision took into consideration current estimates of business potential and earnings prospects.

The alleged misstatement as to factors that were considered, as of the effective date of the offering, lists the following factors:  (i) the company's historical performance;  (ii) estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the company;  and (iii) market prices of, and financial and operating data concerning, comparable companies with publicly traded equity securities.  This list of factors is, in effect, a laundry list of general factors that would likely be considered in any reasonable estimation of price.  Cf. Lucian Arye Bebchuk and Marcel Kahan, Fairness Opinions:  How Fair Are They And What Can Be Done About It, 1989 Duke L.J. 27, 34-35 (1989) (listing methods of estimating fair price);  cf. generally Ronald J. Gilson and Reinier H. Kraakman, The Mechanisms of Market Efficiency, 70 Va.  L.Rev. 549 (1984) (describing the types of information that are incorporated into securities prices).  Therefore, if the defendants did not actually consider current information in the broad categories of data they claimed to have looked at, it is possible that plaintiffs would have a reasonable basis claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The due diligence claim also comes down to one that the setting of the price was done without a reasonable basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The statement in the Prospectus that the independent underwriters conducted due diligence was an affirmative statement that a reasonable investigation of the company was done and that, using that and other relevant information, a fair price was estimated.

Second, it also may be a failure of due diligence to rely solely on management representations as to the state of the company where those representations can reasonably be verified.

However, it is plaintiffs' responsibility to plead factual allegations, not hypotheticals, sufficient to reasonably allow the inference that the defendants actually did not consider the up-to-date data as of the offering date.

Plaintiffs suggest that these downward adjustments in price reflected the disappointing results for the second quarter of 1992, but not the negative information from the first seven weeks of the third quarter of 1992.  However, plaintiffs' claim that data from the first seven weeks of the third quarter was ignored both lacks factual support and is belied by context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did Computervision and the underwriters lower the initially planned stock offering price by more than 30%, but the Prospectus abounds with warnings that the market price might dip lower once trading commenced.  The Prospectus explicitly warned that an investment in the securities involved a high degree of risk;  that Computervision was highly leveraged;  that it operated in a highly competitive environment and that its products might not be accepted by customers;  and that there had been a history of significant losses for at least three years.  As discussed, price is essentially a forecast of future earnings.  Reducing the price from $19 to $12 showed a reduced expectation of future earnings.  Plaintiffs give us no basis from which to infer that this reduction in price factored in the disappointing second quarter results, but did not incorporate the information from the first seven weeks of the third quarter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Additionally, the cautionary language as to potential price drops belies plaintiffs' claim that certain disappointing third quarter information was not considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the factual context of the offerings provides no support for the inference plaintiffs seek to draw.  Here the offering was conducted pursuant to a firm-commitment underwriting, in which the underwriters bore all the initial risk that the offering prices may have been set too high.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Further, as part of the offering, both Shearson Holdings and DR Holdings agreed to lock up their Computervision stock holdings for an entire year after the offerings, thereby decreasing any incentive they would have had to inflate the short-term stock price as of the offering date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been over three years since the first complaint in this case was filed and plaintiffs have been allowed full discovery.  In this procedural setting, plaintiffs' bald and factually unsupported hypothesis that the underwriters failed to obtain and use up-to-date information is not, standing alone, sufficient.  Cf. Driscoll, 985 F.2d at 48 (dismissal proper where after almost two years of litigation plaintiffs' complaint contained no factual allegations to support its legal conclusions);  Gooley, 851 F.2d at 515 (if, \"despite multiple opportunities to finetune the complaint, a naked conclusion, unanchored in any meaningful set of factual averments\" is the asserted basis for relief, dismissal may follow);  Dewey, 694 F.2d at 3-4 (dismissal proper where plaintiff, despite having eight months to make original complaint more specific, was not able to \"fill in the gaps\" in a \"skeletal set of bland allegations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, all the Proposed Complaint alleges is that, by the close of trading on September 30, 1992, the prices of Computervision's securities fell because of an announcement on September 29 that third quarter earnings were going to be lower than expected.  However, the assertion that the future fell below projections is not enough in itself to render the projection actionable.  See Kowal, 16 F.3d at 1278 (failure to meet performance projections \"supports no inference\" that projection lacked a reasonable basis when made);  cf. Virginia Bankshares, 501 U.S. at 1092-94, 111 S.Ct. at 2758-59 (describing the type of hard, contemporaneous facts that could show a statement about the adequacy of price to be false).  A ruling to the contrary would magnify the risk of nuisance litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  The district court was justified in viewing the Proposed Complaint's pricing claims as no more than an attempt to seek a warranty of the accuracy of price, and therefore as insufficient.  Computervision II, 914 F.Supp. at 720.  Rule 12(b)(6) may set a low threshold, but it is real.  Gooley, 851 F.2d at 514.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Mid-Quarter Information</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs assert that, as of week seven of the third quarter of 1992, the following intra-quarterly information was known, and should have been disclosed:  (i) third quarter domestic bookings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> were only about 24% of Computervision's internal forecasts for those weeks, and significantly below bookings at comparable points in the past five quarters;  (ii) Computervision's international sales were also short of internal forecasts;  and (iii) Computervision had a shortfall of $40 million in visible<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> orders from its internal forecasts and IPO Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But alleged deviations from internal forecasts, without more, do not produce a duty to disclose in the Prospectus.  We recognize that investors may find information about a firm's internal projections and forecasts to be important.  See Frank H. Easterbrook and Daniel R. Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 305 (1991);  cf. Virginia Bankshares, 501 U.S. at 1090-91, 111 S.Ct. at 2757 (statement of opinion by a board of directors can be materially significant because investors know that directors usually have knowledge and expertise far exceeding that of the normal investor).  Nonetheless, the federal securities laws focus on the mandatory disclosure of backward-looking hard information, not forecasts.  See Easterbrook and Fischel, Corporate Law, at 305-06.  A firm has the option to disclose its internal projections, but is not required to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  See In re Lyondell Petrochemical Co. Secs.

Cf. VeriFone I, 784 F.Supp. at 1484 (in order to assert a valid claim under the securities laws, plaintiffs must \"establish a link between a misleading statement or implication in the prospectus and an actual fact, not a speculation about the future, omitted from the document\").  The mere fact that intra-quarterly results lagged behind internal projections does not, without more, require disclosure.  See In re Worlds of Wonder Secs.

This rule, however, has to be read in light of the SEC's instruction to this paragraph which expressly states that forward-looking information need not be disclosed.  17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a), Instruction 7;  VeriFone II, 11 F.3d at 870;  Lyondell, 984 F.2d at 1053.   Given this context, the phrase \"known trends and uncertainties\" has to be understood as referring to those trends discernible from hard information alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  Here, unlike in Shaw, the undisclosed hard information pled did not indicate a \"substantial likelihood that the quarter would turn out to be an extreme departure from publicly known trends and uncertainties.\"  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1194.   Thus, the alleged nondisclosures fell neither within the ambit of 17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a) or Shaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, of the three alleged nondisclosures, the only one that plaintiffs compare to hard data is the nondisclosure as to domestic bookings.  Plaintiffs assert that domestic bookings as of week seven of the third quarter of 1992 were lower than the corresponding numbers for the prior five quarters.  But the Prospectus explicitly represented that Computervision suffered cyclical variations in quarterly results, with its first and third quarter results typically being lower than those of the second and fourth quarters.  Given those fluctuations, the meaningful comparison of Computervision's third quarter 1992 booking numbers is to those of the third quarter of 1991.  See Capri Optics Profit Sharing v.  Digital Equip.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572651\"><a href=\"/opinion/572651/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96415-capri-optics-profit-sharing-v-digital-equipment/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1991).

We further noted in Shaw that when the allegedly undisclosed information (here only seven weeks into the quarter--and where mid-quarter results were not particularly predictive<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>) is more remote in time and causation from the ultimate events of which it supposedly forewarns, a nondisclosure claim becomes \"indistinguishable from a claim that the issuer should have divulged its internal predictions about what would come of the undisclosed information.\"  Id.  That quarterly results for the third quarter of 1992 did in fact turn out to be lower than expected is not enough to produce the inference that as of the offering date Computervision had hard mid-quarter results that would have predicted a material departure in the end-of-quarter results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Backlog</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs separately allege that the Prospectus contained three material misstatements and omissions relating to backlog.  One paragraph of the Prospectus is the subject of these claims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>Shipments are generally made within 30 days of receiving an order.   In light of the short time between order and shipment of the Company's products, the Company generally has relatively little backlog at any given date, and the Company does not believe that backlog is representative of potential sales for any future period (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs say that:  (i) Computervision was required to, but failed to disclose the dollar amount of backlog orders;  (ii) Computervision misrepresented that backlog data was not significant to its results;  and (iii) the statement, \"shipments are generally made within 30 days of receiving an order,\" was false.  \"Backlog\" is the dollar amount, on any given day, of orders received for which product has not yet been shipped.  We address these claims in turn and find no error in the district court's rejection of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Dollar Amounts of Backlog</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Item 101 of Regulation S-K requires that a prospectus disclose \"to the extent material, ... [t]he dollar amount of backlog orders believed to be firm, as of a recent date and as of a comparable date in the preceding fiscal year.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.101(c)(1)(viii) (emphasis added).  Information is material when there is a reasonable likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1219;  Wielgos, 892 F.2d at 517.   The Prospectus disclosed that backlog levels were usually low.  But, plaintiffs argue that that disclosure was not enough.  They argue that the specific backlog numbers were material and hence required to be disclosed.  This is so, they say, because backlog entering the third quarter of 1992 was unusually low.  Plaintiffs support their argument by comparing the backlog entering the third quarter of 1992 ($26,875,000) to that entering the second quarter ($39,897,000)--a difference of approximately $13 million or thirty-two percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a threshold flaw in plaintiffs' argument.  As Item 101(c)(1)(viii) itself says, the appropriate comparison is not to the numbers from an immediately preceding quarter, but to those from a comparable date in the preceding fiscal year.  17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.101(c)(1)(viii).  This is particularly true here, where the Prospectus specifically stated that Computervision tended to experience seasonal declines in revenues in its first and third quarters.  See Capri Optics, 950 F.2d at 10 (where defendant's business was seasonal, it was not meaningful for plaintiffs to compare results for the quarter in question to those for the immediately preceding quarter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if quarter-to-next-quarter comparisons were appropriate, Computervision's failure to provide more specific information is nonetheless not actionable.  Roughly adjusting the numbers for seasonality, they show only a minor drop in initial backlog levels (as fractions of budgeted quarterly revenues) between the second and third quarters of 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  This minor drop of a few percent is not adequate to support the claim that the difference in backlog levels between quarters was material and hence required specific backlog numbers to be disclosed.  Where a variable, although material, is of only minor predictive value, disclosure of a rough estimate of that variable's value can obviate the need for more specific disclosure.  Cf. Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1211 n. 21 (disclosure of a \"soft\" projection may, in some cases, render the \"hard\" information underlying the projection immaterial as a matter of fact or of law).  Indeed, disclosure of only a rough estimate may keep investors from attaching undue importance to minor shifts in the variable's value and avoids the risk of \"burying the [investors] in an avalanche of trivial information.\"  San Leandro Emergency Medical Group Profit Sharing Plan v.

In sum, plaintiffs have no claim that Computervision's general statement that backlog was usually low, without the disclosure of specific numbers, was materially misleading as of the effective date of the offering.

Plaintiffs misread the Prospectus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement in the Prospectus does not say that information on backlog is insignificant or immaterial.  Instead, it says that such information should not be taken as representative.  The statement cautions investors that they should not take backlog levels as necessarily predicting results for future periods.  In addition, there is at least one other statement on the very same page of the Prospectus that warns investors that data available early in a quarter (i.e., opening backlog) is not necessarily a strong predictor of quarterly results because:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>a substantial portion of the Company's orders and shipments typically occur in the last month of each quarter.

Plaintiffs point to a backlog aging analysis from the seventh week of the third quarter of 1992, which indicates that 39% of the backlog balance, at that time, was to be shipped in more than thirty days.  The first problem with the argument is that, although plaintiffs attack the word \"generally,\" they base their claim solely on data from one portion of one quarter and fail to allege anything meaningful about Computervision's general practice.  Second, even if one portion of one quarter could be taken as representative, plaintiffs' factual allegations would not support a misrepresentation claim.  Plaintiffs allege that approximately sixty-one percent of orders were shipped out in less than thirty days, six percent were shipped in between thirty and sixty days, and thirty-three percent were shipped in more than sixty days.  Computervision's statement said that shipments were generally made within thirty days of receiving an order, not that they were always made within thirty days.  That sixty-one percent of orders in one portion of one quarter were shipped within thirty days is perfectly consistent with the statement that orders were generally shipped within thirty days.  There was no material misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4.

Plaintiffs allege that the Prospectus made two sets of material misstatements or omissions with respect to CADDS 5:  (i) the Prospectus misrepresented that, as of June 1992, CADDS 5 was a \"successful product,\" being shipped in \"volume,\" i.e., to thousands of customers;  and (ii) the Prospectus materially overstated CADDS 5's potential for success when, in fact, the product was beset with problems.

Commercial shipments of CADDS 5 (release 2.0) began in June 1992 and as of June 28, 1992, Release 2.0 had been shipped to 32 customers.  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from alluding to thousands of customers, the Prospectus specified the number of customers to whom the product had been shipped--24 in the beta testing stage and 32 in the commercial shipping stage.  Plaintiffs' assertion that this precise statement can be interpreted as implying that CADDS 5 was being shipped, or was ready to be shipped, to thousands, is baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Prospectus was replete with language cautioning investors that the market in general (i.e., a large volume of customers) had not accepted CADDS 5 as yet and that the product might need further enhancements.  For example, the Prospectus stated that although Computervision hoped to replace its \"declining hardware revenues and margins with sales of higher margin CAD/CAM software products ... [n]o assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in achieving this objective.\"  (emphasis added).  In addition, the Prospectus warned that \"customer acceptance of CADDS 5 is critical \" to continued customer purchase of Computervision's existing software product, CADDS 4X, that the \"delayed release of CADDS 5 (Release 2.0) resulted in customers delaying product purchases \" and that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>the CAD/CAM industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions and product enhancements....  There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products ... [or] that new customers will change to the Company's new products even if they are judged to be superior.  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Computervision's statement that it had commercially shipped CADDS 5 software to 32 customers must be viewed in the context of the Prospectus' numerous cautionary statements that CADDS 5 might never be accepted by the market.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1213 (if a statement is couched in cautionary language that disclaims the drawing of a particular inference, a claim that the statement was materially misleading may fail as a matter of law).  The context confirms that any possible misleading inference that might be drawn from Computervision's statement is properly deemed immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Misleading Optimistic Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' final claim is that certain optimistic statements in the Prospectus regarding the development and commercial prospects of CADDS 5 were materially misleading in light of Computervision's alleged nondisclosure of problems the product was facing.  See, e.g., Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591453\"><a href=\"/opinion/591453/david-hanon-v-dataproducts-corporation-jack-c-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 502 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A duty to disclose technical or developmental problems with a product may arise where a company makes strongly optimistic or concrete statements about that product that are in stark contrast to its internal reports.  Cf. Serabian, 24 F.3d at 363-65 (sustaining Section 10(b) claims where there was a \"contrast between what company officials were hearing internally ... and what the company was telling the public at the same time \" (emphasis in original)).  But, in this case, the statements about CADDS 5 in the Prospectus were not so optimistic as to be materially misleading about the existence of developmental or commercial difficulties with CADDS 5. To the contrary, the Prospectus frequently alludes to the uncertainties associated with the release of a new product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key statements identified by the plaintiffs are that Computervision expected CADDS 5 \"to broaden the number of customers in existing accounts as well as attract new customers,\" and that \"Computervision believes that CADDS 4X and CADDS 5 are likely to be used in tandem by major accounts in the foreseeable future.\"   These statements, whether read in isolation or in the context of Computervision's numerous warnings that CADDS 5 might not be accepted by the market and might need further enhancements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> suggest, at most, the hope that CADDS 5 will eventually gain acceptance in the market.  Such a hope is not unusual for a company releasing a new product.  Cf. VeriFone I, 784 F.Supp. at 1484 (\"securities laws presume that skilled investors are aware that a corporation's performance with a new product ... is unlikely to replicate past successes\").  Computervision's statements did not rise to the level of optimism or certainty that would make them materially misleading in the absence of disclosure of initial developmental problems the product was facing.  Cf. Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1219 n. 33 (cautiously optimistic statements, expressing at most a hope for a positive future, do not trigger a duty to update);  San Leandro, 75 F.3d at 811 (subdued generally optimistic statements constituted nothing more than puffery and were not actionable);  In re Time Warner Inc.

In particular, at the time of the Offerings, Computervision's U.S. sales were materially below sales at comparable points in the prior five quarters.  Both U.S. and international sales were substantially below the Company's plans.  In addition, Computervision had a $40 million shortfall in visible orders needed to reach its quarterly budget.  The Underwriters failed to perform adequate due diligence on Computervision's actual revenues, sales, orders, bookings and visibility for the seven weeks during the Third Quarter before the Offerings.  The Underwriters were required to but did not obtain information necessary to verify the Company's false statements that such results were \"more or less where they were expected to be.\"   To the extent the Underwriters obtained any information from the Company concerning these results, the Stock and Notes were mispriced because the initial offering price and the yields, as well as Underwriters' recommendations, did not take into account these low levels of sales and the $40 million order shortfall.   Therefore, the representation in the Stock prospectus that the offering price was based upon \"estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the Company\" was false and misleading, as were the representations in the Prospectuses concerning the recommendations of the qualified independent underwriters.

The Proposed Complaint alleges that the IPO Plan did not fully reflect the information as to the first seven weeks of the third quarter of 1992.

While initial backlog levels for the second and third quarters of 1992 were $39,897,000 and $26,875,000, respectively, Computervision's budgeted revenues for those quarters were $159,500,000 and $121,000,000, respectively.  When the initial backlog levels for the two quarters are looked at as fractions of the budgeted revenues for those quarters, the result is 25% for the second quarter and 22.2% for the third quarter--a difference of less than 3%</p>\n        <p>The district court, in Computervision II, noted that the Proposed Complaint calculated initial backlog levels for the second and third quarters of 1992 as a percentage of actual revenues (for the second quarter) and forecasted revenues (for the third quarter), respectively, and found a 9% difference between the two percentages.  914 F.Supp. at 721.   The district court ruled that this 9% differential was an insufficient basis to support plaintiffs' claim.  Id.  Not knowing the degree to which Computervision's forecasts may have been systematically biased vis-a-vis actual results, and not having been provided with this information by the parties, we are reluctant to endorse the plaintiffs' 9% number.  Cf. Wielgos, 892 F.2d at 515 (defendant's cost estimates were systematically biased).  Nevertheless, we note that our conclusion would not be different whether we used 3% or 9%.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> The Prospectus also states that \"a significant delay\" in the availability of CADDS 5 would adversely affect Computervision and that many of Computervision's competitors \"have greater financial and operating resources\" and that \"there can be no assurance that competitors will not produce equivalent or superior products.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
