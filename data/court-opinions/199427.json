Crouter, with whom Drummond Woodsum & MacMahon,\nwere on brief, for appellee.\n\fJune 5, 2001\n\f            STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.      This case arose from a\n\ndispute between the parties to a construction contract.                 The\n\nMaine School Administrative District No. 35 (MSAD 35) and the\n\nMirra Company, Inc.(Mirra), had entered into a contract which\n\nobligated Mirra to do site work at a high school project in the\n\ndistrict.    Problems soon arose, and now each party has claims\n\nagainst the other. The sole question before us is whether the\n\nparties must submit these claims to binding arbitration.              Mirra\n\nargues   that   the   contract   requires   disputes    to   be   resolved\n\nthrough arbitration, while MSAD 35 claims that there is no such\n\nagreement in the final version of the parties' contract.                The\n\ndistrict court agreed with MSAD 35 and held that the contract\n\nunambiguously did not require arbitration.        We affirm.\n\n                             I. BACKGROUND\n\n            In early 1997, the State of Maine Bureau of General\n\nServices (BGS) advertised for bids for site work at the new\n\nMarshwood High School in South Berwick, Maine.           MSAD 35 is the\n\npublic   school   district   for   that   town.   The    bid      documents\n\nprovided that the     Standard General Conditions for construction\n\ncontracts would apply, subject to certain amendments, listed in\n\nthe attached Supplementary General Conditions.               As relevant\n\nhere, the Standard General Conditions stated:\n\n            Article 42. ARBITRATION\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f                   If, in the performance of this\n            contract, there arises a dispute between the\n            Owner and the Contractor which cannot be\n            settled,   then   this  dispute   shall   be\n            submitted to Arbitration and both the Owner\n            and the Contractor shall be bound by the\n            decision of the Arbitrator.\n                   The   membership  of   the   American\n            Arbitration Association shall be used as\n            Arbitrators and the procedures used for\n            Arbitration shall be in conformity with the\n            Construction Industry Arbitration Rules as\n            administered by the American Arbitration\n            Association.\n\n            The Supplementary General Conditions used two different\n\nmethods to amend the General Conditions.           Where only a few words\n\nwere to be changed, the Supplementary General Conditions merely\n\nreferenced the article number and title of the relevant General\n\nCondition    to    be   changed   and    the    minor     alterations   were\n\ndescribed.     But where an entire article was to be substituted\n\nwith a new one, the Supplemental General Conditions referenced\n\nthe   relevant     article   number     and    title    and   set   forth   an\n\ninstruction to delete the article               in its entirety and to\n\nsubstitute a      new one with a new heading.          This second procedure\n\nwas used with respect to the agreement’s original arbitration\n\nprovision resulting in the following change:\n\n                   Article 42 - ARBITRATION: Delete in\n            its entirety and substitute:\n\n                    Article 42 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION:\n\n                          If, in the performance of this\n            Contract,    there arises a dispute between\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          Contractor and Owner that cannot be resolved\n          by the parties to the Contract, the dispute\n          shall be referred to the Director of the\n          Bureau of General Services, who, at his/her\n          discretion, will submit the dispute to non-\n          binding Alternate Dispute Resolution or\n          binding arbitration (ADR).   If the parties\n          in dispute are not satisfied with the\n          results of ADR Owner or Contractor may re-\n          submit the dispute to the Director for\n          binding arbitration.\n\n          On May 15, 1997, Mirra submitted its bid to BGS, which\n\nwas the lowest of all received, and BGS forwarded it to MSAD 35.\n\nOn June 9, 1997, MSAD 35 sent Mirra a addendum designed to\n\nfurther modify the Bidding and Contract Documents.        The addendum\n\ndid not delete and replace any articles wholesale, as the BGS's\n\nSupplementary General Conditions had done, but merely referenced\n\neach article it was to modify and set forth what was to be\n\ndeleted and what was to be added within the relevant article as\n\nit most recently stood.      On June 23, 1997, Mirra explicitly\n\nacknowledged the changes wrought by the addendum and executed\n\nthe   contract.   The   addendum    modified   the   parties’   dispute\n\nresolution agreement as follows:\n\n          1.04   Supplementary   General    Conditions,\n          Section 3-B-4, Article 42\n                 DELETE:   The entire paragraph\n                 ADD:           \"Any disputes arising out\n                 of or in the course of this Agreement,\n                 which   cannot    be   settled    through\n                 discussion between parties, shall be\n                 submitted   to   mediation   before   any\n                 lawsuit or Demand for Arbitration is\n                 filed.    When either party requests\n\n                                   -5-\n\f                   mediation, the parties, [sic] shall\n                   attempt to agree on a single mediator to\n                   mediate the dispute. The mediator shall\n                   assist the parties in attempting to\n                   solve their dispute by agreement.    The\n                   parties agree to participate in good\n                   faith during the mediation process\n                   including the selection of the mediator.\n                   The parties agree that they will engage\n                   in mediation for at least three days,\n                   unless a shorter period is set by the\n                   mediator, before abandoning the process.\n                   The cost of mediation shall be borne\n                   equally by each party.\n                   Notwithstanding this provision, either\n                   party may file suit before or during\n                   mediation if the party in good faith\n                   deems it necessary to avoid losing the\n                   right to sue. If suit is filed before\n                   good   faith   mediation   efforts   are\n                   completed, the party filing suit will\n                   agree to stay until all mediation\n                   efforts have been completed.\n\n           In   early   2000,   as    the   project   neared   completion,\n\nvarious disputes arose between the parties, and each asserted\n\nclaims against the other.            As required by the contract, the\n\nparties participated in mediation on May 17, 2000, but without\n\nsuccess.   MSAD 35 then filed suit against Mirra on May 19, 2000,\n\nin the Maine Superior Court.          On May 22, 2000, Mirra filed this\n\ndiversity action    requesting an order to compel arbitration.          On\n\nJuly 1, 2000, the district court held that \"the contract is\n\nunambiguous and does not require arbitration.\"             Mirra appeals\n\nthat decision.\n\n                            II. DISCUSSION\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           The interpretation of unambiguous contract language is\n\na matter of law reserved to the courts.           Golden Rule Ins. Co. v.\n\nAtallah,   45   F.3d   512,   516   (1st   Cir.   1995)   (\"Under   Maine's\n\ngeneral\n\nlaw of contracts, the interpretation of a contract is a question\n\nfor the fact finder only if the court first determines that the\n\ncontract is ambiguous, a question of law.\").              For this reason,\n\nwe afford de novo review to the district court’s ruling.               Paul\n\nRevere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. v. Kirschhofer, 226 F.3d 15,\n\n18-19 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Arbitration is a contractual matter, and no party may\n\nbe forced to arbitrate a dispute unless she has expressly agreed\n\nto do so by contract.     Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Miller, 523 U.S.\n\n866, 876 (1998).        In determining whether the parties to a\n\ncontract have agreed to arbitrate their disputes, courts \"should\n\napply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of\n\ncontracts.\"     First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S.\n\n938, 944 (1995).       Maine requires \"clear contractual language\n\nevidencing an intent to be bound to [arbitrate].\"              Maine Cent.\n\nR.R. v. Bangor & Aroostook R.R., 395 A.2d 1107, 1116 (Me. 1978);\n\nsee also Roosa v. Tillotson, 695 A.2d 1196, 1197-98 (Me. 1997).\n\n           Here, there is no language in the final version of the\n\ncontract that clearly suggests an intent to arbitrate.              Article\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f42,   as   revised    by   the   addendum,       only    requires     non-binding\n\nmediation,    after    which     either    party       may   file   suit    or    seek\n\narbitration (with the consent of the other party).                       Mirra does\n\nnot   suggest    a    different    interpretation            of   this     language.\n\nRather, its central argument is that, when the final addendum\n\ndeleted the     ADR paragraph from the revised Article 42, it also\n\ndeleted the preceding instruction to delete the original Article\n\n42, thus resulting in its reinstitution.\n\n            We do not agree.       The Supplementary General Conditions\n\nremoved the arbitration clause found in the Standard General\n\nConditions,     and   replaced     it     with    an    entirely     new     dispute\n\nresolution clause. The addendum merely changed the language of\n\nthat new clause so as to require mediation rather than ADR.                        The\n\ncontract unambiguously does not require arbitration.                             Thus,\n\neither party is free to bring a lawsuit against the other for\n\ndamages arising from a breach of the contract.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f",

This case arose from a\n\ndispute between the parties to a construction contract.                 The\n\nMaine School Administrative District No. 35 (MSAD 35) and the\n\nMirra Company, Inc.(Mirra), had entered into a contract which\n\nobligated Mirra to do site work at a high school project in the\n\ndistrict.    Problems soon arose, and now each party has claims\n\nagainst the other. The sole question before us is whether the\n\nparties must submit these claims to binding arbitration.              Mirra\n\nargues   that   the   contract   requires   disputes    to   be   resolved\n\nthrough arbitration, while MSAD 35 claims that there is no such\n\nagreement in the final version of the parties' contract.                The\n\ndistrict court agreed with MSAD 35 and held that the contract\n\nunambiguously did not require arbitration.        We affirm.\n\n                             I. BACKGROUND\n\n            In early 1997, the State of Maine Bureau of General\n\nServices (BGS) advertised for bids for site work at the new\n\nMarshwood High School in South Berwick, Maine.           MSAD 35 is the\n\npublic   school   district   for   that   town.   The    bid      documents\n\nprovided that the     Standard General Conditions for construction\n\ncontracts would apply, subject to certain amendments, listed in\n\nthe attached Supplementary General Conditions.               As relevant\n\nhere, the Standard General Conditions stated:\n\n            Article 42. ARBITRATION\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f                   If, in the performance of this\n            contract, there arises a dispute between the\n            Owner and the Contractor which cannot be\n            settled,   then   this  dispute   shall   be\n            submitted to Arbitration and both the Owner\n            and the Contractor shall be bound by the\n            decision of the Arbitrator.\n                   The   membership  of   the   American\n            Arbitration Association shall be used as\n            Arbitrators and the procedures used for\n            Arbitration shall be in conformity with the\n            Construction Industry Arbitration Rules as\n            administered by the American Arbitration\n            Association.\n\n            The Supplementary General Conditions used two different\n\nmethods to amend the General Conditions.           Where only a few words\n\nwere to be changed, the Supplementary General Conditions merely\n\nreferenced the article number and title of the relevant General\n\nCondition    to    be   changed   and    the    minor     alterations   were\n\ndescribed.     But where an entire article was to be substituted\n\nwith a new one, the Supplemental General Conditions referenced\n\nthe   relevant     article   number     and    title    and   set   forth   an\n\ninstruction to delete the article               in its entirety and to\n\nsubstitute a      new one with a new heading.          This second procedure\n\nwas used with respect to the agreement’s original arbitration\n\nprovision resulting in the following change:\n\n                   Article 42 - ARBITRATION: Delete in\n            its entirety and substitute:\n\n                    Article 42 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION:\n\n                          If, in the performance of this\n            Contract,    there arises a dispute between\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          Contractor and Owner that cannot be resolved\n          by the parties to the Contract, the dispute\n          shall be referred to the Director of the\n          Bureau of General Services, who, at his/her\n          discretion, will submit the dispute to non-\n          binding Alternate Dispute Resolution or\n          binding arbitration (ADR).   If the parties\n          in dispute are not satisfied with the\n          results of ADR Owner or Contractor may re-\n          submit the dispute to the Director for\n          binding arbitration.\n\n          On May 15, 1997, Mirra submitted its bid to BGS, which\n\nwas the lowest of all received, and BGS forwarded it to MSAD 35.\n\nOn June 9, 1997, MSAD 35 sent Mirra a addendum designed to\n\nfurther modify the Bidding and Contract Documents.        The addendum\n\ndid not delete and replace any articles wholesale, as the BGS's\n\nSupplementary General Conditions had done, but merely referenced\n\neach article it was to modify and set forth what was to be\n\ndeleted and what was to be added within the relevant article as\n\nit most recently stood.      On June 23, 1997, Mirra explicitly\n\nacknowledged the changes wrought by the addendum and executed\n\nthe   contract.   The   addendum    modified   the   parties’   dispute\n\nresolution agreement as follows:\n\n          1.04   Supplementary   General    Conditions,\n          Section 3-B-4, Article 42\n                 DELETE:   The entire paragraph\n                 ADD:           \"Any disputes arising out\n                 of or in the course of this Agreement,\n                 which   cannot    be   settled    through\n                 discussion between parties, shall be\n                 submitted   to   mediation   before   any\n                 lawsuit or Demand for Arbitration is\n                 filed.

The\n                   parties agree to participate in good\n                   faith during the mediation process\n                   including the selection of the mediator.\n                   The parties agree that they will engage\n                   in mediation for at least three days,\n                   unless a shorter period is set by the\n                   mediator, before abandoning the process.\n                   The cost of mediation shall be borne\n                   equally by each party.\n                   Notwithstanding this provision, either\n                   party may file suit before or during\n                   mediation if the party in good faith\n                   deems it necessary to avoid losing the\n                   right to sue. If suit is filed before\n                   good   faith   mediation   efforts   are\n                   completed, the party filing suit will\n                   agree to stay until all mediation\n                   efforts have been completed.\n\n           In   early   2000,   as    the   project   neared   completion,\n\nvarious disputes arose between the parties, and each asserted\n\nclaims against the other.            As required by the contract, the\n\nparties participated in mediation on May 17, 2000, but without\n\nsuccess.   MSAD 35 then filed suit against Mirra on May 19, 2000,\n\nin the Maine Superior Court.          On May 22, 2000, Mirra filed this\n\ndiversity action    requesting an order to compel arbitration.          On\n\nJuly 1, 2000, the district court held that \"the contract is\n\nunambiguous and does not require arbitration.\"             Mirra appeals\n\nthat decision.\n\n                            II.

Article\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f42,   as   revised    by   the   addendum,       only    requires     non-binding\n\nmediation,    after    which     either    party       may   file   suit    or    seek\n\narbitration (with the consent of the other party).                       Mirra does\n\nnot   suggest    a    different    interpretation            of   this     language.\n\nRather, its central argument is that, when the final addendum\n\ndeleted the     ADR paragraph from the revised Article 42, it also\n\ndeleted the preceding instruction to delete the original Article\n\n42, thus resulting in its reinstitution.\n\n            We do not agree.       The Supplementary General Conditions\n\nremoved the arbitration clause found in the Standard General\n\nConditions,     and   replaced     it     with    an    entirely     new     dispute\n\nresolution clause. The addendum merely changed the language of\n\nthat new clause so as to require mediation rather than ADR.                        The\n\ncontract unambiguously does not require arbitration.                             Thus,\n\neither party is free to bring a lawsuit against the other for\n\ndamages arising from a breach of the contract.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f</pre>",
