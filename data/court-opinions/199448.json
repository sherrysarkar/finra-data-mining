Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n          Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n    Fernando Marcella on brief pro se.\n    Marc DeSisto on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                           June 12, 2001\n\f           Per Curiam.       After carefully reviewing the record\n\nand briefs on appeal, we affirm the decision below.\n\n           We are satisfied that the evidence showing the\n\nprior    disposition    of    the    two   criminal    charges     against\n\nMarcella was immaterial and was properly excluded by the\n\ndistrict court.        The disposition sought to be placed in\n\nevidence was the dismissal of the criminal assault charge\n\ncoupled with the one-year filing under R.I.G.L. § 12-10-12\n\nof the charge for resisting arrest.            This disposition must\n\nbe viewed in light of Marcella’s past illness and the likely\n\ninterest of those concerned to effectuate a non-criminal\n\ndisposition consistent with his future improvement.                 It is\n\nimpossible rationally to infer from this pragmatic plea\n\narrangement that the prosecution was or was not conceding\n\nanything as to the underlying truth of the assault charge.\n\nDismissal of that charge cannot be viewed in isolation from\n\nthe continued retention for possible prosecution within one\n\nyear of the resisting arrest charge.           We note that defendant\n\nMurphy   testified     in    the    instant   case    that   he   arrested\n\nMarcella because of Marcella’s alleged assault upon him.\n\nHad the resisting arrest charge been prosecuted during the\n\none-year following the disposition, the government would\n\npresumably have expected to seek to prove the assault as\n\fconstituting a lawful basis for the arrest.                          Hence, we\n\ncannot    say     that   admission       of     evidence   of    this    prior\n\ndisposition of the criminal charges would “make ... the\n\nexistence    of    any   fact     that     is    of   consequence       to   the\n\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable\n\nthan it would be without the evidence.”                Fed. R. Evid. 401.\n\nWe hold that the district court acted properly within its\n\nbroad    discretion      to    exclude     the    evidence      in   question.\n\nFaigin v.
