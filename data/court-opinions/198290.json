Before the Court is plaintiff-\r\nappellant Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority's (\"PRASA\")\r\nappeal from the district court's denial of PRASA's motion for a\r\nsecond partial new trial on damages.  At the first partial new\r\ntrial, the jury awarded PRASA no damages despite an earlier verdict\r\nfinding defendant-appellee Constructora Lluch, Inc. (\"Lluch\") to be\r\nnegligent and in breach of the construction contract between the\r\ntwo.  PRASA also appeals from a jury award on Lluch's counterclaims\r\nagainst PRASA for breach of contract and for amounts owed on the\r\ncontract.  For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the\r\njudgment awarding Lluch $756,471.59 on its counterclaims, but\r\nvacate the judgment awarding PRASA no damages on its claims and\r\nremand for a second partial new trial on the issue of damages.  \r\n                       BACKGROUND\r\n     This case arises out of the collapse, during\r\nconstruction, of the steel roof structure of the Mayaguez\r\nComposting Facility in October of 1989.  PRASA entertained bids for\r\nthe project and eventually awarded the project's design to Lebrn\r\nAssociates, an engineering and architecture firm.  In May of 1988,\r\nPRASA entered into a construction contract with Lluch to build the\r\nfacility.  Several months later, Lluch subcontracted with Richmond\r\nSteel, Inc. (\"RSI\") to manufacture and install the facility's steel\r\ncomponents, including the roof.\r\n     The Mayaguez facility was to be a compost treatment plant\r\ncomprised of a main building to deposit and treat compost and a\r\nseparate administrative building.  The main building was designed \r\nas two adjacent bays with three lines of columns to support two\r\nseparate steel frame roofs.   Among the plans and specifications\r\ndeveloped by Lebrn was a procedure to be followed for the\r\npreparation and consolidation of the soil.  Under the procedure,\r\nLluch was required: (1) to place a permanent landfill on the site;\r\n(2) to install wicks and pertinent instrumentation; (3) to place a\r\nsurcharge on the site; and (4) to leave the surcharge undisturbed\r\nfor a period of seven and a half months.  However, before the\r\nconsolidation of the soil was completed, Lluch removed the\r\nsurcharge from the soil in order to begin the concrete construction\r\nand in order to allow RSI to begin the steel erection.\r\nOn October 22, 1989, after RSI had erected a substantial\r\npart of the east portion of the steel roof structure, the\r\nuncompleted west portion of the steel roof structure collapsed.\r\nAfter the collapse, Lluch removed the collapsed steel frames and\r\ndebris, began to repair the damaged columns, and continued with\r\nconstruction of the remaining phases of the project, all with\r\nPRASA's authorization and under PRASA's supervision.  After Lluch\r\nhad substantially completed the construction of the project -- with\r\nthe exception of the steel roof structure -- PRASA demolished the\r\nentire project, over Lluch's objection.  \r\nOn October 10, 1990, this action was filed in United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by RSI,\r\nseeking monetary and declaratory relief against PRASA, Lluch,\r\nLebrn, and their bonding and surety companies.  Several\r\ncounterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims followed, most\r\nof which were dismissed before trial.  Included in those rulings,\r\nthe district court dismissed PRASA's cross-claim under Article 1483\r\nof the Puerto Rico Civil Code against Lluch and RSI.  See Richmond\r\nSteel, Inc. v. Legal and Gen. Assurance Soc'y, Ltd., 825 F. Supp.\r\n443, 445 (D.P.R. 1993).\r\nAt the first trial in 1993, some of the parties entered\r\ninto various stipulations, including the dismissal of original\r\nplaintiff RSI.  The district court then realigned the parties to\r\ncontinue the trial.  As a result, PRASA became the plaintiff, and\r\nLluch, Lebrn, and CNA Casualty of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"CNA\")\r\nremained as defendants.  On August 9, 1993, after a twenty-four day\r\ntrial, the jury, in a special verdict form, found: (1) that Lluch\r\nimproperly removed the surcharge from the construction site or in\r\nsome other way breached its contract with PRASA by negligent\r\nconstruction work; (2) that this breach caused the collapse of the\r\nroof structure; (3) that this breach caused damages to PRASA; (4)\r\nthat PRASA's demolition of the remains of the structure was\r\nunjustified; and (5) that PRASA suffered $4,587,202.77 in damages\r\nas a result of Lluch's breach.  With regard to the counterclaims\r\nagainst PRASA, the jury found: (1) that PRASA breached its contract\r\nwith Lluch; (2) that this breach caused damages to Lluch in the\r\namount of $138,758; (3) that PRASA owed Lluch $617,713.59 for work\r\nperformed on the contract; and (4) that PRASA owed Lebrn\r\n$40,148.28 on the contract.  As a result of these findings, the\r\njury awarded: (1) $4,587,202.77 to PRASA for Lluch's negligence and\r\nbreach of contract; (2) $756,471.59 to Lluch on its counterclaims\r\nagainst PRASA for breach of contract and money owed on the\r\ncontract; and (3) $40,148.28 to Lebrn on its counterclaim against\r\nPRASA for money owed on the contract.\r\nOn October 15, 1993, the district court issued a judgment\r\nconsistent with the damages awarded by the jury.  In an order\r\nissued the same day, the district court advised counsel that all\r\npost-trial motions were required to be filed or renewed within 10\r\ndays of the date of the judgment.  On October 21, 1993, CNA and\r\nLluch filed a timely motion for a new trial on PRASA's claims.  On\r\nNovember 4, 1993 -- twenty days after the entry of judgment --\r\nPRASA filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law with regard to\r\nLluch's counterclaims.\r\nOn July 27, 1994, the court granted CNA and Lluch's\r\nmotion for a new trial, subject to PRASA's acceptance of a\r\nremittitur.  The court concluded that the jury award was excessive\r\nin light of the evidence presented.  The court then gave PRASA the\r\noption of accepting a remitted award of $1,224,000 or a partial new\r\ntrial on damages.  PRASA opted for a new trial. \r\nOn March 24, 1995, the court denied PRASA's motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law on Lluch's counterclaims.  The court\r\nfound that the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury\r\nto reach a verdict in favor of Lluch on those claims.\r\nOn February 7, 1996, the court set the scope of the\r\npartial new trial on damages for PRASA's claims.  The court held\r\nthat the new trial would be limited only to the extent of PRASA's \r\ndamages at the time of the collapse.  The court concluded that,\r\nbecause the jury in the first trial found that PRASA was\r\nunjustified in demolishing the structure, damages would be limited\r\nto the cost to repair the collapse as of October 22, 1989, the date\r\nof the collapse.\r\nAt the partial new trial, PRASA presented evidence that\r\nthe soil conditions at the site were unstable and were experiencing\r\nsettlement beyond what was expected.  PRASA's experts testified\r\nthat the soil had to be improved in order to repair the collapse,\r\neither through placing a new surcharge on the site or by installing\r\npiles to support the structure.  PRASA's experts testified that\r\nonly the option of installing piles was feasible, but that it would\r\ncost in excess of $6 million to do.  Lluch and CNA presented\r\ntestimony that the soil did not have to be improved to repair the\r\ncollapse and that it would have cost approximately $500,000 to\r\nrepair the damage.  Lluch and CNA also presented testimony that\r\nLluch intended to absorb the costs of repair and that PRASA was\r\nnever going to be charged for those costs.\r\nThe court instructed the jury: (1) that PRASA was\r\nentitled to claim the extent of any damages it suffered at the time\r\nof the collapse on October 22, 1989; and (2) that those damages\r\nwere limited to the cost to repair the collapse.  The court also\r\ninstructed the jury to accept as established facts: (1) that Lluch\r\nimproperly removed the surcharge or breached its contract in some\r\nother way by negligent construction; (2) that this breach or\r\nnegligence caused the collapse; and (3) that PRASA's subsequent\r\ndemolition of the structure was unjustified.  The court informed\r\nthe jury that if PRASA failed to establish the amount of damages\r\ncaused by Lluch, then PRASA was not entitled to collect any\r\ndamages.  The court then submitted a verdict form to the jury that\r\nasked whether PRASA suffered any damages, and if so, the amount of\r\nthose damages.\r\nOn July 15, 1997, the jury returned the verdict form\r\nindicating that it found that PRASA suffered no damages.  Judgment\r\nwas entered the next day, ordering that PRASA take nothing from\r\nLluch and CNA.\r\nOn August 1, 1997, PRASA filed a motion for a second\r\npartial new trial on the issue of damages or for reinstatement of\r\nthe 1993 verdict.  On December 11, 1997, the court entered an\r\nOpinion and Order denying PRASA's motion.  On December 22, 1997,\r\nPRASA filed a motion to alter or amend the December 11, 1997\r\nOpinion and Order.  On January 22, 1998, the court denied PRASA's\r\nmotion to alter or amend by Endorsed Order.  The Court photocopied\r\nthe motion, wrote \"Denied\" in the margin of the photocopy, and\r\nreferred the parties to the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order. \r\nOn January 27, 1998, PRASA filed a notice of appeal from the\r\nJuly 16, 1997 judgment, the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order,\r\nand the January 22, 1998 Endorsed Order.\r\n                       DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Jurisdiction\r\nBefore we reach the merits, we must first address\r\nappellees' contention that we lack jurisdiction over PRASA's\r\nappeal.  The docket reflects the following chain of relevant\r\nevents:\r\n     July 16, 1997 - The district court entered judgment\r\n     awarding no damages to PRASA;\r\n     August 1, 1997 - PRASA filed a Rule 59(b) motion for a\r\n     second partial new trial on damages or for\r\n     reinstatement of the prior verdict;\r\n     December 11, 1997 - The district court entered an\r\n     Opinion and Order denying PRASA's motion for a second\r\n     partial new trial on damages;\r\n     December 22, 1997 - PRASA filed a motion to alter or\r\n     amend the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order;\r\n     January 22, 1998 - The district court denied PRASA's\r\n     motion to alter or amend by entering an Endorsed Order. \r\n     The Endorsed Order consisted of a photocopy of PRASA's\r\n     motion to alter or amend, with a notation in the margin\r\n     signed by the district judge.  The notation stated:\r\n     \"Denied.  See docket no. 624  .\"  Docket No. 624 is the\r\n     court's December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order;\r\n     January 27, 1998 - PRASA filed its notice of appeal\r\n     from the July 16, 1997 judgment, the December 11, 1997\r\n     Opinion and Order, and the January 22, 1998 Endorsed\r\n     Order.\r\nAppellees argue that appellate jurisdiction is lacking\r\nbecause PRASA's December 22, 1997 motion to alter or amend the\r\nDecember 11, 1997 Opinion and Order did not toll the time to appeal\r\nthe judgment or the Opinion and Order.  Federal Rule of Appellate\r\nProcedure 4(a)(4)(C) provides that the filing of a motion to alter\r\nor amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e)\r\ntolls the time for appeal until the district court issues an order\r\ndisposing of the motion.  Appellees claim that PRASA's motion is\r\nnot really a motion to alter or amend the December 11, 1997 Opinion\r\nand Order because it requested the same relief sought by the motion\r\nfor a second partial new trial, and did so on the same grounds. \r\nAppellees argue that PRASA's motion to alter or amend is really a\r\nmotion to reconsider the July 16, 1997 judgment.  Appellees point\r\nout that the motion to alter or amend is, in some places, an exact\r\nverbatim copy of the motion for a new trial.  Appellees further\r\nclaim that even the non-verbatim portions merely recast the\r\narguments of the motion for a new trial with the addition of\r\nquotations from the trial transcript.\r\nAppellees correctly note that the filing of a motion to\r\nreconsider will only toll the time for appeal if the motion is\r\nfiled no later than ten days after the entry of the judgment from\r\nwhich reconsideration is sought.  See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(F). \r\nAppellees claim that since PRASA's December 22, 1997 motion is\r\nreally a motion to reconsider the July 16, 1997 judgment, it needed\r\nto be filed within ten days of July 16, 1997 to have any effect on\r\nthe time to appeal.  In support of this position, appellees cite\r\nAcevedo-Villalobos v. Hernndez, 22 F.3d 384 (1st Cir.), cert.\r\ndenied, 513 U.S. 1015 (1994).  In Acevedo-Villalobos, the Court was\r\nfaced with a situation in which the district court entered a\r\njudgment of dismissal and the plaintiffs filed one post-judgment\r\nmotion within 10 days of the judgment and another post-judgment\r\nmotion more than 10 days from the entry of judgment.  See id. at\r\n389-90.  Even though the second motion purported to request\r\nreconsideration of the denial of the first motion, the Court found\r\nthat the second motion was \"an obvious attempt to have the district\r\ncourt revisit the legal basis for\" the original judgment of\r\ndismissal.  Id. at 390.  The Court noted that the second motion\r\nrequested the same relief that the first motion requested, and did\r\nso on the same grounds.  See id.  Therefore, the Court treated the\r\nsecond motion as a motion to reconsider the original judgment of\r\ndismissal.  See id.  Because the second motion was untimely as such\r\na motion to reconsider, the Court found: (1) that it did not extend\r\nthe tolling of the time to appeal the original judgment of\r\ndismissal; and (2) that it did not toll the time to appeal the\r\ndenial of the first post-judgment motion.  See id. \r\nAppellees argue that the same result should follow in the\r\npresent case because the December 22, 1997 motion is really a\r\nmotion to reconsider the July 16, 1997 judgment and because the\r\nmotion was filed over five months after the July 16, 1997 judgment. \r\nFrom this, appellees argue: (1) that the time to appeal the\r\nJuly 16, 1997 judgment was tolled only by the filing of the Rule\r\n59(b) motion for a second partial new trial and therefore expired\r\non January 11, 1998; (2) that the time to appeal the December 11,\r\n1997 Opinion and Order was never tolled and also expired on\r\nJanuary 11, 1998; and (3) that there was no time to appeal the\r\nJanuary 22, 1998 Order, because the untimeliness of the motion to\r\nreconsider deprived the district court of jurisdiction to decide\r\nit.\r\nWe cannot accept appellees' contentions.  We are faced\r\nwith a different situation than that presented in Acevedo-\r\nVillalobos.  In that case, the Court found that the tolling\r\nterminated with the denial of the first post-judgment motion.  SeeAcevedo-Villalobos, 22 F.3d at 390.  In the present case, however, \r\nthe December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order -- the order denying\r\nPRASA's first post-judgment motion -- did not stop the tolling of\r\nthe time to appeal the July 16, 1997 judgment because, as discussed\r\nbelow, it was not a \"final judgment\" in compliance with the\r\n\"separate document\" rule of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58.  \r\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) provides that\r\nthe tolling commenced by the filing of a proper post-judgment\r\nmotion continues until \"the entry of the order disposing of the\r\nlast such motion outstanding.\"  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4). \r\nSubsection (a)(7) states that \"a judgment or order is entered\r\nwithin the meaning of this Rule 4(a) when it is entered in\r\ncompliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure.\"  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7).  Therefore, in order to halt\r\nthe tolling of the time to appeal, an order denying a tolling post-\r\njudgment motion must comply with Rule 58.  See also Kersey v.\r\nDennison Mfg. Co., 3 F.3d 482, 484-85 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding that\r\nthe tolling of the time to appeal from a certified judgment never\r\nstopped because, even though the district court \"announced\" its\r\ndenial of a tolling post-judgment Rule 59(e) motion in an order, it\r\nnever issued a separate document); Fiore v. Washington Cty. Com.\r\nMental Health Ctr., 960 F.2d 229, 233 (1st Cir. 1992)(en\r\nbanc)(noting Rules 4(a)(4) and 4(a)(7) and stating that those\r\nsubsections expressly impose Rule 58's separate document\r\nrequirement on denials of post-judgment motions that toll the time\r\nfor appeal).  Because we find below that the December 11, 1997\r\nOpinion and Order did not comply with Rule 58, we find that it did\r\nnot stop the tolling of the time to appeal the July 16, 1997\r\njudgment.\r\nRule 58 states that \"[e]very judgment shall be set forth\r\non a separate document\" and that \"[a] judgment is only effective\r\nwhen so set forth.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.  In Fiore v. Washington\r\nCty. Com. Mental Health Ctr., this Court held that Rule 58 shall be\r\napplied to all final orders denying and granting post-judgment\r\nmotions under Rules 50(b), 59(b), 59(e), and 60(b).  See Fiore, 960\r\nF.2d at 232-33; see also Credit Francais Int'l, S.A. v. Bio-Vita,\r\nLtd., 78 F.3d 698, 704 n.12 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[T]he 'separate\r\ndocument' rule does apply to orders denying Rule 59(e) motions.\"). \r\nIn doing so, the Fiore Court concluded that \"technical compliance\r\nwith the [separate document requirement] is as necessary in the\r\npost-judgment context as it is in disposing of the merits.\"  Fiore,\r\n960 F.2d at 235.  Because PRASA's motion for a second partial new\r\ntrial was a Rule 59(b) motion, it fits within Fiore's \"uniform\r\napproach for all orders denying post-judgment motions under Rules\r\n50(b), 52(b) and 59(b) and (e), as well as under Rule 60(b).\"  Id.at 232.  Thus, the Opinion and Order denying PRASA's motion for a\r\nsecond partial new trial must comply with Rule 58.\r\nThe December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order was a five-page\r\nopinion which considered PRASA's motion for a second partial new\r\ntrial.  In the Opinion and Order, the district court addressed and\r\nrejected each of PRASA's arguments in turn, using explanatory\r\nlanguage to give its reason for each rejection.  The Opinion and\r\nOrder concluded with the following statements: \"Accordingly, the\r\nCourt hereby denies the motion for a new trial.  IT IS SO ORDERED.\" \r\nAppellees argue that the Opinion and Order, by itself,\r\nwas a separate document, as contemplated by Rule 58.  Appellees\r\nclaim that the Opinion and Order was originated by the district\r\ncourt as a separate piece of paper and that the Opinion and Order\r\ndiscussed the merits of PRASA's motion for a new trial.  Appellees\r\nfurther claim that there was no margin for confusion or uncertainty\r\nas to the finality of the order.  Appellees cite Hollywood v. City\r\nof Santa Mara, 886 F.2d 1228, 1231 (9th Cir. 1989), for its\r\nholding that a separate document was not required to accompany a\r\nnine-page order denying a Rule 59 motion for a new trial.  In that\r\ncase, the Ninth Circuit noted that it had previously held that\r\ncompliance with Rule 58 \"requires entry of a document distinct from\r\nany opinion or memorandum.\"  Id. at 1231 (citing Allah v. Superior\r\nCourt, 871 F.2d 887, 890 (9th Cir. 1989); Vernon v. Heckler, 811\r\nF.2d 1274, 1276 (9th Cir. 1987)).  The Hollywood court then refused\r\nto extend this rule to the context of orders denying Rule 59\r\nmotions.  See id.  The court found that the risk of confusion\r\nregarding finality does not exist in the context of denials of Rule\r\n59 motions for a new trial.  See id. at 1232.  The court held that\r\nthe order denying the Rule 59 motion \"definitively signaled the end\r\nof the litigation.\"  Id.    \r\nIn relying on Hollywood, appellees make an argument\r\ndirectly at odds with this Court's holding in Fiore.  In Fiore, the\r\nCourt held that \"technical compliance with the [separate document\r\nrequirement] is as necessary in the post-judgment context as it is\r\nin disposing of the merits.\"  Fiore, 960 F.2d at 235.  The Court\r\nrecognized that the uncertainty that prompted the separate document\r\nrule would be less likely to occur with respect to post-judgment\r\norders than for initial judgments.  See id. at 234.  Nonetheless,\r\nthe Court stated that, because some uncertainty will always exist,\r\nconsistency and clarity would be better achieved by following the\r\nrules as written than by trying to distinguish one type of judgment\r\nor order from another.  See id.  In footnote 9, the Court stated\r\nthat Hollywood was \"at odds with our conclusion that post-judgment\r\nmotions should be treated identically with judgments on the\r\nmerits.\"  Id. at 235 n.9.  Therefore, appellees' reliance on\r\nHollywood is misplaced; we are bound by Fiore's holding that orders\r\ndenying Rule 59(b) motions are subject to the separate document\r\nrequirement of Rule 58.\r\nAppellees cannot escape the fact that the December 11,\r\n1997 Opinion and Order was a five-page explanatory opinion denying\r\nPRASA's motion that was not accompanied by a separate one-line\r\njudgment.  This does not comply with the separate document\r\nrequirement of Rule 58.  Several courts have found that detailed\r\nopinions similar to the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order violate\r\nthe separate document requirement because they were not accompanied\r\nby a short separate judgment.  See, e.g., Baker v. Mercedes Benz of\r\nNorth America, 114 F.3d 57, 60 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding that Rule\r\n58 was not satisfied by an extensive written opinion concluding\r\nwith the sentence: \"This is a final judgment\", because there was no\r\nseparate document judgment); Barber v. Whirlpool Corp., 34 F.3d\r\n1268, 1275 (4th Cir. 1994)(holding that an eleven-page order\r\nsetting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law and\r\ndismissing defendant's post-trial motions did not satisfy the\r\nseparate document rule); Clough v. Rush, 959 F.2d 182, 184-85 (10th\r\nCir. 1992) (holding that the absence of a separate document\r\nrendered an order nonfinal, even though the order granting summary\r\njudgment was fifteen pages long and contained detailed legal\r\nreasoning).  We recognize the irony in finding that an Opinion and\r\nOrder is not an effectively final judgment because it contains\r\npages of explanatory language and reasoning.  However, this Court's\r\nconcerns for certainty and predictability in Fiore gave rise to a\r\nuniform rule of technical compliance.  Consequently, we find that\r\nthe December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order did not comply with the\r\nseparate document requirement of Rule 58.  Therefore, the\r\nDecember 11, 1997 Opinion and Order did not stop the tolling of the\r\ntime to appeal the July 16, 1997 judgment.\r\nEven though the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order was\r\nnot a final judgment in compliance with the separate document\r\nrequirement of Rule 58, we nevertheless have jurisdiction over the\r\nappeal if the parties are found to have waived the separate\r\ndocument requirement.  In Bankers Trust v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381,\r\n386 (1978), the Supreme Court stated that judicial efficiency\r\nrequires that the parties be able to waive the separate document\r\nrequirement in order to avoid the pointless exercise of dismissing\r\nthe appeal only to have it refiled when the district court enters\r\nthe required separate document.  The Court then went on to find\r\nwaiver in that case because the petitioner (who was the appellee at\r\nthe circuit level) did not object to the taking of the appeal in\r\nthe absence of a separate judgment.  See id. at 387-88.  We have\r\npreviously applied this waiver principle \"where both parties waive\r\nthe requirement and neither party would be prejudiced or misled by\r\nthe lack of a separate document.\"  Wang Laboratories, Inc. v.\r\nApplied Computer Sciences, Inc., 926 F.2d 92, 96 (1st Cir. 1991); \r\nsee also Smith v. Massachusetts Dep't of Correction, 936 F.2d 1390,\r\n1394 (1st Cir. 1991).  We have also stated that \"the separate\r\ndocument requirement should always be interpreted to prevent the\r\nloss of the right to appeal, not to facilitate loss.\"  Fiore, 960\r\nF.2d at 236-37 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nIn the present case, both PRASA and appellees have waived\r\nthe separate document requirement.  PRASA clearly waived the\r\nrequirement when it filed its notice of appeal in the absence of a\r\ntrue final judgment.  See id. at 236 n.10.  Appellees waived the\r\nrequirement by failing to object at any point to the taking of an\r\nappeal in the absence of a separate document.  To date, appellees\r\nhave never claimed that no separate document has issued or that\r\nthis appeal may not proceed because no separate document has\r\nissued.  Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of\r\njurisdiction, but this motion claimed that the January 27, 1998\r\nnotice of appeal was untimely, an argument which is predicated on\r\nthe validity and finality of the December 11, 1997 Opinion and\r\nOrder.  Appellees did not raise the separate document issue in any\r\nform until the Court denied the motion to dismiss the appeal and\r\nspecifically inquired about compliance with the separate document\r\nrule.  Appellees' current position is that the Opinion and Order is\r\na separate document and therefore the notice of appeal was\r\nuntimely, so appellees do not, even today, object to the taking of\r\nan appeal in the absence of a separate document.   \r\nNor does it appear that either PRASA or appellees have\r\nbeen prejudiced or misled by the lack of a separate document. \r\nAppellees apparently did not even suspect that the December 11,\r\n1997 Opinion and Order was insufficient until the Court's request\r\nfor briefing on the issue.  PRASA was not prejudiced or misled by\r\nthe lack of a separate document because it took steps -- in the\r\nform of the December 22, 1997 motion to alter or amend and the\r\nJanuary 27, 1998 notice of appeal -- to ensure that it was not\r\nsleeping on its appellate rights.  Therefore, under Bankers Trust,\r\nSmith, and Wang, we find that the parties have waived the separate\r\ndocument requirement of Rule 58.  Consequently, we have\r\njurisdiction over the present appeal even though the December 11,\r\n1997 Opinion and Order was not a valid final judgment in compliance\r\nwith Rule 58.  \r\nII. The District Court's Denial of PRASA's Motion For a Second   \r\nPartial New Trial on the Issue of Damages\r\n\n    PRASA argues that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in denying PRASA's motion for a second partial new trial\r\non the issue of damages.  PRASA argues that a second partial new\r\ntrial should have been granted because: (1) the jury verdict\r\nawarding no damages was against the demonstrable weight of the\r\nevidence; (2) the district court erred in allowing the jury to\r\nredetermine issues already determined by the first jury; and (3)\r\nappellees' counsel made improper and prejudicial remarks to the\r\njury during opening and closing statements. \r\n    The denial of a new trial is reviewed for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  Bogosian v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 104\r\nF.3d 472, 482 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    A.       Jury Verdict Against the Weight of the Evidence\r\n    PRASA first argues that the 1997 jury verdict was against\r\nthe weight of the evidence because it was inadequate to compensate\r\nPRASA for its damages.  A verdict may be set aside and a new trial\r\nordered \"when the verdict is against the clear weight of the\r\nevidence, or is based upon evidence which is false, or will result\r\nin a clear miscarriage of justice.\"  Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., 915\r\nF.2d 764, 766 (1st Cir. 1990)(citing Torres-Troche v. Municipality\r\nof Yauco, 873 F.2d 499 (1st Cir. 1989)).\r\n    PRASA argues that the clear weight of the evidence at the\r\npartial new trial established that PRASA suffered significant\r\ndamages.  The jury in the first trial found that Lluch had been\r\nnegligent in breaching its contract with PRASA, that Lluch's breach\r\ncaused the collapse of the structure, and that this breach caused\r\ndamages to PRASA.  While the district court set aside the amount of\r\ndamages awarded as excessive, it did not set aside the jury's\r\nfinding of negligence or the jury's finding that this negligence\r\ncaused PRASA damages.  Rather, the district court specifically\r\ninstructed the second jury to accept those two determinations. \r\nThen, the district court set the parameters for the amount PRASA\r\ncould recover by instructing the second jury that:\r\n    PRASA is entitled to recover an amount which\r\n    will reasonably compensate it for any damages\r\n    it had suffered as a result of Lluch's breach\r\n    of contract or negligence as of the date of\r\n    the collapse on October 22, 1989. \r\n    Specifically, PRASA is entitled to recover the\r\n    cost to repair the collapse. \r\n\n    PRASA argues that the clear weight of the evidence\r\npresented at the partial trial showed that it suffered significant\r\ndamages as of the date of the collapse.  PRASA breaks down the cost\r\nof repair into two components: (1) the cost of preparing the soil\r\nto support the repaired roof structure; and (2) the cost of\r\nrepairing the roof structure itself.  The first component was\r\nsought by PRASA as the cost of the stabilization of the soil or the\r\ninstallation of piling support at the construction site.  PRASA\r\nnotes that the first jury determined: (1) that Lluch improperly\r\nremoved the surcharge from the soil at the construction site or in\r\nother ways acted negligently in breaching its contract with PRASA;\r\nand (2) that Lluch's improper removal caused the collapse of the\r\nroof structure.  PRASA argues that the cost of repair must include\r\nthe cost of stabilization or piling support because it would be\r\nfutile to attempt to install the roof structure again without first\r\nimproving or supporting the soil. \r\n    In an attempt to prove that the soil at the site must be\r\nimproved or supported before repair of the structure could begin,\r\nPRASA offered the testimony of Engineers Carlos Ortiz, Angel\r\nHerrera, and Alan Crumley.  Ortiz testified that he conducted soil\r\nexploration at the site after the collapse and that he determined\r\nthat the soil had settled nearly 70 cm, almost twice the settlement\r\nexpected when the site was originally analyzed in 1986.  Ortiz also\r\ndetected settlement of the concrete columns on which the new roof\r\nstructure would be installed.  Ortiz concluded that because the\r\nconsolidation and settlement of the soil was ongoing at the time of\r\nthe collapse, the soil needed to be treated in order to build on\r\nit.  Herrera, an expert in design, construction and estimates of\r\ncosts of repairs of failures or collapses of structures, testified\r\nthat, at the time of the collapse, the soil at the site was notcompetent to support the building as designed. Crumley testified\r\nthat he analyzed the soil in 1995 and found that primary\r\nsettlements were still occurring and were therefore occurring at\r\nthe time of the collapse at a rapid rate.  Crumley opined that\r\nrepairing the collapse in 1989 would have required either improving\r\nthe soil or installing piles. \r\n    The district court apparently agreed with PRASA's\r\nassertion that the soil had to be improved before the structure\r\ncould be repaired.  Appellees objected to testimony regarding soil\r\nimprovement measures as beyond the scope of the cost of repairing\r\nthe collapse, but the court overruled those objections and stated\r\nthat \"to repair he's got to do that.\" \r\n    PRASA attempted to quantify how much it would cost to\r\nimprove the soil or install piles through Herrera's testimony. \r\nHerrera first considered the option of surcharging the soil, but\r\nrejected that alternative because of the uncertainty of the\r\nsettlement.  Therefore, Herrera recommended the second alternative:\r\ninstalling piles for support.  Herrera testified that properly\r\ninstalling piles for support would require the following steps (and\r\ncosts): (1) removing portions of the floor slab ($82,500); (2)\r\ninstalling piles ($3,201,000); (3) raising the existing footings\r\n($440,000); (4) installing new footings to connect the piles with\r\nthe existing footings ($423,835); (5) building concrete foundation\r\nbeams ($510,044); and (6) building a new floor slab ($1,220,740). \r\nHerrera testified that these steps would cost $5,878,119, plus a\r\nsix percent consulting fee, for a total cost of improving the soil\r\nof $6,230,806. \r\n    The second component of the cost of repair sought by\r\nPRASA was the repair of the roof structure itself.  PRASA argues\r\nthat the evidence of the cost of reinstalling the collapsed roof\r\nvaried from $470,000 to $2,513,211.48.  PRASA first points to the\r\ntestimony of Lluch's expert, Engineer Rafael Jimnez.  Jimnez\r\ntestified that repairing the roof structure would require repairing\r\nand installing the steel trusses ($420,000), repairing the concrete\r\ncolumns ($21,000), and removing the twisted steel ($70,000), for a\r\ntotal of $511,000.  Engineer Edison Lluch also testified for\r\ndefendants regarding the cost to repair the collapse.  Eng. Lluch\r\nagreed with Jimnez that those three steps needed to be undertaken,\r\nbut disagreed with Jimnez's estimate of cost.  Eng. Lluch\r\nestimated the steps to cost $421,000, $20,000, and $29,000,\r\nrespectively, for a total of $470,000. \r\n    For the highest estimated cost of repair, PRASA points to\r\nthe cross-examination of Eng. Lluch, during which PRASA claims that\r\nEng. Lluch acknowledged that he had written a letter to Seaboard\r\nSurety Company claiming $2,513,211.48 for repair of the structure. \r\nIn that letter, PRASA claims that Eng. Lluch included estimates on\r\nhow much it would cost: (1) to remove the collapsed structure; (2)\r\nto replace the damaged steel structure; (3) to install the steel\r\nstructure; and (4) to repair the damage to the concrete columns.\r\nHowever, Eng. Lluch also testified that much of the claimed amount\r\nwas not related to the collapse, but was related to the fact that\r\nRichmond abandoned the project.  PRASA does not itemize the\r\n$2,513,211.48 claim to explain how much was claimed by Lluch as\r\nrepair for the collapse and how much was claimed because Richmond\r\nabandoned the project. \r\n    In total, PRASA claims that the jury was presented\r\nevidence that the soil would cost $6,230,806 to improve and that\r\nthe steel roof structure would cost anywhere from $470,000 to\r\n$2,513,211.48 to repair. PRASA argues that the jury verdict\r\nawarding no damages was clearly contrary to the weight of this\r\nevidence.\r\n    In response, appellees offer two arguments.  First,\r\nappellees raise the legal argument that PRASA was not legally\r\nentitled to compensation for the collapse.   Appellees argue that\r\nClauses V and VIII of the construction contract provided PRASA with\r\na choice of remedies in the event of a breach by Lluch.  Clause V\r\nprovided that if Lluch failed in the performance of the contract,\r\nPRASA could hire a substitute contractor to complete the work at\r\nLluch's expense.  Appellees describe this remedy as the \"in natura\"\r\nremedy for breach of contract.  Clause VIII was a penalty clause\r\nthat obligated Lluch to pay PRASA $1,400 for each day that\r\ncompletion of the project was delayed due to Lluch's failure to\r\nfulfill its obligations.  \r\n    Appellees argue that Clauses V and VIII, in conjunction,\r\nprovide the only remedies available to PRASA:  specific performance\r\nor substitute performance, with Lluch paying the liquidated late\r\nfees or cost overruns.  Appellees cite Article 1106 of the Puerto\r\nRico Civil Code for the proposition that, in obligations that\r\ninclude a penalty clause, the penalty shall substitute indemnity\r\nfor damages.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3131.  Appellees also\r\ncite Rodrguez Cancel v. A.E.E., 16 P.R. Offic. Trans. 542 (1995),\r\nin support of their argument that, by contracting for the \"in\r\nnatura\" remedy, the parties precluded the recovery of monetary\r\ndamages.  Appellees argue that, instead of choosing one of those\r\nremedies, PRASA unjustifiably demolished the entire structure,\r\nmaking it impossible for either Lluch or a substitute contractor to\r\nfinish the project.  From this, appellees claim that PRASA opted\r\nout of both remedies available to it, and therefore is not entitled\r\nto recover monetary damages now.\r\n    We reject appellees' first argument because it ignores\r\nthe fact that PRASA did not bring its claim solely under a breach\r\nof contract theory.  Appellees may well be correct that PRASA's\r\nremedies for a pure breach of contract action are limited to the\r\nremedies provided in the contract.  However, while the exact nature\r\nof PRASA's claims is not at all clear from the record, this was not\r\na pure breach of contract action.  The district court treated the\r\naction as a breach of contract action in which the claimed breach\r\nof contract was Lluch's negligent construction.  The district court\r\nasked the first jury: \"Do you find that Constructora Lluch\r\nimproperly removed the surcharge from the construction site or in\r\nany other way breached its contract with PRASA by negligent\r\nconstruction work?\"   Similarly, the district court instructed the\r\nsecond jury to accept as an established fact that Lluch \"breached\r\nits contract with PRASA by negligent construction work.\"  In\r\nnumerous instances, the court used hybrid language that makes it\r\nclear that it entertained both contract and tort theories and\r\nremedies in this case, and properly so.  At oral argument,\r\nappellees agreed with PRASA that, under Ramos v. Orientalist Rattan\r\nFurniture, Inc., 1992 WL 755597 (Puerto Rico 1992), if a party is\r\ndamaged by acts or omissions that constitute both a breach of\r\ncontract and a breach of duty, the damaged party may make a tort\r\nclaim based on the breach of contract.  Appellees argue that this\r\nwas not the case here, but we disagree.  Lluch's negligence\r\nbreached both the construction contract and its duty not to cause\r\ndamage to others, so PRASA may seek to recover under either a tort\r\nor contract theory.\r\n    PRASA attempted to recover damages under a negligence\r\ntort theory.  Article 1054 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code states:\r\n    Those who in fulfilling their obligations are\r\n    guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay and\r\n    those who in any manner whatsoever act in\r\n    contravention of the stipulations of the same\r\n    shall be subject to indemnity for the losses\r\n    and damages caused thereby.\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3018.\r\n    Nowhere in the construction contract do the parties agree\r\nto limit Lluch's liability for any damages suffered by PRASA due to\r\nLluch's negligence.  Consequently, appellees may not assert the\r\ncontractual limits on breach of contract damages as a bar to\r\nPRASA's recovery in this case.  In short, the collapse of the roof\r\nstructure was found to be caused by Lluch's negligent construction\r\nand was clearly a reasonably foreseeable consequence of such\r\nnegligence.  Therefore, the cost of repairing the structure\r\nfollowing the collapse was properly recoverable by PRASA under a\r\ntort theory.  See id. (providing for recovery of \"losses and\r\ndamages\" against those who are negligent in fulfilling their\r\nobligations); P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33,  3024 (defining \"losses and\r\ndamages\" as those foreseen or which may have been foreseen at the\r\ntime of entering into the obligation).  \r\n    Appellees' second argument is that PRASA could prove no\r\ndamages in the amount of the cost to repair the structure because\r\nPRASA would never have incurred any such damages; Lluch would have. \r\nThe district court instructed the jury that PRASA was entitled to\r\nrecover any amount which will reasonably compensate it for any\r\ndamages it suffered as a result of Lluch's breach of contract or\r\nnegligence as of the date of the collapse on October 22, 1989;\r\nspecifically, the cost to repair the collapse.  Appellees argue\r\nthat PRASA would never have actually incurred the cost of repairing\r\nthe collapse, because that amount would have been absorbed by\r\nLluch.  Appellees argue that because Lluch had contracted to\r\ndeliver the completed structure, Article 1481 of the Civil Code\r\nallocated to Lluch any loss caused by destruction of the project\r\nbefore delivery.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33,  4122 (\"If the\r\nperson who contracted for the work bound himself to furnish the\r\nmaterials, he shall suffer the loss in case of the destruction of\r\nthe work before it is delivered, unless there has been a delay in\r\nreceiving it.\").  From this, appellees argue that, up until PRASA's\r\nunjustified demolition of the entire structure, Lluch was\r\nresponsible for absorbing the cost of repairing the collapsed\r\nstructure, not PRASA.  Appellees argue that this responsibility\r\ndisappeared when PRASA demolished the entire structure because\r\nLluch could no longer deliver the completed structure.\r\n    We cannot accept this argument as an explanation for how\r\nthe jury could reasonably have determined, consistently with its\r\nduty to follow the court's instructions, that PRASA was entitled to\r\nno damages.  Appellees' argument regarding the allocation of the\r\nburden of the collapse is a strictly legal theory that was never\r\npresented to the jury.  At oral argument, counsel for appellees was\r\nasked whether this theory was ever presented to the jury.  Counsel\r\nstated that the theory had been explained in the form of Eng.\r\nLluch's and Jimnez's testimony that the cost of repair was to be\r\nabsorbed by Lluch and was never to have been invoiced to PRASA. \r\nHowever, the fact that the jury heard testimony regarding Lluch's\r\nalleged intent that would give life to appellees' legal theory does\r\nnot mean that the jury was instructed on the legal theory itself. \r\nThe jury was specifically instructed that PRASA was entitled to\r\nrecover the cost of repairing the collapse.  The jury was not asked\r\nto first determine whether PRASA would have actually suffered the\r\ncost of repair if it had not demolished the structure.  Appellees\r\ndo not argue that they objected to this instruction and do not\r\ncross-appeal on this issue.  In fact, Appellees do not even appear\r\nto argue that this portion of the instruction was incorrect. \r\nRather, what appellees seem to argue is that the jury properly\r\nawarded no damages despite the existence of this instruction.  At\r\noral argument, appellees' counsel was asked whether it was\r\nerroneous to instruct the jury that PRASA was entitled to recover\r\nthe cost of repairing the collapse.  Counsel responded that it was\r\nnot erroneous to do so, but that PRASA failed to prove the amount. \r\nAs a result of appellees' failure to object, we accept this\r\ninstruction as correct and as the law of the case.  \r\n    We are left with a situation in which the court\r\ninstructed the jury that PRASA could recover the cost of repairing\r\nthe collapse, and PRASA showed that the cost of repairing the\r\ncollapse was significant.  We do not rule on whether the soil\r\nneeded to be improved before the structure could be repaired or\r\nwhether the cost of repairing the roof structure itself was closer\r\nto $470,000 or to $2,513,211.48.  We find only that, under any of\r\nthose theories, the evidence before the jury was that the cost of\r\nrepair was at least $470,000.  Consequently, a verdict of no\r\ndamages is not consonant with both the instructions given and the\r\nevidence presented.  We find that the jury abdicated its duty to\r\nfollow the instructions given by the district court, which resulted\r\nin a verdict that is against the clear weight of the evidence. \r\nAdditionally, we find that it was an abuse of the district court's\r\ndiscretion to deny PRASA's motion for a second partial new trial on\r\nthe issue of damages.  The judgment awarding PRASA no damages is\r\nvacated, and we remand for a new trial on the issue of damages.\r\n    B.  Redetermination of Settled Issues By the Second Jury \r\n    in Violation of the Seventh Amendment\r\n\nPRASA also argues that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in allowing the second jury, due to misleading jury\r\ninstructions and verdict forms, to redetermine the issues of\r\nLluch's liability and the existence of PRASA's damages.  PRASA\r\nclaims that these two issues were revisited by the second jury in\r\nviolation of the Seventh Amendment, which states that \"no fact\r\ntried by jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the\r\nUnited States, than according to the rules of the common law.\" \r\nU.S. Const. amend. VII.  \r\nWe summarily dismiss PRASA's claim that the jury was\r\nallowed to redetermine the issue of Lluch's liability.  PRASA\r\noffers nothing more than the absence of a jury award in support of\r\nits argument.  However, the jury was specifically instructed: (1)\r\nthat it had already been established that Lluch was negligent and\r\nbreached its contract with PRASA; (2) that Lluch's breach caused\r\nthe collapse of the structure; and (3) that PRASA was entitled to\r\nrecover any damages it suffered due to Lluch's negligence or\r\nbreach.  In light of these instructions, it simply cannot be said\r\nthat the 1997 jury was allowed to redetermine the question of\r\nLluch's liability.  In fact, the jury was specifically told that\r\nthis issue had been determined and that they should disregard any\r\ntestimony to the contrary.  Thus, we turn to PRASA's contention\r\nthat the jury was improperly allowed to redetermine the existence\r\nof PRASA's damages.\r\nPRASA argues that the district court violated the Seventh\r\nAmendment when it did not set aside the first jury's determination\r\nthat Lluch's negligence caused PRASA damages, but still allowed the\r\nsecond jury to redetermine the existence of PRASA's damages.  PRASA\r\nargues that the second jury should only have determined the extentof PRASA's damages, not whether PRASA suffered any damages at all. \r\nPRASA argues that the second jury was allowed to revisit this issue\r\nbecause the district court: (1) failed to instruct the jury that it\r\nwas already established that PRASA suffered damages; and (2)\r\nspecifically instructed the jury that it had the option of finding\r\nthat PRASA had not suffered any damages.\r\nPRASA cites several cases for the proposition that the\r\nSeventh Amendment requires district courts to conduct successive\r\ntrials in such a way that the same issue is not reexamined by\r\ndifferent juries.  Without addressing the questions of whether the\r\nauthority cited by PRASA adequately demonstrates such a Seventh\r\nAmendment principle or whether that principle is applicable in the\r\ncontext of a partial new trial on the issue of damages, we note\r\nthat no such principle was violated in this case.  The district\r\ncourt did not allow the second jury to redetermine the issue of\r\nwhether PRASA suffered damages.  It is true that the second jury\r\nwas not instructed that it had already been established that PRASA\r\nsuffered damages.  And it is also true that the second jury was\r\ninstructed that it could fail to award PRASA any damages at all. \r\nHowever, this instruction was given in the context of explaining to\r\nthe jury that it was PRASA's duty to establish the amount of any\r\ndamages caused by Lluch's negligence or breach of contract.  Seeid.  It is neither inaccurate nor an infringement on PRASA's\r\nSeventh Amendment rights to instruct the jury that PRASA could not\r\nrecover any damages if it failed to prove any damages at the\r\npartial new trial, whether the previous jury found that PRASA\r\nsuffered any damages or not.  To hold otherwise would be to hold\r\nthat the jury was obligated to award PRASA damages even if PRASA\r\nfailed to put on any evidence at all at the partial new trial. \r\nThis cannot be the case.  Thus, the district court did not err in\r\ninstructing the jury that it could fail to award PRASA any damages\r\nat all, despite the first jury's determination that PRASA was\r\ndamaged by Lluch's negligence. \r\nIn short, the district court did not err in failing to\r\norder a second partial new trial because of the alleged\r\nreexamination of issues by the second jury.  No such reexamination\r\nof issues actually occurred.\r\nC.  Unfair Influence on the Verdict Through Appellees'\r\nCounsel's Prejudicial Comments During Opening Statements\r\nand Closing Arguments\r\n\nPRASA's final contention as to why the district court\r\nshould have granted a second partial new trial on the issue of\r\ndamages is that appellees' counsel unfairly influenced the verdict\r\nwith two impermissible and prejudicial arguments to the jury. \r\nPRASA claims: (1) that CNA's counsel made improper reference to the\r\nlimits of Lluch's insurance policy with CNA during CNA's opening\r\nstatement; and (2) that Lluch's counsel made improper reference to\r\nPRASA's demolition of the structure during Lluch's closing\r\nargument.\r\nAbsent an abuse of discretion, we will defer to the\r\ndistrict court's denial of a motion for a new trial on the basis of\r\nimproper argument or conduct of counsel.  See Meyers v. Moody, 693\r\nF.2d 1196, 1220-21 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 920\r\n(1983); see also Johnson v. National Sea Prods., Ltd., 35 F.3d 626,\r\n631 (1st Cir. 1994).  In assessing the effect of improper conduct\r\nby counsel, the Court must examine the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, including the nature of the comments, their\r\nfrequency, their possible relevancy to the real issues before the\r\njury, the manner in which the parties and the court treated the\r\ncomments, the strength of the case, and the verdict itself.  SeeForrestal v. Magendantz, 848 F.2d 303, 309 (1st Cir. 1988)(quoting\r\nCity of Cleveland v. Peter Kiewit Sons' Co., 624 F.2d 749, 756 (6th\r\nCir. 1980)).  We reverse only upon a showing of prejudice.  SeeGonzlez-Marn v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 845 F.2d 1140,\r\n1147 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\nPRASA first complains of CNA's counsel's reference to\r\nLluch's policy limits in CNA's opening statement.  PRASA claims\r\nthat this was done for the sole reason of appealing to jury\r\nsympathy.  CNA pointed out that Lluch would have to pay most of the\r\nmillions sought by PRASA from its own funds, because the insurance\r\npolicy limit was $500,000.  However, the parties agree that the\r\ninsurance policy was admitted into evidence as Joint Exhibit VII. \r\nBecause the jury could have easily discovered the policy limits for\r\nitself, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion\r\nin refusing to grant a new trial on the basis of CNA's improper\r\nargument.\r\nPRASA next complains that it was improper for Lluch's\r\ncounsel to make reference to PRASA's demolition of the structure in\r\nhis closing argument.  However, because PRASA did not make a timely\r\nobjection to this statement, we review only for plain error.  SeeFernndez v. Corporacin Insular de Seguros, 79 F.3d 207, 210 (1st\r\nCir. 1996);  Johnson, 35 F.3d at 631 (citations omitted). \r\nWe do not find it to be plain error: (1) to allow Lluch's\r\ncounsel to refer to the demolition of the structure; or (2) to fail\r\nto grant a new trial on the basis of such a reference.  It was a\r\nstipulated fact that the demolition of the structure occurred in\r\nthe weeks following January 25, 1993.  Also, the jury was\r\nspecifically instructed that it had already been established that\r\nPRASA's demolition of the structure was unjustified.  In light of\r\nthe evidence and instructions with which the jury was provided, we\r\ndo not believe that Lluch's mention of the demolition during\r\nclosing argument resulted in any prejudice to PRASA.  \r\nIn sum, the district court did not err in failing to\r\ngrant a second partial new trial due to the reference to Lluch's\r\npolicy limits during CNA's opening statement or the reference to\r\nPRASA's demolition of the structure during Lluch's closing\r\nargument. \r\nIII.  Jury Verdict in Favor of Lluch's Counterclaims\r\nPRASA's final argument regards a portion of the 1993\r\nverdict that was not remitted:  the award of $756,471.59 in favor\r\nof Lluch on its counterclaims for breach of contract and amounts\r\nowed on the contract.  PRASA complains that this award was also\r\nagainst the weight of the evidence.\r\n\nA.  Preservation of This Issue On Appeal\r\nA motion for a new trial must be made in the first\r\ninstance before the trial court, particularly where the weight of\r\nthe evidence is at issue.  See Velzquez v. Figueroa-Gmez, 996\r\nF.2d 425, 427 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 993 (1993); Wells\r\nReal Estate v. Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 811\r\n(1st Cir.) (citing 6A Moore's Federal Practice  59.15[3], at 326-\r\n27 (2d ed. 1987)), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955 (1988).  The failure\r\nto move for a new trial waives the issue on appeal.  See Velzquez,\r\n996 F.2d at 427; Wells Real Estate, 850 F.2d at 811.\r\nPRASA did not move for a new trial on Lluch's\r\ncounterclaims.  However, following the judgment on Lluch's\r\ncounterclaims, PRASA filed a two-page motion for judgment as a\r\nmatter of law on those claims.  On October 27, 1995, the district\r\ndenied PRASA's motion.  The district court found that Lluch\r\npresented evidence: (1) that PRASA breached the contract; (2) that\r\nthis breach caused damages to Lluch; and (3) that PRASA owed Lluch\r\nmonies on the contract.  The district court found that the evidence\r\npresented was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to reach a\r\nverdict in favor of Lluch on its counterclaims.\r\nWhile PRASA's failure to file a motion for a new trial\r\nwould ordinarily require this Court to find that the issue has been\r\nwaived, the fact that PRASA filed a motion for judgment as a matter\r\nof law helps PRASA to avoid that result.  In Velzquez, the\r\nappellants sought to challenge the verdict as against the weight of\r\nthe evidence.  See Velzquez, 996 F.2d at 427.  We held that, even\r\nthough the appellants failed to make the appropriate motion for a\r\nnew trial before the district court, the issue was not waived\r\nbecause the appellants made a motion to set aside or amend the\r\nverdict.  See id.  We found that because the purpose of the\r\nappellants' motion was to challenge the verdict as against the\r\nweight of the evidence, the appellants should not have been deemed\r\nto have waived the issue.  See id.  We noted that the district\r\ncourt addressed the sufficiency argument and denied the motion\r\nbecause the jury's verdict was supported by the evidence.  See id. \r\nConsequently, we treated the appellants' motion as a motion for a\r\nnew trial and treated the appeal as an appeal of the denial of that\r\nmotion for a new trial.  See id.  \r\nThe same situation is presented in the present appeal:\r\n(1) PRASA made a motion challenging the verdict as against the\r\nweight of the evidence; (2) the district court addressed the\r\nsufficiency argument; and (3) the district court denied the motion\r\nbecause the jury's verdict was supported by the evidence. \r\nTherefore, we treat this appeal as an appeal from the denial of\r\nPRASA's motion for a new trial on Lluch's counterclaims.\r\nB.  Denial of PRASA's Motion for a New Trial on Lluch's\r\nCounterclaims\r\n\nAgain, the denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewed\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  See Bogosian, 104 F.3d at 482.  A verdict\r\nmay be set aside and a new trial ordered \"when the verdict is\r\nagainst the clear weight of the evidence, or is based upon evidence\r\nwhich is false, or will result in a clear miscarriage of justice.\" \r\nPhav, 915 F.2d at 766.\r\nPRASA points to the testimony of Jos A. Toro-Mercado, a\r\ncertified public accountant who PRASA claims testified on behalf of\r\nLluch that PRASA owed Lluch $2,121,956.35 as a result of change\r\norders, additional work, materials, and extended office overhead. \r\nPRASA claims that Toro-Mercado's testimony was based on three main,\r\nbut faulty, premises: (1) that Lebrn, the designer of the project,\r\nwas at fault for the collapse of the steel roof structure; (2) that\r\nall delays in the construction project were attributable to PRASA;\r\nand (3) that Lluch had worked at the project between August 1, 1988\r\nand October 20, 1990.\r\nPRASA argues that the first of these three premises was\r\ncontradicted by the 1993 jury verdict itself.  PRASA claims that\r\nthe 1993 jury specifically ruled that Lluch, not Lebrn, was solely\r\nliable to PRASA for the negligent removal of the surcharge that\r\ncaused the collapse of the structure.  PRASA argues that the second\r\npremise was also contradicted by the 1993 jury verdict and the\r\nevidence adduced at trial.  PRASA notes that the 1993 jury omitted\r\nany finding that PRASA had been solely responsible for the delays\r\nin the project.  PRASA also claims that all of the evidence\r\nregarding job certifications that was presented at trial showed\r\nthat Lluch or its subcontractors were as much responsible for the\r\ndelays as was PRASA.  PRASA also notes that \"the certifications\r\nwere reconciled during trial by the parties, clearly showing that\r\nPRASA was not remotely the sole responsible party for the delays in\r\nthe project.\"  Regarding the third premise, PRASA argues that there\r\nwas \"better evidence\" of the time period of Lluch's presence at the\r\nproject. \r\nPRASA's argument fails in several respects.  First, while\r\nthe 1993 jury found Lluch to have been liable, it did not find that\r\nLebrn was faultless.  The liability of Lebrn was not before the\r\njury, and the jury made no determinations regarding this issue.\r\nSecond, the \"omission\" of a finding that PRASA was solely\r\nresponsible for project delays is hardly a finding that PRASA was\r\nnot responsible for any delays that may have caused Lluch damages. \r\nThird, PRASA does not direct the Court to any of the evidence it\r\nclaims demonstrated Lluch's responsibility for delay in\r\nconstruction.  Fourth, even if the certifications were \"reconciled\"\r\nduring trial, PRASA does not explain to the Court how that \"clearly\r\nshow[s] that PRASA was not remotely the sole responsible party for\r\nthe delays in the project.\"  Fifth, PRASA makes no attempt to\r\nidentify the \"better evidence\" of an allegedly more accurate time\r\nperiod of Lluch's involvement in the project.\r\nFinally, and most importantly, the jury awarded Lluch\r\n$756,471.59 on its counterclaims, even though PRASA admits that\r\nToro-Mercado testified that PRASA owed Lluch $2,121,956.35.  It is\r\nquite possible that the jury questioned Toro-Mercado's three\r\npremises and reduced the damages award accordingly.  For example,\r\nthe jury may have reduced the award by the amount it determined\r\nthat Lluch was at fault for the delays.  Or it may have reduced the\r\naward because it did not agree that Lebrn was solely at fault for\r\nthe collapse.  Or it may have reduced the award because it believed\r\nthat the \"better evidence\" referred to by PRASA demonstrated that\r\nLluch was not on the job as long as it claimed.  This is, of\r\ncourse, all speculation, but PRASA does not offer any argument as\r\nto why the amount actually awarded was against the weight of the\r\nevidence.  PRASA offers several arguments that demonstrate why\r\nLluch should not have been granted all it requested, but the fact\r\nremains that Lluch was not granted all it requested.\r\nIn the jury verdict form, the 1993 jury found: (1) that\r\nPRASA breached its contract with Lluch; (2) that this breach caused\r\ndamages to Lluch in the amount of $138,758; and (3) that PRASA owed\r\nLluch $617,713.59 for work performed on the contract.  PRASA does\r\nnot offer any evidence or argument that Lluch did not in fact\r\nsuffer damages in the amount of $138,758 or that Lluch was not in\r\nfact owed $617,713.59 for work performed on the contract. \r\nConsequently, we reject PRASA's claims that the verdict was against\r\nthe weight of the evidence and leave undisturbed the judgment in\r\nfavor of Lluch on its counterclaims.\r\n                      CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the judgment awarding PRASA no\r\ndamages is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for a new trial on\r\nthe issue of damages.  The judgment awarding Lluch $756,471.59 on\r\nits counterclaims for breach of contract and amounts owed on the\r\ncontract is AFFIRMED.\n",

Before the Court is plaintiff-\r\nappellant Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority's (\"PRASA\")\r\nappeal from the district court's denial of PRASA's motion for a\r\nsecond partial new trial on damages.  At the first partial new\r\ntrial, the jury awarded PRASA no damages despite an earlier verdict\r\nfinding defendant-appellee Constructora Lluch, Inc. (\"Lluch\") to be\r\nnegligent and in breach of the construction contract between the\r\ntwo.  PRASA also appeals from a jury award on Lluch's counterclaims\r\nagainst PRASA for breach of contract and for amounts owed on the\r\ncontract.  For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the\r\njudgment awarding Lluch $756,471.59 on its counterclaims, but\r\nvacate the judgment awarding PRASA no damages on its claims and\r\nremand for a second partial new trial on the issue of damages.  \r\n                       BACKGROUND\r\n     This case arises out of the collapse, during\r\nconstruction, of the steel roof structure of the Mayaguez\r\nComposting Facility in October of 1989.  PRASA entertained bids for\r\nthe project and eventually awarded the project's design to Lebrn\r\nAssociates, an engineering and architecture firm.  In May of 1988,\r\nPRASA entered into a construction contract with Lluch to build the\r\nfacility.  Several months later, Lluch subcontracted with Richmond\r\nSteel, Inc. (\"RSI\") to manufacture and install the facility's steel\r\ncomponents, including the roof.\r\n     The Mayaguez facility was to be a compost treatment plant\r\ncomprised of a main building to deposit and treat compost and a\r\nseparate administrative building.  The main building was designed \r\nas two adjacent bays with three lines of columns to support two\r\nseparate steel frame roofs.   Among the plans and specifications\r\ndeveloped by Lebrn was a procedure to be followed for the\r\npreparation and consolidation of the soil.  Under the procedure,\r\nLluch was required: (1) to place a permanent landfill on the site;\r\n(2) to install wicks and pertinent instrumentation; (3) to place a\r\nsurcharge on the site; and (4) to leave the surcharge undisturbed\r\nfor a period of seven and a half months.  However, before the\r\nconsolidation of the soil was completed, Lluch removed the\r\nsurcharge from the soil in order to begin the concrete construction\r\nand in order to allow RSI to begin the steel erection.\r\nOn October 22, 1989, after RSI had erected a substantial\r\npart of the east portion of the steel roof structure, the\r\nuncompleted west portion of the steel roof structure collapsed.\r\nAfter the collapse, Lluch removed the collapsed steel frames and\r\ndebris, began to repair the damaged columns, and continued with\r\nconstruction of the remaining phases of the project, all with\r\nPRASA's authorization and under PRASA's supervision.  After Lluch\r\nhad substantially completed the construction of the project -- with\r\nthe exception of the steel roof structure -- PRASA demolished the\r\nentire project, over Lluch's objection.  \r\nOn October 10, 1990, this action was filed in United\r\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by RSI,\r\nseeking monetary and declaratory relief against PRASA, Lluch,\r\nLebrn, and their bonding and surety companies.  Several\r\ncounterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims followed, most\r\nof which were dismissed before trial.  Included in those rulings,\r\nthe district court dismissed PRASA's cross-claim under Article 1483\r\nof the Puerto Rico Civil Code against Lluch and RSI.  See Richmond\r\nSteel, Inc. v. Legal and Gen. Assurance Soc'y, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1412769\"><a href=\"/opinion/1412769/richmond-steel-v-legal-and-general-assur-soc/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445 (D.P.R. 1993).\r\nAt the first trial in 1993, some of the parties entered\r\ninto various stipulations, including the dismissal of original\r\nplaintiff RSI.  The district court then realigned the parties to\r\ncontinue the trial.  As a result, PRASA became the plaintiff, and\r\nLluch, Lebrn, and CNA Casualty of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"CNA\")\r\nremained as defendants.  On August 9, 1993, after a twenty-four day\r\ntrial, the jury, in a special verdict form, found: (1) that Lluch\r\nimproperly removed the surcharge from the construction site or in\r\nsome other way breached its contract with PRASA by negligent\r\nconstruction work; (2) that this breach caused the collapse of the\r\nroof structure; (3) that this breach caused damages to PRASA; (4)\r\nthat PRASA's demolition of the remains of the structure was\r\nunjustified; and (5) that PRASA suffered $4,587,202.77 in damages\r\nas a result of Lluch's breach.  With regard to the counterclaims\r\nagainst PRASA, the jury found: (1) that PRASA breached its contract\r\nwith Lluch; (2) that this breach caused damages to Lluch in the\r\namount of $138,758; (3) that PRASA owed Lluch $617,713.59 for work\r\nperformed on the contract; and (4) that PRASA owed Lebrn\r\n$40,148.28 on the contract.  As a result of these findings, the\r\njury awarded: (1) $4,587,202.77 to PRASA for Lluch's negligence and\r\nbreach of contract; (2) $756,471.59 to Lluch on its counterclaims\r\nagainst PRASA for breach of contract and money owed on the\r\ncontract; and (3) $40,148.28 to Lebrn on its counterclaim against\r\nPRASA for money owed on the contract.\r\nOn October 15, 1993, the district court issued a judgment\r\nconsistent with the damages awarded by the jury.  In an order\r\nissued the same day, the district court advised counsel that all\r\npost-trial motions were required to be filed or renewed within 10\r\ndays of the date of the judgment.  On October 21, 1993, CNA and\r\nLluch filed a timely motion for a new trial on PRASA's claims.  On\r\nNovember 4, 1993 -- twenty days after the entry of judgment --\r\nPRASA filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law with regard to\r\nLluch's counterclaims.\r\nOn July 27, 1994, the court granted CNA and Lluch's\r\nmotion for a new trial, subject to PRASA's acceptance of a\r\nremittitur.  The court concluded that the jury award was excessive\r\nin light of the evidence presented.  The court then gave PRASA the\r\noption of accepting a remitted award of $1,224,000 or a partial new\r\ntrial on damages.  PRASA opted for a new trial. \r\nOn March 24, 1995, the court denied PRASA's motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law on Lluch's counterclaims.  The court\r\nfound that the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury\r\nto reach a verdict in favor of Lluch on those claims.\r\nOn February 7, 1996, the court set the scope of the\r\npartial new trial on damages for PRASA's claims.  The court held\r\nthat the new trial would be limited only to the extent of PRASA's \r\ndamages at the time of the collapse.  The court concluded that,\r\nbecause the jury in the first trial found that PRASA was\r\nunjustified in demolishing the structure, damages would be limited\r\nto the cost to repair the collapse as of October 22, 1989, the date\r\nof the collapse.\r\nAt the partial new trial, PRASA presented evidence that\r\nthe soil conditions at the site were unstable and were experiencing\r\nsettlement beyond what was expected.  PRASA's experts testified\r\nthat the soil had to be improved in order to repair the collapse,\r\neither through placing a new surcharge on the site or by installing\r\npiles to support the structure.  PRASA's experts testified that\r\nonly the option of installing piles was feasible, but that it would\r\ncost in excess of $6 million to do.  Lluch and CNA presented\r\ntestimony that the soil did not have to be improved to repair the\r\ncollapse and that it would have cost approximately $500,000 to\r\nrepair the damage.  Lluch and CNA also presented testimony that\r\nLluch intended to absorb the costs of repair and that PRASA was\r\nnever going to be charged for those costs.\r\nThe court instructed the jury: (1) that PRASA was\r\nentitled to claim the extent of any damages it suffered at the time\r\nof the collapse on October 22, 1989; and (2) that those damages\r\nwere limited to the cost to repair the collapse.  The court also\r\ninstructed the jury to accept as established facts: (1) that Lluch\r\nimproperly removed the surcharge or breached its contract in some\r\nother way by negligent construction; (2) that this breach or\r\nnegligence caused the collapse; and (3) that PRASA's subsequent\r\ndemolition of the structure was unjustified.  The court informed\r\nthe jury that if PRASA failed to establish the amount of damages\r\ncaused by Lluch, then PRASA was not entitled to collect any\r\ndamages.  The court then submitted a verdict form to the jury that\r\nasked whether PRASA suffered any damages, and if so, the amount of\r\nthose damages.\r\nOn July 15, 1997, the jury returned the verdict form\r\nindicating that it found that PRASA suffered no damages.  Judgment\r\nwas entered the next day, ordering that PRASA take nothing from\r\nLluch and CNA.\r\nOn August 1, 1997, PRASA filed a motion for a second\r\npartial new trial on the issue of damages or for reinstatement of\r\nthe 1993 verdict.  On December 11, 1997, the court entered an\r\nOpinion and Order denying PRASA's motion.  On December 22, 1997,\r\nPRASA filed a motion to alter or amend the December 11, 1997\r\nOpinion and Order.  On January 22, 1998, the court denied PRASA's\r\nmotion to alter or amend by Endorsed Order.  The Court photocopied\r\nthe motion, wrote \"Denied\" in the margin of the photocopy, and\r\nreferred the parties to the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order. \r\nOn January 27, 1998, PRASA filed a notice of appeal from the\r\nJuly 16, 1997 judgment, the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order,\r\nand the January 22, 1998 Endorsed Order.\r\n                       DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Jurisdiction\r\nBefore we reach the merits, we must first address\r\nappellees' contention that we lack jurisdiction over PRASA's\r\nappeal.  The docket reflects the following chain of relevant\r\nevents:\r\n     July 16, 1997 - The district court entered judgment\r\n     awarding no damages to PRASA;\r\n     August 1, 1997 - PRASA filed a Rule 59(b) motion for a\r\n     second partial new trial on damages or for\r\n     reinstatement of the prior verdict;\r\n     December 11, 1997 - The district court entered an\r\n     Opinion and Order denying PRASA's motion for a second\r\n     partial new trial on damages;\r\n     December 22, 1997 - PRASA filed a motion to alter or\r\n     amend the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order;\r\n     January 22, 1998 - The district court denied PRASA's\r\n     motion to alter or amend by entering an Endorsed Order. \r\n     The Endorsed Order consisted of a photocopy of PRASA's\r\n     motion to alter or amend, with a notation in the margin\r\n     signed by the district judge.  The notation stated:\r\n     \"Denied.  See docket no. 624  .\"  Docket No. 624 is the\r\n     court's December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order;\r\n     January 27, 1998 - PRASA filed its notice of appeal\r\n     from the July 16, 1997 judgment, the December 11, 1997\r\n     Opinion and Order, and the January 22, 1998 Endorsed\r\n     Order.\r\nAppellees argue that appellate jurisdiction is lacking\r\nbecause PRASA's December 22, 1997 motion to alter or amend the\r\nDecember 11, 1997 Opinion and Order did not toll the time to appeal\r\nthe judgment or the Opinion and Order.  Federal Rule of Appellate\r\nProcedure 4(a)(4)(C) provides that the filing of a motion to alter\r\nor amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e)\r\ntolls the time for appeal until the district court issues an order\r\ndisposing of the motion.  Appellees claim that PRASA's motion is\r\nnot really a motion to alter or amend the December 11, 1997 Opinion\r\nand Order because it requested the same relief sought by the motion\r\nfor a second partial new trial, and did so on the same grounds. \r\nAppellees argue that PRASA's motion to alter or amend is really a\r\nmotion to reconsider the July 16, 1997 judgment.  Appellees point\r\nout that the motion to alter or amend is, in some places, an exact\r\nverbatim copy of the motion for a new trial.  Appellees further\r\nclaim that even the non-verbatim portions merely recast the\r\narguments of the motion for a new trial with the addition of\r\nquotations from the trial transcript.\r\nAppellees correctly note that the filing of a motion to\r\nreconsider will only toll the time for appeal if the motion is\r\nfiled no later than ten days after the entry of the judgment from\r\nwhich reconsideration is sought.  See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(F). \r\nAppellees claim that since PRASA's December 22, 1997 motion is\r\nreally a motion to reconsider the July 16, 1997 judgment, it needed\r\nto be filed within ten days of July 16, 1997 to have any effect on\r\nthe time to appeal.  In support of this position, appellees cite\r\nAcevedo-Villalobos v. Hernndez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195330\"><a href=\"/opinion/195330/acevedo-villalobos-v-hon-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.), cert.\r\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994).  In Acevedo-Villalobos, the Court was\r\nfaced with a situation in which the district court entered a\r\njudgment of dismissal and the plaintiffs filed one post-judgment\r\nmotion within 10 days of the judgment and another post-judgment\r\nmotion more than 10 days from the entry of judgment.  See id. at\r\n389-90.  Even though the second motion purported to request\r\nreconsideration of the denial of the first motion, the Court found\r\nthat the second motion was \"an obvious attempt to have the district\r\ncourt revisit the legal basis for\" the original judgment of\r\ndismissal.  Id. at 390.  The Court noted that the second motion\r\nrequested the same relief that the first motion requested, and did\r\nso on the same grounds.  See id.  Therefore, the Court treated the\r\nsecond motion as a motion to reconsider the original judgment of\r\ndismissal.  See id.  Because the second motion was untimely as such\r\na motion to reconsider, the Court found: (1) that it did not extend\r\nthe tolling of the time to appeal the original judgment of\r\ndismissal; and (2) that it did not toll the time to appeal the\r\ndenial of the first post-judgment motion.  See id. \r\nAppellees argue that the same result should follow in the\r\npresent case because the December 22, 1997 motion is really a\r\nmotion to reconsider the July 16, 1997 judgment and because the\r\nmotion was filed over five months after the July 16, 1997 judgment. \r\nFrom this, appellees argue: (1) that the time to appeal the\r\nJuly 16, 1997 judgment was tolled only by the filing of the Rule\r\n59(b) motion for a second partial new trial and therefore expired\r\non January 11, 1998; (2) that the time to appeal the December 11,\r\n1997 Opinion and Order was never tolled and also expired on\r\nJanuary 11, 1998; and (3) that there was no time to appeal the\r\nJanuary 22, 1998 Order, because the untimeliness of the motion to\r\nreconsider deprived the district court of jurisdiction to decide\r\nit.\r\nWe cannot accept appellees' contentions.  We are faced\r\nwith a different situation than that presented in Acevedo-\r\nVillalobos.  In that case, the Court found that the tolling\r\nterminated with the denial of the first post-judgment motion.  SeeAcevedo-Villalobos, 22 F.3d at 390.  In the present case, however, \r\nthe December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order -- the order denying\r\nPRASA's first post-judgment motion -- did not stop the tolling of\r\nthe time to appeal the July 16, 1997 judgment because, as discussed\r\nbelow, it was not a \"final judgment\" in compliance with the\r\n\"separate document\" rule of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58.  \r\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) provides that\r\nthe tolling commenced by the filing of a proper post-judgment\r\nmotion continues until \"the entry of the order disposing of the\r\nlast such motion outstanding.\"  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4). \r\nSubsection (a)(7) states that \"a judgment or order is entered\r\nwithin the meaning of this Rule 4(a) when it is entered in\r\ncompliance with Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure.\"  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7).  Therefore, in order to halt\r\nthe tolling of the time to appeal, an order denying a tolling post-\r\njudgment motion must comply with Rule 58.

Because we find below that the December 11, 1997\r\nOpinion and Order did not comply with Rule 58, we find that it did\r\nnot stop the tolling of the time to appeal the July 16, 1997\r\njudgment.\r\nRule 58 states that \"[e]very judgment shall be set forth\r\non a separate document\" and that \"[a] judgment is only effective\r\nwhen so set forth.\"  Fed.

Because PRASA's motion for a second partial new\r\ntrial was a Rule 59(b) motion, it fits within Fiore's \"uniform\r\napproach for all orders denying post-judgment motions under Rules\r\n50(b), 52(b) and 59(b) and (e), as well as under Rule 60(b).\"  Id.at 232.  Thus, the Opinion and Order denying PRASA's motion for a\r\nsecond partial new trial must comply with Rule 58.\r\nThe December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order was a five-page\r\nopinion which considered PRASA's motion for a second partial new\r\ntrial.  In the Opinion and Order, the district court addressed and\r\nrejected each of PRASA's arguments in turn, using explanatory\r\nlanguage to give its reason for each rejection.  The Opinion and\r\nOrder concluded with the following statements: \"Accordingly, the\r\nCourt hereby denies the motion for a new trial.  IT IS SO ORDERED.\" \r\nAppellees argue that the Opinion and Order, by itself,\r\nwas a separate document, as contemplated by Rule 58.  Appellees\r\nclaim that the Opinion and Order was originated by the district\r\ncourt as a separate piece of paper and that the Opinion and Order\r\ndiscussed the merits of PRASA's motion for a new trial.  Appellees\r\nfurther claim that there was no margin for confusion or uncertainty\r\nas to the finality of the order.  Appellees cite Hollywood v. City\r\nof Santa Mara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530043\"><a href=\"/opinion/530043/marian-hollywood-v-city-of-santa-maria-dorothy-lyman-michael-a-maramonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1231 (9th Cir. 1989), for its\r\nholding that a separate document was not required to accompany a\r\nnine-page order denying a Rule 59 motion for a new trial.  In that\r\ncase, the Ninth Circuit noted that it had previously held that\r\ncompliance with Rule 58 \"requires entry of a document distinct from\r\nany opinion or memorandum.\"  Id. at 1231 (citing Allah v. Superior\r\nCourt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520670\"><a href=\"/opinion/520670/al-hakim-allah-v-superior-court-of-the-state-of-california-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 890 (9th Cir. 1989); Vernon v.

The Hollywood court then refused\r\nto extend this rule to the context of orders denying Rule 59\r\nmotions.  See id.  The court found that the risk of confusion\r\nregarding finality does not exist in the context of denials of Rule\r\n59 motions for a new trial.  See id. at 1232.  The court held that\r\nthe order denying the Rule 59 motion \"definitively signaled the end\r\nof the litigation.\"  Id.    \r\nIn relying on Hollywood, appellees make an argument\r\ndirectly at odds with this Court's holding in Fiore.  In Fiore, the\r\nCourt held that \"technical compliance with the [separate document\r\nrequirement] is as necessary in the post-judgment context as it is\r\nin disposing of the merits.\"  Fiore, 960 F.2d at 235.  The Court\r\nrecognized that the uncertainty that prompted the separate document\r\nrule would be less likely to occur with respect to post-judgment\r\norders than for initial judgments.  See id. at 234.  Nonetheless,\r\nthe Court stated that, because some uncertainty will always exist,\r\nconsistency and clarity would be better achieved by following the\r\nrules as written than by trying to distinguish one type of judgment\r\nor order from another.  See id.  In footnote 9, the Court stated\r\nthat Hollywood was \"at odds with our conclusion that post-judgment\r\nmotions should be treated identically with judgments on the\r\nmerits.\"  Id. at 235 n.9.  Therefore, appellees' reliance on\r\nHollywood is misplaced; we are bound by Fiore's holding that orders\r\ndenying Rule 59(b) motions are subject to the separate document\r\nrequirement of Rule 58.\r\nAppellees cannot escape the fact that the December 11,\r\n1997 Opinion and Order was a five-page explanatory opinion denying\r\nPRASA's motion that was not accompanied by a separate one-line\r\njudgment.  This does not comply with the separate document\r\nrequirement of Rule 58.  Several courts have found that detailed\r\nopinions similar to the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order violate\r\nthe separate document requirement because they were not accompanied\r\nby a short separate judgment.  See, e.g., Baker v. Mercedes Benz of\r\nNorth America, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741017\"><a href=\"/opinion/741017/jerry-baker-jerry-baker-v-mercedes-benz-of-north-america-daimler-benz-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding that Rule\r\n58 was not satisfied by an extensive written opinion concluding\r\nwith the sentence: \"This is a final judgment\", because there was no\r\nseparate document judgment); Barber v.

We recognize the irony in finding that an Opinion and\r\nOrder is not an effectively final judgment because it contains\r\npages of explanatory language and reasoning.  However, this Court's\r\nconcerns for certainty and predictability in Fiore gave rise to a\r\nuniform rule of technical compliance.  Consequently, we find that\r\nthe December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order did not comply with the\r\nseparate document requirement of Rule 58.  Therefore, the\r\nDecember 11, 1997 Opinion and Order did not stop the tolling of the\r\ntime to appeal the July 16, 1997 judgment.\r\nEven though the December 11, 1997 Opinion and Order was\r\nnot a final judgment in compliance with the separate document\r\nrequirement of Rule 58, we nevertheless have jurisdiction over the\r\nappeal if the parties are found to have waived the separate\r\ndocument requirement.  In Bankers Trust v. Mallis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109822\"><a href=\"/opinion/109822/bankers-trust-co-v-mallis/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n386 (1978), the Supreme Court stated that judicial efficiency\r\nrequires that the parties be able to waive the separate document\r\nrequirement in order to avoid the pointless exercise of dismissing\r\nthe appeal only to have it refiled when the district court enters\r\nthe required separate document.  The Court then went on to find\r\nwaiver in that case because the petitioner (who was the appellee at\r\nthe circuit level) did not object to the taking of the appeal in\r\nthe absence of a separate judgment.  See id. at 387-88.  We have\r\npreviously applied this waiver principle \"where both parties waive\r\nthe requirement and neither party would be prejudiced or misled by\r\nthe lack of a separate document.\"  Wang Laboratories, Inc. v.\r\nApplied Computer Sciences, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556398\"><a href=\"/opinion/556398/wang-laboratories-inc-v-applied-computer-sciences-inc-james-abbenhaus/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (1st Cir. 1991); \r\nsee also Smith v.

We have also stated that \"the separate\r\ndocument requirement should always be interpreted to prevent the\r\nloss of the right to appeal, not to facilitate loss.\"  Fiore, 960\r\nF.2d at 236-37 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nIn the present case, both PRASA and appellees have waived\r\nthe separate document requirement.  PRASA clearly waived the\r\nrequirement when it filed its notice of appeal in the absence of a\r\ntrue final judgment.  See id. at 236 n.10.  Appellees waived the\r\nrequirement by failing to object at any point to the taking of an\r\nappeal in the absence of a separate document.  To date, appellees\r\nhave never claimed that no separate document has issued or that\r\nthis appeal may not proceed because no separate document has\r\nissued.  Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of\r\njurisdiction, but this motion claimed that the January 27, 1998\r\nnotice of appeal was untimely, an argument which is predicated on\r\nthe validity and finality of the December 11, 1997 Opinion and\r\nOrder.  Appellees did not raise the separate document issue in any\r\nform until the Court denied the motion to dismiss the appeal and\r\nspecifically inquired about compliance with the separate document\r\nrule.  Appellees' current position is that the Opinion and Order is\r\na separate document and therefore the notice of appeal was\r\nuntimely, so appellees do not, even today, object to the taking of\r\nan appeal in the absence of a separate document.   \r\nNor does it appear that either PRASA or appellees have\r\nbeen prejudiced or misled by the lack of a separate document. \r\nAppellees apparently did not even suspect that the December 11,\r\n1997 Opinion and Order was insufficient until the Court's request\r\nfor briefing on the issue.  PRASA was not prejudiced or misled by\r\nthe lack of a separate document because it took steps -- in the\r\nform of the December 22, 1997 motion to alter or amend and the\r\nJanuary 27, 1998 notice of appeal -- to ensure that it was not\r\nsleeping on its appellate rights.  Therefore, under Bankers Trust,\r\nSmith, and Wang, we find that the parties have waived the separate\r\ndocument requirement of Rule 58.  Consequently, we have\r\njurisdiction over the present appeal even though the December 11,\r\n1997 Opinion and Order was not a valid final judgment in compliance\r\nwith Rule 58.  \r\nII. The District Court's Denial of PRASA's Motion For a Second   \r\nPartial New Trial on the Issue of Damages\r\n\n    PRASA argues that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in denying PRASA's motion for a second partial new trial\r\non the issue of damages.  PRASA argues that a second partial new\r\ntrial should have been granted because: (1) the jury verdict\r\nawarding no damages was against the demonstrable weight of the\r\nevidence; (2) the district court erred in allowing the jury to\r\nredetermine issues already determined by the first jury; and (3)\r\nappellees' counsel made improper and prejudicial remarks to the\r\njury during opening and closing statements. \r\n    The denial of a new trial is reviewed for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  Bogosian v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733243\"><a href=\"/opinion/733243/elizabeth-v-bogosian-v-mercedes-benz-of-north-america-inc-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 482 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    A.       Jury Verdict Against the Weight of the Evidence\r\n    PRASA first argues that the 1997 jury verdict was against\r\nthe weight of the evidence because it was inadequate to compensate\r\nPRASA for its damages.  A verdict may be set aside and a new trial\r\nordered \"when the verdict is against the clear weight of the\r\nevidence, or is based upon evidence which is false, or will result\r\nin a clear miscarriage of justice.\"  Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548929\"><a href=\"/opinion/548929/chat-phav-v-trueblood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 766 (1st Cir. 1990)(citing Torres-Troche v. Municipality\r\nof Yauco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522156\"><a href=\"/opinion/522156/carlos-torres-troche-v-municipality-of-yauco/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1989)).\r\n    PRASA argues that the clear weight of the evidence at the\r\npartial new trial established that PRASA suffered significant\r\ndamages.  The jury in the first trial found that Lluch had been\r\nnegligent in breaching its contract with PRASA, that Lluch's breach\r\ncaused the collapse of the structure, and that this breach caused\r\ndamages to PRASA.  While the district court set aside the amount of\r\ndamages awarded as excessive, it did not set aside the jury's\r\nfinding of negligence or the jury's finding that this negligence\r\ncaused PRASA damages.  Rather, the district court specifically\r\ninstructed the second jury to accept those two determinations. \r\nThen, the district court set the parameters for the amount PRASA\r\ncould recover by instructing the second jury that:\r\n    PRASA is entitled to recover an amount which\r\n    will reasonably compensate it for any damages\r\n    it had suffered as a result of Lluch's breach\r\n    of contract or negligence as of the date of\r\n    the collapse on October 22, 1989. \r\n    Specifically, PRASA is entitled to recover the\r\n    cost to repair the collapse. \r\n\n    PRASA argues that the clear weight of the evidence\r\npresented at the partial trial showed that it suffered significant\r\ndamages as of the date of the collapse.  PRASA breaks down the cost\r\nof repair into two components: (1) the cost of preparing the soil\r\nto support the repaired roof structure; and (2) the cost of\r\nrepairing the roof structure itself.  The first component was\r\nsought by PRASA as the cost of the stabilization of the soil or the\r\ninstallation of piling support at the construction site.  PRASA\r\nnotes that the first jury determined: (1) that Lluch improperly\r\nremoved the surcharge from the soil at the construction site or in\r\nother ways acted negligently in breaching its contract with PRASA;\r\nand (2) that Lluch's improper removal caused the collapse of the\r\nroof structure.  PRASA argues that the cost of repair must include\r\nthe cost of stabilization or piling support because it would be\r\nfutile to attempt to install the roof structure again without first\r\nimproving or supporting the soil. \r\n    In an attempt to prove that the soil at the site must be\r\nimproved or supported before repair of the structure could begin,\r\nPRASA offered the testimony of Engineers Carlos Ortiz, Angel\r\nHerrera, and Alan Crumley.  Ortiz testified that he conducted soil\r\nexploration at the site after the collapse and that he determined\r\nthat the soil had settled nearly 70 cm, almost twice the settlement\r\nexpected when the site was originally analyzed in 1986.  Ortiz also\r\ndetected settlement of the concrete columns on which the new roof\r\nstructure would be installed.  Ortiz concluded that because the\r\nconsolidation and settlement of the soil was ongoing at the time of\r\nthe collapse, the soil needed to be treated in order to build on\r\nit.  Herrera, an expert in design, construction and estimates of\r\ncosts of repairs of failures or collapses of structures, testified\r\nthat, at the time of the collapse, the soil at the site was notcompetent to support the building as designed. Crumley testified\r\nthat he analyzed the soil in 1995 and found that primary\r\nsettlements were still occurring and were therefore occurring at\r\nthe time of the collapse at a rapid rate.  Crumley opined that\r\nrepairing the collapse in 1989 would have required either improving\r\nthe soil or installing piles. \r\n    The district court apparently agreed with PRASA's\r\nassertion that the soil had to be improved before the structure\r\ncould be repaired.  Appellees objected to testimony regarding soil\r\nimprovement measures as beyond the scope of the cost of repairing\r\nthe collapse, but the court overruled those objections and stated\r\nthat \"to repair he's got to do that.\" \r\n    PRASA attempted to quantify how much it would cost to\r\nimprove the soil or install piles through Herrera's testimony. \r\nHerrera first considered the option of surcharging the soil, but\r\nrejected that alternative because of the uncertainty of the\r\nsettlement.  Therefore, Herrera recommended the second alternative:\r\ninstalling piles for support.  Herrera testified that properly\r\ninstalling piles for support would require the following steps (and\r\ncosts): (1) removing portions of the floor slab ($82,500); (2)\r\ninstalling piles ($3,201,000); (3) raising the existing footings\r\n($440,000); (4) installing new footings to connect the piles with\r\nthe existing footings ($423,835); (5) building concrete foundation\r\nbeams ($510,044); and (6) building a new floor slab ($1,220,740). \r\nHerrera testified that these steps would cost $5,878,119, plus a\r\nsix percent consulting fee, for a total cost of improving the soil\r\nof $6,230,806. \r\n    The second component of the cost of repair sought by\r\nPRASA was the repair of the roof structure itself.  PRASA argues\r\nthat the evidence of the cost of reinstalling the collapsed roof\r\nvaried from $470,000 to $2,513,211.48.  PRASA first points to the\r\ntestimony of Lluch's expert, Engineer Rafael Jimnez.  Jimnez\r\ntestified that repairing the roof structure would require repairing\r\nand installing the steel trusses ($420,000), repairing the concrete\r\ncolumns ($21,000), and removing the twisted steel ($70,000), for a\r\ntotal of $511,000.  Engineer Edison Lluch also testified for\r\ndefendants regarding the cost to repair the collapse.  Eng. Lluch\r\nagreed with Jimnez that those three steps needed to be undertaken,\r\nbut disagreed with Jimnez's estimate of cost.  Eng. Lluch\r\nestimated the steps to cost $421,000, $20,000, and $29,000,\r\nrespectively, for a total of $470,000. \r\n    For the highest estimated cost of repair, PRASA points to\r\nthe cross-examination of Eng. Lluch, during which PRASA claims that\r\nEng. Lluch acknowledged that he had written a letter to Seaboard\r\nSurety Company claiming $2,513,211.48 for repair of the structure. \r\nIn that letter, PRASA claims that Eng. Lluch included estimates on\r\nhow much it would cost: (1) to remove the collapsed structure; (2)\r\nto replace the damaged steel structure; (3) to install the steel\r\nstructure; and (4) to repair the damage to the concrete columns.\r\nHowever, Eng. Lluch also testified that much of the claimed amount\r\nwas not related to the collapse, but was related to the fact that\r\nRichmond abandoned the project.  PRASA does not itemize the\r\n$2,513,211.48 claim to explain how much was claimed by Lluch as\r\nrepair for the collapse and how much was claimed because Richmond\r\nabandoned the project. \r\n    In total, PRASA claims that the jury was presented\r\nevidence that the soil would cost $6,230,806 to improve and that\r\nthe steel roof structure would cost anywhere from $470,000 to\r\n$2,513,211.48 to repair. PRASA argues that the jury verdict\r\nawarding no damages was clearly contrary to the weight of this\r\nevidence.\r\n    In response, appellees offer two arguments.  First,\r\nappellees raise the legal argument that PRASA was not legally\r\nentitled to compensation for the collapse.   Appellees argue that\r\nClauses V and VIII of the construction contract provided PRASA with\r\na choice of remedies in the event of a breach by Lluch.  Clause V\r\nprovided that if Lluch failed in the performance of the contract,\r\nPRASA could hire a substitute contractor to complete the work at\r\nLluch's expense.  Appellees describe this remedy as the \"in natura\"\r\nremedy for breach of contract.  Clause VIII was a penalty clause\r\nthat obligated Lluch to pay PRASA $1,400 for each day that\r\ncompletion of the project was delayed due to Lluch's failure to\r\nfulfill its obligations.  \r\n    Appellees argue that Clauses V and VIII, in conjunction,\r\nprovide the only remedies available to PRASA:  specific performance\r\nor substitute performance, with Lluch paying the liquidated late\r\nfees or cost overruns.  Appellees cite Article 1106 of the Puerto\r\nRico Civil Code for the proposition that, in obligations that\r\ninclude a penalty clause, the penalty shall substitute indemnity\r\nfor damages.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3131.  Appellees also\r\ncite Rodrguez Cancel v. A.E.E., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995),\r\nin support of their argument that, by contracting for the \"in\r\nnatura\" remedy, the parties precluded the recovery of monetary\r\ndamages.  Appellees argue that, instead of choosing one of those\r\nremedies, PRASA unjustifiably demolished the entire structure,\r\nmaking it impossible for either Lluch or a substitute contractor to\r\nfinish the project.  From this, appellees claim that PRASA opted\r\nout of both remedies available to it, and therefore is not entitled\r\nto recover monetary damages now.\r\n    We reject appellees' first argument because it ignores\r\nthe fact that PRASA did not bring its claim solely under a breach\r\nof contract theory.  Appellees may well be correct that PRASA's\r\nremedies for a pure breach of contract action are limited to the\r\nremedies provided in the contract.  However, while the exact nature\r\nof PRASA's claims is not at all clear from the record, this was not\r\na pure breach of contract action.  The district court treated the\r\naction as a breach of contract action in which the claimed breach\r\nof contract was Lluch's negligent construction.  The district court\r\nasked the first jury: \"Do you find that Constructora Lluch\r\nimproperly removed the surcharge from the construction site or in\r\nany other way breached its contract with PRASA by negligent\r\nconstruction work?\"   Similarly, the district court instructed the\r\nsecond jury to accept as an established fact that Lluch \"breached\r\nits contract with PRASA by negligent construction work.\"  In\r\nnumerous instances, the court used hybrid language that makes it\r\nclear that it entertained both contract and tort theories and\r\nremedies in this case, and properly so.  At oral argument,\r\nappellees agreed with PRASA that, under Ramos v. Orientalist Rattan\r\nFurniture, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755597</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Puerto Rico 1992), if a party is\r\ndamaged by acts or omissions that constitute both a breach of\r\ncontract and a breach of duty, the damaged party may make a tort\r\nclaim based on the breach of contract.  Appellees argue that this\r\nwas not the case here, but we disagree.  Lluch's negligence\r\nbreached both the construction contract and its duty not to cause\r\ndamage to others, so PRASA may seek to recover under either a tort\r\nor contract theory.\r\n    PRASA attempted to recover damages under a negligence\r\ntort theory.  Article 1054 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code states:\r\n    Those who in fulfilling their obligations are\r\n    guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay and\r\n    those who in any manner whatsoever act in\r\n    contravention of the stipulations of the same\r\n    shall be subject to indemnity for the losses\r\n    and damages caused thereby.\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3018.\r\n    Nowhere in the construction contract do the parties agree\r\nto limit Lluch's liability for any damages suffered by PRASA due to\r\nLluch's negligence.  Consequently, appellees may not assert the\r\ncontractual limits on breach of contract damages as a bar to\r\nPRASA's recovery in this case.  In short, the collapse of the roof\r\nstructure was found to be caused by Lluch's negligent construction\r\nand was clearly a reasonably foreseeable consequence of such\r\nnegligence.  Therefore, the cost of repairing the structure\r\nfollowing the collapse was properly recoverable by PRASA under a\r\ntort theory.  See id. (providing for recovery of \"losses and\r\ndamages\" against those who are negligent in fulfilling their\r\nobligations); P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33,  3024 (defining \"losses and\r\ndamages\" as those foreseen or which may have been foreseen at the\r\ntime of entering into the obligation).  \r\n    Appellees' second argument is that PRASA could prove no\r\ndamages in the amount of the cost to repair the structure because\r\nPRASA would never have incurred any such damages; Lluch would have. \r\nThe district court instructed the jury that PRASA was entitled to\r\nrecover any amount which will reasonably compensate it for any\r\ndamages it suffered as a result of Lluch's breach of contract or\r\nnegligence as of the date of the collapse on October 22, 1989;\r\nspecifically, the cost to repair the collapse.  Appellees argue\r\nthat PRASA would never have actually incurred the cost of repairing\r\nthe collapse, because that amount would have been absorbed by\r\nLluch.  Appellees argue that because Lluch had contracted to\r\ndeliver the completed structure, Article 1481 of the Civil Code\r\nallocated to Lluch any loss caused by destruction of the project\r\nbefore delivery.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33,  4122 (\"If the\r\nperson who contracted for the work bound himself to furnish the\r\nmaterials, he shall suffer the loss in case of the destruction of\r\nthe work before it is delivered, unless there has been a delay in\r\nreceiving it.\").  From this, appellees argue that, up until PRASA's\r\nunjustified demolition of the entire structure, Lluch was\r\nresponsible for absorbing the cost of repairing the collapsed\r\nstructure, not PRASA.  Appellees argue that this responsibility\r\ndisappeared when PRASA demolished the entire structure because\r\nLluch could no longer deliver the completed structure.\r\n    We cannot accept this argument as an explanation for how\r\nthe jury could reasonably have determined, consistently with its\r\nduty to follow the court's instructions, that PRASA was entitled to\r\nno damages.  Appellees' argument regarding the allocation of the\r\nburden of the collapse is a strictly legal theory that was never\r\npresented to the jury.  At oral argument, counsel for appellees was\r\nasked whether this theory was ever presented to the jury.  Counsel\r\nstated that the theory had been explained in the form of Eng.\r\nLluch's and Jimnez's testimony that the cost of repair was to be\r\nabsorbed by Lluch and was never to have been invoiced to PRASA. \r\nHowever, the fact that the jury heard testimony regarding Lluch's\r\nalleged intent that would give life to appellees' legal theory does\r\nnot mean that the jury was instructed on the legal theory itself. \r\nThe jury was specifically instructed that PRASA was entitled to\r\nrecover the cost of repairing the collapse.  The jury was not asked\r\nto first determine whether PRASA would have actually suffered the\r\ncost of repair if it had not demolished the structure.  Appellees\r\ndo not argue that they objected to this instruction and do not\r\ncross-appeal on this issue.  In fact, Appellees do not even appear\r\nto argue that this portion of the instruction was incorrect. \r\nRather, what appellees seem to argue is that the jury properly\r\nawarded no damages despite the existence of this instruction.  At\r\noral argument, appellees' counsel was asked whether it was\r\nerroneous to instruct the jury that PRASA was entitled to recover\r\nthe cost of repairing the collapse.  Counsel responded that it was\r\nnot erroneous to do so, but that PRASA failed to prove the amount. \r\nAs a result of appellees' failure to object, we accept this\r\ninstruction as correct and as the law of the case.  \r\n    We are left with a situation in which the court\r\ninstructed the jury that PRASA could recover the cost of repairing\r\nthe collapse, and PRASA showed that the cost of repairing the\r\ncollapse was significant.  We do not rule on whether the soil\r\nneeded to be improved before the structure could be repaired or\r\nwhether the cost of repairing the roof structure itself was closer\r\nto $470,000 or to $2,513,211.48.  We find only that, under any of\r\nthose theories, the evidence before the jury was that the cost of\r\nrepair was at least $470,000.  Consequently, a verdict of no\r\ndamages is not consonant with both the instructions given and the\r\nevidence presented.  We find that the jury abdicated its duty to\r\nfollow the instructions given by the district court, which resulted\r\nin a verdict that is against the clear weight of the evidence. \r\nAdditionally, we find that it was an abuse of the district court's\r\ndiscretion to deny PRASA's motion for a second partial new trial on\r\nthe issue of damages.  The judgment awarding PRASA no damages is\r\nvacated, and we remand for a new trial on the issue of damages.\r\n    B.  Redetermination of Settled Issues By the Second Jury \r\n    in Violation of the Seventh Amendment\r\n\nPRASA also argues that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in allowing the second jury, due to misleading jury\r\ninstructions and verdict forms, to redetermine the issues of\r\nLluch's liability and the existence of PRASA's damages.  PRASA\r\nclaims that these two issues were revisited by the second jury in\r\nviolation of the Seventh Amendment, which states that \"no fact\r\ntried by jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the\r\nUnited States, than according to the rules of the common law.\" \r\nU.S. Const. amend. VII.  \r\nWe summarily dismiss PRASA's claim that the jury was\r\nallowed to redetermine the issue of Lluch's liability.  PRASA\r\noffers nothing more than the absence of a jury award in support of\r\nits argument.  However, the jury was specifically instructed: (1)\r\nthat it had already been established that Lluch was negligent and\r\nbreached its contract with PRASA; (2) that Lluch's breach caused\r\nthe collapse of the structure; and (3) that PRASA was entitled to\r\nrecover any damages it suffered due to Lluch's negligence or\r\nbreach.  In light of these instructions, it simply cannot be said\r\nthat the 1997 jury was allowed to redetermine the question of\r\nLluch's liability.  In fact, the jury was specifically told that\r\nthis issue had been determined and that they should disregard any\r\ntestimony to the contrary.  Thus, we turn to PRASA's contention\r\nthat the jury was improperly allowed to redetermine the existence\r\nof PRASA's damages.\r\nPRASA argues that the district court violated the Seventh\r\nAmendment when it did not set aside the first jury's determination\r\nthat Lluch's negligence caused PRASA damages, but still allowed the\r\nsecond jury to redetermine the existence of PRASA's damages.  PRASA\r\nargues that the second jury should only have determined the extentof PRASA's damages, not whether PRASA suffered any damages at all. \r\nPRASA argues that the second jury was allowed to revisit this issue\r\nbecause the district court: (1) failed to instruct the jury that it\r\nwas already established that PRASA suffered damages; and (2)\r\nspecifically instructed the jury that it had the option of finding\r\nthat PRASA had not suffered any damages.\r\nPRASA cites several cases for the proposition that the\r\nSeventh Amendment requires district courts to conduct successive\r\ntrials in such a way that the same issue is not reexamined by\r\ndifferent juries.  Without addressing the questions of whether the\r\nauthority cited by PRASA adequately demonstrates such a Seventh\r\nAmendment principle or whether that principle is applicable in the\r\ncontext of a partial new trial on the issue of damages, we note\r\nthat no such principle was violated in this case.  The district\r\ncourt did not allow the second jury to redetermine the issue of\r\nwhether PRASA suffered damages.  It is true that the second jury\r\nwas not instructed that it had already been established that PRASA\r\nsuffered damages.  And it is also true that the second jury was\r\ninstructed that it could fail to award PRASA any damages at all. \r\nHowever, this instruction was given in the context of explaining to\r\nthe jury that it was PRASA's duty to establish the amount of any\r\ndamages caused by Lluch's negligence or breach of contract.  Seeid.  It is neither inaccurate nor an infringement on PRASA's\r\nSeventh Amendment rights to instruct the jury that PRASA could not\r\nrecover any damages if it failed to prove any damages at the\r\npartial new trial, whether the previous jury found that PRASA\r\nsuffered any damages or not.  To hold otherwise would be to hold\r\nthat the jury was obligated to award PRASA damages even if PRASA\r\nfailed to put on any evidence at all at the partial new trial. \r\nThis cannot be the case.  Thus, the district court did not err in\r\ninstructing the jury that it could fail to award PRASA any damages\r\nat all, despite the first jury's determination that PRASA was\r\ndamaged by Lluch's negligence. \r\nIn short, the district court did not err in failing to\r\norder a second partial new trial because of the alleged\r\nreexamination of issues by the second jury.  No such reexamination\r\nof issues actually occurred.\r\nC.  Unfair Influence on the Verdict Through Appellees'\r\nCounsel's Prejudicial Comments During Opening Statements\r\nand Closing Arguments\r\n\nPRASA's final contention as to why the district court\r\nshould have granted a second partial new trial on the issue of\r\ndamages is that appellees' counsel unfairly influenced the verdict\r\nwith two impermissible and prejudicial arguments to the jury. \r\nPRASA claims: (1) that CNA's counsel made improper reference to the\r\nlimits of Lluch's insurance policy with CNA during CNA's opening\r\nstatement; and (2) that Lluch's counsel made improper reference to\r\nPRASA's demolition of the structure during Lluch's closing\r\nargument.\r\nAbsent an abuse of discretion, we will defer to the\r\ndistrict court's denial of a motion for a new trial on the basis of\r\nimproper argument or conduct of counsel.

PRASA claims\r\nthat this was done for the sole reason of appealing to jury\r\nsympathy.  CNA pointed out that Lluch would have to pay most of the\r\nmillions sought by PRASA from its own funds, because the insurance\r\npolicy limit was $500,000.  However, the parties agree that the\r\ninsurance policy was admitted into evidence as Joint Exhibit VII. \r\nBecause the jury could have easily discovered the policy limits for\r\nitself, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion\r\nin refusing to grant a new trial on the basis of CNA's improper\r\nargument.\r\nPRASA next complains that it was improper for Lluch's\r\ncounsel to make reference to PRASA's demolition of the structure in\r\nhis closing argument.  However, because PRASA did not make a timely\r\nobjection to this statement, we review only for plain error.  SeeFernndez v. Corporacin Insular de Seguros, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196641\"><a href=\"/opinion/196641/fernandez-v-corporacion-insular/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210 (1st\r\nCir. 1996);  Johnson, 35 F.3d at 631 (citations omitted). \r\nWe do not find it to be plain error: (1) to allow Lluch's\r\ncounsel to refer to the demolition of the structure; or (2) to fail\r\nto grant a new trial on the basis of such a reference.  It was a\r\nstipulated fact that the demolition of the structure occurred in\r\nthe weeks following January 25, 1993.  Also, the jury was\r\nspecifically instructed that it had already been established that\r\nPRASA's demolition of the structure was unjustified.  In light of\r\nthe evidence and instructions with which the jury was provided, we\r\ndo not believe that Lluch's mention of the demolition during\r\nclosing argument resulted in any prejudice to PRASA.  \r\nIn sum, the district court did not err in failing to\r\ngrant a second partial new trial due to the reference to Lluch's\r\npolicy limits during CNA's opening statement or the reference to\r\nPRASA's demolition of the structure during Lluch's closing\r\nargument. \r\nIII.  Jury Verdict in Favor of Lluch's Counterclaims\r\nPRASA's final argument regards a portion of the 1993\r\nverdict that was not remitted:  the award of $756,471.59 in favor\r\nof Lluch on its counterclaims for breach of contract and amounts\r\nowed on the contract.  PRASA complains that this award was also\r\nagainst the weight of the evidence.\r\n\nA.

The failure\r\nto move for a new trial waives the issue on appeal.  See Velzquez,\r\n996 F.2d at 427; Wells Real Estate, 850 F.2d at 811.\r\nPRASA did not move for a new trial on Lluch's\r\ncounterclaims.  However, following the judgment on Lluch's\r\ncounterclaims, PRASA filed a two-page motion for judgment as a\r\nmatter of law on those claims.  On October 27, 1995, the district\r\ndenied PRASA's motion.  The district court found that Lluch\r\npresented evidence: (1) that PRASA breached the contract; (2) that\r\nthis breach caused damages to Lluch; and (3) that PRASA owed Lluch\r\nmonies on the contract.  The district court found that the evidence\r\npresented was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to reach a\r\nverdict in favor of Lluch on its counterclaims.\r\nWhile PRASA's failure to file a motion for a new trial\r\nwould ordinarily require this Court to find that the issue has been\r\nwaived, the fact that PRASA filed a motion for judgment as a matter\r\nof law helps PRASA to avoid that result.  In Velzquez, the\r\nappellants sought to challenge the verdict as against the weight of\r\nthe evidence.  See Velzquez, 996 F.2d at 427.  We held that, even\r\nthough the appellants failed to make the appropriate motion for a\r\nnew trial before the district court, the issue was not waived\r\nbecause the appellants made a motion to set aside or amend the\r\nverdict.  See id.  We found that because the purpose of the\r\nappellants' motion was to challenge the verdict as against the\r\nweight of the evidence, the appellants should not have been deemed\r\nto have waived the issue.  See id.  We noted that the district\r\ncourt addressed the sufficiency argument and denied the motion\r\nbecause the jury's verdict was supported by the evidence.  See id. \r\nConsequently, we treated the appellants' motion as a motion for a\r\nnew trial and treated the appeal as an appeal of the denial of that\r\nmotion for a new trial.  See id.  \r\nThe same situation is presented in the present appeal:\r\n(1) PRASA made a motion challenging the verdict as against the\r\nweight of the evidence; (2) the district court addressed the\r\nsufficiency argument; and (3) the district court denied the motion\r\nbecause the jury's verdict was supported by the evidence. \r\nTherefore, we treat this appeal as an appeal from the denial of\r\nPRASA's motion for a new trial on Lluch's counterclaims.\r\nB.  Denial of PRASA's Motion for a New Trial on Lluch's\r\nCounterclaims\r\n\nAgain, the denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewed\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  See Bogosian, 104 F.3d at 482.  A verdict\r\nmay be set aside and a new trial ordered \"when the verdict is\r\nagainst the clear weight of the evidence, or is based upon evidence\r\nwhich is false, or will result in a clear miscarriage of justice.\" \r\nPhav, 915 F.2d at 766.\r\nPRASA points to the testimony of Jos A. Toro-Mercado, a\r\ncertified public accountant who PRASA claims testified on behalf of\r\nLluch that PRASA owed Lluch $2,121,956.35 as a result of change\r\norders, additional work, materials, and extended office overhead. \r\nPRASA claims that Toro-Mercado's testimony was based on three main,\r\nbut faulty, premises: (1) that Lebrn, the designer of the project,\r\nwas at fault for the collapse of the steel roof structure; (2) that\r\nall delays in the construction project were attributable to PRASA;\r\nand (3) that Lluch had worked at the project between August 1, 1988\r\nand October 20, 1990.\r\nPRASA argues that the first of these three premises was\r\ncontradicted by the 1993 jury verdict itself.  PRASA claims that\r\nthe 1993 jury specifically ruled that Lluch, not Lebrn, was solely\r\nliable to PRASA for the negligent removal of the surcharge that\r\ncaused the collapse of the structure.  PRASA argues that the second\r\npremise was also contradicted by the 1993 jury verdict and the\r\nevidence adduced at trial.  PRASA notes that the 1993 jury omitted\r\nany finding that PRASA had been solely responsible for the delays\r\nin the project.  PRASA also claims that all of the evidence\r\nregarding job certifications that was presented at trial showed\r\nthat Lluch or its subcontractors were as much responsible for the\r\ndelays as was PRASA.  PRASA also notes that \"the certifications\r\nwere reconciled during trial by the parties, clearly showing that\r\nPRASA was not remotely the sole responsible party for the delays in\r\nthe project.\"  Regarding the third premise, PRASA argues that there\r\nwas \"better evidence\" of the time period of Lluch's presence at the\r\nproject. \r\nPRASA's argument fails in several respects.  First, while\r\nthe 1993 jury found Lluch to have been liable, it did not find that\r\nLebrn was faultless.  The liability of Lebrn was not before the\r\njury, and the jury made no determinations regarding this issue.\r\nSecond, the \"omission\" of a finding that PRASA was solely\r\nresponsible for project delays is hardly a finding that PRASA was\r\nnot responsible for any delays that may have caused Lluch damages. \r\nThird, PRASA does not direct the Court to any of the evidence it\r\nclaims demonstrated Lluch's responsibility for delay in\r\nconstruction.  Fourth, even if the certifications were \"reconciled\"\r\nduring trial, PRASA does not explain to the Court how that \"clearly\r\nshow[s] that PRASA was not remotely the sole responsible party for\r\nthe delays in the project.\"  Fifth, PRASA makes no attempt to\r\nidentify the \"better evidence\" of an allegedly more accurate time\r\nperiod of Lluch's involvement in the project.\r\nFinally, and most importantly, the jury awarded Lluch\r\n$756,471.59 on its counterclaims, even though PRASA admits that\r\nToro-Mercado testified that PRASA owed Lluch $2,121,956.35.  It is\r\nquite possible that the jury questioned Toro-Mercado's three\r\npremises and reduced the damages award accordingly.  For example,\r\nthe jury may have reduced the award by the amount it determined\r\nthat Lluch was at fault for the delays.  Or it may have reduced the\r\naward because it did not agree that Lebrn was solely at fault for\r\nthe collapse.  Or it may have reduced the award because it believed\r\nthat the \"better evidence\" referred to by PRASA demonstrated that\r\nLluch was not on the job as long as it claimed.  This is, of\r\ncourse, all speculation, but PRASA does not offer any argument as\r\nto why the amount actually awarded was against the weight of the\r\nevidence.  PRASA offers several arguments that demonstrate why\r\nLluch should not have been granted all it requested, but the fact\r\nremains that Lluch was not granted all it requested.\r\nIn the jury verdict form, the 1993 jury found: (1) that\r\nPRASA breached its contract with Lluch; (2) that this breach caused\r\ndamages to Lluch in the amount of $138,758; and (3) that PRASA owed\r\nLluch $617,713.59 for work performed on the contract.  PRASA does\r\nnot offer any evidence or argument that Lluch did not in fact\r\nsuffer damages in the amount of $138,758 or that Lluch was not in\r\nfact owed $617,713.59 for work performed on the contract. \r\nConsequently, we reject PRASA's claims that the verdict was against\r\nthe weight of the evidence and leave undisturbed the judgment in\r\nfavor of Lluch on its counterclaims.\r\n                      CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the judgment awarding PRASA no\r\ndamages is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for a new trial on\r\nthe issue of damages.  The judgment awarding Lluch $756,471.59 on\r\nits counterclaims for breach of contract and amounts owed on the\r\ncontract is AFFIRMED.\n</pre>",
