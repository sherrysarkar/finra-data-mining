Portela-Gonzalez  (Portela)  challenges  a\r\n\nsummary judgment entered  in favor  of the Navy.1   Although  our\r\n\nreasoning differs in  one salient respect  from that employed  by\r\n\nthe court below, we affirm the  judgment.  See Hachikian v. FDIC,\r                                                                          \r\n\n96  F.3d 502, 504 (1st  Cir. 1996) (explaining  that an appellate\r\n\ncourt  is not committed to  the trial court's  rationale, but may\r\n\naffirm on any alternative ground made manifest by the record). \r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  facts  essential   to  our   review  are   largely\r\n\nuncontested.    Portela worked  for  nearly  three decades  as  a\r\n\ncivilian employee  at the Roosevelt  Roads Naval  Station.   From\r\n\n1985 forward, she occupied  the position of sales manager  at the\r\n\nNavy Exchange.    She had  an unblemished  employment record  and\r\n\nachieved consistently high performance ratings.\r\n\n          On  December 14,  1989, Portela  placed 28  articles of\r\n\nclothing on layaway at  the Exchange, 25 of which  were clearance\r\n\nsale  items  (known  colloquially  as  \"red  tag\"  items).    The\r\n\nanticipated purchase price of the merchandise was $484.10.   When\r\n\nthe Exchange slashed  the prices of  all red tag items  even more\r\n\ndrastically  during  the  post-Christmas lull,  Portela  spied an\r\n\nopportunity   for   increased  savings,   canceled   her  layaway\r\n\narrangement   (paying  a   $5.00  penalty),   and  simultaneously\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Portela's  husband,  Juan  Enrique  Del  Valle,  and  their\r\nconjugal partnership  are also  plaintiffs; the Secretary  of the\r\nNavy and the Naval Resale and Services Support Office (NRSSO) are\r\nadditional  defendants.  For simplicity's sake, we treat the case\r\nas involving only Portela and the Navy.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nrepurchased the articles she had removed from layaway status  for\r\n\na price of $330.79.  Portela contends that these machinations did\r\n\nnot  transgress any policy, rule, or  regulation of the Exchange;\r\n\nthe Navy contends otherwise.\r\n\nII.  THE AFTERMATH\r          II.  THE AFTERMATH\r\n\n          On April  9, 1990, L.H.  Arcement, Jr., the  Officer in\r\n\nCharge (OIC) of the Navy Exchange,  suspended Portela without pay\r\n\npending  anticipated disciplinary  action.   On May  29, Arcement\r\n\nnotified Portela  that she would  be terminated for  \"applying an\r\n\nunauthorized 40% price reduction to red tagged clothing items you\r\n\nhad  placed on  layaway in  violation of  the Exchange's  layaway\r\n\npolicy,  resulting  in  a  loss  to  the  Exchange of  $197.32.\"2\r\n\nPursuant to the  controlling administrative procedure,  contained\r\n\nin a Secretary of the  Navy Instruction (SECNAVINST), the  letter\r\n\ninformed Portela  of the  charges against  her  and outlined  her\r\n\nprocedural rights.\r\n\n          Portela contested the proposed disciplinary action.  On\r\n\nJune  22,   1990,  the  OIC  overrode   Portela's  grievance  and\r\n\nterminated her employment  as of July 3, 1990.   The Navy advised\r\n\nPortela of her right to appeal this decision and she proceeded to\r\n\ndo so.  Her first  appeal was heard pro forma by the OIC who, not\r                                                       \r\n\nsurprisingly, affirmed  his original  determination.   Her second\r\n\nappeal culminated in a  full evidentiary hearing, following which\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2While simple  arithmetic indicates  that this figure  is in\r\nthe  vicinity of 40% of  the original purchase  price, the record\r\nsheds  no further light  on its genesis.   We need  not probe the\r\npoint, however, because Portela does not challenge the amount.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nMichael F. O'Brien, the Commanding Officer of the Roosevelt Roads\r\n\nNaval Station, upheld her termination.\r\n\n          Portela  pursued  the  appellate  process to  the  next\r\n\nlevel.    On  March  25,  1991,  Rear  Admiral  H.D.  Weatherson,\r\n\nCommander of the NRSSO, headquartered at Staten Island, New York,\r\n\naffirmed her  termination.  This decision informed Portela of her\r\n\nright  to  take  a  final  administrative appeal  to  the  Deputy\r\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy, Civilian Personnel Policy, Equal\r\n\nEmployment Opportunity  Office, in Washington, D.C.   Rather than\r\n\npursue this fourth level of administrative redress, Portela filed\r\n\nsuit.\r\n\n          After some preliminary  skirmishing, not relevant here,\r\n\nthe  district  court  addressed  the Navy's  motion  for  summary\r\n\njudgment.  The  court ruled  that Portela had  failed to  exhaust\r\n\navailable  administrative remedies  but  nonetheless reached  the\r\n\nmerits of her suit  in the exercise of its  perceived discretion.\r\n\nSee Portela Gonzalez v. Secretary of Navy, 913 F. Supp. 122, 126-\r                                                   \r\n\n28 (D.P.R.  1996).  Portela's victory  proved ephemeral, however,\r\n\nas  the  court concluded  that  the Navy's  actions  were neither\r\n\narbitrary nor capricious.  See id. at 128.  This appeal ensued.\r                                            \r\n\nIII.  DISCUSSION\r          III.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          We  agree   with  the   district  court   that  Portela\r\n\nimpermissibly failed to exhaust  her administrative remedies.  We\r\n\ndisagree,  however,  that  the   court  had  discretion,  in  the\r\n\ncircumstances  of this case,  to relieve her  of the  onus of her\r\n\nomission.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n                   A.  The Exhaustion Doctrine.\r                             A.  The Exhaustion Doctrine.\r                                                        \r\n\n          Starkly  contoured, the exhaustion  doctrine holds that\r\n\n\"no  one is  entitled  to  judicial  relief  for  a  supposed  or\r\n\nthreatened injury until the prescribed administrative  remedy has\r\n\nbeen exhausted.\"  Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n41, 50-51 (1938).   In  practice, the doctrine  has softer  edges\r\n\nthan this  language implies.  See Kenneth Culp Davis &amp; Richard J.\r                                           \r\n\nPierce,  Jr., II Administrative Law  Treatise   15.2,  at 307 (3d\r                                                       \r\n\ned.  1994).   Although exhaustion  of administrative  remedies is\r\n\nabsolutely  required  if  explicitly  mandated by  Congress,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nMcCarthy v. Madigan, 503  U.S. 140, 144 (1992), courts  have more\r                             \r\n\nlatitude in  dealing with exhaustion questions  when Congress has\r\n\nremained  silent, see  Darby v.  Cisneros, 509  U.S.  137, 153-54\r                                                   \r\n\n(1993); McCarthy, 503 U.S. at  144.  In such purlieus, the  court\r                          \r\n\nof  first instance possesses a modicum of discretion to relax the\r\n\nexhaustion  requirement.   See  Salus  v.  GTE Directories  Serv.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp., 104 F.3d 131, 138 (7th Cir. 1997).\r               \r\n\n          The  Court's  opinion in  McCarthy  is  integral to  an\r                                                      \r\n\nunderstanding  of the  parameters of  this discretion.   Although\r\n\nrecognizing that the  exhaustion doctrine ordinarily  \"serves the\r\n\ntwin purposes of protecting  administrative agency authority  and\r\n\npromoting judicial efficiency,\" and,  thus, should customarily be\r\n\nenforced, the Court identified \"three broad sets of circumstances\r\n\nin which  the interests of  the individual weigh  heavily against\r\n\nrequiring administrative exhaustion.\"  McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145,\r                                                         \r\n\n146.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          First,  a court  may  consider relaxing  the rule  when\r\n\nunreasonable or  indefinite delay  threatens unduly  to prejudice\r\n\nthe subsequent bringing of a judicial action.  See id. at 146-47.\r                                                                \r\n\nAnd,  relatedly,  if the  situation  is such  that  \"a particular\r\n\nplaintiff  may  suffer  irreparable  harm  if  unable  to  secure\r\n\nimmediate judicial consideration of his claim,\" exhaustion may be\r\n\nexcused even though  \"the administrative decisionmaking  schedule\r\n\nis otherwise reasonable and definite.\"  Id. at 147.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Second, McCarthy acknowledges that  it sometimes may be\r                                    \r\n\ninappropriate for a court to require exhaustion if a  substantial\r\n\ndoubt  exists about  whether  the agency  is  empowered to  grant\r\n\nmeaningful redress.   See id. at 147-48, 154;  see also Gibson v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBerryhill,  411  U.S.  564, 574  n.14  (1973).    An agency,  for\r                   \r\n\nexample,  may  lack  authority  to  grant  the   type  of  relief\r\n\nrequested.  See, e.g.,  McNeese v. Board of Educ.,  373 U.S. 668,\r                                                           \r\n\n675 (1963).\r\n\n          Finally, McCarthy teaches that the  exhaustion rule may\r                                     \r\n\nbe relaxed where there  are clear, objectively verifiable indicia\r\n\nof administrative taint.  Thus, if the potential decisionmaker is\r\n\nbiased or can be  shown to have predetermined the  issue, failure\r\n\nto exploit  an available  administrative remedy may  be forgiven.\r\n\nSee McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 148.\r                      \r\n\n                 B.  Application of the Doctrine.\r                           B.  Application of the Doctrine.\r                                                          \r\n\n          Congress has excluded Navy Exchange  personnel from the\r\n\nstrictures of the  Administrative Procedure Act,  see 5 U.S.C.   \r                                                               \r\n\n2105(c),  and  has not  otherwise  mandated  that such  employees\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nalways  must  exhaust  administrative  remedies  as  a  condition\r\n\nprecedent to  suit.   Accordingly, Portela's admitted  failure to\r\n\nexercise the  final level  of available administrative  review is\r\n\nnot  necessarily fatal to her  claim; the effect  of her omission\r\n\ndepends  instead upon whether  the circumstances of  her case can\r\n\njustify that omission.\r\n\n          1.  The Availability of Fourth-Level  Review.  We start\r                    1.  The Availability of Fourth-Level  Review.\r                                                                \r\n\nthis phase  of our  analysis by addressing  Portela's halfhearted\r\n\nargument,  raised for  the first  time on  appeal, that  a fourth\r\n\nlevel  of review was not in fact  available to her.  The argument\r\n\nis bogus.\r\n\n          The facts are as  follows.  The original administrative\r\n\nprocedure, SECNAVINST 5300.22A, did not mention a fourth level of\r\n\nreview.  On November 15, 1989, however, the Secretary of the Navy\r\n\npromulgated SECNAVINST 5300.22B,  directing subordinate  commands\r\n\nto implement it within  120 days.  The new  regulation (5300.22B)\r\n\nexplicitly canceled the old regulation (5300.22A).  Nevertheless,\r\n\non January 24, 1990, the  Director, Officer of Civilian Personnel\r\n\nManagement,  granted an  extension  to the  NRSSO, deferring  the\r\n\neffective date of SECNAVINST 5300.22B until July 15, 1990.  Thus,\r\n\nthe notice of  suspension issued to Portela on April 9, 1990, the\r\n\nnotice of proposed disciplinary  action issued to her on  May 29,\r\n\n1990,  and  the  notice of  decision  dated  June  22, 1990,  all\r\n\nreferenced SECNAVINST 5300.22A as the controlling regulation.\r\n\n          From  that  point  forward,  however,  Portela  clearly\r\n\nunderstood    indeed,  urged    that  SECNAVINST 5300.22B,  which\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nunarguably  contains a  fourth  level  of administrative  review,\r\n\ngoverned her case.   She mentioned it in her second appeal, dated\r\n\nAugust  12, 1990,  and  at the  ensuing  evidentiary hearing  her\r\n\ncounsel insisted that 5300.22B, rather than  5300.22A, controlled\r\n\nher  case.   While  the  hearing  officer  did  not rule  on  the\r\n\nquestion,   the  ultimate   decisionmaker  at  that   level  (the\r\n\nCommanding Officer of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station) accepted\r\n\nPortela's  argument  and  reviewed   the  hearing  transcript  in\r\n\naccordance with SECNAVINST 5300.22B.  Throughout the remainder of\r\n\nthe  administrative  process,  both  sides proceeded  under  that\r\n\nregulation.3\r\n\n          We do  not aspire  to add  hues to a  rainbow.   By its\r\n\nterms, SECNAVINST  5300.22B applies  here.  And,  moreover, since\r\n\nPortela consistently argued for its application during the latter\r\n\nstages  of the administrative process, she cannot now be heard to\r\n\ncomplain  that   the  agency  surrendered  to   her  exhortation.\r\n\nEquitable  doctrines  of  estoppel  apply in  administrative  and\r\n\njudicial  fora, see generally Davis  &amp; Pierce, supra,     13.1 to\r                                                              \r\n\n13.5,  and  a party  cannot take  one  position in  an underlying\r\n\nadministrative proceeding  and then  disclaim it in  a subsequent\r\n\nsuit arising out of the agency proceedings.

General Cinema  Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st  Cir. 1987)\r                                       \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3We cite two episodes which confirm this conclusion.  In her\r\nthird-level  notice of  appeal,  Portela  stated  expressly  that\r\n\"[t]his appeal arises under SECNAVINST 5300.22B.\"  By like token,\r\nin  resolving  that  appeal   adversely  to  Portela,  the  NRSSO\r\ncommandant  specifically  informed  Portela  of her  right  to  a\r\nfourth-level appeal under SECNAVINST 5300.22B.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n(explaining that  the doctrine of judicial  estoppel \"precludes a\r\n\nparty  from asserting a position in one legal proceeding which is\r\n\ncontrary to a position it has already asserted in another\").\r\n\n          2.   The Futility  Exception.   The only  question that\r                    2.   The Futility  Exception.\r                                                \r\n\nremains is whether Portela's  failure to mount the final  rung of\r\n\nthe administrative ladder is fatal to the court case.  She argued\r\n\nbelow  that the  court should  excuse her  omission, asseverating\r\n\nthat a final appeal to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy\r\n\nwould have been a  futile gesture because it would  have resulted\r\n\nin an automatic affirmance of her dismissal.   In theory, this is\r\n\na  good argument.  Consistent  with the exceptions  limned by the\r\n\nMcCarthy Court,  we  have  recognized  the  inappropriateness  of\r                  \r\n\nrequiring  exhaustion when  further agency  proceedings  would be\r\n\nfutile.   See, e.g., Pihl v. Massachusetts Dep't of Educ., 9 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n\n184,  190  (1st Cir.  1993);  Christopher W.  v.  Portsmouth Sch.\r                                                                           \r\n\nComm.,  877  F.2d   1089,  1095  (1st  Cir.  1989);   Ezratty  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCommonwealth of P.R., 648 F.2d 770, 774 (1st Cir. 1981).\r                              \r\n\n          But  the futility  exception is  not available  for the\r\n\nasking.    Reliance on  the  exception in  a  given case  must be\r\n\nanchored in demonstrable reality.  A pessimistic prediction  or a\r\n\nhunch   that  further   administrative  proceedings   will  prove\r\n\nunproductive is not enough to sidetrack the exhaustion rule.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nChristopher W., 877 F.2d  at 1095-96; see also Gilbert v.

Accordingly,  \"[a]n essential element of\r\n\nthe claim of futility . . . is  that all reasonable possibilities\r\n\nof   adequate   administrative  relief   have   been  effectively\r\n\nforeclosed.\"        Tucker    v.

Indeed, the  Seventh Circuit has held that  claimants who\r\n\nseek  safe harbor under the futility exception \"must show that it\r\n\nis certain that their claim will be denied on appeal,  not merely\r\n\nthat they doubt an  appeal will result in a  different decision.\"\r\n\nSmith v.  Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield United, 959 F.2d 655, 659 (7th\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1992).4\r\n\n          Portela  cannot surmount  this  hurdle.   The claim  of\r\n\nfutility   is  merely   a  self-serving   pronouncement   in  the\r\n\ncircumstances of  this case.  The evidence is uncontradicted that\r\n\nthe Deputy Assistant Secretary  is an impartial official  who has\r\n\nreversed termination decisions affecting Navy  Exchange personnel\r\n\nin  the  past.    Though   the  prognosis  for  Portela's  unused\r\n\nadministrative  appeal may  have been  poor and  her expectations\r\n\nmodest,  neither  courts  nor  litigants are  allowed  to  equate\r\n\npessimism with futility.   See  Hodges v. Callaway, 499 F.2d 417,\r                                                            \r\n\n424  (5th Cir. 1974).

Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 61  (\"To come\r                                                \r\nwithin the exception, a  sort of inevitability is required:   the\r\nprospect  of refusal must be  certain (or nearly  so).\"), but the\r\ncase  at hand  does not  require us to  choose between  these two\r\nformulations.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nsuggest  that Portela's lack of success at the previous levels of\r\n\nreview necessarily signified that the final level of review would\r\n\nbe  an  empty  gesture,  her  failure  to  exhaust  an  available\r\n\nadministrative  remedy  cannot be  overlooked  on  the ground  of\r\n\nfutility.\r\n\n          3.   The District Court's Rationale.  To this point, we\r                    3.   The District Court's Rationale.\r                                                       \r\n\nare in agreement with the court below.  See Portela, 913 F. Supp.\r                                                             \r\n\nat  126-27  (declaring  that  alleged  futility  did  not  excuse\r\n\nPortela's nonexhaustion).  After finding the plaintiff's futility\r\n\nargument futile, however, the district  judge nonetheless elected\r\n\nto  relax  the  exhaustion  requirement \"[i]n  the  interests  of\r\n\nminimizing cost and delay in the judicial system and avoiding the\r\n\nwaste  of resources.\"   Id. at  127.   The judge  reasoned that a\r                                     \r\n\nperceived waste  of  resources, in  and  of itself,  can  justify\r\n\nexcusing  nonexhaustion of  administrative  remedies.   We  think\r\n\nnot.5\r\n\n          Were  we  to adopt  the  lower  court's reasoning,  the\r\n\nresulting exception would swallow the exhaustion rule in a single\r\n\ngulp.  Once  an aggrieved party has brought suit,  forcing her to\r\n\nretreat  to any  unused administrative appeal  potentially wastes\r                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5To  be  sure, we  stated  in Ezratty  that  \"[s]ometimes to\r                                                    \r\nrequire exhaustion  will not only  waste resources but  also work\r\nsevere harm  upon  a litigant.\"    648 F.2d  at  774.   Taken  in\r\ncontext, this  statement is  entirely compatible with  the \"undue\r\nprejudice/irreparable   harm\"   consideration  outlined   by  the\r\nMcCarthy Court in its discussion of the first potential exception\r                  \r\nto the exhaustion rule.  503 U.S. at 146-47.  In the case at bar,\r\nthere is no  hint that taking  an appeal to the  Deputy Assistant\r\nSecretary would have caused Portela irreparable harm or otherwise\r\nseriously prejudiced her rights.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nresources.   The  Supreme Court has  disavowed such  a resupinate\r\n\napproach.  In McKart  v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 193 (1969),\r                                                \r\n\nthe Court  explained that a  \"primary purpose\" of  the exhaustion\r\n\ndoctrine  is  \"the avoidance  of  premature  interruption of  the\r\n\nadministrative  process.\"      Consequently,  it   is   generally\r\n\ninefficient to permit a  party to seek judicial recourse  without\r\n\nfirst exhausting her  administrative remedies.   See id. at  194.\r                                                                  \r\n\nFollowing this train of thought, the Court has concluded that, by\r\n\nand large,  concerns regarding  efficiency militate in  favor of,\r\n\nrather  than  against,  strict  application   of  the  exhaustion\r\n\ndoctrine.  See  McCarthy, 503 U.S.  at 145;  McKart, 395 U.S.  at\r                                                             \r\n\n195;  see also Ezratty, 648  F.2d at 774  (acknowledging that the\r                                \r\n\nexhaustion  doctrine \"serves  interests of  accuracy, efficiency,\r\n\nagency autonomy and judicial economy\").\r\n\n          This view  is steeped in real-world  wisdom.  Insisting\r\n\non exhaustion  forces parties to take  administrative proceedings\r\n\nseriously,  allows  administrative  agencies  an  opportunity  to\r\n\ncorrect their  own errors,  and potentially  avoids the  need for\r\n\njudicial  involvement  altogether.     Furthermore,  disregarding\r\n\navailable  administrative  processes thrusts  parties prematurely\r\n\ninto overcrowded courts and  weakens an agency's effectiveness by\r\n\nencouraging end-runs around it.   See McCarthy, 503 U.S.  at 145;\r                                                        \r\n\nMcKart, 395 U.S. at 195.\r                \r\n\n          4.  The Bottom Line.  To sum up, the futility exception\r                    4.  The Bottom Line.\r                                       \r\n\nis  unavailable to  Portela  and the  district court's  professed\r\n\nreason  for  excusing  her  failure  to  exhaust   administrative\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nremedies  neither passes muster on its own terms nor falls within\r\n\nany  of the  hallmark  McCarthy exceptions.6   Those  conclusions\r                                         \r\n\ndictate  the result  we  must  reach.    The  plaintiff  left  an\r\n\navailable administrative  remedy untapped and the  record in this\r\n\ncase, howsoever  construed,  reveals no  sufficiently  excusatory\r\n\ncircumstances to warrant spurning that remedy.\r\n\n          First,  there  is  no indication  that  full exhaustion\r\n\nwould have  caused undue prejudice, irreparable  harm, or unusual\r\n\nhardship of any  sort.   Although Portela had  already pursued  a\r\n\nfairly lengthy administrative process, it  had moved celeritously\r\n\n  the pavane  began when the OIC  terminated Portela's employment\r\n\nas  of July 3, 1990, and  ended when the NRSSO,  in the person of\r\n\nRear  Admiral Weatherson,  denied her  penultimate administrative\r\n\nappeal on March  25, 1991    and the  Deputy Assistant  Secretary\r\n\nwould have been required  to respond to her final  appeal \"within\r\n\n60  calendar days of receipt of the official record.\"  SECNAVINST\r\n\n5300.22B Ch.V (9)(d)(3).  Second, the agency (here, the Navy) was\r\n\nfully capable of granting all  the relief that Portela originally\r\n\nsought,  namely,  reinstatement, reassignment,  and  quashing the\r\n\ncharges against her.  Third, there is no meaningful indication of\r\n\nany institutional bias.  Fourth, the plaintiff has not identified\r\n\nany  other  special  circumstance warranting  relaxation  of  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6We  do  not  suggest  that  the  three  exceptions  to  the\r\nexhaustion  rule delineated  by  the McCarthy  Court comprise  an\r                                                       \r\nexclusive compendium.   But to  the extent that  other exceptions\r\nappropriately may lie, they must be on a  par with the exceptions\r\ndescribed by the  Court.  As  explained in the  text, the  record\r\nhere  contains nothing  which suggests  a  plausible basis  for a\r\nfurther exception.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nexhaustion  rule, and  our  careful perlustration  of the  record\r\n\nreveals none.   It follows  that the district  court should  have\r\n\ndismissed  the complaint for failure of  the plaintiff to exhaust\r\n\navailable administrative remedies.\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          It may  seem hypertechnical to  some that a  person who\r\n\nbelieves herself aggrieved by  agency action must jump  through a\r\n\nseries of  hoops before she can  seek out a judicial  forum.  But\r\n\nlong-recognized concerns  regarding agency autonomy  and judicial\r\n\nefficiency  weigh  heavily   in  favor   of  requiring   complete\r\n\nexhaustion  of administrative  remedies.   When all  is said  and\r\n\ndone, our  system of justice  depends on litigants'  adherence to\r\n\nwell-defined rules.  Where, as here, a party decides unilaterally\r\n\nto forsake those rules, she does so at her peril.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  The short of it is that Portela\r\n\nlacked a legally sufficient  reason for leaping prematurely  to a\r\n\njudicial venue.   Thus, the district court should  have dismissed\r\n\nher complaint  for  failure to  exhaust available  administrative\r\n\nremedies.  In the end, however,  the district court's error is of\r\n\nno moment; though the court entered judgment in favor of the Navy\r\n\non  an inappropriate ground, the Navy  is nonetheless entitled to\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n",

BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  facts  essential   to  our   review  are   largely\r\n\nuncontested.    Portela worked  for  nearly  three decades  as  a\r\n\ncivilian employee  at the Roosevelt  Roads Naval  Station.   From\r\n\n1985 forward, she occupied  the position of sales manager  at the\r\n\nNavy Exchange.    She had  an unblemished  employment record  and\r\n\nachieved consistently high performance ratings.\r\n\n          On  December 14,  1989, Portela  placed 28  articles of\r\n\nclothing on layaway at  the Exchange, 25 of which  were clearance\r\n\nsale  items  (known  colloquially  as  \"red  tag\"  items).    The\r\n\nanticipated purchase price of the merchandise was $484.10.   When\r\n\nthe Exchange slashed  the prices of  all red tag items  even more\r\n\ndrastically  during  the  post-Christmas lull,  Portela  spied an\r\n\nopportunity   for   increased  savings,   canceled   her  layaway\r\n\narrangement   (paying  a   $5.00  penalty),   and  simultaneously\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Portela's  husband,  Juan  Enrique  Del  Valle,  and  their\r\nconjugal partnership  are also  plaintiffs; the Secretary  of the\r\nNavy and the Naval Resale and Services Support Office (NRSSO) are\r\nadditional  defendants.  For simplicity's sake, we treat the case\r\nas involving only Portela and the Navy.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nrepurchased the articles she had removed from layaway status  for\r\n\na price of $330.79.  Portela contends that these machinations did\r\n\nnot  transgress any policy, rule, or  regulation of the Exchange;\r\n\nthe Navy contends otherwise.\r\n\nII.  THE AFTERMATH\r          II.  THE AFTERMATH\r\n\n          On April  9, 1990, L.H.  Arcement, Jr., the  Officer in\r\n\nCharge (OIC) of the Navy Exchange,  suspended Portela without pay\r\n\npending  anticipated disciplinary  action.   On May  29, Arcement\r\n\nnotified Portela  that she would  be terminated for  \"applying an\r\n\nunauthorized 40% price reduction to red tagged clothing items you\r\n\nhad  placed on  layaway in  violation of  the Exchange's  layaway\r\n\npolicy,  resulting  in  a  loss  to  the  Exchange of  $197.32.\"2\r\n\nPursuant to the  controlling administrative procedure,  contained\r\n\nin a Secretary of the  Navy Instruction (SECNAVINST), the  letter\r\n\ninformed Portela  of the  charges against  her  and outlined  her\r\n\nprocedural rights.\r\n\n          Portela contested the proposed disciplinary action.  On\r\n\nJune  22,   1990,  the  OIC  overrode   Portela's  grievance  and\r\n\nterminated her employment  as of July 3, 1990.   The Navy advised\r\n\nPortela of her right to appeal this decision and she proceeded to\r\n\ndo so.  Her first  appeal was heard pro forma by the OIC who, not\r                                                       \r\n\nsurprisingly, affirmed  his original  determination.   Her second\r\n\nappeal culminated in a  full evidentiary hearing, following which\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2While simple  arithmetic indicates  that this figure  is in\r\nthe  vicinity of 40% of  the original purchase  price, the record\r\nsheds  no further light  on its genesis.   We need  not probe the\r\npoint, however, because Portela does not challenge the amount.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nMichael F. O'Brien, the Commanding Officer of the Roosevelt Roads\r\n\nNaval Station, upheld her termination.\r\n\n          Portela  pursued  the  appellate  process to  the  next\r\n\nlevel.    On  March  25,  1991,  Rear  Admiral  H.D.  Weatherson,\r\n\nCommander of the NRSSO, headquartered at Staten Island, New York,\r\n\naffirmed her  termination.  This decision informed Portela of her\r\n\nright  to  take  a  final  administrative appeal  to  the  Deputy\r\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy, Civilian Personnel Policy, Equal\r\n\nEmployment Opportunity  Office, in Washington, D.C.   Rather than\r\n\npursue this fourth level of administrative redress, Portela filed\r\n\nsuit.\r\n\n          After some preliminary  skirmishing, not relevant here,\r\n\nthe  district  court  addressed  the Navy's  motion  for  summary\r\n\njudgment.  The  court ruled  that Portela had  failed to  exhaust\r\n\navailable  administrative remedies  but  nonetheless reached  the\r\n\nmerits of her suit  in the exercise of its  perceived discretion.\r\n\nSee Portela Gonzalez v.

Accordingly, Portela's admitted  failure to\r\n\nexercise the  final level  of available administrative  review is\r\n\nnot  necessarily fatal to her  claim; the effect  of her omission\r\n\ndepends  instead upon whether  the circumstances of  her case can\r\n\njustify that omission.\r\n\n          1.  The Availability of Fourth-Level  Review.  We start\r                    1.  The Availability of Fourth-Level  Review.\r                                                                \r\n\nthis phase  of our  analysis by addressing  Portela's halfhearted\r\n\nargument,  raised for  the first  time on  appeal, that  a fourth\r\n\nlevel  of review was not in fact  available to her.  The argument\r\n\nis bogus.\r\n\n          The facts are as  follows.  The original administrative\r\n\nprocedure, SECNAVINST 5300.22A, did not mention a fourth level of\r\n\nreview.  On November 15, 1989, however, the Secretary of the Navy\r\n\npromulgated SECNAVINST 5300.22B,  directing subordinate  commands\r\n\nto implement it within  120 days.  The new  regulation (5300.22B)\r\n\nexplicitly canceled the old regulation (5300.22A).  Nevertheless,\r\n\non January 24, 1990, the  Director, Officer of Civilian Personnel\r\n\nManagement,  granted an  extension  to the  NRSSO, deferring  the\r\n\neffective date of SECNAVINST 5300.22B until July 15, 1990.  Thus,\r\n\nthe notice of  suspension issued to Portela on April 9, 1990, the\r\n\nnotice of proposed disciplinary  action issued to her on  May 29,\r\n\n1990,  and  the  notice of  decision  dated  June  22, 1990,  all\r\n\nreferenced SECNAVINST 5300.22A as the controlling regulation.\r\n\n          From  that  point  forward,  however,  Portela  clearly\r\n\nunderstood    indeed,  urged    that  SECNAVINST 5300.22B,  which\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nunarguably  contains a  fourth  level  of administrative  review,\r\n\ngoverned her case.   She mentioned it in her second appeal, dated\r\n\nAugust  12, 1990,  and  at the  ensuing  evidentiary hearing  her\r\n\ncounsel insisted that 5300.22B, rather than  5300.22A, controlled\r\n\nher  case.   While  the  hearing  officer  did  not rule  on  the\r\n\nquestion,   the  ultimate   decisionmaker  at  that   level  (the\r\n\nCommanding Officer of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station) accepted\r\n\nPortela's  argument  and  reviewed   the  hearing  transcript  in\r\n\naccordance with SECNAVINST 5300.22B.  Throughout the remainder of\r\n\nthe  administrative  process,  both  sides proceeded  under  that\r\n\nregulation.3\r\n\n          We do  not aspire  to add  hues to a  rainbow.   By its\r\n\nterms, SECNAVINST  5300.22B applies  here.  And,  moreover, since\r\n\nPortela consistently argued for its application during the latter\r\n\nstages  of the administrative process, she cannot now be heard to\r\n\ncomplain  that   the  agency  surrendered  to   her  exhortation.\r\n\nEquitable  doctrines  of  estoppel  apply in  administrative  and\r\n\njudicial  fora, see generally Davis  &amp; Pierce, supra,     13.1 to\r                                                              \r\n\n13.5,  and  a party  cannot take  one  position in  an underlying\r\n\nadministrative proceeding  and then  disclaim it in  a subsequent\r\n\nsuit arising out of the agency proceedings.

In her\r\nthird-level  notice of  appeal,  Portela  stated  expressly  that\r\n\"[t]his appeal arises under SECNAVINST 5300.22B.\"  By like token,\r\nin  resolving  that  appeal   adversely  to  Portela,  the  NRSSO\r\ncommandant  specifically  informed  Portela  of her  right  to  a\r\nfourth-level appeal under SECNAVINST 5300.22B.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n(explaining that  the doctrine of judicial  estoppel \"precludes a\r\n\nparty  from asserting a position in one legal proceeding which is\r\n\ncontrary to a position it has already asserted in another\").\r\n\n          2.

The Futility  Exception.\r                                                \r\n\nremains is whether Portela's  failure to mount the final  rung of\r\n\nthe administrative ladder is fatal to the court case.  She argued\r\n\nbelow  that the  court should  excuse her  omission, asseverating\r\n\nthat a final appeal to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy\r\n\nwould have been a  futile gesture because it would  have resulted\r\n\nin an automatic affirmance of her dismissal.   In theory, this is\r\n\na  good argument.

Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 61  (\"To come\r                                                \r\nwithin the exception, a  sort of inevitability is required:   the\r\nprospect  of refusal must be  certain (or nearly  so).\"), but the\r\ncase  at hand  does not  require us to  choose between  these two\r\nformulations.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nsuggest  that Portela's lack of success at the previous levels of\r\n\nreview necessarily signified that the final level of review would\r\n\nbe  an  empty  gesture,  her  failure  to  exhaust  an  available\r\n\nadministrative  remedy  cannot be  overlooked  on  the ground  of\r\n\nfutility.\r\n\n          3.   The District Court's Rationale.  To this point, we\r                    3.   The District Court's Rationale.\r                                                       \r\n\nare in agreement with the court below.  See Portela, 913 F. Supp.\r                                                             \r\n\nat  126-27  (declaring  that  alleged  futility  did  not  excuse\r\n\nPortela's nonexhaustion).  After finding the plaintiff's futility\r\n\nargument futile, however, the district  judge nonetheless elected\r\n\nto  relax  the  exhaustion  requirement \"[i]n  the  interests  of\r\n\nminimizing cost and delay in the judicial system and avoiding the\r\n\nwaste  of resources.\"   Id. at  127.   The judge  reasoned that a\r                                     \r\n\nperceived waste  of  resources, in  and  of itself,  can  justify\r\n\nexcusing  nonexhaustion of  administrative  remedies.   We  think\r\n\nnot.5\r\n\n          Were  we  to adopt  the  lower  court's reasoning,  the\r\n\nresulting exception would swallow the exhaustion rule in a single\r\n\ngulp.  Once  an aggrieved party has brought suit,  forcing her to\r\n\nretreat  to any  unused administrative appeal  potentially wastes\r                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5To  be  sure, we  stated  in Ezratty  that  \"[s]ometimes to\r                                                    \r\nrequire exhaustion  will not only  waste resources but  also work\r\nsevere harm  upon  a litigant.\"    648 F.2d  at  774.   Taken  in\r\ncontext, this  statement is  entirely compatible with  the \"undue\r\nprejudice/irreparable   harm\"   consideration  outlined   by  the\r\nMcCarthy Court in its discussion of the first potential exception\r                  \r\nto the exhaustion rule.  503 U.S. at 146-47.  In the case at bar,\r\nthere is no  hint that taking  an appeal to the  Deputy Assistant\r\nSecretary would have caused Portela irreparable harm or otherwise\r\nseriously prejudiced her rights.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nresources.   The  Supreme Court has  disavowed such  a resupinate\r\n\napproach.  In McKart  v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107944\"><a href=\"/opinion/107944/mckart-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1969),\r                                                \r\n\nthe Court  explained that a  \"primary purpose\" of  the exhaustion\r\n\ndoctrine  is  \"the avoidance  of  premature  interruption of  the\r\n\nadministrative  process.\"      Consequently,  it   is   generally\r\n\ninefficient to permit a  party to seek judicial recourse  without\r\n\nfirst exhausting her  administrative remedies.   See id. at  194.\r                                                                  \r\n\nFollowing this train of thought, the Court has concluded that, by\r\n\nand large,  concerns regarding  efficiency militate in  favor of,\r\n\nrather  than  against,  strict  application   of  the  exhaustion\r\n\ndoctrine.  See  McCarthy, 503 U.S.  at 145;  McKart, 395 U.S.  at\r                                                             \r\n\n195;  see also Ezratty, 648  F.2d at 774  (acknowledging that the\r                                \r\n\nexhaustion  doctrine \"serves  interests of  accuracy, efficiency,\r\n\nagency autonomy and judicial economy\").\r\n\n          This view  is steeped in real-world  wisdom.  Insisting\r\n\non exhaustion  forces parties to take  administrative proceedings\r\n\nseriously,  allows  administrative  agencies  an  opportunity  to\r\n\ncorrect their  own errors,  and potentially  avoids the  need for\r\n\njudicial  involvement  altogether.     Furthermore,  disregarding\r\n\navailable  administrative  processes thrusts  parties prematurely\r\n\ninto overcrowded courts and  weakens an agency's effectiveness by\r\n\nencouraging end-runs around it.   See McCarthy, 503 U.S.  at 145;\r                                                        \r\n\nMcKart, 395 U.S. at 195.\r                \r\n\n          4.  The Bottom Line.  To sum up, the futility exception\r                    4.  The Bottom Line.\r                                       \r\n\nis  unavailable to  Portela  and the  district court's  professed\r\n\nreason  for  excusing  her  failure  to  exhaust   administrative\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nremedies  neither passes muster on its own terms nor falls within\r\n\nany  of the  hallmark  McCarthy exceptions.6   Those  conclusions\r                                         \r\n\ndictate  the result  we  must  reach.    The  plaintiff  left  an\r\n\navailable administrative  remedy untapped and the  record in this\r\n\ncase, howsoever  construed,  reveals no  sufficiently  excusatory\r\n\ncircumstances to warrant spurning that remedy.\r\n\n          First,  there  is  no indication  that  full exhaustion\r\n\nwould have  caused undue prejudice, irreparable  harm, or unusual\r\n\nhardship of any  sort.   Although Portela had  already pursued  a\r\n\nfairly lengthy administrative process, it  had moved celeritously\r\n\n  the pavane  began when the OIC  terminated Portela's employment\r\n\nas  of July 3, 1990, and  ended when the NRSSO,  in the person of\r\n\nRear  Admiral Weatherson,  denied her  penultimate administrative\r\n\nappeal on March  25, 1991    and the  Deputy Assistant  Secretary\r\n\nwould have been required  to respond to her final  appeal \"within\r\n\n60  calendar days of receipt of the official record.\"  SECNAVINST\r\n\n5300.22B Ch.V (9)(d)(3).  Second, the agency (here, the Navy) was\r\n\nfully capable of granting all  the relief that Portela originally\r\n\nsought,  namely,  reinstatement, reassignment,  and  quashing the\r\n\ncharges against her.  Third, there is no meaningful indication of\r\n\nany institutional bias.  Fourth, the plaintiff has not identified\r\n\nany  other  special  circumstance warranting  relaxation  of  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6We  do  not  suggest  that  the  three  exceptions  to  the\r\nexhaustion  rule delineated  by  the McCarthy  Court comprise  an\r                                                       \r\nexclusive compendium.   But to  the extent that  other exceptions\r\nappropriately may lie, they must be on a  par with the exceptions\r\ndescribed by the  Court.  As  explained in the  text, the  record\r\nhere  contains nothing  which suggests  a  plausible basis  for a\r\nfurther exception.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nexhaustion  rule, and  our  careful perlustration  of the  record\r\n\nreveals none.   It follows  that the district  court should  have\r\n\ndismissed  the complaint for failure of  the plaintiff to exhaust\r\n\navailable administrative remedies.\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          It may  seem hypertechnical to  some that a  person who\r\n\nbelieves herself aggrieved by  agency action must jump  through a\r\n\nseries of  hoops before she can  seek out a judicial  forum.  But\r\n\nlong-recognized concerns  regarding agency autonomy  and judicial\r\n\nefficiency  weigh  heavily   in  favor   of  requiring   complete\r\n\nexhaustion  of administrative  remedies.   When all  is said  and\r\n\ndone, our  system of justice  depends on litigants'  adherence to\r\n\nwell-defined rules.  Where, as here, a party decides unilaterally\r\n\nto forsake those rules, she does so at her peril.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  The short of it is that Portela\r\n\nlacked a legally sufficient  reason for leaping prematurely  to a\r\n\njudicial venue.   Thus, the district court should  have dismissed\r\n\nher complaint  for  failure to  exhaust available  administrative\r\n\nremedies.  In the end, however,  the district court's error is of\r\n\nno moment; though the court entered judgment in favor of the Navy\r\n\non  an inappropriate ground, the Navy  is nonetheless entitled to\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n</pre>",
