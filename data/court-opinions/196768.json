We\r\n\ndo not reach the issue of whether Lui poses a risk of flight.\r\n\n          Lui,  formerly  a  senior  officer  of the  British\r\n\nAmerican Tobacco Co.  (HK) Ltd. (\"BAT\"),  is charged in  Hong\r\n\nKong   with conspiring  to receive and  receiving millions of\r\n\ndollars in bribes from Giant Island Ltd. (\"GIL\").  The bribes\r\n\nwere  allegedly given for a virtual monopoly on the export of\r\n\ncertain cigarettes to  the People's Republic of  China and to\r\n\nTaiwan.   The  Hong  Kong authorities  charge  that GIL  paid\r\n\nbribes  in excess  of HK  $100  million to  a  series of  BAT\r\n\nexecutives, including  Lui.  Other  alleged conspirators  are\r\n\nalso  charged with  the abduction,  torture, and murder  of a\r\n\nformer GIL  shareholder who  cooperated with the  authorities\r\n\nand,  it  is said,  would  have  provided  evidence of  Lui's\r\n\nacceptance of  bribes.   Lui was  away  from Hong  Kong on  a\r\n\nbusiness  trip  when  the  Hong Kong  authorities  sought  to\r\n\nquestion him  in April 1994  and he has not  returned to Hong\r\n\nKong since, despite representations  from his attorney to the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nauthorities  that   he  would   return  and  consent   to  be\r\n\ninterviewed within several weeks.\r\n\n          At  the request  of the  United Kingdom,  acting on\r\n\nbehalf of  its Crown  Colony,  Hong Kong,  the United  States\r\n\narrested Lui as he disembarked from a plane at Boston's Logan\r\n\nAirport on December 20, 1995.  The arrest was for the purpose\r\n\nof  extraditing Lui to Hong  Kong to face  several charges of\r\n\nbribery.   At  a December  21, 1995  hearing, the  government\r\n\nasked  that  Lui  be   detained  pending  completion  of  the\r\n\nextradition proceedings.   The magistrate  judge ordered  Lui\r\n\nheld temporarily pending a  full hearing on the motion.   Lui\r\n\nfiled a cross-motion to  be released on conditions.   After a\r\n\nhearing,  the magistrate  judge  denied Lui's  request to  be\r\n\nreleased on bail.  The magistrate judge found both that there\r\n\nwere no special circumstances and there was a risk of flight.\r\n\n          On  a petition  for a  writ of  habeas  corpus, the\r\n\ndistrict court reversed the order of the magistrate judge and\r\n\nreleased Lui on conditions.  The district court held that the\r\n\nreversion of Hong Kong  to the People's Republic of  China on\r\n\nJuly 1, 1997 raised complex legal issues that would result in\r\n\nprotracted proceedings and presented a \"special circumstance\"\r\n\noverriding the presumption against  bail.  The district court\r\n\nalso found that  there were conditions of  release that would\r\n\nadequately ensure Lui's presence  at future proceedings.  The\r\n\ndistrict court's  order granting a release  on conditions has\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nbeen  stayed  pending  this decision.    We  now reverse  the\r\n\ndistrict court and  order Lui held pending the  resolution of\r\n\nthe extradition issue.\r\n\n          There  is a presumption against bail in extradition\r\n\ncases  and only  \"special circumstances\"  justify  release on\r\n\nbail.

McNamara  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHenkel, 46 F.2d 84, 84 (S.D.N.Y. 1912) (\"When the examination\r                  \r\n\nday  comes and the [government] is not ready to proceed after\r\n\nhaving had  a reasonable opportunity to  communicate with the\r\n\nregion from  whence the request for  extradition emanated, it\r\n\nis  then time enough  to ask for bail.\").   Other courts have\r\n\nheld that such circumstances  may also include the raising of\r\n\nsubstantial claims against  extradition on which the  relator\r\n\nhas a high probability of success, a serious deterioration in\r\n\nthe  relator's health,  or  an unusual  delay in  the appeals\r\n\nprocess.

United  States, 878 F.2d  317, 317 (9th\r                                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nCir. 1989); In re Extradition of Siegmund, 887 F. Supp. 1383,\r                                                     \r\n\n1385-86  (D. Nev. 1995);  United States v.  Taitz, 130 F.R.D.\r                                                             \r\n\n442,  444-45  (S.D.  Cal.  1990).   While  arguably  Lui  may\r\n\nultimately prevail in his  challenges to his extradition, the\r\n\nrecord does not  establish probability of success  one way or\r\n\nanother.  Similarly, the other two grounds do not obtain.\r\n\n          Lui  argues that  the  complexity  of legal  issues\r\n\nsurrounding  the  impending change  in sovereignty  over Hong\r\n\nKong (namely,  whether extradition is authorized if it is the\r\n\nPeople's Republic of China, and not Hong Kong, which will try\r\n\nLui)  will result  in protracted extradition  proceedings and\r\n\nthat this  constitutes a \"special  circumstance.\"  We  do not\r\n\nagree.  Lui does  not argue that the extradition  hearing has\r\n\nyet  been unduly  delayed.   See Williams,  611 F.2d  at 915;\r                                                     \r\n\nMcNamara, 46 F.2d at  84.  The matter is  currently scheduled\r                    \r\n\nto  be heard on May  28, 1996 before  Magistrate Judge Karol.\r\n\nIndeed, Lui states in his brief in this court that \"the lower\r\n\ncourts have been deciding the issues at as rapid a pace as is\r\n\npracticable.\"   To the extent that there has been some delay,\r\n\nLui himself is partly responsible, having moved, for example,\r\n\nat the end of  April, for a continuance of  the hearing which\r\n\nhad been scheduled  for May 6, 1996.1  Moreover,  there is no\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We also note that on May 6, 1996, Lui filed a motion with\r\nthe district court  entitled Motion  for Leave  to Amend  His\r\nPetition for  a Writ of Habeas Corpus  and to Dismiss so Much\r                                                 \r\nof  His Petition as Seeks Release on Conditions, in which Lui\r\nsought \"to dismiss so  much of his pending petition  as seeks\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nreason to believe that the extradition hearing itself will be\r\n\nunusually  long.  At  oral argument before  this court, Lui's\r\n\ncounsel estimated  that the hearing  would take two  to three\r\n\ndays  at most,  while the government  suggested a  few hours.\r\n\nLui  has made  an  insufficient showing  that  the issues  he\r\n\nraises are so complex that the resolution of  the extradition\r\n\nissue will be  inevitably and exceedingly protracted.  Cf. In\r                                                                         \r\n\nre Extradition of Morales, 906  F. Supp. 1368, 1374-75  (S.D.\r                                     \r\n\nCal.  1995)  (\"special  circumstances\"  existed  when,  after\r\n\nrelator already had been held six  months, the United States,\r\n\nat  the request of  the foreign government  involved and upon\r\n\nthe dismissal of the original  complaint for lack of probable\r\n\ncause,  filed a  new complaint  charging a  different offense\r\n\nthus delaying conclusion of the  matter).  The factual record\r\n\nwill  be further developed at the  extradition hearing and it\r\n\nis premature for this  court to consider the merits  of Lui's\r\n\nclaims.  Finally, we  do not believe that the  normal passage\r\n\nof  time inherent  in  the litigation  process constitutes  a\r\n\n\"special circumstance.\"  Should unusual delays transpire, Lui\r\n\nmay then renew his bail request.\r\n\n          Thus, we  are left  with Lui's argument  that final\r\n\nresolution  of  the extradition  proceedings  (unless  in his\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nhis  release  on  conditions,  and to  vacate  [the  district\r\ncourt's] April  25, 1996 Order  which granted him  release on\r\nconditions.\"  Had that motion been granted, which it was not,\r\nconsiderable delay would have resulted.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfavor) may not take place before reversion and it is unlikely\r\n\nthat there will be a treaty in place allowing his extradition\r\n\nto the People's Republic of China.  Under such circumstances,\r\n\nhe argues, he could not be extradited after reversion and the\r\n\nUnited States  would be required to  release him immediately.\r\n\nHowever, given the current  uncertainty over the future state\r\n\nof foreign affairs2  with Hong Kong and the People's Republic\r\n\nof  China  and  the  possibility (which  we  do  not consider\r\n\nremote) that the federal courts will complete their review of\r\n\nthis matter well prior  to July 1, 1997, we  are reluctant at\r\n\nthis time  to consider  the expected effect  of reversion  on\r\n\nLui's extraditability to constitute a \"special circumstance.\"\r\n\n          For  these reasons,  we  reverse the  order of  the\r\n\ndistrict court releasing Lui on bail and instruct that Lui be\r\n\nheld without  bail pending the resolution  of the extradition\r\n\nissue.  This order  is without prejudice to Lui's  ability to\r\n\nfile a new  motion for release  on bail  at some future  date\r\n\nshould there be a change in circumstances.\r\n\n          It is so ordered.\r                                       \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Lui's own brief before this court states that \"the Senate\r\nmay yet ratify  an agreement with  the [People's Republic  of\r\nChina] . . .  which would provide the necessary  assurance of\r\n. . . protections  [for trial  or punishment by  the People's\r\nRepublic  of China]  after the U.K.  relinquishes sovereignty\r\nover  Hong  Kong's  criminal  justice  system.\"    While  the\r\nconcession  was made in the context of trial or punishment by\r\nthe  People's  Republic of  China after  a surrender  to Hong\r\nKong,  such  an  agreement   could  conceivably  cover  post-\r\nreversion  extraditions for  offenses committed  against Hong\r\nKong.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n",

The magistrate judge found both that there were no special circumstances and there was a risk of flight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the district court reversed the order of the magistrate judge and released Lui on conditions.   The district court held that the reversion of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997 raised complex legal issues that would result in protracted proceedings and presented a \"special circumstance\" overriding the presumption against bail.   The district court also found that there were conditions of release that would adequately ensure Lui's presence at future proceedings.   The district court's order granting a release on conditions has been stayed pending this decision.   We now reverse the district court and order Lui held pending the resolution of the extradition issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a presumption against bail in extradition cases and only \"special circumstances\" justify release on bail.  Wright v. Henkel, 190 U.S. 40, 63, 23 S.Ct. 781, 787, 47 L.Ed. 948 (1903);  Koskotas v. Roche, 931 F.2d 169, 175 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v.

Hartigan, 554 F.2d 1, 1 (1st Cir.1977) (per curiam).  \"Special circumstances\" are limited to situations in which \" 'the justification [for release] is pressing as well as plain.' \"  Williams, 611 F.2d at 915 (quoting In re Klein, 46 F.2d 85, 85 (S.D.N.Y.1930)).  \"Special circumstances\" may include a delayed extradition hearing.  Id. at 915;  see also United States ex rel. McNamara v. Henkel, 46 F.2d 84, 84 (S.D.N.Y.1912) (\"When the examination day comes and the [government] is not ready to proceed after having had a reasonable opportunity to communicate with the region from whence the request for extradition emanated, it is then time enough to ask for bail.\").   Other courts have held that such circumstances may also include the raising of substantial claims against extradition on which the relator has a high probability of success, a serious deterioration in the relator's health, or an unusual delay in the appeals process.  Salerno v. United States, 878 F.2d 317, 317 (9th Cir.1989);  In re Extradition of Siegmund, 887 F.Supp. 1383, 1385-86 (D.Nev.1995);  United States v. Taitz, 130 F.R.D. 442, 444-45 (S.D.Cal.1990).   While arguably Lui may ultimately prevail in his challenges to his extradition, the record does not establish probability of success one way or another. Similarly, the other two grounds do not obtain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lui argues that the complexity of legal issues surrounding the impending change in sovereignty over Hong Kong (namely, whether extradition is authorized if it is the People's Republic of China, and not Hong Kong, which will try Lui) will result in protracted extradition proceedings and that this constitutes a \"special circumstance.\"   We do not agree.   Lui does not argue that the extradition hearing has yet been unduly delayed.   See Williams, 611 F.2d at 915;  McNamara, 46 F.2d at 84.   The matter is currently scheduled to be heard on May 28, 1996 before Magistrate Judge Karol.   Indeed, Lui states in his brief in this court that \"the lower courts have been deciding the issues at as rapid a pace as is practicable.\"   To the extent that there has been some delay, Lui himself is partly responsible, having moved, for example, at the end of April, for a continuance of the hearing which had been scheduled for May 6, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Moreover, there is no reason to believe that the extradition hearing itself will be unusually long.   At oral argument before this court, Lui's counsel estimated that the hearing would take two to three days at most, while the government suggested a few hours.   Lui has made an insufficient showing that the issues he raises are so complex that the resolution of the extradition issue will be inevitably and exceedingly protracted.   Cf. In re Extradition of Morales, 906 F.Supp. 1368, 1374-75 (S.D.Cal.1995) (\"special circumstances\" existed when, after relator already had been held six months, the United States, at the request of the foreign government involved and upon the dismissal of the original complaint for lack of probable cause, filed a new complaint charging a different offense thus delaying conclusion of the matter).   The factual record will be further developed at the extradition hearing and it is premature for this court to consider the merits of Lui's claims.   Finally, we do not believe that the normal passage of time inherent in the litigation process constitutes a \"special circumstance.\"   Should unusual delays transpire, Lui may then renew his bail request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we are left with Lui's argument that final resolution of the extradition proceedings (unless in his favor) may not take place before reversion and it is unlikely that there will be a treaty in place allowing his extradition to the People's Republic of China.   Under such circumstances, he argues, he could not be extradited after reversion and the United States would be required to release him immediately.   However, given the current uncertainty over the future state of foreign affairs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China and the possibility (which we do not consider remote) that the federal courts will complete their review of this matter well prior to July 1, 1997, we are reluctant at this time to consider the expected effect of reversion on Lui's extraditability to constitute a \"special circumstance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we reverse the order of the district court releasing Lui on bail and instruct that Lui be held without bail pending the resolution of the extradition issue.

(HK) Ltd.  (\"BAT\"), is charged in Hong Kong with conspiring to receive and receiving millions of dollars in bribes from Giant Island Ltd.  (\"GIL\").  The bribes were allegedly given for a virtual monopoly on the export of certain cigarettes to the People's Republic of China and to Taiwan.   The Hong Kong authorities charge that GIL paid bribes in excess of HK $100 million to a series of BAT executives, including Lui.  Other alleged conspirators are also charged with the abduction, torture, and murder of a former GIL shareholder who cooperated with the authorities and, it is said, would have provided evidence of Lui's acceptance of bribes.   Lui was away from Hong Kong on a business trip when the Hong Kong authorities sought to question him in April 1994 and he has not returned to Hong Kong since, despite representations from his attorney to the authorities that he would return and consent to be interviewed within several weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of the United Kingdom, acting on behalf of its Crown Colony, Hong Kong, the United States arrested Lui as he disembarked from a plane at Boston's Logan Airport on December 20, 1995.   The arrest was for the purpose of extraditing Lui to Hong Kong to face several charges of bribery.   At a December 21, 1995 hearing, the government asked that Lui be detained pending completion of the extradition proceedings.   The magistrate judge ordered Lui held temporarily pending a full hearing on the motion.   Lui filed a cross-motion to be released on conditions.
