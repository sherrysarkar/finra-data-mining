Defendant-appellant Borland\r\nInternational, Inc. (\"Borland\") appeals from the district court's\r\norder denying its motion for attorney's fees and costs incurred\r\nduring extended litigation concerning its alleged infringement of\r\nplaintiff-appellee Lotus Development Corporation's (\"Lotus\")\r\ncopyright in a computer program, Lotus 1-2-3.  Borland, the\r\nprevailing party in this copyright infringement action, now claims\r\nthat the district court abused its discretion in declining to award\r\nfees.  We affirm.\r\n                             I. \r\nBackground                         \r\n Lotus 1-2-3 is a spreadsheet computer program that\r\nenables users to perform various functions and calculations.  In\r\n1987, Borland released spreadsheet programs Quattro and Quattro Pro,\r\nwhich competed with Lotus 1-2-3 and contained virtually identical\r\ncopies of the 1-2-3 menu command hierarchy.  The inclusion of this\r\nso-called \"menu tree\" from Lotus 1-2-3 prompted the instant\r\nlitigation in 1990, the substance of which is set forth in our prior\r\nopinion.  See Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807,\r\n810-811 (1st Cir. 1995).  Here we recite only the facts pertinent\r\nto the present appeal.  \r\n The hard-fought litigation below resulted in four\r\nseparate district court opinions (Keeton, U.S.D.J.), culminating in\r\nthe district court's conclusion that the 1-2-3 menu tree contained\r\ncopyrightable expression and that Borland had thus infringed Lotus's\r\ncopyrights in Lotus 1-2-3.  On March 9, 1995, we reversed, holding\r\nas a matter of first impression that the 1-2-3 menu command\r\nhierarchy was an uncopyrightable \"method of operation\" under 17\r\nU.S.C.  102(b).  See 49 F.3d at 813-18.  Subsequently, the Supreme\r\nCourt granted Lotus's petition for certiorari but deadlocked on the\r\nmerits, resulting in an affirmance by an equally divided Court.  See516 U.S. 233 (1996). \r\nAfter the Supreme Court proceedings, Borland filed a\r\nmotion for attorney's fees and \"full costs\" as the prevailing party\r\npursuant to 17 U.S.C.  505.  Borland claimed that, as a result of\r\nLotus's suit, it had incurred over $11 million in attorney's fees,\r\n$7.5 million in expert fees, and $1.6 million in other costs.  It\r\nsought reimbursement for all of these expenses.  Following oral\r\nargument, the district court (Woodlock, U.S.D.J.) denied Borland's\r\nmotion.   As we explicate below, the district court reasoned, in\r\nessence, that Lotus and Borland had litigated a novel and unsettled\r\nquestion of copyright law in order to protect their own economic\r\ninterests, and thus under Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517\r\n(1994)(interpreting 17 U.S.C.  505), an award of fees was not\r\nwarranted.  Borland now appeals this ruling. \r\n                             II. \r\n                          Discussion\r\nPursuant to 17 U.S.C.  505, the district \"court in its\r\ndiscretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any\r\nparty. . . .  The court may also award a reasonable attorney's fee\r\nto the prevailing party as part of the costs.\"  We will disturb a\r\nruling under section 505 only if the record persuades us that the\r\ntrial court \"indulged a serious lapse in judgment.\" Texaco P.R.,\r\nInc. v. Department of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 875 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).\r\nIn Fogerty, the Supreme Court rejected the \"dual standard\"\r\nfor the award of fees, then in effect in many circuits, which\r\nallowed prevailing plaintiffs to recover attorney's fees almost\r\nautomatically under section 505, but which required prevailing\r\ndefendants to demonstrate that the plaintiff's claims were frivolous\r\nor brought in bad faith.  See 510 U.S. at 534.  Finding no basis for\r\nthe disparate treatment of plaintiffs and defendants in the text of\r\nsection 505, the Fogerty Court held that district courts should\r\nexercise their equitable discretion to award fees in an even-handed\r\nmanner, and with the goal of vindicating the overriding purpose of\r\nthe Copyright Act: to encourage the production of original literary,\r\nartistic, and musical expression for the public good.  See id. at\r\n524, 534.  Rather than formulate a specific standard for district\r\ncourts to apply, the Court identified a list of nonexclusive factors\r\nthat district courts may consider, such as \"frivolousness,\r\nmotivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and\r\nlegal components of the case) and the need in some cases to advance\r\nconsiderations of compensation and deterrence.\"  Id. at 534 n.19\r\n(citing Lieb v. Topstone Indus., Inc. 788 F.2d 151, 156 (3d Cir.\r\n1986)).  Notably, the Fogerty Court eschewed arguments that courts\r\nshould employ the so-called \"British rule,\" which mandates the award\r\nof attorney's fees to prevailing parties. See id. at 534.\r\nIn denying Borland's fee application, the district court\r\nreasoned, in part, as follows:  \r\nFogerty opened the possibility of the shifting\r\nof attorney's fees, but it did not embrace a\r\nregime of the automatic award of attorney's\r\nfees.  Rather it recognized that there is to\r\nbe undertaken an exercise of equitable\r\ndiscretion for which there is no precise\r\nformula.\r\n                           . . .  \r\n\nWhat we dealt with here is a case dealing with\r\nwhat I call the open-textured dimensions of\r\nthe copyright law in which the interstices\r\nwere quite broad and in which judges attempted\r\nto knit a fabric that maintained the integrity\r\nof copyright law itself. . . .  [T]here was\r\nmerit on both sides, and [the court of appeals\r\nwas] dealing with an area that was . . .\r\nmoving copyright law into a relatively\r\nuncharted area that would benefit from further\r\ndirections from Congress and in which both\r\nparties had an important economic interest.  \r\n     I find that the claims made by Lotus\r\nwere meritorious.  I also find that this is a\r\ncase in which the various judges . . . had\r\ndifferent views . . . . \r\n                            . . . \r\n\n     And so, while I find that this was not\r\nfrivolous, [and that] the claims were\r\nobjectively reasonable . . . that we deal with\r\na quite unique set of circumstances as to\r\nwhich the larger directions of Fogerty are not\r\nto make an award of attorney's fees . . . . \r\n\nThe district court then considered whether an award was warranted\r\nin light of the other factors mentioned in Fogerty: motivation,\r\ncompensation, and deterrence.  Finding that these factors did not\r\nmilitate in favor of an award, the court denied fees. \r\nBorland mounts both legal and factual challenges to the\r\ndistrict court's decision.  We turn first to Borland's claims of\r\nlegal error.  Borland asserts that the court applied the Fogertystandard incorrectly because it placed two factors, the non-\r\nfrivolous nature of the plaintiff's claims and their objective\r\nreasonableness, above all other considerations.  Borland contends\r\nthat when corporate giants litigate important copyright questions\r\nof first impression, the resulting lack of frivolousness and\r\nobjective unreasonableness will invariably preclude a prevailing\r\ndefendant from obtaining attorney's fees.  This reasoning, Borland\r\nconcludes, is no different from the \"dual standard\" rejected in\r\nFogerty, and thus, under Fogerty and Edwards v. Red Farm Studio Co.,\r\n109 F.3d 80 (1st Cir. 1997), the district court's analysis is\r\nlegally erroneous. \r\nAlthough we agree with Borland that defendants are no\r\nlonger required as a matter of law to demonstrate culpable behavior\r\non the plaintiff's part, see Fantasy v. Fogerty, 94 F.3d 553, 558\r\n(9th Cir. 1996), we disagree with Borland's characterization of the\r\ndistrict court's reasoning.  Had the district court taken such a\r\nhard line, Borland would have a strong argument.  In Edwards, we\r\nreversed the denial of attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant\r\nbecause the district court had required a showing of bad faith or\r\nfrivolousness.  See 109 F.3d at 82.  The district court here,\r\nhowever, committed no such error.  Rather, it is evident that the\r\ncourt recognized that under Fogerty a showing of culpability is not\r\na prerequisite for awarding fees: after concluding that Lotus's\r\nclaims were neither frivolous nor objectively unreasonable, the\r\ncourt went on to consider the remaining Lieb factors.  The district\r\ncourt merely reasoned, in part, that when a plaintiff prosecutes an\r\naction in good faith, in an unsettled area of law, and with a\r\nreasonable likelihood of success, against a party with similar\r\nfinancial resources, the prevailing party's case for attorney's fees\r\nis weaker, whether it be a plaintiff or a defendant.  This view has\r\na long history in copyright law, see, e.g., McCulloch v. Albert E.\r\nPrice, Inc., 823 F.2d 316, 322 (9th Cir. 1987);  Official Aviation\r\nGuide Co. v. American Aviation Assocs., 162 F.2d 541, 542 (7th Cir.\r\n1947), and in no way conflicts with Fogerty's command to treat\r\nprevailing plaintiffs and defendants even-handedly.  As a result,\r\nwe see no basis for concluding that the district court applied an\r\nincorrect legal standard.  \r\nBorland next contends that the district court committed\r\nlegal error by relying on the Supreme Court's affirmance by an\r\nequally divided court to buttress its conclusion that Borland\r\nnarrowly prevailed on the merits.  Borland argues that the inference\r\nmade by the court, that four Justices of the Supreme Court were\r\nready to reverse our opinion on the merits, is legally incorrect\r\nbecause there is no way to ascertain the position of the Justices\r\non the merits of the litigation.   \r\nThe relevance of this objection to our present analysis\r\nis not obvious to us.  At points, the court did refer to the split\r\non the Supreme Court as some evidence that Lotus's claims had merit\r\nand thus were objectively reasonable.  To the extent that Borland\r\nchallenges this finding, its challenge is unpersuasive.  The fact\r\nremains that Lotus filed this action only after prevailing on a\r\nvirtually identical claim that was never appealed against a\r\ndifferent software company.  See Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Paperback\r\nSoftware Int'l, 740 F. Supp. 37 (D. Mass. 1990) (Keeton, U.S.D.J.). \r\nAlthough we ultimately held to the contrary, we cannot say that\r\nLotus's initial decision to rely on Paperback was objectively\r\nunreasonable.  Regardless of the meaning of the Supreme Court's\r\nnarrow affirmance, the district court's conclusion that Lotus's\r\nchief claim was objectively reasonable is certainly a permissible\r\none. \r\nBorland also contends that the district court's\r\napplication of the various Lieb factors was clearly erroneous.  SeeLieb, 788 F.2d at 156.  The court found that neither party had an\r\nimproper motivation in litigating the case, reasoning that both\r\nparties had important economic interests in the litigation and that\r\nthere were \"no clear signs for judicial determination.\"  The court\r\nalso held that the need to advance considerations of compensation\r\nand deterrence did not militate in favor of a fee award.  The court\r\nfound no \"oppression by one party over the other in the ability to\r\nuse their financial wherewithal to affect the litigation\" and\r\nconcluded that when \"the parties are litigating a matter of some\r\nimportance to the copyright laws, there is no need for deterrence.\" \r\nBorland now contends that the district court erred by\r\nignoring Lotus's alleged anti-competitive purposes in bringing the\r\nlitigation, relying impermissibly on Borland's refusal to settle the\r\ncase, and discounting the importance of encouraging copyright\r\ndefendants to assert meritorious defenses.  Borland notes that it\r\nadvanced the interests of copyright law by litigating this case all\r\nthe way through the Supreme Court against an unusually wealthy\r\nplaintiff.  It also contends that the \"vindication\" of its own\r\ncopyright in Quattro Pro increased the availability of copyrighted\r\nworks.  Borland concludes that \"if ever there were a situation where\r\nthe assertion of meritorious defenses should be encouraged, it is\r\na case involving issues of first impression.\"   \r\nNone of these contentions provides a basis for overriding\r\nthe denial of fees and costs.  Both sides proffered evidence on the\r\nissue of whether Lotus had intended to use this litigation to\r\nbankrupt Borland and thus maintain its dominant position in the\r\nspreadsheet market.  We cannot say, on the record before us, that\r\nthe presence of an impermissible motive on Lotus's part is so clear\r\nthat a contrary conclusion could not reasonably be reached.  After\r\nall, copyright law often delineates the boundaries of economic\r\ncompetition.  See, e.g., Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel.\r\nServs., 499 U.S. 340, 349 (1990) (holding that the plaintiff's\r\ntelephone directory lacked originality and thus copyright law did\r\nnot bar defendant from copying the information to create a competing\r\nproduct).  Arguably, there is nothing inherently improper about\r\nbringing a claim that is well-founded in law and fact against one's\r\ncompetitors, even when legal action, if successful, will inflict\r\nsevere economic consequences upon them. \r\nAs for the district court's consideration of the parties'\r\nsettlement negotiations, the court did note in its discussion of the\r\nmotivation factor that \"more careful evaluators of the expense of\r\nlitigation might have chosen not to spend\" the money to litigate the\r\ncase.  This statement does give us some concern.  Copyright\r\ndefendants with strong legal or factual defenses should not be\r\ndeterred from litigation by the possibility that their refusal to\r\nsettle an invalid claim will be held against them after they\r\nprevail.  Such reasoning would conflict with Fogerty's direction\r\nthat the award of fees should encourage copyright defendants to\r\nassert meritorious defenses.  See 510 U.S. at 527.  We are\r\nconfident, however, that the court's casual observation regarding\r\nthe costs of litigation was not material to its ultimate\r\ndetermination.  Rather, the court relied squarely on the parties'\r\nclear economic interests in pursuing the litigation, about which\r\nthere is little to dispute.\r\nTurning to the need to encourage meritorious defenses, a\r\ncopyright defendant's success on the merits in a case of first\r\nimpression may militate in favor of a fee award, but we are\r\nunwilling to hold that a successful defense in an important case\r\nnecessarily mandates an award of attorney's fees.  When close\r\ninfringement cases are litigated, copyright law benefits from the\r\nresulting clarification of the doctrine's boundaries.  But because\r\nnovel cases require a plaintiff to sue in the first place, the need\r\nto encourage meritorious defenses is a factor that a district court\r\nmay balance against the potentially chilling effect of imposing a\r\nlarge fee award on a plaintiff, who, in a particular case, may have\r\nadvanced a reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, claim.  Fogerty made\r\nclear that courts are to evaluate cases on an individualized basis,\r\nwith the primary responsibility resting on the shoulders of the\r\ndistrict judge.  Regardless of whether we would have approached the\r\nmatter similarly, we are unable to say that the district court's\r\nanalysis strikes us as an abuse of that discretion. \r\nBorland's final contentions--that the district court\r\nerred by ignoring Borland's \"vindication\" of its own copyrighted\r\ncomputer program and Lotus's unusual wealth--are unpersuasive.   As\r\na basis for awarding fees, we see no meaningful distinction between\r\nBorland's vindication of its own copyrighted work and its assertion\r\nof a meritorious defense.  The latter necessarily implies the\r\nformer.  In addition, the district court supportably found that both\r\nparties were financially able to litigate this important case. \r\nLotus's unusual wealth in no way alters this conclusion. \r\nAs an alternative to its argument for all its fees and\r\ncosts, Borland claims that the district court erred by not awarding\r\nBorland fees and costs attributable to those portions of the case\r\nin which Lotus's conduct was objectively unreasonable. \r\nSpecifically, Borland claims it was objectively unreasonable for\r\nLotus (1) to litigate the \"functional constraints\" issue, seeBorland II, 799 F. Supp. at 221; Borland III, 831 F. Supp. at 207;\r\n(2) to add the \"Key Reader\" claim in the midst of the case, seeBorland IV, 831 F. Supp. at 230-31; and (3) to prosecute a trial on\r\ndamages during the pendency of Borland's successful appeal.   \r\nThe district court denied Borland's motion for \"full\r\ncosts\" covering the entire litigation, but did not explicitly rule\r\nBorland's alternative request for \"partial\" fees and costs.   The\r\nissue of awarding partial fees was, however, argued at some length\r\nduring the hearing on Borland's motion, which indicates that the\r\ndistrict court considered Borland's arguments.  Although the\r\ndistrict court's silence is troubling, we think it implicit that his\r\ndecision that no fees are warranted for the entirety of the case\r\nnecessarily encompasses Borland's request for fees resulting from\r\nindividual parts of the litigation.  In addition, there is no\r\nsuggestion in the district court's opinion that it was under the\r\nlegally erroneous impression that an award of partial fees was not\r\nallowable under section 505.   \r\nThis case is close, particularly in the lack of analysis\r\non Borland's partial fee request.  If the district court had\r\ndecided to award at least some fees, it is difficult to see how that\r\ndecision would have been an abuse of discretion either.  But the\r\ndecision to award fees is not a decision committed to the appellate\r\ncourt in the first instance.  We are thus limited to saying only\r\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in its\r\ndecision. \r\nAffirmed.  No costs to either party.\n",

Department of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 875 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fogerty, the Supreme Court rejected the \"dual standard\" for the award of fees, then in effect in many circuits, which allowed prevailing plaintiffs to recover attorney's fees almost automatically under section 505, but which required prevailing defendants to demonstrate that the plaintiff's claims were frivolous or brought in bad faith.  See 510 U.S. at 534, 114 S.Ct. at 1033.   Finding no basis for the disparate treatment of plaintiffs and defendants in the text of section 505, the Fogerty Court held that district courts should exercise their equitable discretion to award fees in an even-handed manner, and with the goal of vindicating the overriding purpose of the Copyright Act:  to encourage the production of original literary, artistic, and musical expression for the public good.  See id. at 524, 534, 114 S.Ct. at 1028, 1033.   Rather than formulate a specific standard for district courts to apply, the Court identified a list of nonexclusive factors that district courts may consider, such as \"frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and legal components of the case) and the need in some cases to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.\"  Id. at 534 n. 19, 114 S.Ct. at 1033 n. 19 (citing Lieb v. Topstone Indus., Inc. 788 F.2d 151, 156 (3d Cir.1986)).  Notably, the Fogerty Court eschewed arguments that courts should employ the so-called \"British rule,\" which mandates the award of attorney's fees to prevailing parties.  See id. at 534, 114 S.Ct. at 1033.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying Borland's fee application, the district court reasoned, in part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Fogerty opened the possibility of the shifting of attorney's fees, but it did not embrace a regime of the automatic award of attorney's fees.  Rather it recognized that there is to be undertaken an exercise of equitable discretion for which there is no precise formula.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>What we dealt with here is a case dealing with what I call the open-textured dimensions of the copyright law in which the interstices were quite broad and in which judges attempted to knit a fabric that maintained the integrity of copyright law itself....  [T]here was merit on both sides, and [the court of appeals was] dealing with an area that was ... moving copyright law into a relatively uncharted area that would benefit from further directions from Congress and in which both parties had an important economic interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that the claims made by Lotus were meritorious.  I also find that this is a case in which the various judges ... had different views....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And so, while I find that this was not frivolous, [and that] the claims were objectively reasonable ... that we deal with a quite unique set of circumstances as to which the larger directions of Fogerty are not to make an award of attorney's fees....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then considered whether an award was warranted in light of the other factors mentioned in Fogerty:  motivation, compensation, and deterrence.  Finding that these factors did not militate in favor of an award, the court denied fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland mounts both legal and factual challenges to the district court's decision.  We turn first to Borland's claims of legal error.  Borland asserts that the court applied the Fogerty standard incorrectly because it placed two factors, the non-frivolous nature of the plaintiff's claims and their objective reasonableness, above all other considerations.  Borland contends that when corporate giants litigate important copyright questions of first impression, the resulting lack of frivolousness and objective unreasonableness will invariably preclude a prevailing defendant from obtaining attorney's fees.  This reasoning, Borland concludes, is no different from the \"dual standard\" rejected in Fogerty, and thus, under Fogerty and Edwards v. Red Farm Studio Co., 109 F.3d 80 (1st Cir.1997), the district court's analysis is legally erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with Borland that defendants are no longer required as a matter of law to demonstrate culpable behavior on the plaintiff's part, see Fantasy v. Fogerty, 94 F.3d 553, 558 (9th Cir.1996), we disagree with Borland's characterization of the district court's reasoning.  Had the district court taken such a hard line, Borland would have a strong argument.  In Edwards, we reversed the denial of attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant because the district court had required a showing of bad faith or frivolousness.  See 109 F.3d at 82.   The district court here, however, committed no such error.  Rather, it is evident that the court recognized that under Fogerty a showing of culpability is not a prerequisite for awarding fees:  after concluding that Lotus's claims were neither frivolous nor objectively unreasonable, the court went on to consider the remaining Lieb factors.  The district court merely reasoned, in part, that when a plaintiff prosecutes an action in good faith, in an unsettled area of law, and with a reasonable likelihood of success, against a party with similar financial resources, the prevailing party's case for attorney's fees is weaker, whether it be a plaintiff or a defendant.  This view has a long history in copyright law, see, e.g., McCulloch v. Albert E. Price, Inc., 823 F.2d 316, 322 (9th Cir.1987);  Official Aviation Guide Co. v. American Aviation Assocs., 162 F.2d 541, 542 (7th Cir.1947), and in no way conflicts with Fogerty 's command to treat prevailing plaintiffs and defendants even-handedly.  As a result, we see no basis for concluding that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland next contends that the district court committed legal error by relying on the Supreme Court's affirmance by an equally divided court to buttress its conclusion that Borland narrowly prevailed on the merits.  Borland argues that the inference made by the court, that four Justices of the Supreme Court were ready to reverse our opinion on the merits, is legally incorrect because there is no way to ascertain the position of the Justices on the merits of the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevance of this objection to our present analysis is not obvious to us.  At points, the court did refer to the split on the Supreme Court as some evidence that Lotus's claims had merit and thus were objectively reasonable.  To the extent that Borland challenges this finding, its challenge is unpersuasive.  The fact remains that Lotus filed this action only after prevailing on a virtually identical claim that was never appealed against a different software company.  See Lotus Dev.  Corp. v. Paperback Software Int'l, 740 F.Supp. 37 (D.Mass.1990) (Keeton, U.S.D.J.).  Although we ultimately held to the contrary, we cannot say that Lotus's initial decision to rely on Paperback was objectively unreasonable.  Regardless of the meaning of the Supreme Court's narrow affirmance, the district court's conclusion that Lotus's chief claim was objectively reasonable is certainly a permissible one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland also contends that the district court's application of the various Lieb factors was clearly erroneous.  See Lieb, 788 F.2d at 156.   The court found that neither party had an improper motivation in litigating the case, reasoning that both parties had important economic interests in the litigation and that there were \"no clear signs for judicial determination.\"   The court also held that the need to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence did not militate in favor of a fee award.  The court found no \"oppression by one party over the other in the ability to use their financial wherewithal to affect the litigation\" and concluded that when \"the parties are litigating a matter of some importance to the copyright laws, there is no need for deterrence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland now contends that the district court erred by ignoring Lotus's alleged anti-competitive purposes in bringing the litigation, relying impermissibly on Borland's refusal to settle the case, and discounting the importance of encouraging copyright defendants to assert meritorious defenses.  Borland notes that it advanced the interests of copyright law by litigating this case all the way through the Supreme Court against an unusually wealthy plaintiff.  It also contends that the \"vindication\" of its own copyright in Quattro Pro increased the availability of copyrighted works.  Borland concludes that \"if ever there were a situation where the assertion of meritorious defenses should be encouraged, it is a case involving issues of first impression.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these contentions provides a basis for overriding the denial of fees and costs.  Both sides proffered evidence on the issue of whether Lotus had intended to use this litigation to bankrupt Borland and thus maintain its dominant position in the spreadsheet market.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We cannot say, on the record before us, that the presence of an impermissible motive on Lotus's part is so clear that a contrary conclusion could not reasonably be reached.  After all, copyright law often delineates the boundaries of economic competition.  See, e.g., Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Service, 499 U.S. 340, 349, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1289-90, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (holding that the plaintiff's telephone directory lacked originality and thus copyright law did not bar defendant from copying the information to create a competing product).  Arguably, there is nothing inherently improper about bringing a claim that is well-founded in law and fact against one's competitors, even when legal action, if successful, will inflict severe economic consequences upon them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the district court's consideration of the parties' settlement negotiations, the court did note in its discussion of the motivation factor that \"more careful evaluators of the expense of litigation might have chosen not to spend\" the money to litigate the case.  This statement does give us some concern.  Copyright defendants with strong legal or factual defenses should not be deterred from litigation by the possibility that their refusal to settle an invalid claim will be held against them after they prevail.  Such reasoning would conflict with Fogerty 's direction that the award of fees should encourage copyright defendants to assert meritorious defenses.  See 510 U.S. at 527, 114 S.Ct. at 1029-30.   We are confident, however, that the court's casual observation regarding the costs of litigation was not material to its ultimate determination.  Rather, the court relied squarely on the parties' clear economic interests in pursuing the litigation, about which there is little to dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the need to encourage meritorious defenses, a copyright defendant's success on the merits in a case of first impression may militate in favor of a fee award, but we are unwilling to hold that a successful defense in an important case necessarily mandates an award of attorney's fees.  When close infringement cases are litigated, copyright law benefits from the resulting clarification of the doctrine's boundaries.  But because novel cases require a plaintiff to sue in the first place, the need to encourage meritorious defenses is a factor that a district court may balance against the potentially chilling effect of imposing a large fee award on a plaintiff, who, in a particular case, may have advanced a reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, claim.  Fogerty made clear that courts are to evaluate cases on an individualized basis, with the primary responsibility resting on the shoulders of the district judge.  Regardless of whether we would have approached the matter similarly, we are unable to say that the district court's analysis strikes us as an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland's final contentions--that the district court erred by ignoring Borland's \"vindication\" of its own copyrighted computer program and Lotus's unusual wealth--are unpersuasive.  As a basis for awarding fees, we see no meaningful distinction between Borland's vindication of its own copyrighted work and its assertion of a meritorious defense.  The latter necessarily implies the former.  In addition, the district court supportably found that both parties were financially able to litigate this important case.  Lotus's unusual wealth in no way alters this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to its argument for all its fees and costs, Borland claims that the district court erred by not awarding Borland fees and costs attributable to those portions of the case in which Lotus's conduct was objectively unreasonable.  Specifically, Borland claims it was objectively unreasonable for Lotus (1) to litigate the \"functional constraints\" issue, see Borland II, 799 F.Supp. at 221;  Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 207;  (2) to add the \"Key Reader\" claim in the midst of the case, see Borland IV, 831 F.Supp. at 230-31;  and (3) to prosecute a trial on damages during the pendency of Borland's successful appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Borland's motion for \"full costs\" covering the entire litigation, but did not explicitly rule on Borland's alternative request for \"partial\" fees and costs.  The issue of awarding partial fees was, however, argued at some length during the hearing on Borland's motion, which indicates that the district court considered Borland's arguments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Although the district court's silence is troubling, we think it implicit that his decision that no fees are warranted for the entirety of the case necessarily encompasses Borland's request for fees resulting from individual parts of the litigation.  In addition, there is no suggestion in the district court's opinion that it was under the legally erroneous impression that an award of partial fees was not allowable under section 505.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is close, particularly in the lack of analysis on Borland's partial fee request.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  If the district court had decided to award at least some fees, it is difficult to see how that decision would have been an abuse of discretion either.  But the decision to award fees is not a decision committed to the appellate court in the first instance.  We are thus limited to saying only that the district court did not abuse its discretion in its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

In 1987, Borland released spreadsheet programs Quattro and Quattro Pro, which competed with Lotus 1-2-3 and contained virtually identical copies of the 1-2-3 menu command hierarchy.  The inclusion of this so-called \"menu tree\" from Lotus 1-2-3 prompted the instant litigation in 1990, the substance of which is set forth in our prior opinion.  See Lotus Dev.  Corp. v.

Borland claimed that, as a result of Lotus's suit, it had incurred over $11 million in attorney's fees, $7.5 million in expert fees, and $1.6 million in other costs.

See 510 U.S. at 534, 114 S.Ct. at 1033.   Finding no basis for the disparate treatment of plaintiffs and defendants in the text of section 505, the Fogerty Court held that district courts should exercise their equitable discretion to award fees in an even-handed manner, and with the goal of vindicating the overriding purpose of the Copyright Act:  to encourage the production of original literary, artistic, and musical expression for the public good.  See id. at 524, 534, 114 S.Ct. at 1028, 1033.   Rather than formulate a specific standard for district courts to apply, the Court identified a list of nonexclusive factors that district courts may consider, such as \"frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and legal components of the case) and the need in some cases to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.\"  Id. at 534 n. 19, 114 S.Ct. at 1033 n. 19 (citing Lieb v.

[T]here was merit on both sides, and [the court of appeals was] dealing with an area that was ... moving copyright law into a relatively uncharted area that would benefit from further directions from Congress and in which both parties had an important economic interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that the claims made by Lotus were meritorious.

Finding that these factors did not militate in favor of an award, the court denied fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland mounts both legal and factual challenges to the district court's decision.  We turn first to Borland's claims of legal error.  Borland asserts that the court applied the Fogerty standard incorrectly because it placed two factors, the non-frivolous nature of the plaintiff's claims and their objective reasonableness, above all other considerations.  Borland contends that when corporate giants litigate important copyright questions of first impression, the resulting lack of frivolousness and objective unreasonableness will invariably preclude a prevailing defendant from obtaining attorney's fees.  This reasoning, Borland concludes, is no different from the \"dual standard\" rejected in Fogerty, and thus, under Fogerty and Edwards v. Red Farm Studio Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197267\"><a href=\"/opinion/197267/edwards-v-red-farm-studio-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997), the district court's analysis is legally erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we agree with Borland that defendants are no longer required as a matter of law to demonstrate culpable behavior on the plaintiff's part, see Fantasy v. Fogerty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725133\"><a href=\"/opinion/725133/fantasy-inc-cross-appellee-v-john-c-fogerty/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 558 (9th Cir.1996), we disagree with Borland's characterization of the district court's reasoning.  Had the district court taken such a hard line, Borland would have a strong argument.  In Edwards, we reversed the denial of attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant because the district court had required a showing of bad faith or frivolousness.  See 109 F.3d at 82.   The district court here, however, committed no such error.  Rather, it is evident that the court recognized that under Fogerty a showing of culpability is not a prerequisite for awarding fees:  after concluding that Lotus's claims were neither frivolous nor objectively unreasonable, the court went on to consider the remaining Lieb factors.  The district court merely reasoned, in part, that when a plaintiff prosecutes an action in good faith, in an unsettled area of law, and with a reasonable likelihood of success, against a party with similar financial resources, the prevailing party's case for attorney's fees is weaker, whether it be a plaintiff or a defendant.  This view has a long history in copyright law, see, e.g., McCulloch v. Albert E. Price, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491031\"><a href=\"/opinion/491031/carolyn-n-mcculloch-lucyann-w-cameron-elizabeth-p-smoot-the-original/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 322 (9th Cir.1987);  Official Aviation Guide Co. v. American Aviation Assocs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1548416\"><a href=\"/opinion/1548416/official-aviation-guide-co-v-american-av-asso/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, 542 (7th Cir.1947), and in no way conflicts with Fogerty 's command to treat prevailing plaintiffs and defendants even-handedly.  As a result, we see no basis for concluding that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland next contends that the district court committed legal error by relying on the Supreme Court's affirmance by an equally divided court to buttress its conclusion that Borland narrowly prevailed on the merits.  Borland argues that the inference made by the court, that four Justices of the Supreme Court were ready to reverse our opinion on the merits, is legally incorrect because there is no way to ascertain the position of the Justices on the merits of the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevance of this objection to our present analysis is not obvious to us.  At points, the court did refer to the split on the Supreme Court as some evidence that Lotus's claims had merit and thus were objectively reasonable.  To the extent that Borland challenges this finding, its challenge is unpersuasive.  The fact remains that Lotus filed this action only after prevailing on a virtually identical claim that was never appealed against a different software company.  See Lotus Dev.  Corp. v. Paperback Software Int'l, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></span> (D.Mass.1990) (Keeton, U.S.D.J.).  Although we ultimately held to the contrary, we cannot say that Lotus's initial decision to rely on Paperback was objectively unreasonable.  Regardless of the meaning of the Supreme Court's narrow affirmance, the district court's conclusion that Lotus's chief claim was objectively reasonable is certainly a permissible one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland also contends that the district court's application of the various Lieb factors was clearly erroneous.  See Lieb, 788 F.2d at 156.   The court found that neither party had an improper motivation in litigating the case, reasoning that both parties had important economic interests in the litigation and that there were \"no clear signs for judicial determination.\"   The court also held that the need to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence did not militate in favor of a fee award.  The court found no \"oppression by one party over the other in the ability to use their financial wherewithal to affect the litigation\" and concluded that when \"the parties are litigating a matter of some importance to the copyright laws, there is no need for deterrence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland now contends that the district court erred by ignoring Lotus's alleged anti-competitive purposes in bringing the litigation, relying impermissibly on Borland's refusal to settle the case, and discounting the importance of encouraging copyright defendants to assert meritorious defenses.  Borland notes that it advanced the interests of copyright law by litigating this case all the way through the Supreme Court against an unusually wealthy plaintiff.  It also contends that the \"vindication\" of its own copyright in Quattro Pro increased the availability of copyrighted works.  Borland concludes that \"if ever there were a situation where the assertion of meritorious defenses should be encouraged, it is a case involving issues of first impression.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these contentions provides a basis for overriding the denial of fees and costs.  Both sides proffered evidence on the issue of whether Lotus had intended to use this litigation to bankrupt Borland and thus maintain its dominant position in the spreadsheet market.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We cannot say, on the record before us, that the presence of an impermissible motive on Lotus's part is so clear that a contrary conclusion could not reasonably be reached.  After all, copyright law often delineates the boundaries of economic competition.  See, e.g., Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Service, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, 349, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>, 1289-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span> (1991) (holding that the plaintiff's telephone directory lacked originality and thus copyright law did not bar defendant from copying the information to create a competing product).  Arguably, there is nothing inherently improper about bringing a claim that is well-founded in law and fact against one's competitors, even when legal action, if successful, will inflict severe economic consequences upon them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the district court's consideration of the parties' settlement negotiations, the court did note in its discussion of the motivation factor that \"more careful evaluators of the expense of litigation might have chosen not to spend\" the money to litigate the case.  This statement does give us some concern.  Copyright defendants with strong legal or factual defenses should not be deterred from litigation by the possibility that their refusal to settle an invalid claim will be held against them after they prevail.  Such reasoning would conflict with Fogerty 's direction that the award of fees should encourage copyright defendants to assert meritorious defenses.  See 510 U.S. at 527, 114 S.Ct. at 1029-30.   We are confident, however, that the court's casual observation regarding the costs of litigation was not material to its ultimate determination.  Rather, the court relied squarely on the parties' clear economic interests in pursuing the litigation, about which there is little to dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the need to encourage meritorious defenses, a copyright defendant's success on the merits in a case of first impression may militate in favor of a fee award, but we are unwilling to hold that a successful defense in an important case necessarily mandates an award of attorney's fees.  When close infringement cases are litigated, copyright law benefits from the resulting clarification of the doctrine's boundaries.  But because novel cases require a plaintiff to sue in the first place, the need to encourage meritorious defenses is a factor that a district court may balance against the potentially chilling effect of imposing a large fee award on a plaintiff, who, in a particular case, may have advanced a reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, claim.  Fogerty made clear that courts are to evaluate cases on an individualized basis, with the primary responsibility resting on the shoulders of the district judge.  Regardless of whether we would have approached the matter similarly, we are unable to say that the district court's analysis strikes us as an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borland's final contentions--that the district court erred by ignoring Borland's \"vindication\" of its own copyrighted computer program and Lotus's unusual wealth--are unpersuasive.  As a basis for awarding fees, we see no meaningful distinction between Borland's vindication of its own copyrighted work and its assertion of a meritorious defense.  The latter necessarily implies the former.  In addition, the district court supportably found that both parties were financially able to litigate this important case.  Lotus's unusual wealth in no way alters this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to its argument for all its fees and costs, Borland claims that the district court erred by not awarding Borland fees and costs attributable to those portions of the case in which Lotus's conduct was objectively unreasonable.  Specifically, Borland claims it was objectively unreasonable for Lotus (1) to litigate the \"functional constraints\" issue, see Borland II, 799 F.Supp. at 221;  Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 207;  (2) to add the \"Key Reader\" claim in the midst of the case, see Borland IV, 831 F.Supp. at 230-31;  and (3) to prosecute a trial on damages during the pendency of Borland's successful appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Borland's motion for \"full costs\" covering the entire litigation, but did not explicitly rule on Borland's alternative request for \"partial\" fees and costs.  The issue of awarding partial fees was, however, argued at some length during the hearing on Borland's motion, which indicates that the district court considered Borland's arguments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Although the district court's silence is troubling, we think it implicit that his decision that no fees are warranted for the entirety of the case necessarily encompasses Borland's request for fees resulting from individual parts of the litigation.  In addition, there is no suggestion in the district court's opinion that it was under the legally erroneous impression that an award of partial fees was not allowable under section 505.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is close, particularly in the lack of analysis on Borland's partial fee request.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  If the district court had decided to award at least some fees, it is difficult to see how that decision would have been an abuse of discretion either.  But the decision to award fees is not a decision committed to the appellate court in the first instance.  We are thus limited to saying only that the district court did not abuse its discretion in its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
