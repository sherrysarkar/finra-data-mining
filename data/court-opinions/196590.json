Mark  Terison,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Joseph  Robert Glidden appeals the district\r                           \r\n\ncourt's dismissal of  his second motion filed pursuant  to 28\r\n\nU.S.C.   2255.  Glidden filed identical copies of this second\r\n\nmotion in each of his two underlying district court  criminal\r\n\ncases.  The district court entered a judgment of dismissal in\r\n\neach  case and  we have  consolidated Glidden's  appeals from\r\n\neach judgment.\r\n\n     We have reviewed the parties'  briefs and the record  on\r\n\nappeal.  We agree  with the district court's conclusion  that\r\n\nGlidden  has abused  the  writ, essentially  for the  reasons\r\n\nstated  in the magistrate-judge's  recommended decision dated\r\n\nDecember 15, 1994.  We,  therefore, affirm the district court\r                                                      \r\n\njudgments  that entered on January  30, 1995, in  each of the\r\n\ntwo  underlying district court  cases, dismissing appellant's\r\n\nsecond  motion, filed  pursuant to  28 U.S.C.    2255,  as an\r\n\nabuse of the writ.  We add only the following.\r\n\n1.   On appeal,  Glidden  seeks to  pursue  a claim  that  he\r\n\nreceived ineffective assistance  of appellate counsel  due to\r\n\nAttorney Joseph L. Ferris' abandonment of his direct criminal\r\n\nappeals  that were  dismissed  for want  of prosecution  when\r\n\ncounsel  failed to file a  brief.  United  States v. Glidden,\r                                                                        \r\n\nNos. 90-1611; 90-1612, (1st Cir. Sept. 27, 1991) (unpublished\r\n\norder of dismissal).  This claim was, at best, presented only\r\n\nin skeletal form in Glidden's  second   2255 motion.   In any\r\n\nevent,  in  his objections  to  the magistrate's  recommended\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndecision,  Glidden  did  not   raise  any  objection  to  the\r\n\nmagistrate's  failure to  address  this claim  and, thus,  is\r\n\nprecluded  from obtaining  appellate  review of  this  claim.\r\n\nKeating  v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 848 F.2d 271,\r                                                          \r\n\n275 (1st Cir. 1988) (per  curiam) (concluding that only those\r\n\nissues fairly  raised by  the objections to  the magistrate's\r\n\nreport  are subject to review in the district court and those\r\n\nnot preserved by such objection are precluded on appeal); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 151 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1994) (rejecting the contention that a litigant need not file\r\n\nan  objection to a magistrate's failure to address a claim to\r                                                   \r\n\npreserve appellate review).\r\n\n     Further,   even  assuming  the  claim  was  sufficiently\r\n\ndeveloped below  beyond skeletal form  in this second    2255\r\n\nmotion and then sufficiently  preserved for appeal, i.e., not\r\n\nwaived  by failing  to  raise it  in  his objections  to  the\r\n\nmagistrate's  recommendation,  it  is  not  a  miscarriage of\r\n\njustice to fail to consider this claim in this second    2255\r\n\nmotion  as   Glidden  had   both  sufficient  knowledge   and\r\n\nopportunity  to timely raise this  claim in his  first   2255\r\n\nmotion.  Glidden was  informed in April 1992 that,  if he was\r\n\nclaiming  that  he  had  not authorized  Attorney  Ferris  to\r\n\nabandon  his direct  criminal appeals,  he should  inform the\r\n\ndistrict  court of this contention  via a    2255 motion and,\r\n\nalthough  by  this  time  Glidden had  appointed  counsel  --\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nAttorney  O'Brian --  to represent  him on  his first    2255\r\n\nmotion  in the  district court,  Glidden  did not  raise this\r\n\nclaim of Attorney Ferris' alleged unauthorized abandonment of\r\n\nappeals among the two new claims submitted in September  1992\r\n\nto the  district court  as an amendment  to his first    2255\r\n\nmotion.\r\n\n2.   On appeal,  Glidden also  seeks to  raise for the  first\r\n\ntime new grounds to support a claim of ineffective assistance\r\n\nof  counsel  with  respect  to  Attorney  James  Horton,  who\r\n\nrepresented  Glidden  at  his  change  of  plea  and  at  his\r\n\nsentencing.   Having failed  to present these  grounds in the\r\n\ndistrict court,  Glidden is  precluded from raising  them for\r\n\nthe  first time on appeal.   Johnston v.  Holiday Inns, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1979).  No miscarriage of justice\r\n\nwill occur if we decline to address them.  Indeed, all appear\r\n\nmeritless.\r\n\n     The judgments of the district court are affirmed.\r                                                                  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
