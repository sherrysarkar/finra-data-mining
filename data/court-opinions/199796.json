Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Boudin, Chief Circuit Judge,\n\n              John R.

Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f                              January 29, 2002\n\n\n\n             JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge. Michael Dubovsky\n\nappeals from the sentence imposed after he pled guilty to one\n\ncount of conspiring to distribute Lysergic Acid Diethylamide\n\n(LSD).    See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846 (1994).              At sentencing,\n\nthe district court determined that Dubovsky was not eligible for\n\nthe \"safety valve\" provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) (1994 &\n\nSupp. V 1999) and U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 5C1.2\n\n(1998)1     because   an    earlier     adjudication   for     possession   of\n\nmarijuana, the records of which had been sealed, had not been\n\nexpunged for the purposes of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n§ 4A1.2(j) (1998).         United States v. Dubovsky, No. CRIM. 99-37-\n\nB,   2001    WL   274730      (D.N.H.     Jan.   24,   2001)    (unpublished\n\nmemorandum).      As a result he received the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence of ten years pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(v)\n\n(1994).      Dubovsky argues on appeal that the sealing of the\n\nrecords relating to his marijuana possession charge constituted\n\nan expungement and that therefore he should have been eligible\n\n\n\n     1\"When applicable, these provisions mandate both reduction\nof the defendant's offense level and judicial disregard of\nstatutes imposing mandatory minimum sentences.\" United States\nv. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 150 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                        -2-\n\ffor a sentence of between forty-six and fifty-seven months.        He\n\nasks that the sentence imposed be set aside and the safety valve\n\nconsidered.       We affirm the sentence imposed by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n                                      I.\n\n              In 1996, Dubovsky admitted in Massachusetts state court\n\nto sufficient facts to support a conviction on a charge of\n\n           possession of marijuana.    The judge continued the charge\n\nwithout a finding of guilt, on the condition that Dubovsky\n\nremain outside the state during the period of continuance.         In\n\n1998, the proceedings were dismissed pursuant to Massachusetts\n\nlaw.       See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 34 (1997).\n\n              In May of 2000, Dubovsky found himself in federal\n\ncourt, where he pled guilty to the unrelated drug conspiracy\n\ncharge at issue here.       Thereafter, Dubovsky filed a motion in\n\nMassachusetts state court to seal all records concerning the\n\nearlier possession of marijuana charge.       This motion was granted\n\non November 2, 2000.2      Dubovsky was sentenced in this case two\n\nmonths later.\n\n\n\n       2\n       \"Dubovsky failed to inform the sentencing judge of the\nfact that he had been charged with another drug possession\noffence in 1993 that had been continued without a finding. If\nthe state court judge had known of this fact, he could not have\ngranted Dubovsky's motion to seal.\" Dubovsky, 2001 WL 274730,\nat *2 n.2.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           The quantity of drugs involved in Dubovsky's conspiracy\n\noffense    (more   than   ten   grams)      mandates   a   minimum   ten-year\n\nsentence, unless the safety valve provision is applicable.                  See\n\n18   U.S.C.   §    3553(f);     21   U.S.C.    §   841(b)(1)(A)(v);      U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines Manual § 5C1.2 (1998).               The safety valve\n\nprovision is only applicable if the defendant has no more than\n\none criminal history point.           U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n§ 5C1.2 (1998).      Under the guidelines, criminal history points\n\nare assessed on the basis of prior sentences.               U.S. Sentencing\n\nGuidelines Manual § 4A1.1 (1998).             When a Massachusetts court\n\nenters a continuance without a finding in accordance with the\n\nprocedures set out in Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure\n\n12,3 that continuance is considered a prior sentence for the\n\npurposes of § 4A1.1.      United States v. Morillo, 178 F.3d 18 (1st\n\nCir. 1999). However, sentences for expunged convictions4 are not\n\ncounted.    U. S. Sentencing Guidelines § 4A1.2(j) (1998).\n\n           What    constitutes       expungement   for     the   purposes    of\n\ndetermining criminal history under the Guidelines is clarified\n\n\n     3Dubovsky acknowledges that the state court complied with\nall required procedures.\n     4The use of the term \"convictions\" in § 4A1.2(j) does not\nrender that section inapplicable here. See Morillo, 178 F.3d\nat 20-21 (treating admission of sufficient facts to support a\nconviction under Massachusetts law as a guilty plea); United\nStates v. Stowe, 989 F.2d 261, 263 (7th Cir. 1993) (applying §\n4A1.2(j) to guilty plea resulting in diversionary disposition).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fin an application note:\n\n            A number of jurisdictions have various procedures\n            pursuant to which previous convictions may be set\n            aside or the defendant may be pardoned for\n            reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law,\n            e.g., in order to restore civil rights to remove\n            the stigma associated with a criminal conviction.\n            Sentences resulting from such convictions are to\n            be counted.   However, expunged convictions are\n            not counted. § 4A1.2(j).\n\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4A1.2(j), cmt. n.10 (1998).\n\nSentencing guideline application notes are authoritative unless\n\nthey   violate   the   Constitution   or    a   federal   statute   or   are\n\ninconsistent with the guideline.          Stinson v. United States, 508\n\nU.S. 36, 38 (1993).       Thus, since excluding Dubovsky's prior\n\nadmission of marijuana possession, which we treat as a guilty\n\nplea, see Morillo, 178 F.3d at 21, from his criminal history\n\ncalculation would have made him eligible for the safety valve\n\nprovision (as the government concedes), the crucial issue for\n\nthe district court was whether Dubovsky's adjudication had been\n\nexpunged.\n\n            The district court received briefs from both parties\n\nconcerning the use of the sealed dispositions, heard extensive\n\noral argument from counsel, and finally concluded that the 1996\n\nadjudication     could   not   be   treated     as   expunged   under    the\n\nGuidelines.      Dubovsky, 2001 WL 274730, at *3.           The district\n\ncourt found that Dubovsky's marijuana charge was not dismissed,\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fand his case was not sealed, for reasons of innocence or errors\n\nof    law,   and   that   the   related      records    were     not     completely\n\ndestroyed.     Id. at *2.       Therefore, Dubovsky's admission could\n\nnot be considered expunged, he was not entitled to the safety\n\nvalve, and a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence was required.\n\nId.\n\n             We review the district court's application of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines de novo.                 United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nArimont, 268 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                       II.\n\n             Dubovsky's    case    can    be   seen    as   a    story    with   two\n\nchapters.     In Morillo, we addressed the issue constituting the\n\nfirst chapter of his story when we concluded that a continuance\n\nwithout a finding, entered as a result of an admission to facts\n\nsufficient to warrant a finding of guilt under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, is counted as a sentence for the purposes of calculating\n\ncriminal history points in sentencing.                178 F.3d at 21.        Now we\n\nmust resolve the issue raised by the second chapter: What effect\n\ndoes the dismissal of a charge continued without a finding under\n\nMassachusetts law, and the sealing of the records related to\n\nthat charge, have upon the calculation of criminal history\n\npoints?       We   conclude     that   the     language     of   the     sentencing\n\nguidelines and related application notes make abundantly clear\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthat Dubovsky's sentence has not been expunged for the purposes\n\nof    calculating    his   criminal    history    points,    and   that    this\n\nconclusion is in accord with Massachusetts law.\n\n           The      district   court        identified   \"three      distinct\n\napproaches\" in the circuit courts for determining whether a\n\ndismissed conviction should be treated as expunged.                Dubovsky,\n\n2001 WL 274730, at *1.         It cited the Tenth, Fifth, and D.C.\n\nCircuits as exemplifying the \"prevailing view,\" focusing on\n\nwhether \"the conviction was set aside because of innocence or\n\nerrors of law.\"       Id. (citing United States v. Hines, 133 F.3d\n\n1360 (10th Cir. 1998); United States v. Ashburn, 20 F.3d 1336\n\n(5th Cir. 1994); United States v. McDonald, 991 F.2d 866 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1993)).     It distinguished this view from that of the Second\n\nCircuit, which it described as focusing on whether \"all trace of\n\nthe    prior   adjudication\"    had    been    eliminated.     Id.    at    *2.\n\n(quoting United States v. Matthews, 205 F.3d 544, 548 (2d Cir.\n\n2000)).    Finally, it characterized the Ninth Circuit as taking\n\nthe position that \"a dismissed or vacated conviction should be\n\ndeemed to have been expunged even though the conviction was set\n\naside for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law and\n\nstate law does not eliminate all trace of the adjudication.\"\n\nId. (citing United States v. Hidalgo, 932 F.2d 805 (9th Cir.\n\n1991)).    The district court cited our decision in United States\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fv. Fosher, 124 F.3d 52 (1st Cir. 1997), for the proposition that\n\nwe had \"not taken a definitive position on the issue.\"             Id.\n\n              Dubovsky urges us to adopt a hybrid of the approaches\n\nattributed to the Second and Ninth Circuits above, such that we\n\ncould       conclude   that   expungement   exists   where    records    are\n\n\"constructively purged\" by the Massachusetts statute.             However,\n\nwe are persuaded that expungement within the meaning of the\n\nGuidelines's structure is best determined by considering whether\n\nthe conviction was set aside because of innocence or errors of\n\nlaw.       We are convinced that the explicit language of note ten to\n\nGuideline § 4A1.2(j) specifically so requires.5              See Gonzalez-\n\n\n       5\n       To the extent that a split exists among the circuits, we\nthus side with what the district court characterized as the\n\"prevailing view.\" There is an argument to be made, however,\nthat there is in fact no meaningful circuit split. For example,\nwhile the Tenth Circuit, in Hines, did state that \"[a]\nconviction is 'expunged' for Guideline purposes only if the\nbasis for the expungement under state law is related to\n'constitutional invalidity, innocence, or errors of law,'\" it\nalso looked to the fact that \"the Act does not permit the\nphysical destruction of records.\" 133 F.3d at 1364-65; see also\nAshburn, 20 F.3d at 1342-44 (analyzing whether statute in\nquestion \"eliminate[d] all evidence of the conviction\").\nSimilarly, while the Second Circuit, in Matthews, may have\nfocused on the fact that the \"statute does not eliminate all\ntrace of the prior adjudication,\" it described its analysis as\nthe same as the one in Hines. 205 F.3d at 546, 548; see also\nUnited States v. Reyes, 13 F.3d 638, 641 (2d Cir. 1994)\n(concluding that defendant's prior conviction could be included\nin calculating his criminal history where he did not argue \"that\nthe motion was granted because of innocence or legal error\").\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit has recently stated that in\n\"[a]pplying    the   commentary's   definition    of   'expunged\nconvictions,' we must decide whether the relief . . . is a more\n\n                                    -8-\n\fArimont, 268 F.3d at 15 (\"We held in [Fosher], that a set-aside\n\nunder   the   Federal   Youth     Corrections     Act    is   'for    reasons\n\nunrelated to innocence or errors of law' and therefore not\n\nexpungement.\") (quoting Fosher, 124 F.3d at 57 (quoting U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines Manual § 4A1.2(j), cmt. n.10 (1998))).\n\nApplying   that   approach   to   this    case,   we    conclude     that   the\n\ndistrict court correctly found that Dubovsky's marijuana charge\n\nwas not dismissed, nor were the related records sealed, on\n\naccount of innocence or legal errors.6         Under Massachusetts law,\n\nthere was no requirement that Dubovsky make a showing of either.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 34 (authorizing a court to\n\ndismiss proceedings and seal records of any first-time drug\n\noffender who has complied with conditions of continuance).\n\n           Dubovsky cites a portion of the Massachusetts statute\n\nwhich states that once sealed, a conviction \"shall not be deemed\n\na conviction for [any] purpose.\"          Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 34.\n\n\n\nlimited remedy, afforded 'for reasons unrelated to innocence or\nerrors of law.'\"   United States v. Hayden, 255 F.3d 768, 771\n(9th Cir. 2001) (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines § 4A1.2(j)\n(1998)).\n    6 Indeed, Dubovsky does not challenge the district court's\nfinding on this issue, and his failure to argue this point\nconstitutes a waiver.     Ortega Cabrera v. Municipality of\nBayamon, 562 F.2d 91, 102 n.10 (1st Cir. 1977). As we discuss,\nhis argument instead is that the sealing of his records by\noperation of Massachusetts law constitutes an expungement\nnonetheless.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fHe   argues    that    for   the    federal     courts    to    allow   the   prior\n\nadjudication here to count for the purposes of criminal history\n\nwould     be   contrary      to    the    intent   of     the      Massachusetts\n\nLegislature.      However, even if this argument is valid, 7 it is\n\nunavailing.     The intent of the state legislature is relevant to\n\nshow whether the sealing procedure is related to innocence or\n\nlegal errors.         See Hines, 133 F.3d at 1364 (\"A conviction is\n\n'expunged' for Guideline purposes only if the basis for the\n\nexpungement     under     state     law   is    related    to    'constitutional\n\ninvalidity, innocence, or errors of law.'                      We must therefore\n\n\n\n      7\n      The Massachusetts Legislature knows the difference between\n\"sealing\" and \"expunging,\" having used both terms in § 34 before\namending that statute to eliminate all reference to \"expunged\"\nrecords. The view that the Massachusetts Legislature's use of\nthe term \"seal\" conveys an intent to accomplish something less\nthan a total ban on future use of the record is borne out by the\nopinions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. See\nCommonwealth v. Vickey, 412 N.E.2d 877, 879 (Mass. 1980)\n(\"Despite considerable confusion in applying this terminology,\nthe Massachusetts Legislature made clear its knowledge of the\ndistinctions involved by changing the language of G.L. c. 94C,\ns 44 from 'expungement' to 'sealing.' . . . Sealed records []\nmay be made available to . . . 'any court.'\") (quoting G.L. c.\n276, s. 100A); Police Comm'r v. Mun. Court, 374 N.E.2d 272, 277\n(Mass. 1978) (\"[T]he distinction between expungement of a record\nand sealing of a record is important. . . . The latter term\nrefers to those steps taken to segregate certain records from\nthe generality of records and to ensure their confidentiality to\nthe extent specified in the controlling statute.\").        As we\nstated in Fosher, an intent to benefit an offender \"by providing\na second chance\" so that he or she can live \"without the stigma\nof a criminal conviction, . . . [is] not meant to allow a\nrecidivist to avoid increased penalties based on earlier\ncriminal convictions.\" 124 F.3d at 58.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fexamine the basis for the expungement of [the] conviction under\n\n[state] law.\") (quoting United States v. Cox, 83 F.3d 336, 339\n\n(10th     Cir.   1998));     Fosher,     124     F.3d   at        58   (examining\n\ncongressional intent). 8          But any collateral consequences of\n\nsealing under state law are irrelevant to the application of the\n\nfederal      Sentencing    Guidelines,      which   have     their       basis   in\n\ncongressional, not state policy.            See United States v. Gray, 177\n\nF.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[States] may not dictate how the\n\nfederal government will vindicate its own interests in punishing\n\nthose who commit federal crimes.\"); United States v. Daniels,\n\n929   F.2d    128,   129   (4th   Cir.   1991)   (\"Even      if    the   juvenile\n\nproceedings had been sealed pursuant to state law, that law\n\ncould not bar consideration of them by a federal court in\n\ndetermining a sentence, when federal law provides otherwise.\").\n\nHere, we agree with the district court that \"[t]he obvious\n\npurpose of this sealing provision is to give a defendant a fresh\n\nstart,\" Dubovsky, 2001 WL 274730, at *2, not to correct errors\n\nof law or vindicate innocence.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the sentence of\n\n      8As noted above, examining the basis of the asserted\nexpungement may also include determining whether the records\nwere destroyed.

Thus, since excluding Dubovsky's prior admission of marijuana possession, which we treat as a guilty plea, <i>see Morillo,</i> 178 F.3d at 21, from his criminal history calculation would have made him eligible for the safety valve provision (as the government concedes), the crucial issue for the district court was whether Dubovsky's adjudication had been expunged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court received briefs from both parties concerning the use of the sealed dispositions, heard extensive oral argument from counsel, and finally concluded that the 1996 adjudication could not be treated as expunged under the Guidelines. <i>Dubovsky,</i> 2001 WL 274730, at *3. The district court found that Dubovsky's marijuana charge was not dismissed, and his case was not sealed, for reasons of innocence or errors of law, and that the related records were not completely destroyed. <i>Id.</i> at *2. Therefore, Dubovsky's admission could not be considered expunged, he was not entitled to the safety valve, and a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence was required. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <i>United States v.

In <i>Morillo,</i> we addressed the issue constituting the first chapter of his story when we concluded that a continuance without a finding, entered as a result of an admission to facts sufficient to warrant a finding of guilt under Massachusetts law, is counted as a sentence for the purposes of calculating criminal history points in sentencing. 178 F.3d at 21. Now we must resolve the issue raised by the second chapter: What effect does the dismissal of a charge continued without a finding under Massachusetts law, and the sealing of the records related to that charge, have upon the calculation of criminal history points? We conclude that the language of the sentencing guidelines and related application notes make abundantly clear that Dubovsky's sentence has not been expunged for the purposes of calculating his criminal history points, and that this conclusion is in accord with Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court identified \"three distinct approaches\" in the circuit courts for determining whether a dismissed conviction should be treated as expunged. <i>Dubovsky,</i> 2001 WL 274730, at *1. It cited the Tenth, Fifth, and D.C. Circuits as exemplifying the \"prevailing view,\" focusing on whether \"the conviction was set aside because of innocence or errors of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Hines,</i> 133 F.3d 1360 (10th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Ashburn,</i> 20 F.3d 1336 (5th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. McDonald,</i> 991 F.2d 866 (D.C.Cir.1993)). It distinguished this view from that of the Second Circuit, which it described as focusing on whether \"all trace of the prior adjudication\" had been eliminated. <i>Id.</i> at *2. (quoting <i>United States v. Matthews,</i> 205 F.3d 544, 548 (2d Cir.2000)). Finally, it characterized the Ninth Circuit as taking the position that \"a dismissed or vacated conviction should be deemed to have been expunged even though the conviction was set aside for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law and state law does not eliminate all trace of the adjudication.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Hidalgo,</i> 932 F.2d 805 (9th Cir.1991)). The district court cited our decision in <i>United States v. Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d 52 (1st Cir.1997), for the proposition that we had \"not taken a definitive position on the issue.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dubovsky urges us to adopt a hybrid of the approaches attributed to the Second and Ninth Circuits above, such that we could conclude that expungement exists where records are \"constructively purged\" by the Massachusetts statute. However, we are persuaded that expungement within the meaning of the Guidelines's structure is best determined by considering whether the conviction was set aside because of innocence or errors of law. We are convinced that the explicit language of note ten to Guideline &#167; 4A1.2(j) specifically so requires.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See Gonzalez-Arimont,</i> 268 F.3d at 15 (\"We held in [<i>Fosher</i>], that a set-aside under the Federal Youth Corrections Act is `for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law' and therefore not expungement.\") (quoting <i>Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d at 57 (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &#167; 4A1.2(j), cmt. n.10 (1998))). Applying that approach to this case, we conclude that the district court correctly found that Dubovsky's marijuana charge was not dismissed, nor were the related records sealed, on account of innocence or legal errors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Under Massachusetts law, there was no requirement that Dubovsky make a showing of either. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 34 (authorizing a court to dismiss proceedings and seal records of any first-time drug offender who has complied with conditions of continuance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dubovsky cites a portion of the Massachusetts statute which states that once sealed, a conviction \"shall not be deemed a conviction for [any] purpose.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 34. He argues that for the federal courts to allow the prior adjudication here to count for the purposes of criminal history would be contrary to the intent of the Massachusetts Legislature. However, even if this argument is valid,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> it is unavailing. The intent of the state legislature is relevant to show whether the sealing procedure is related to innocence or legal errors. <i>See Hines,</i> 133 F.3d at 1364 (\"A conviction is `expunged' for Guideline purposes only if the basis for the expungement under state law is related to `constitutional invalidity, innocence, or errors of law.' We must therefore examine the basis for the expungement of [the] conviction under [state] law.\") (quoting <i>United States v. Cox,</i> 83 F.3d 336, 339 (10th Cir.1996)); <i>Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d at 58 (examining congressional intent).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> But any collateral consequences of sealing under state law are irrelevant to the application of the federal Sentencing Guidelines, which have their basis in congressional, not state policy. <i>See United States v. Gray,</i> 177 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[States] may not dictate how the federal government will vindicate its own interests in punishing those who commit federal crimes.\"); <i>United States v. Daniels,</i> 929 F.2d 128, 129 (4th Cir.1991) (\"Even if the juvenile proceedings had been sealed pursuant to state law, that law could not bar consideration of them by a federal court in determining a sentence, when federal law provides otherwise.\"). Here, we agree with the district court that \"[t]he obvious purpose of this sealing provision is to give a defendant a fresh start,\" <i>Dubovsky,</i> 2001 WL 274730, at *2, not to correct errors of law or vindicate innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the sentence of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

For example, while the Tenth Circuit, in<i>Hines,</i> did state that \"[a] conviction is `expunged' for Guideline purposes only if the basis for the expungement under state law is related to `constitutional invalidity, innocence, or errors of law,'\" it also looked to the fact that \"the Act does not permit the physical destruction of records.\" 133 F.3d at 1364-65; <i>see also Ashburn,</i> 20 F.3d at 1342-44 (analyzing whether statute in question \"eliminate[d] all evidence of the conviction\"). Similarly, while the Second Circuit, in <i>Matthews,</i> may have focused on the fact that the \"statute does not eliminate all trace of the prior adjudication,\" it described its analysis as the same as the one in <i>Hines.</i> 205 F.3d at 546, 548; <i>see also United States v. Reyes,</i> 13 F.3d 638, 641 (2d Cir.1994) (concluding that defendant's prior conviction could be included in calculating his criminal history where he did not argue \"that the motion was granted because of innocence or legal error\"). Finally, the Ninth Circuit has recently stated that in \"[a]pplying the commentary's definition of `expunged convictions,' we must decide whether the relief ... is a more limited remedy, afforded `for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law.'\" <i>United States v. Hayden,</i> 255 F.3d 768, 771 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 4A1.2(j) (1998)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Dubovsky does not challenge the district court's finding on this issue, and his failure to argue this point constitutes a waiver<i>Ortega Cabrera v. Municipality of Bayamon,</i> 562 F.2d 91, 102 n. 10 (1st Cir.1977). As we discuss, his argument instead is that the sealing of his records by operation of Massachusetts law constitutes an expungement nonetheless.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Massachusetts Legislature knows the difference between \"sealing\" and \"expunging,\" having used both terms in &#167; 34 before amending that statute to eliminate all reference to \"expunged\" records. The view that the Massachusetts Legislature's use of the term \"seal\" conveys an intent to accomplish something less than a total ban on future use of the record is borne out by the opinions of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts<i>See Commonwealth v. Vickey,</i> 381 Mass. 762, 412 N.E.2d 877, 879 (1980) (\"Despite considerable confusion in applying this terminology, the Massachusetts Legislature made clear its knowledge of the distinctions involved by changing the language of G.L. c. 94C, s 44 from `expungement' to `sealing.' ...

The latter term refers to those steps taken to segregate certain records from the generality of records and to ensure their confidentiality to the extent specified in the controlling statute.\"). As we stated in <i>Fosher,</i> an intent to benefit an offender \"by providing a second chance\" so that he or she can live \"without the stigma of a criminal conviction, ...

Now we must resolve the issue raised by the second chapter: What effect does the dismissal of a charge continued without a finding under Massachusetts law, and the sealing of the records related to that charge, have upon the calculation of criminal history points?

However, we are persuaded that expungement within the meaning of the Guidelines's structure is best determined by considering whether the conviction was set aside because of innocence or errors of law. We are convinced that the explicit language of note ten to Guideline &#167; 4A1.2(j) specifically so requires.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See Gonzalez-Arimont,</i> 268 F.3d at 15 (\"We held in [<i>Fosher</i>], that a set-aside under the Federal Youth Corrections Act is `for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law' and therefore not expungement.\") (quoting <i>Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d at 57 (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &#167; 4A1.2(j), cmt. n.10 (1998))). Applying that approach to this case, we conclude that the district court correctly found that Dubovsky's marijuana charge was not dismissed, nor were the related records sealed, on account of innocence or legal errors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Under Massachusetts law, there was no requirement that Dubovsky make a showing of either. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen.

Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 34. He argues that for the federal courts to allow the prior adjudication here to count for the purposes of criminal history would be contrary to the intent of the Massachusetts Legislature. However, even if this argument is valid,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> it is unavailing. The intent of the state legislature is relevant to show whether the sealing procedure is related to innocence or legal errors. <i>See Hines,</i> 133 F.3d at 1364 (\"A conviction is `expunged' for Guideline purposes only if the basis for the expungement under state law is related to `constitutional invalidity, innocence, or errors of law.' We must therefore examine the basis for the expungement of [the] conviction under [state] law.\") (quoting <i>United States v.

For example, while the Tenth Circuit, in<i>Hines,</i> did state that \"[a] conviction is `expunged' for Guideline purposes only if the basis for the expungement under state law is related to `constitutional invalidity, innocence, or errors of law,'\" it also looked to the fact that \"the Act does not permit the physical destruction of records.\" 133 F.3d at 1364-65; <i>see also Ashburn,</i> 20 F.3d at 1342-44 (analyzing whether statute in question \"eliminate[d] all evidence of the conviction\"). Similarly, while the Second Circuit, in <i>Matthews,</i> may have focused on the fact that the \"statute does not eliminate all trace of the prior adjudication,\" it described its analysis as the same as the one in <i>Hines.</i> 205 F.3d at 546, 548; <i>see also United States v.
