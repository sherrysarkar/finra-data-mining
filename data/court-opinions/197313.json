We  find there  was probable  cause,\r\n\nindependent of the cocaine seized, to arrest the defendant before\r\n\nthe search.  Consequently, we affirm the conviction.  \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n          The  defendant-appellant  David  P.  Bizier  became the\r\n\nfocus of a narcotics investigation after a confidential informant\r\n\ntold  Maine Drug  Enforcement Administration (MDEA)  Agent Joseph\r\n\nBradeen that Bizier was selling crack cocaine  from his apartment\r\n\nin Lewiston,  Maine.  MDEA Agents used the confidential informant\r\n\nto make two controlled  buys of crack cocaine from  the apartment\r\n\non  January  12, 1995  and January  19,  1995.   The confidential\r\n\ninformant received  a telephone call from  Bizier's girlfriend on\r\n\nJanuary 23, 1995 while Bradeen and other MDEA agents were meeting\r\n\nin the informant's apartment.   Bizier's girlfriend, who had been\r\n\nobserved facilitating entry to Bizier's apartment for one  of the\r\n\nearlier controlled buys,  told the informant,  who then told  the\r\n\nAgents, that Bizier  had gone  to Massachusetts in  his truck  to\r\n\npick  up some  cocaine and  would be  returning around  6:00 p.m.\r\n\nBradeen gave Maine  State Police personnel  a description of  the\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ntruck and  the timing of its return north; he also told the State\r\n\nPolice to stop the truck.\r\n\n          Bizier was spotted  that day heading north on the Maine\r\n\nTurnpike going slightly over  the speed limit and was  stopped by\r\n\nMaine State  Police Troopers Kevin Curran and Charles Granger, at\r\n\nabout  6:00 p.m.  The troopers, who  had been informed by a State\r\n\nPolice  dispatcher  that  there  were  narcotics  in  the  truck,\r\n\ntestified  it took Bizier an  unusually long period  to pull over\r\n\nafter being  directed to  do so  by the  flashing  lights of  the\r\n\npolice  vehicle.    Bizier  appeared glassy  eyed  with  pinpoint\r\n\npupils.  When he got out of  the car, he avoided eye contact  and\r\n\nswayed from side to side.  He and his passenger told the troopers\r\n\nconflicting stories about where they had been.   Bizier consented\r\n\nto a  search of the vehicle  and admitted that there  was a small\r\n\namount of marijuana in the ashtray of the vehicle.   A police dog\r\n\nbrought to the scene alerted to the presence of  narcotics in the\r\n\nfront seat.   Thirty minutes after the stop, Bizier and his truck\r\n\nwere transported from the breakdown lane to a nearby State Police\r\n\nfacility to  secure the  truck pending  application for  a search\r\n\nwarrant regarding the vehicle.  After speaking personally to MDEA\r\n\nAgent Bradeen and  receiving advice that there was probable cause\r\n\nto  arrest  Bizier  for  cocaine  distribution,  Trooper  Granger\r\n\nconducted a body search,  to which Bizier objected, during  which\r\n\ntwo bags of cocaine were found in Bizier's underwear.  Bizier was\r\n\nthen formally placed under arrest.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Bizier's motion  to suppress the cocaine  was denied by\r\n\nJudge  Hornby   acting  on  the  Report   and  Recommendation  of\r\n\nMagistrate  Judge Cohen.  Bizier  then entered a conditional plea\r\n\nof guilty to a one-count indictment for possession with intent to\r\n\ndistribute the cocaine seized,  received a 70-month sentence, and\r\n\nnow appeals the denial of the suppression order.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n          Considering  only  the  evidence available  before  the\r\n\nsearch,  it is  clear that information  known to  law enforcement\r\n\nauthorities  supported  the  arrest,  an  arrest  which  in  turn\r\n\nsupported the  body search of  Bizier.  The  information provided\r\n\ngrounds for two distinct species of arrest.\r\n\n          First, the traffic violation stop generated information\r\n\nwhich,  standing alone  and irrespective  of whether there  was a\r\n\nseparate law  enforcement objective, provided probable  cause for\r\n\nan  offense justifying a full custody arrest related to misuse of\r\n\nthe truck by Bizier.\r\n\n          Second, the past crack cocaine transactions between the\r\n\nconfidential informant and Bizier coupled  with the report by his\r\n\ngirlfriend of  a trip south to  obtain a new supply  of the drug,\r\n\ncorroborated  by his  return north  at about  the  time expected,\r\n\nprovided probable cause for a cocaine distribution arrest.\r\n\n          Before  turning  to   a  specific  discussion  of   the\r\n\napplication of search and seizure law  to these circumstances, we\r\n\nfirst state the general principles governing this area.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r\n\n          PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST - GENERAL PRINCIPLES\r                    PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST - GENERAL PRINCIPLES\r                                                                  \r\n\n          An officer may  conduct a warrantless arrest as long as\r\n\nthere  is  \"probable  cause  to  believe  that  the  suspect  has\r\n\ncommitted or is committing  a crime.\" United States v.

Id. at 1772; see also Maryland v. Wilson, 117\r                                                                      \r\n\nS.

The\r\n\ninformation   developed  in   connection   with  that   temporary\r\n\ninvestigative stop may in turn provide grounds for a full custody\r\n\narrest.   In  Whren, a  police officer  observed defendants  in a\r                             \r\n\ntruck  which  the  officer  had probable  cause  to  believe  had\r\n\nviolated certain  traffic regulations.

In this  connection, Bizier\r\n\ncontends that probable  cause for an  arrest supporting a  search\r\n\nincident thereto can exist only for the actual offense ultimately\r\n\ncharged.  He argues that because he was, in the end, charged with\r\n\na  cocaine offense relating to the drugs found during the search,\r\n\nthere  was  no  preexisting   probable  cause  and  therefore  no\r\n\njustification for that arrest.  \r\n\n          As a legal proposition,  the argument is without merit.\r\n\nThe  probable cause  justifying  a lawful  custodial arrest,  and\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ntherefore  a search incident to that arrest,  need not be for the\r\n\ncharge eventually prosecuted.   See e.g., Barna v. City  of Perth\r                                                                           \r\n\nAmboy, 42 F.3d 809, 819 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"Probable cause need only\r               \r\n\nexist  as  to  any  offense  that  could  be  charged  under  the\r                                                      \r\n\ncircumstances\") (emphasis added); Barry  v.

Consequently, a finding of probable\r\n\ncause  for any  offense justifying  full custodial  detention can\r\n\nvalidate the search in this case as incident to a lawful arrest. \r\n\n          We need not  pause to consider  the question whether  a\r\n\nstop for speeding, an offense  which does not ordinarily  involve\r\n\nanything  beyond a  fine,1  would support  a  body search.    Cf.\r                                                                          \r\n\nRobinson,  414  U.S. at  236  n.6.

Me.  Rev. Stat.\r\nAnn. tit. 29-A,  2074(5) (West 1996).  Bizier was not  going more\r\nthan ten  miles per hour  above the posted  speed limit and  thus\r\nwould be subject simply to a fine for the speeding violation.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nThe information learned by the troopers here quickly escalated to\r\n\nprobable  cause for a full custody arrest.  These developments at\r\n\nthe roadside after  the initial traffic stop, which were entirely\r\n\nseparate from the cocaine  discovery, provided probable cause for\r\n\na full custody arrest  for a serious traffic violation--operating\r\n\nthe  truck under  the influence  of a  drug.   Both  troopers who\r\n\nexecuted  the stop testified  at the suppression  hearing that it\r\n\ntook longer  than usual for Bizier to  pull over to the roadside.\r\n\nWhen  Trooper Curran  approached Bizier,  he noted  that Bizier's\r\n\neyes  were  glassy,  his  eyelids were  heavy,  his  pupils  were\r\n\npinpoints and he was  swaying.  Bizier  and the passenger in  the\r\n\ntruck  told the  troopers  inconsistent stories.   These  factors\r\n\ntogether created probable cause for a driving under the influence\r\n\narrest2 following the otherwise justifiable traffic stop.\r\n\n          When the police  dog called  to the  scene arrived,  it\r\n\nalerted to the presence of narcotics on seat covers  on the front\r\n\nseat, the front edge of the front seat and in the gearshift area,\r\n\nas well  as a box  which had  been next  to the front  seat.   In\r\n\naddition, Bizier admitted to Trooper Curran that he had marijuana\r\n\nremains in his truck.   This admission regarding the  presence of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   An operating under the influence violation is punishable with\r\nincarceration in Maine.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29-A,  2411(5).\r\nIndeed, Maine law independently  authorizes a warrantless  arrest\r\nwhen a law enforcement officer has probable cause and \"the arrest\r\noccurs  within  a  period  reasonably  likely  to  result in  the\r\nobtaining of  probative evidence  of . .  . drug  concentration.\"\r\nId. at 2411(4).\r             \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ncontraband corroborated other evidence supporting  probable cause\r\n\nfor driving under the influence.\r\n\n          Moreover, as  we held  in United  States v. Staula,  80\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 596, 603 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S.

See Watson,  423 U.S. at 415-424.   When Trooper\r                                     \r\n\nCurran  pulled over  Bizier  on  the  Maine Turnpike,  there  was\r\n\nprobable  cause, collectively  known  to the  involved Maine  law\r\n\nenforcement personnel based on the two controlled buys of cocaine\r\n\nfrom  Bizier,  to  arrest   Bizier  for  cocaine  possession  and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Bizier  contends that  because possession  of marijuana  is a\r\ncivil infraction  in Maine, the possession itself did not provide\r\nindependent grounds for  arrest.  Possession of  marijuana in any\r\nquantity,  however,  is  also a  crime  under  federal law  which\r\nindependently  supports  an  arrest.    See  21  U.S.C.      844.\r                                                     \r\nFurthermore, the presence of the marijuana in the truck fortified\r\nthe probable cause for a driving under the influence arrest.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ndistribution.   Bizier himself concedes  that at the  time of the\r\n\nstop, \"[t]here did exist probable cause that Bizier had committed\r\n\nprior drug transactions,\"  Appellant's Brief at 5, but then notes\r\n\nthat  no arrest  was made  based on  those transactions.   As  we\r\n\nobserved  above, probable cause need only exist as to any offense\r\n\nthat  could be  charged  under the  circumstance.   Thus,  it  is\r\n\nimmaterial  that the  arrest grounds  differed from  the ultimate\r\n\ncharging  decision.  It is uncontested that probable cause for an\r\n\narrest  did exist  based  on those  two  controlled buys  in  the\r\n\nprevious  two weeks.    Thus, the  search  of Bizier  immediately\r\n\nbefore  his formal arrest could be justified as a search incident\r\n\nto arrest based on  the controlled buys alone.  See Rawlings, 448\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 111.\r\n\n          Bizier, in  oral argument,  challenged the  validity of\r\n\nthe two controlled buys  as a basis for probable  cause, claiming\r\n\nthat they were \"stale.\"   While a long delay in seeking  a search\r                                                                           \r\n\nwarrant can create difficulties if  the information is stale, See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWatson, 423 U.S. at 450 n.14 (Marshall, J., dissenting), probable\r                \r\n\ncause  to arrest,  \"once formed  will continue  to exist  for the\r                          \r\n\nindefinite future,  at least if no  intervening exculpatory facts\r\n\ncome to light.\"  Id. at 449 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (citations\r                             \r\n\nomitted).    As  Justice  Powell  observed  in  his  concurrence,\r\n\nprobable  cause to support an arrest normally does not grow stale\r\n\nbecause  \"once there is probable cause to believe that someone is\r\n\na  felon  the passage  of time  often  will bring  new supporting\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nevidence\";  such  probable cause  would  grow  stale only  if  it\r\n\nemerges  that it was based on since discredited information.  Id.\r                                                                          \r\n\nat 432 n.5.   Here,  rather than the  development of  intervening\r\n\ninformation  that  weakened  the  probable  cause  based  on  the\r\n\ncontrolled buys,  information emerged that  actually strengthened\r\n\nthe basis for arrest on cocaine distribution charges.    \r\n\n          In any event, the period of time between the controlled\r\n\nbuys  and the  arrest  was not  so  long here  as  to render  the\r\n\nprobable  cause  stale in  any  meaningful temporal  sense.   The\r\n\narrest occurred  just four days  after the second  controlled buy\r\n\nand less than two weeks after  the first controlled buy at a time\r\n\nwhen there was  probable cause to  believe additional drugs  were\r\n\nbeing transported in a moving vehicle.\r\n\n          We can find no suggestion the police acted in bad faith\r\n\nby seeking unfairly to rely upon probable cause from an abandoned\r\n\nprior  arrest  opportunity  in   order  to  effect  an  otherwise\r\n\ninsupportable  current arrest  and thereby  exploit the  right of\r\n\nsearch incident to arrest.   In this connection, we  note Justice\r\n\nPowell's  observation that \"[g]ood police practice often requires\r\n\npostponing  an  arrest,  even   after  probable  cause  has  been\r\n\nestablished, in order  to place the suspect under surveillance or\r\n\notherwise develop further evidence necessary to prove  guilt to a\r\n\njury.\"    Id. at  431.   The  law enforcement  response  here was\r                       \r\n\nmeasured  and restrained as  the MDEA agents on  the one hand and\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nthe  troopers  on  the  other  pursued  legitimate  investigative\r\n\ntechniques to develop an appropriate case regarding Bizier.  \r\n\n          In the end,  there was probable cause before the search\r\n\nfor  arrest on the charge of possession with intent to distribute\r\n\nthe  cocaine  for  which Bizier  was  convicted.    The MDEA  had\r\n\nreceived information from the confidential informant that Bizier,\r\n\non the  day of the stop,  was travelling to Massachusetts  in his\r\n\ntruck  to  purchase  cocaine and  carry  it  back  to Maine  that\r\n\nevening.  The  MDEA agents were  in the confidential  informant's\r\n\nhome when the informant received  a call from Bizier's girlfriend\r\n\ntelling the  informant that Bizier  would be  returning that  day\r\n\nfrom his trip to  Massachusetts around 6:00 p.m.  The MDEA agents\r\n\nprovided a complete description of the truck, including its plate\r\n\nnumbers to the Maine troopers.  When the troopers stopped Bizier,\r\n\nhe was travelling in the truck  the MDEA agents had identified at\r\n\naround  the time which the confidential informant told the agents\r\n\nhe  would be returning to Maine.  This information in conjunction\r\n\nwith the two controlled buys, all of which was developed within a\r\n\nspan  of less than two weeks, supported the existence of probable\r\n\ncause  for   a  cocaine  trafficking  offense   arrest  that  day\r\n\nindependent of the discovery of the cocaine on Bizier's body.  As\r\n\nsuch, the search itself  was proper as  one incident to a  lawful\r\n\narrest for  such an offense  under traditional exceptions  to the\r\n\nwarrant requirement of the  Fourth Amendment.  See  Robinson, 414\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 224.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n          Under settled Fourth Amendment  principles specifically\r\n\napplicable here,  there was  sufficient probable cause  to arrest\r\n\nBizier provided both by evidence flowing from the traffic stop on\r\n\nJanuary 23 and  by evidence  flowing from the  course of  cocaine\r\n\ndealing   arrangements  between   Bizier  and   the  confidential\r\n\ninformant o justify  the body  search of Bizier  incident to  his\r\n\nlawful arrest.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n",

Bizier's girlfriend, who had been\r\n\nobserved facilitating entry to Bizier's apartment for one  of the\r\n\nearlier controlled buys,  told the informant,  who then told  the\r\n\nAgents, that Bizier  had gone  to Massachusetts in  his truck  to\r\n\npick  up some  cocaine and  would be  returning around  6:00 p.m.\r\n\nBradeen gave Maine  State Police personnel  a description of  the\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ntruck and  the timing of its return north; he also told the State\r\n\nPolice to stop the truck.\r\n\n          Bizier was spotted  that day heading north on the Maine\r\n\nTurnpike going slightly over  the speed limit and was  stopped by\r\n\nMaine State  Police Troopers Kevin Curran and Charles Granger, at\r\n\nabout  6:00 p.m.  The troopers, who  had been informed by a State\r\n\nPolice  dispatcher  that  there  were  narcotics  in  the  truck,\r\n\ntestified  it took Bizier an  unusually long period  to pull over\r\n\nafter being  directed to  do so  by the  flashing  lights of  the\r\n\npolice  vehicle.    Bizier  appeared glassy  eyed  with  pinpoint\r\n\npupils.  When he got out of  the car, he avoided eye contact  and\r\n\nswayed from side to side.  He and his passenger told the troopers\r\n\nconflicting stories about where they had been.   Bizier consented\r\n\nto a  search of the vehicle  and admitted that there  was a small\r\n\namount of marijuana in the ashtray of the vehicle.   A police dog\r\n\nbrought to the scene alerted to the presence of  narcotics in the\r\n\nfront seat.   Thirty minutes after the stop, Bizier and his truck\r\n\nwere transported from the breakdown lane to a nearby State Police\r\n\nfacility to  secure the  truck pending  application for  a search\r\n\nwarrant regarding the vehicle.  After speaking personally to MDEA\r\n\nAgent Bradeen and  receiving advice that there was probable cause\r\n\nto  arrest  Bizier  for  cocaine  distribution,  Trooper  Granger\r\n\nconducted a body search,  to which Bizier objected, during  which\r\n\ntwo bags of cocaine were found in Bizier's underwear.  Bizier was\r\n\nthen formally placed under arrest.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Bizier's motion  to suppress the cocaine  was denied by\r\n\nJudge  Hornby   acting  on  the  Report   and  Recommendation  of\r\n\nMagistrate  Judge Cohen.  Bizier  then entered a conditional plea\r\n\nof guilty to a one-count indictment for possession with intent to\r\n\ndistribute the cocaine seized,  received a 70-month sentence, and\r\n\nnow appeals the denial of the suppression order.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n          Considering  only  the  evidence available  before  the\r\n\nsearch,  it is  clear that information  known to  law enforcement\r\n\nauthorities  supported  the  arrest,  an  arrest  which  in  turn\r\n\nsupported the  body search of  Bizier.  The  information provided\r\n\ngrounds for two distinct species of arrest.\r\n\n          First, the traffic violation stop generated information\r\n\nwhich,  standing alone  and irrespective  of whether there  was a\r\n\nseparate law  enforcement objective, provided probable  cause for\r\n\nan  offense justifying a full custody arrest related to misuse of\r\n\nthe truck by Bizier.\r\n\n          Second, the past crack cocaine transactions between the\r\n\nconfidential informant and Bizier coupled  with the report by his\r\n\ngirlfriend of  a trip south to  obtain a new supply  of the drug,\r\n\ncorroborated  by his  return north  at about  the  time expected,\r\n\nprovided probable cause for a cocaine distribution arrest.\r\n\n          Before  turning  to   a  specific  discussion  of   the\r\n\napplication of search and seizure law  to these circumstances, we\r\n\nfirst state the general principles governing this area.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r\n\n          PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST - GENERAL PRINCIPLES\r                    PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST - GENERAL PRINCIPLES\r                                                                  \r\n\n          An officer may  conduct a warrantless arrest as long as\r\n\nthere  is  \"probable  cause  to  believe  that  the  suspect  has\r\n\ncommitted or is committing  a crime.\" United States v.

Me.  Rev. Stat.\r\nAnn. tit. 29-A,  2074(5) (West 1996).  Bizier was not  going more\r\nthan ten  miles per hour  above the posted  speed limit and  thus\r\nwould be subject simply to a fine for the speeding violation.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nThe information learned by the troopers here quickly escalated to\r\n\nprobable  cause for a full custody arrest.  These developments at\r\n\nthe roadside after  the initial traffic stop, which were entirely\r\n\nseparate from the cocaine  discovery, provided probable cause for\r\n\na full custody arrest  for a serious traffic violation--operating\r\n\nthe  truck under  the influence  of a  drug.   Both  troopers who\r\n\nexecuted  the stop testified  at the suppression  hearing that it\r\n\ntook longer  than usual for Bizier to  pull over to the roadside.\r\n\nWhen  Trooper Curran  approached Bizier,  he noted  that Bizier's\r\n\neyes  were  glassy,  his  eyelids were  heavy,  his  pupils  were\r\n\npinpoints and he was  swaying.  Bizier  and the passenger in  the\r\n\ntruck  told the  troopers  inconsistent stories.   These  factors\r\n\ntogether created probable cause for a driving under the influence\r\n\narrest2 following the otherwise justifiable traffic stop.\r\n\n          When the police  dog called  to the  scene arrived,  it\r\n\nalerted to the presence of narcotics on seat covers  on the front\r\n\nseat, the front edge of the front seat and in the gearshift area,\r\n\nas well  as a box  which had  been next  to the front  seat.   In\r\n\naddition, Bizier admitted to Trooper Curran that he had marijuana\r\n\nremains in his truck.

Search Flowing From Cocaine Dealing Arrangements\r                                                                     \r\n\n          A law enforcement officer  may make an arrest  if there\r\n\nis  probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed some\r                                                                      \r\n\nfelony offense.  See Watson,  423 U.S. at 415-424.   When Trooper\r                                     \r\n\nCurran  pulled over  Bizier  on  the  Maine Turnpike,  there  was\r\n\nprobable  cause, collectively  known  to the  involved Maine  law\r\n\nenforcement personnel based on the two controlled buys of cocaine\r\n\nfrom  Bizier,  to  arrest   Bizier  for  cocaine  possession  and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Bizier  contends that  because possession  of marijuana  is a\r\ncivil infraction  in Maine, the possession itself did not provide\r\nindependent grounds for  arrest.  Possession of  marijuana in any\r\nquantity,  however,  is  also a  crime  under  federal law  which\r\nindependently  supports  an  arrest.    See  21  U.S.C.      844.\r                                                     \r\nFurthermore, the presence of the marijuana in the truck fortified\r\nthe probable cause for a driving under the influence arrest.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ndistribution.   Bizier himself concedes  that at the  time of the\r\n\nstop, \"[t]here did exist probable cause that Bizier had committed\r\n\nprior drug transactions,\"  Appellant's Brief at 5, but then notes\r\n\nthat  no arrest  was made  based on  those transactions.   As  we\r\n\nobserved  above, probable cause need only exist as to any offense\r\n\nthat  could be  charged  under the  circumstance.   Thus,  it  is\r\n\nimmaterial  that the  arrest grounds  differed from  the ultimate\r\n\ncharging  decision.  It is uncontested that probable cause for an\r\n\narrest  did exist  based  on those  two  controlled buys  in  the\r\n\nprevious  two weeks.    Thus, the  search  of Bizier  immediately\r\n\nbefore  his formal arrest could be justified as a search incident\r\n\nto arrest based on  the controlled buys alone.  See Rawlings, 448\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 111.\r\n\n          Bizier, in  oral argument,  challenged the  validity of\r\n\nthe two controlled buys  as a basis for probable  cause, claiming\r\n\nthat they were \"stale.\"   While a long delay in seeking  a search\r                                                                           \r\n\nwarrant can create difficulties if  the information is stale, See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWatson, 423 U.S. at 450 n.14 (Marshall, J., dissenting), probable\r                \r\n\ncause  to arrest,  \"once formed  will continue  to exist  for the\r                          \r\n\nindefinite future,  at least if no  intervening exculpatory facts\r\n\ncome to light.\"  Id. at 449 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (citations\r                             \r\n\nomitted).    As  Justice  Powell  observed  in  his  concurrence,\r\n\nprobable  cause to support an arrest normally does not grow stale\r\n\nbecause  \"once there is probable cause to believe that someone is\r\n\na  felon  the passage  of time  often  will bring  new supporting\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nevidence\";  such  probable cause  would  grow  stale only  if  it\r\n\nemerges  that it was based on since discredited information.  Id.\r                                                                          \r\n\nat 432 n.5.   Here,  rather than the  development of  intervening\r\n\ninformation  that  weakened  the  probable  cause  based  on  the\r\n\ncontrolled buys,  information emerged that  actually strengthened\r\n\nthe basis for arrest on cocaine distribution charges.    \r\n\n          In any event, the period of time between the controlled\r\n\nbuys  and the  arrest  was not  so  long here  as  to render  the\r\n\nprobable  cause  stale in  any  meaningful temporal  sense.   The\r\n\narrest occurred  just four days  after the second  controlled buy\r\n\nand less than two weeks after  the first controlled buy at a time\r\n\nwhen there was  probable cause to  believe additional drugs  were\r\n\nbeing transported in a moving vehicle.\r\n\n          We can find no suggestion the police acted in bad faith\r\n\nby seeking unfairly to rely upon probable cause from an abandoned\r\n\nprior  arrest  opportunity  in   order  to  effect  an  otherwise\r\n\ninsupportable  current arrest  and thereby  exploit the  right of\r\n\nsearch incident to arrest.   In this connection, we  note Justice\r\n\nPowell's  observation that \"[g]ood police practice often requires\r\n\npostponing  an  arrest,  even   after  probable  cause  has  been\r\n\nestablished, in order  to place the suspect under surveillance or\r\n\notherwise develop further evidence necessary to prove  guilt to a\r\n\njury.\"    Id. at  431.   The  law enforcement  response  here was\r                       \r\n\nmeasured  and restrained as  the MDEA agents on  the one hand and\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nthe  troopers  on  the  other  pursued  legitimate  investigative\r\n\ntechniques to develop an appropriate case regarding Bizier.  \r\n\n          In the end,  there was probable cause before the search\r\n\nfor  arrest on the charge of possession with intent to distribute\r\n\nthe  cocaine  for  which Bizier  was  convicted.    The MDEA  had\r\n\nreceived information from the confidential informant that Bizier,\r\n\non the  day of the stop,  was travelling to Massachusetts  in his\r\n\ntruck  to  purchase  cocaine and  carry  it  back  to Maine  that\r\n\nevening.  The  MDEA agents were  in the confidential  informant's\r\n\nhome when the informant received  a call from Bizier's girlfriend\r\n\ntelling the  informant that Bizier  would be  returning that  day\r\n\nfrom his trip to  Massachusetts around 6:00 p.m.  The MDEA agents\r\n\nprovided a complete description of the truck, including its plate\r\n\nnumbers to the Maine troopers.  When the troopers stopped Bizier,\r\n\nhe was travelling in the truck  the MDEA agents had identified at\r\n\naround  the time which the confidential informant told the agents\r\n\nhe  would be returning to Maine.  This information in conjunction\r\n\nwith the two controlled buys, all of which was developed within a\r\n\nspan  of less than two weeks, supported the existence of probable\r\n\ncause  for   a  cocaine  trafficking  offense   arrest  that  day\r\n\nindependent of the discovery of the cocaine on Bizier's body.  As\r\n\nsuch, the search itself  was proper as  one incident to a  lawful\r\n\narrest for  such an offense  under traditional exceptions  to the\r\n\nwarrant requirement of the  Fourth Amendment.  See  Robinson, 414\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 224.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n          Under settled Fourth Amendment  principles specifically\r\n\napplicable here,  there was  sufficient probable cause  to arrest\r\n\nBizier provided both by evidence flowing from the traffic stop on\r\n\nJanuary 23 and  by evidence  flowing from the  course of  cocaine\r\n\ndealing   arrangements  between   Bizier  and   the  confidential\r\n\ninformant o justify  the body  search of Bizier  incident to  his\r\n\nlawful arrest.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n</pre>",
