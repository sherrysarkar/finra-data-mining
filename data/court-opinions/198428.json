Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Gordon C. Reid on brief pro se.\r\n   Robert G. Whaland and McDonough &amp; O'Shaughnessy, P.A. on brief\r\nfor appellees.\r\n\nApril 15, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  This case returns to us following our remand\r\nin Reid v. New Hampshire, 56 F.3d 332 (1st Cir. 1995) (Reid I). \r\nPlaintiff Gordon C. Reid, appearing pro se, appeals from an order\r\nthat granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on a\r\ncompendium of claims under both federal and state law.  Having\r\nthoroughly reviewed the record and the parties' briefs, we affirm\r\nthe district court's well-considered opinion in all respects but\r\none.\r\nWe first discuss all of Reid's claims, save for his\r\nBrady-based claim that the defendant Simmons failed to disclose two\r\nexculpatory police reports to state prosecutors.  On this group of\r\nclaims, brevis disposition was appropriate.  We need not linger,\r\nfor the district court's opinion touches the relevant bases.  We\r\ntherefore affirm for substantially the reasons set forth by Judge\r\nMcAuliffe, adding only a brief comment.\r\nThe proof of probable cause is not diluted past the point\r\nof no recall either by the evidence of Misty's past sexual abuse\r\nand emotional problems, or by the fact that her mother had been\r\ninvestigated for child abuse.  In turn, the sufficiency of the\r\nprobable cause evidence defeats Reid's false arrest, malicious\r\nprosecution, and negligence claims.  Moreover, since Reid failed to\r\nadduce any evidence of a conspiracy, summary judgment with respect\r\nto that claim also was proper.  Hence, we affirm the entry of\r\nsummary judgment in all these respects.\r\nWe are left with the Brady-based claim, which has force\r\nonly as to defendant Simmons.  On that claim, we vacate the summary\r\njudgment and reinstate the claim for further proceedings in the\r\ndistrict court, aimed at ascertaining whether Simmons failed to\r\ndisclose to the prosecutors who tried the underlying criminal case\r\nagainst Reid the two exculpatory reports, dated December 20, 1985\r\nand April 4, 1986, respectively, that he (Simmons) had authored in\r\nthe course of police investigation.\r\nWe reach this result because the district court resolved\r\nthis claim by finding it \"undisputed\" that Simmons \"openly\r\ndiscussed\" these reports at Reid's probable cause hearing.  The\r\nrecord refutes this finding.  Indeed, the fact of such disclosure,\r\nas well as its nature and extent (if any), were hotly disputed. \r\nThis dispute is amply evidenced by the affidavit that Reid filed in\r\nopposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment (original\r\npaper #251, Affidavit (2) of Gordon Reid, 10-12) and by paragraph\r\n10 of an earlier affidavit that Reid filed in response to the\r\ndefendants' initial motion for summary judgment (incorporated by\r\nreference in Reid's opposition to the later dispositive motion),\r\nsee Reid I, 56 F.3d at 340 n.17 (describing earlier affidavit). \r\nThus, summary judgment was insupportable on the district court's\r\nstated rationale.\r\nTo be sure, Simmons made several other arguments in\r\nsearch of summary judgment on this claim.  We have canvassed these\r\narguments, see Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir. 1996)\r\n(explaining that the court of appeals may affirm the entry of\r\nsummary judgment on any alternative ground made manifest in the\r\nrecord), and find no readily ascertainable basis for affirming the\r\ndistrict court's order on an independent ground.  Simmons' most\r\ntouted alternate argument is that the trial judge's order vacating\r\nReid's conviction collaterally estopped Reid from disputing the\r\nfact that Simmons disclosed the reports to the prosecutors during\r\nReid's probable cause hearing.  This asseveration is unpersuasive. \r\nThe trial judge's order, examined (as it must be) in light of the\r\npleadings that led to it, see Caouette v. Town of New Ipswich, 484\r\nA.2d 1106, 1113 (N.H. 1984), plainly reveals that several\r\nprerequisites for application of collateral estoppel are lacking\r\n(e.g., there is no identity of issues, and, in all events, the\r\ncritical issue   whether Simmons' previous testimony sufficed to\r\ndisclose the exculpatory reports to the prosecutors   does not\r\nappear to have been fully and fairly litigated in the earlier\r\nhearing on Reid's motion to vacate his conviction).  Perhaps most\r\nimportantly, a prosecutor has a duty to disclose material\r\nexculpatory evidence known to police acting in concert with the\r\nprosecutor whether or not the prosecutor, himself, succeeds in\r\nlearning of the evidence.  See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437-\r\n38 (1995); United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir.\r\n1997); Carriger v. Stewart, 132 F.3d 463, 479-80 (9th Cir. 1997),\r\ncert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1827 (1998); Smith v. Secretary of Dep't\r\nof Correction, 50 F.3d 801, 824 (10th Cir. 1995).  Consequently, a\r\nfinding that Simmons disclosed the exculpatory reports to the\r\nprosecutors was not a necessary prerequisite to the judgment\r\nvacating Reid's conviction.  Therefore, an essential element for\r\nthe application of collateral estoppel is missing.\r\nWe need go no further.  Simmons' other arguments are even\r\nless convincing, and none requires comment at this stage of the\r\ncase.  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment for defendant Simmons on\r\nReid's claim that he failed to disclose the exculpatory police\r\nreports to the prosecutors, in derogation of Reid's right to due\r\nprocess, and remand for further proceedings in the district court. \r\nWe affirm the judgment for Simmons in all other respects, and we\r\naffirm the judgment for all other defendants in all respects.  All\r\nparties will bear their own costs.\r\n\nSo Ordered.\n",
