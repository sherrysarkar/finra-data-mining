We affirm.\r\n\n          In   his   motion,   Brooker   alleged   that   his\r\n\nconstitutional  rights to  due process  and to  the effective\r\n\nassistance  of counsel  had been  violated when  his attorney\r\n\nfailed  to challenge, at sentencing  or on direct appeal, his\r\n\nenhanced  sentencing  for  conspiring  to distribute  and  to\r\n\npossess crack cocaine.   According to Brooker, the government\r\n\nfailed to prove that  the drug crime to which  he pled guilty\r\n\ninvolved  \"crack cocaine,\"  rather  than some  other form  of\r\n\n\"cocaine base\"  for which he  would have been  more leniently\r\n\nsentenced.    However,  the  plea  hearing  transcript  shows\r\n\nunambiguously that, under oath, Brooker knowingly admitted to\r\n\nhaving   agreed   to  distribute   crack  cocaine   in  taped\r\n\nconversations with a  government informant.  \"There can be no\r\n\nquestion that admissions to the court by a defendant during a\r\n\nguilty plea colloquy  can be relied upon by  the court at the\r\n\nsentencing  stage.\"  United States v.

See United States  v.
