Vega-\r\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal\r\nDivision, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n               August 30, 1999\r\n                                          NOONAN, Circuit Judge.  Abraham Serrano-Osorio (Serrano)\r\nappeals his conviction for carjacking in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n2119(2) &amp; (3) and his life sentence for murder in connection\r\ntherewith, together with his conviction of using a firearm in the\r\ncarjacking in violation of 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1)(3).  We affirm the\r\njudgment of the district court.\r\n                     FACTS\r\nAt trial, the government's principal witness, Wilfredo\r\nCabrera-Batista (Cabrera) testified that on January 19, 1993 he was\r\na security guard for St. James Company standing in the town square\r\nof Ro Grande, Puerto Rico at about 6:30 in the evening.  An\r\nacquaintance, Rubn Rivera-Trujillo (Rivera), drove by in a\r\nchampagne-colored Mitsubishi Montero.  Cabrera asked Rivera for a\r\nride.  After driving a block they passed Serrano on a street\r\ncorner.  Serrano had known Cabrera for nine years and asked Cabrera\r\nif he too could have a ride.  Cabrera, in turn, asked Rivera to\r\noblige Serrano because Serrano was going to the same area where\r\nCabrera lived.  Rivera agreed.  Cabrera got in the back seat and\r\nSerrano the front passenger seat.\r\nImmediately after getting in, Serrano pulled something\r\nfrom his waist that Cabrera could not see and told Rivera to take\r\nhim to a different area, \"La Pescadera\" in Loza.  Rivera\r\ncomplied.  When they reached La Pescadera Serrano told Rivera to\r\nstop the car and ordered both Rivera and Cabrera to get out.  When\r\nhe got out, Cabrera saw that Serrano had a revolver in his hand. \r\nSerrano grabbed Rivera by the neck and put the gun to his head. \r\nThey both fell to the ground.  Cabrera asked Serrano if he needed\r\nmoney and threw $180 on the ground near him.  He heard two shots\r\nand saw Serrano pointing the gun at Rivera's head.  He then ran and\r\nwas himself shot in the buttocks and in the back.  Serrano,\r\nhowever, did not pursue him.  Cabrera escaped into a pasture and\r\nfrom a hill saw Serrano drive off in the Mitsubishi Montero.  The\r\nmedical examiner testified that Rivera died by gunshot to his head. \r\nAnother witness testified that later in the evening Serrano arrived\r\nat a grocery store in a champagne-colored Mitsubishi Montero and\r\nthat he carried a gun in the right-hand pocket of his jeans.\r\nThe government also presented evidence that the FBI took\r\nCabrera's statement on February 25, 1994 as to what had happened\r\nand that Cabrera had identified Serrano as the carjacker and killer\r\nof Rivera.  The FBI searched for Serrano in Puerto Rico and was\r\nunable to find him although he continued to have property in Puerto\r\nRico.  A fugitive investigation ensued.  On June 29, 1995 the FBI\r\narrested Serrano in the Dominican Republic.\r\nThe defense introduced a single witness, a notary public\r\nand attorney, Noem Caraballo-Lpez (Caraballo), who had been a\r\nlawyer for 11 years.  She testified that on May 31, 1997 Cabrera\r\nhad come to her office and stated that he wanted to make a sworn\r\nstatement.  She took notes of what he wanted to say and gave them\r\nto her secretary who typed them out.  After the statement was typed\r\nshe read it to Cabrera, who signed it.  The document ended with two\r\ndeclarations:  \"I sign this statement without having been\r\nintimidated fully and voluntarily and without any coercion\r\nwhatsoever.\"  And:  \"What I have stated is the truth and nothing\r\nbut the truth, in witness whereof I sign this statement in Ro\r\nGrande, Puerto Rico on May 31, 1997.\"\r\nIn this sworn statement Cabrera declared that an argument\r\nhad arisen between Rivera and Serrano; that Rivera got out of the\r\ncar and started looking under the seat and took out a firearm; that\r\nthen Serrano got out and began to struggle with Rivera on account\r\nof the gun; and that eventually Serrano succeeded in taking the gun\r\nfrom Rivera and shot him.  At the trial Cabrera stated that he\r\nsupplied this statement because he was paid $140 by the brother of\r\nSerrano who asked him to help get his brother out of the carjacking\r\ncharge and told Cabrera that he would give him $5,000 more if his\r\nbrother did get out of the charge.  He further stated that he was\r\nintimidated by the brother and two other men and that the notary\r\npublic had been chosen by Serrano's wife.\r\n                  PROCEEDINGS\r\nOn July 5, 1995, Serrano was indicted.  A jury trial\r\nbegan on February 17, 1998.  At the conclusion of the evidence\r\nSerrano moved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 for a\r\njudgment of acquittal, which the court denied.\r\nSerrano did not object to the evidence offered as to the\r\nFBI search for him in Puerto Rico and its subsequent fugitive\r\ninvestigation.  He did argue that the court should not instruct the\r\njury as to flight.  The court, however, instructed the jury that it\r\ncould consider intentional flight by the defendant, noting that in\r\nits consideration of the evidence of flight the jury should\r\nconsider that \"there may be reasons for the defendant's actions\r\nthat are fully consistent with innocence.\"  The court also reminded\r\nthe jury that the government had the burden of proof as to whether\r\nthe defendant had engaged in intentional flight.  Serrano made no\r\nobjection to the instructions actually given.\r\nThe jury convicted Serrano of carjacking and of use of a\r\ngun.  At the sentencing hearing Serrano moved for a downward\r\ndeparture pursuant to U.S.S.G.  2A1.1, Application Note 1.  The\r\ngovernment replied that Serrano was guilty of felony murder.  The\r\ncourt heard an allocution from Serrano in which he declared that he\r\nwas innocent of intentionally killing Rivera.  The court held that\r\nRivera had been killed under circumstances that would constitute\r\nmurder under 18 U.S.C.  1111 and that therefore U.S.S.G.  2B3.1\r\n&amp; 2A1.1 set a base offense level of 43, requiring Serrano be\r\nsentenced to life imprisonment.\r\nSerrano appeals.\r\n                    ANALYSIS\r\nThe Evidence of Guilt.  Serrano contends that the\r\ngovernment's case depends on the testimony of Cabrera and that that\r\ntestimony was perjured.  This contention is based solely on the\r\ninconsistency between Cabrera's sworn statement before the notary\r\nand his testimony at trial.  No doubt the statement before the\r\nnotary shows the events in a different light from Cabrera's trial\r\ntestimony, but it was the province of the jury to decide if and\r\nwhen he was telling the truth.  He explained why his statement to\r\nthe notary was not true.  That a  man can lie on one occasion does\r\nnot establish that he is a perjurer in court.  We will not second\r\nguess the jury's belief that he told the truth to it.  See United\r\nStates v. Carroll, 105 F.3d 740, 742 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 520\r\nU.S. 1258 (1997).\r\nThe Flight Instruction.  It was doubtful that Serrano\r\neffectively objected to the court instructing the jury on flight. \r\nAssuming, however, without deciding that there is an objection, the\r\ncourt did not err in what it did tell the jury it might consider if\r\nthe government had convinced the jurors that Serrano had fled the\r\njurisdiction.  See United States v. Hernndez-Bermdez, 857 F.2d\r\n50, 52 (1st Cir. 1983).\r\nThe Constitutionality of the Carjacking Statute.  Serrano\r\nargues that 18 U.S.C.  2119 is not within the commerce powers of\r\nthe Congress.  We have rejected this contention.  See United States\r\nv. Rivera-Figueroa, 149 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub\r\nnom. Rodrguez-Rodrguez v. United States,     U.S.    , 119 S. Ct.\r\n251 (1998).\r\nThe Sentence.  The district court did not err in ruling\r\nthat Serrano had committed felony murder.  18 U.S.C.  1111.  The\r\ndistrict court's refusal to depart downward under Application Note\r\n1 to U.S.S.G.  2A1.1 is not reviewable.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n",

The document ended with two declarations: \"I sign this statement without having been intimidated fully and voluntarily and without any coercion whatsoever.\" And: \"What I have stated is the truth and nothing but the truth, in witness whereof I sign this statement in Ro Grande, Puerto Rico on May 31, 1997.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this sworn statement Cabrera declared that an argument had arisen between Rivera and Serrano; that Rivera got out of the car and started looking under the seat and took out a firearm; that then Serrano got out and began to struggle with Rivera on account of the gun; and that eventually Serrano succeeded in taking the gun from Rivera and shot him. At the trial Cabrera stated that he supplied this statement because he was paid $140 by the brother of Serrano who asked him to help get his brother out of the carjacking charge and told Cabrera that he would give him $5,000 more if his brother did get out of the charge. He further stated that he was intimidated by the brother and two other men and that the notary public had been chosen by Serrano's wife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 5, 1995, Serrano was indicted. A jury trial began on February 17, 1998. At the conclusion of the evidence Serrano moved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 for a judgment of acquittal, which the court denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano did not object to the evidence offered as to the FBI search for him in Puerto Rico and its subsequent fugitive investigation. He did argue that the court should not instruct the jury as to flight. The court, however, instructed the jury that it could consider intentional flight by the defendant, noting that in its consideration of the evidence of flight the jury should consider that \"there may be reasons for the defendant's actions that are fully consistent with innocence.\" The court also reminded the jury that the government had the burden of proof as to whether the defendant had engaged in intentional flight. Serrano made no objection to the instructions actually given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Serrano of carjacking and of use of a gun. At the sentencing hearing Serrano moved for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A1.1, Application Note 1. The government replied that Serrano was guilty of felony murder. The court heard an allocution from Serrano in which he declared that he was innocent of intentionally killing Rivera. The court held that Rivera had been killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111 and that therefore U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2B3.1 &amp; 2A1.1 set a base offense level of 43, requiring Serrano be sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serrano appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Evidence of Guilt. Serrano contends that the government's case depends on the testimony of Cabrera and that that testimony was perjured. This contention is based solely on the inconsistency between Cabrera's sworn statement before the notary and his testimony at trial. No doubt the statement before the notary shows the events in a different light from Cabrera's trial testimony, but it was the province of the jury to decide if and when he was telling the truth. He explained why his statement to the notary was not true. That a man can lie on one occasion does not establish that he is a perjurer in court. We will not second guess the jury's belief that he told the truth to it. See United States v.

It was doubtful that Serrano effectively objected to the court instructing the jury on flight. Assuming, however, without deciding that there is an objection, the court did not err in what it did tell the jury it might consider if the government had convinced the jurors that Serrano had fled the jurisdiction.
