Plaintiff,  Earl Braxton, appeals the grant\r                           \r\n\nof summary judgment in  favor of the defendants, the  City of\r\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island,  and six City police  officers.  We\r\n\nhave carefully reviewed the parties' briefs and the record on\r\n\nappeal.   We affirm the district court's judgment in favor of\r\n\nthe  defendants, essentially  for the  reasons stated  in the\r\n\nmagistrate-judge's Report and Recommendation,  dated December\r\n\n13, 1995, and, with respect  to Braxton's request for  return\r\n\nof the  automobile, for  the reason  stated  by the  district\r\n\ncourt  at the hearing held  on January 16,  1996, see tr. pp.\r                                                                 \r\n\n17-19.1\r                  1\r\n\n     We have  considered all of Braxton's  arguments and find\r\n\nnone with  merit.  We see no need to address each separately.\r\n\nWe note only the following.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Braxton also  purports to  be appealing a  prior district\r               1\r\ncourt  order   approving  an  August  15,   1995  Report  and\r\nRecommendation of the  magistrate, that recommended dismissal\r\nof defendant State  of Rhode  Island on the  ground that  the\r\nState is not a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.   1983.\r\nHowever, we  note that Braxton's  notice of appeal,  filed on\r\nFebruary 6,  1996, made specific reference  only to appealing\r\nthe  December  13, 1995  Report  and  Recommendation and  the\r\ndistrict court's acceptance of it.  Reference to a particular\r\nruling  denotes  an  intention   not  to  appeal  other  non-\r\nreferenced rulings.   See,  e.g., Kotler v.  American Tobacco\r                                                                         \r\nCo.,  981 F.2d 7, 11 (1st  Cir. 1992).  Moreover, Braxton did\r               \r\nnot serve  a copy  of this notice  of appeal  or his  opening\r\nbrief on the State.  Arguably, therefore, Braxton has  waived\r\nany appellate arguments  regarding the  earlier dismissal  of\r\nthe State of Rhode Island.\r\n     In any event, the dismissal of the State of Rhode Island\r\nwas correct for reasons  stated by the magistrate.   See Will\r                                                                         \r\nv.

The magistrate did not determine the\r                                                           \r\n\nmotions for summary judgment; rather, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n636(b)(1)(B),  the  magistrate   submitted  his  report   and\r\n\nrecommendation  on  these motions,  which  were  reviewed and\r\n\nfinally determined by the district court.\r\n\n     Braxton has  filed two post-briefing  motions with  this\r\n\ncourt requesting leave to supplement the record with material\r\n\nnot  presented to  the  district court.    These motions  are\r\n\ndenied.  This  court reviews  an appeal based  on the  record\r\n\nbelow which  encompasses \"[t]he original papers  and exhibits\r\n\nfiled in  the district court, the  transcript of proceedings,\r\n\nif any, and a  certified copy of the docket  entries prepared\r\n\nby the  clerk of the district court.\"  Fed. R. App. P. 10(a).\r\n\nIn any  event, nothing  contained in  these  two motions  and\r\n\ntheir  attachments  would  change  our  disposition  of  this\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n     The motions to supplement the record are denied.\r                                                                 \r\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
