Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n           Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Peter M. Onek, by Appointment of the Court, for appellant.\r\n   Cathryn A. Neaves, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\r\nThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief for appellees.\r\n\nJuly 19, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  Charles Vieux was charged\r\nin a Massachusetts state proceeding with rape and indecent assault\r\nand battery stemming from an encounter with Marie Dorcely.  After\r\nthe incident Marquise Dorcely, Marie's younger sister, eavesdropped\r\non a telephone conversation Vieux had with Marie's mother.  Over\r\nVieux's objection on hearsay grounds, the court admitted Marquise's\r\ntestimony regarding a comment Vieux had made.  On appeal Vieux\r\nclaimed ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object on\r\nother grounds.  After the Massachusetts Appeals Court disagreed and\r\naffirmed his conviction, he filed a petition for writ of habeas\r\ncorpus in federal court.  The district court also rebuffed his\r\nentreaty, and he has now appealed to us.  We agree that his\r\nargument lacks merit, and address once again the difficult issue of\r\nascertaining the precise contours of federal court appraisal of\r\nhabeas petitions filed by state prisoners.\r\n                    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nVieux was a close friend of the Dorcely family.  On June\r\n19, 1994, after spending the day at a beach with some friends,\r\nVieux took them to the Dorcelys' house for something to drink. \r\nWhile his friends waited in the car, Vieux went inside and called\r\nout to see if anyone was present.  Alone in the house, Marie\r\nallowed him upstairs, and, after he inspected some recent carpentry\r\nwork, they both went to the kitchen to get him some ice water.\r\nAt this point their accounts of the events differ.  She\r\nclaims that he pinned her against the refrigerator, fondled her\r\nbreasts and inserted his finger into her vagina.  She says that he\r\nthen dragged her a couple feet to the living room where he pushed\r\nher forward over the back of a couch, lifted up her dress and had\r\nintercourse with her from behind.  She asserts that throughout the\r\nepisode she attempted to get him to stop and he told her not to\r\nmake him exert himself too much.  His version of events has her\r\nbeing the sexual aggressor, kissing him and leading him to the\r\ncouch where they had brief consensual intercourse.\r\nAfterwards, he brought drinks out to his friends in the\r\ncar.  When they all eventually left, Marie called Dina Casimir and\r\ntold Casimir she had been raped.  Casimir immediately called an\r\nambulance, and Marie was taken to the hospital.  The hospital staff\r\ndiscovered semen but noted that Marie appeared to have no bruising\r\nor lacerations.\r\nThat night, Marie's mother, Degrace Dorcely, called Vieux\r\nto discuss the incident.  He admitted that he and Marie had engaged\r\nin intercourse, but claimed it was consensual.  They spoke a couple\r\nof times over the next few days, repeating the basic elements of\r\nthat conversation.  On one call Vieux turned on the speaker phone\r\nso other mechanics at the shop where Vieux worked could listen to\r\nthe conversation.  Vieux testified that the other mechanics\r\nlistened and laughed.\r\nAlso during one of the calls, unbeknownst to either\r\nDegrace or Vieux, Marquise eavesdropped from a telephone extension\r\nbecause she \"wanted to know what was going on.\"  After the end of\r\nthe conversation, Degrace hung up, but Marquise stayed on the line\r\nand heard Vieux telling the other mechanics that Degrace should\r\nallow him to marry Marie, and explaining that he just \"got a little\r\npussy.\"  Vieux denies ever making such a vulgar comment.  \r\n                    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nVieux was charged with rape and indecent assault and\r\nbattery.  The central issue at trial involved whether Marie had\r\nconsented to the intercourse.  Both Marie and Vieux took the stand,\r\nand because they were the only witnesses to the encounter and had\r\nconflicting accounts, the jury was forced to weigh their\r\ncredibility.  Believing that the comment Marquise allegedly\r\noverheard would tarnish Vieux's image in the minds of the jury,\r\nVieux's lawyer unsuccessfully attempted to suppress this evidence\r\nby objecting on hearsay grounds.\r\nAfter deliberating for approximately six hours, the jury\r\nreported that it was deadlocked.  The court then issued a\r\nsupplemental charge, and the jury deliberated for another several\r\nhours before finding Vieux guilty of rape and not guilty of\r\nindecent assault and battery.\r\nOn appeal, Vieux claimed that he received ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel.  Vieux argued that the federal wiretapping\r\nstatute (outlawing \"any electronic . . . device\" used to intercept\r\na telephone conversation and the evidence therefrom) prohibits the\r\nintroduction of the statement Marquise claims to have overheard\r\nwhile eavesdropping.  Vieux asserted that his lawyer should have\r\nobjected on that basis, and the failure to do so constituted\r\nineffective assistance of counsel.  The Massachusetts Appeals Court\r\nfound that an objection based on the federal wiretapping statute\r\nwould have been futile because the evidence fell into the statute's\r\n\"ordinary course of business\" exception (exempting from the\r\ndefinition of an \"electronic . . . device\" a telephone \"being used\r\n. . . in the ordinary course of . . . business\").  Consequently,\r\nthe court concluded that counsel was not ineffective, and affirmed\r\nVieux's conviction.  He unsuccessfully sought review before the\r\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the United States Supreme\r\nCourt, but each denied his request.\r\nVieux then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in\r\nfederal district court.  In a lengthy and thoughtful opinion, the \r\ncourt agreed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court and dismissed his\r\npetition.\r\n                   III. REVIEW UNDER AEDPA\r\nBefore addressing the merits of Vieux's claim, we must\r\nfirst delve into an explication of our standard of review.  When\r\nCongress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\r\nof 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), it significantly altered our review of habeas\r\npetitions brought by state prisoners.  Federal courts are now\r\nbarred from granting a writ of habeas corpus to such individuals\r\nunless the underlying adjudication:\r\n  (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\r\nto, or involved an unreasonable application\r\nof, clearly established Federal law, as\r\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates; or\r\n  (2) resulted in a decision that was based on\r\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in\r\nlight of the evidence presented in the State\r\ncourt proceeding.\r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2254(d).  The Massachusetts Appeals Court did not\r\ndetermine any facts, so we need analyze its decision only under\r\nsubsection (1), i.e., we must decide whether it was \"contrary to,\r\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\r\nFederal law.\"\r\nWhen we addressed this provision at length in O'Brien v.\r\nDuBois, 145 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 1998), we held that the provision\r\nrequires a two step inquiry.  \"First, the habeas court asks whether\r\nthe Supreme Court has prescribed a rule that governs the\r\npetitioner's claim.  If so, the habeas court gauges whether the\r\nstate court decision is 'contrary to' the governing rule.\"  Id. at\r\n24.  If petitioner does not obtain relief under the \"contrary to\"\r\nprong, the inquiry shifts to the second step where the habeas court\r\nmust decide whether the state decision is an unreasonable\r\napplication of Supreme Court precedent.  See id.  In O'Brien, we\r\nfound no Court precedent sufficiently on point to justify review\r\nunder the \"contrary to\" prong, so we proceeded to evaluate the\r\nclaim under the \"unreasonable application\" clause.  See id. at 26.\r\nMassachusetts argues that if a claim can be analyzed\r\nunder the first prong, the court is not allowed to reach the second\r\nstep in the analysis.  As we shall demonstrate, this is simply\r\nincorrect.\r\nThe initial challenge in applying this statutory language\r\nis in determining precisely how similar the case must be to Supreme\r\nCourt precedent to justify \"contrary to\" analysis.  Quite\r\nobviously, the closer a case is to the factual and legal posture of\r\na given Supreme Court decision, the easier it is to say that the\r\nSupreme Court has prescribed a governing rule, thereby triggering\r\nthe \"contrary to\" clause.  However, precise identicality of facts\r\nand legal issues is not required, for, if it were, no cases would\r\nbe analyzed under the \"contrary to\" prong.  Therefore, we commented\r\nthat some \"Supreme Court holdings are 'general' in the sense that\r\nthey erect a framework specifically intended for application to\r\nvariant factual situations.\"  Id. at 25.  In a footnote by way of\r\nexample we cited a number of familiar cases that would fit this\r\nmold, including Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), for\r\nclaims involving ineffective assistance of counsel.  When a\r\npetitioner raised such a \"framework\" legal claim, we held that\r\nCourt precedent \"sufficiently shape[d] the contours of . . .\r\nappropriate analysis . . . to merit review of a state court's\r\ndecision under section 2254(d)(1)'s 'contrary to' prong.\"  O'Brien,\r\n145 F.3d at 25.\r\nThe fact that \"framework\" claims may be analyzed under\r\nthe \"contrary to\" clause does not, however, obviate the need also\r\nto apply the \"unreasonable application\" clause as well.  Rather,\r\nO'Brien held that relief under the \"contrary to\" prong requires\r\nboth: (1) identification of controlling Court precedent, whether a\r\n\"framework\" case like Strickland or not; and (2) a ruling that the\r\nidentified precedent demands a particular outcome, i.e., one\r\ncontrary to that reached by the state court.  Specifically, we\r\nstated that the \"key inquiry\" was whether the relevant Supreme\r\nCourt decision \"can fairly be said to require a particular result\r\nin a particular case.\"  Id. (emphasis added). \"If no Supreme Court\r\nprecedent is dispositive of a petitioner's claim, then, a fortiori,\r\nthere is no specific rule to which the state court's decision can\r\nbe 'contrary.'\" Id. (emphasis added).\r\nThus, the petitioner may succeed under the \"contrary to\"\r\nclause only if Supreme Court caselaw directly governs the claim and\r\nthe state court got it wrong.  The case is not over, however, if\r\nthe state court decision cannot be termed \"contrary to\" Court\r\nprecedent.  Instead, just as in cases where there is no specific\r\nrule on point, we must assess whether it is an \"unreasonable\r\napplication\" of the Court's pronouncements.  Admittedly, in certain\r\ncases, especially those involving non-\"framework\" claims, Court\r\nprecedent will be sufficiently specific that petitioner's claim\r\nwill either be contrary to or entirely consonant with the Court's\r\nrulings.  If the state decision is consistent with the relevant\r\nCourt decision, it plainly would not be an unreasonable application\r\nof Court precedent.  Therefore, the federal court will be able to\r\ndispatch swiftly any argument under the second step of analysis.\r\nTo say this, however, is not to say that the second step\r\nanalysis is unnecessary, for unless a habeas court grants relief\r\nunder the \"contrary to\" prong, it will be required to analyze the\r\npetitioner's claim under the \"unreasonable application\" prong as\r\nwell.  To rule otherwise would be to ignore the word \"or\" in the\r\nstatute limiting our power to grant the writ if the state decision\r\nwas \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\"\r\nfederal law.  28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) (emphasis added).\r\n                   IV. PETITIONER'S CLAIMS\r\nWe turn to the merits of Vieux's appeal.  Vieux's claim\r\nof ineffective assistance of counsel is analyzed under the familiar\r\nStrickland rubric, which requires Vieux to prove that his counsel's\r\nperformance both was deficient and prejudiced his defense.  See\r\nUnited States v. Ortiz, 146 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1998). \r\nObviously, counsel's performance was not deficient if he declined\r\nto pursue a futile tactic.  See United States v. Wright, 573 F.2d\r\n681, 684 (1st Cir. 1978) (\"Counsel is not required to waste the\r\ncourt's time with futile or frivolous motions.\").  The\r\nMassachusetts Appeals Court ruled that Vieux's counsel was not\r\ndeficient because any objection on the basis of the federal\r\nwiretapping statute would have been overruled by the trial court. \r\nConsequently, the court denied his claim under Strickland.\r\nWe start by noting that the Massachusetts Appeals Court\r\nconducted a proper Strickland analysis.  It identified both\r\nessential elements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,\r\nand properly recognized that \"failing to pursue a futile tactic\r\ndoes not amount to constitutional ineffectiveness.\"  Commonwealth\r\nv. Vieux, 671 N.E.2d 989, 990 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996).  So long as\r\nits underlying reasoning, i.e., that the objection would have been\r\nunsuccessful, was not \"contrary to, or [did not] involve[] an\r\nunreasonable application of\" Supreme Court precedent, we are\r\npowerless to grant the writ.  We turn, then, to whether an\r\nobjection would have been futile.\r\nIn relevant part, the federal wiretapping statute outlaws\r\nthe unauthorized use of \"any electronic, mechanical, or other\r\ndevice\" to intercept a telephone conversation.  18 U.S.C. \r\n2511(b).  The statute also prohibits courts from receiving any such\r\nillegally intercepted telephone conversations into evidence at\r\ntrial.  See 18 U.S.C.  2515. At issue is whether Marquise's\r\ntelephone extension constitutes an \"electronic, mechanical or other\r\ndevice.\"  The statute defines that term as \"any device . . . other\r\nthan . . . any telephone . . . being used by the subscriber or user\r\nin the ordinary course of its business[.]\"  18 U.S.C.  2510(5). \r\nConsequently, if Marquise was using the phone in the ordinary\r\ncourse of her business, she did not illegally intercept Vieux's\r\nalleged comment.  On the other hand, if she was not using the phone\r\nin the ordinary course of her business, then her eavesdropping\r\nconstituted the use of \"any electronic, mechanical or other\r\ndevice,\" and the trial court would have been barred from allowing\r\nthe statement she overheard into evidence.  Under this scenario,\r\nany objection on this basis should have been successful.\r\nThe Massachusetts Appeals Court conducted an extensive\r\nsurvey of the caselaw interpreting the contours of the \"ordinary\r\ncourse of business\" exception.  See Commonwealth v. Vieux, 671\r\nN.E.2d at 991-993.  Because the first step of our review centers on\r\nwhether the state decision was contrary to only those cases decided\r\nby the Supreme Court, we focus our inquiry there.\r\nThe Supreme Court has not directly addressed the scope of\r\nthe \"ordinary course of business\" exception.  It has considered the\r\nstatute on a number of occasions, but most decisions involve the\r\nauthority of law enforcement personnel to wiretap criminal\r\nsuspects.  See, e.g., United States v. Ojeda Rios, 495 U.S. 257\r\n(1990) (discussing the requirement that law enforcement seal tapes\r\nof authorized interceptions); Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238\r\n(1979) (holding that electronic surveillance statute granted courts\r\nthe power to allow government agents to enter private premises\r\ncovertly).  In his attempt to argue that the state decision was\r\ncontrary to Supreme Court caselaw, Vieux cites two cases: Gelbard\r\nv. United States, 408 U.S. 41 (1972), and United States v.\r\nGiordano, 416 U.S. 505 (1974).  \r\nAt issue in Gelbard was a witness's attempt to invoke the\r\nstatute to refuse to testify before a grand jury because any\r\ntestimony would be based on illegally intercepted conversations. \r\nIn the course of allowing this claim as a defense to the witness's\r\ncontempt proceeding, the Court stated that unless \"expressly\r\nauthorized in [the statute] . . . all interceptions of wire and\r\noral communications are flatly prohibited.\"  Gelbard, 408 U.S. at\r\n46.  Vieux relies heavily on this simple statement in his attempt\r\nto convince us that Marquise's eavesdropping was improper.  He\r\nneglects to acknowledge, however, that the use of a telephone in\r\nthe \"ordinary course of business\" does not fall within the\r\ndefinition of a prohibited intercepting device, and anything\r\noverheard therefore would not be an interception.  The quotation\r\nprovides no assistance in resolving the issue before us and instead\r\nbegs the question.  No other language in Gelbard indicates in any\r\nway whether Marquise's eavesdropping should fall within the\r\n\"ordinary course of business\" exception or not.\r\nGiordano provides equally little ammunition for Vieux's\r\nchallenge.  Giordano involved a motion to suppress evidence because\r\nthe authority for a given wiretap did not come from one of the\r\nofficials empowered to authorize electronic surveillance under the\r\nstatute.  Again Vieux highlights the Court's sweeping language,\r\nnamely that \"[t]he purpose of the legislation . . . was effectively\r\nto prohibit . . . all interceptions of oral and wire\r\ncommunications, except those specifically provided for in the Act,\"\r\nmost notably law enforcement personnel acting under a court order. \r\nGiordano, 416 U.S. at 514.  And again, the quote fails to address\r\nthe underlying question of whether Marquise's eavesdropping was not\r\nan interception because she used an extension telephone in the\r\nordinary course of her business.  \r\nHence the Supreme Court has not ruled directly on the\r\nscope of the ordinary business exception, and its more general\r\npronouncements provide no guidance as to whether Marquise's\r\neavesdropping was done in the \"ordinary course of business.\"\r\nConsequently, we cannot say that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's\r\ndecision that counsel was not deficient because the objection would\r\nbe futile was \"contrary to\" Supreme Court caselaw.\r\nWe thus proceed to the second step of the inquiry:\r\nwhether the state court ruling was an \"unreasonable application\" of\r\nthe Court's precedent.  As we said in O'Brien, the issue \"reduces\r\nto a question of whether the state court's derivation of a case-\r\nspecific rule from the Court's generally relevant jurisprudence\r\nappears objectively reasonable.\"  O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.  To find\r\nthe state decision unreasonable, it must be \"so offensive to\r\nexisting precedent, so devoid of record support, or so arbitrary,\r\nas to indicate that it is outside the universe of plausible,\r\ncredible outcomes.\"  Id.  \r\nIn divining the reasonableness of the Appeals Court's\r\ndecision, we start by noting that the scope of the \"ordinary course\r\nof business\" exception has been the subject of a significant split\r\nin authority.  Relying on legislative history concerning the\r\nextensive use of electronic surveillance in marital disputes, some\r\ncourts have ruled that the intra-family use of an extension phone\r\ndoes not fall within the ordinary course of business exception, and\r\nhence any conversation heard by some family members when\r\neavesdropping on other family members is inadmissible in court. \r\nSee, e.g., Kempf v. Kempf, 868 F.2d 970, 973 (8th Cir. 1989)\r\n(holding that no exception exists under federal wiretapping statute\r\nfor instances of willful, unconsented-to electronic surveillance\r\nbetween spouses); Pritchard v. Pritchard, 732 F.2d 372, 374 (4th\r\nCir. 1984) (same); United States v. Jones, 542 F.2d 661, 673 (6th\r\nCir. 1976) (finding that the plain language of the statute and its\r\nlegislative history compel the interpretation that the act includes\r\ninterspousal wiretaps).\r\nOther courts, concerned about intruding on intra-family\r\nmatters better left to state law, have ruled that eavesdropping by\r\nfamily members on an extension telephone falls within the ordinary\r\ncourse of the family member's business and thus is not outlawed by\r\nthe federal electronic surveillance statute.  See, e.g., Scheib v.\r\nGrant, 22 F.3d 149, 153-4 (7th Cir. 1994) (finding that father's\r\nmonitoring and recording conversations between his child and his\r\nex-wife was encompassed within the ordinary course of business\r\nexception); Newcomb v. Ingle, 944 F.2d 1534, 1535-36 (10th Cir.\r\n1991) (ruling that custodial parent's recording of child's\r\nconversations with non-custodial parent was not an illegal\r\ninterception under the statute); Anonymous v. Anonymous, 558 F.2d\r\n677, 679 (2d Cir. 1977) (quoting testimony from the legislative\r\nhistory to the effect that \"nobody wants to make it a crime for a\r\nfather to listen in on his teenage daughter or some such related\r\nproblem\"); Simpson v. Simpson, 490 F.2d 803, 810 (5th Cir. 1974)\r\n(deciding that husband intercepting conversations between wife and\r\nanother man did not fall within statute's prohibitions).\r\nIt seems to us that both positions are supportable.  The\r\nMassachusetts Appeals Court's conclusion that an objection under\r\nthe federal wiretapping statute would have been overruled was\r\ntherefore not an \"unreasonable application\" of federal law.\r\nLet us be clear.  We are not deciding that, were the\r\nquestion presented to us, Marquise's use of the telephone extension\r\nwas done in the ordinary course of business and thus was exempted\r\nfrom the federal wiretapping statute's restrictions.  Rather, we\r\nare holding only that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision to\r\nthat effect was not \"contrary to\" or \"an unreasonable application\r\nof\" federal law.  Consequently, its decision that Vieux's lawyer\r\nwas not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object on that\r\nbasis was equally not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\r\nfederal law.\r\nIn essence, Vieux wants us to announce our views as to\r\nthe scope of the ordinary business exception, and then apply the\r\nresult, if favorable to him, to his trial in state court three\r\nyears ago.  We refuse to do so.  As we said in O'Brien, \r\n  Teague taught that, apart from the Supreme\r\nCourt, federal habeas courts ought not act as\r\ninnovators in the field of criminal procedure,\r\nthereby upsetting state convictions because\r\nstate courts were not prescient and thus\r\nfailed to comply with federal law that did not\r\nexist at the time they ruled. \r\n\nO'Brien, 145 F.3d at 23.  This case falls precisely within that\r\nrestriction.  When confronted with Vieux's ineffective assistance\r\nof counsel claim, the Massachusetts Appeals Court issued a decision\r\nthat cannot be deemed unreasonable in light of a healthy debate\r\namong a number of courts.  We are powerless to grant Vieux's\r\nsubsequent petition for the writ of habeas corpus.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

His version of events has her being the sexual aggressor, kissing him and leading him to the couch where they had brief consensual intercourse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Afterwards, he brought drinks out to his friends in the car. When they all eventually left, Marie called Dina Casimir and told Casimir she had been raped. Casimir immediately called an ambulance, and Marie was taken to the hospital. The hospital staff discovered semen but noted that Marie appeared to have no bruising or lacerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That night, Marie's mother, Degrace Dorcely, called Vieux to discuss the incident. He admitted that he and Marie had engaged in intercourse, but claimed it was consensual. They spoke a couple of times over the next few days, repeating the basic elements of that conversation. On one call Vieux turned on the speaker phone so other mechanics at the shop where Vieux worked could listen to the conversation. Vieux testified that the other mechanics listened and laughed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also during one of the calls, unbeknownst to either Degrace or Vieux, Marquise eavesdropped from a telephone extension because she \"wanted to know what was going on.\" After the end of the conversation, Degrace hung up, but Marquise stayed on the line and heard Vieux telling the other mechanics that Degrace should allow him to marry Marie, and explaining that he just \"got a little pussy.\" Vieux denies ever making such a vulgar comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vieux was charged with rape and indecent assault and battery. The central issue at trial involved whether Marie had consented to the intercourse. Both Marie and Vieux took the stand, and because they were the only witnesses to the encounter and had conflicting accounts, the jury was forced to weigh their credibility. Believing that the comment Marquise allegedly overheard would tarnish Vieux's image in the minds of the jury, Vieux's lawyer unsuccessfully attempted to suppress this evidence by objecting on hearsay grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberating for approximately six hours, the jury reported that it was deadlocked. The court then issued a supplemental charge, and the jury deliberated for another several hours before finding Vieux guilty of rape and not guilty of indecent assault and battery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Vieux claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Vieux argued that the federal wiretapping statute (outlawing \"any electronic . . . device\" used to intercept a telephone conversation and the evidence therefrom) prohibits the introduction of the statement Marquise claims to have overheard while eavesdropping. Vieux asserted that his lawyer should have objected on that basis, and the failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Massachusetts Appeals Court found that an objection based on the federal wiretapping statute would have been futile because the evidence fell into the statute's \"ordinary course of business\" exception (exempting from the definition of an \"electronic . . . device\" a telephone \"being used . . . in the ordinary course of . . . business\"). Consequently, the court concluded that counsel was not ineffective, and affirmed Vieux's conviction. He unsuccessfully sought review before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the United States Supreme Court, but each denied his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vieux then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. In a lengthy and thoughtful opinion, the court agreed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court and dismissed his petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. REVIEW UNDER AEDPA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the merits of Vieux's claim, we must first delve into an explication of our standard of review. When Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), it significantly altered our review of habeas petitions brought by state prisoners. Federal courts are now barred from granting a writ of habeas corpus to such individuals unless the underlying adjudication:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). The Massachusetts Appeals Court did not determine any facts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> so we need analyze its decision only under subsection (1), i.e., we must decide whether it was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we addressed this provision at length in O'Brien v. DuBois, 145 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 1998), we held that the provision requires a two step inquiry. \"First, the habeas court asks whether the Supreme Court has prescribed a rule that governs the petitioner's claim. If so, the habeas court gauges whether the state court decision is 'contrary to' the governing rule.\" Id. at 24. If petitioner does not obtain relief under the \"contrary to\" prong, the inquiry shifts to the second step where the habeas court must decide whether the state decision is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. See id. In O'Brien, we found no Court precedent sufficiently on point to justify review under the \"contrary to\" prong, so we proceeded to evaluate the claim under the \"unreasonable application\" clause. See id. at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts argues that if a claim can be analyzed under the first prong, the court is not allowed to reach the second step in the analysis. As we shall demonstrate, this is simply incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial challenge in applying this statutory language is in determining precisely how similar the case must be to Supreme Court precedent to justify \"contrary to\" analysis. Quite obviously, the closer a case is to the factual and legal posture of a given Supreme Court decision, the easier it is to say that the Supreme Court has prescribed a governing rule, thereby triggering the \"contrary to\" clause. However, precise identicality of facts and legal issues is not required, for, if it were, no cases would be analyzed under the \"contrary to\" prong. Therefore, we commented that some \"Supreme Court holdings are 'general' in the sense that they erect a framework specifically intended for application to variant factual situations.\" Id. at 25. In a footnote by way of example we cited a number of familiar cases that would fit this mold, including Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel. When a petitioner raised such a \"framework\" legal claim, we held that Court precedent \"sufficiently shape[d] the contours of . . . appropriate analysis . . . to merit review of a state court's decision under section 2254(d)(1)'s 'contrary to' prong.\" O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that \"framework\" claims may be analyzed under the \"contrary to\" clause does not, however, obviate the need also to apply the \"unreasonable application\" clause as well. Rather, O'Brien held that relief under the \"contrary to\" prong requires both: (1) identification of controlling Court precedent, whether a \"framework\" case like Strickland or not; and (2) a ruling that the identified precedent demands a particular outcome, i.e., one contrary to that reached by the state court. Specifically, we stated that the \"key inquiry\" was whether the relevant Supreme Court decision \"can fairly be said to require a particular result in a particular case.\" Id. (emphasis added). \"If no Supreme Court precedent is dispositive of a petitioner's claim, then, a fortiori, there is no specific rule to which the state court's decision can be 'contrary.'\" Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the petitioner may succeed under the \"contrary to\" clause only if Supreme Court caselaw directly governs the claim and the state court got it wrong. The case is not over, however, if the state court decision cannot be termed \"contrary to\" Court precedent. Instead, just as in cases where there is no specific rule on point, we must assess whether it is an \"unreasonable application\" of the Court's pronouncements. Admittedly, in certain cases, especially those involving non-\"framework\" claims, Court precedent will be sufficiently specific that petitioner's claim will either be contrary to or entirely consonant with the Court's rulings. If the state decision is consistent with the relevant Court decision, it plainly would not be an unreasonable application of Court precedent. Therefore, the federal court will be able to dispatch swiftly any argument under the second step of analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say this, however, is not to say that the second step analysis is unnecessary, for unless a habeas court grants relief under the \"contrary to\" prong, it will be required to analyze the petitioner's claim under the \"unreasonable application\" prong as well. To rule otherwise would be to ignore the word \"or\" in the statute limiting our power to grant the writ if the state decision was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\" federal law. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. PETITIONER'S CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the merits of Vieux's appeal. Vieux's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is analyzed under the familiar Strickland rubric, which requires Vieux to prove that his counsel's performance both was deficient and prejudiced his defense. See United States v. Ortiz, 146 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1998). Obviously, counsel's performance was not deficient if he declined to pursue a futile tactic. See United States v. Wright, 573 F.2d 681, 684 (1st Cir. 1978) (\"Counsel is not required to waste the court's time with futile or frivolous motions.\"). The Massachusetts Appeals Court ruled that Vieux's counsel was not deficient because any objection on the basis of the federal wiretapping statute would have been overruled by the trial court. Consequently, the court denied his claim under Strickland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by noting that the Massachusetts Appeals Court conducted a proper Strickland analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> It identified both essential elements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and properly recognized that \"failing to pursue a futile tactic does not amount to constitutional ineffectiveness.\" Commonwealth v. Vieux, 671 N.E.2d 989, 990 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996). So long as its underlying reasoning, i.e., that the objection would have been unsuccessful, was not \"contrary to, or [did not] involve[] an unreasonable application of\" Supreme Court precedent, we are powerless to grant the writ. We turn, then, to whether an objection would have been futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In relevant part, the federal wiretapping statute outlaws the unauthorized use of \"any electronic, mechanical, or other device\" to intercept a telephone conversation. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(b). The statute also prohibits courts from receiving any such illegally intercepted telephone conversations into evidence at trial. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2515. At issue is whether Marquise's telephone extension constitutes an \"electronic, mechanical or other device.\" The statute defines that term as \"any device . . . other than . . . any telephone . . . being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business[.]\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(5). Consequently, if Marquise was using the phone in the ordinary course of her business, she did not illegally intercept Vieux's alleged comment. On the other hand, if she was not using the phone in the ordinary course of her business, then her eavesdropping constituted the use of \"any electronic, mechanical or other device,\" and the trial court would have been barred from allowing the statement she overheard into evidence. Under this scenario, any objection on this basis should have been successful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Appeals Court conducted an extensive survey of the caselaw interpreting the contours of the \"ordinary course of business\" exception. See Commonwealth v. Vieux, 671 N.E.2d at 991-993. Because the first step of our review centers on whether the state decision was contrary to only those cases decided by the Supreme Court, we focus our inquiry there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the scope of the \"ordinary course of business\" exception. It has considered the statute on a number of occasions, but most decisions involve the authority of law enforcement personnel to wiretap criminal suspects. See, e.g., United States v. Ojeda Rios, 495 U.S. 257 (1990) (discussing the requirement that law enforcement seal tapes of authorized interceptions); Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238 (1979) (holding that electronic surveillance statute granted courts the power to allow government agents to enter private premises covertly). In his attempt to argue that the state decision was contrary to Supreme Court caselaw, Vieux cites two cases: Gelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41 (1972), and United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in Gelbard was a witness's attempt to invoke the statute to refuse to testify before a grand jury because any testimony would be based on illegally intercepted conversations. In the course of allowing this claim as a defense to the witness's contempt proceeding, the Court stated that unless \"expressly authorized in [the statute] . . . all interceptions of wire and oral communications are flatly prohibited.\" Gelbard, 408 U.S. at 46. Vieux relies heavily on this simple statement in his attempt to convince us that Marquise's eavesdropping was improper. He neglects to acknowledge, however, that the use of a telephone in the \"ordinary course of business\" does not fall within the definition of a prohibited intercepting device, and anything overheard therefore would not be an interception. The quotation provides no assistance in resolving the issue before us and instead begs the question. No other language in Gelbard indicates in any way whether Marquise's eavesdropping should fall within the \"ordinary course of business\" exception or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giordano provides equally little ammunition for Vieux's challenge. Giordano involved a motion to suppress evidence because the authority for a given wiretap did not come from one of the officials empowered to authorize electronic surveillance under the statute. Again Vieux highlights the Court's sweeping language, namely that \"[t]he purpose of the legislation . . . was effectively to prohibit . . . all interceptions of oral and wire communications, except those specifically provided for in the Act,\" most notably law enforcement personnel acting under a court order. Giordano, 416 U.S. at 514. And again, the quote fails to address the underlying question of whether Marquise's eavesdropping was not an interception because she used an extension telephone in the ordinary course of her business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence the Supreme Court has not ruled directly on the scope of the ordinary business exception, and its more general pronouncements provide no guidance as to whether Marquise's eavesdropping was done in the \"ordinary course of business.\" Consequently, we cannot say that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision that counsel was not deficient because the objection would be futile was \"contrary to\" Supreme Court caselaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus proceed to the second step of the inquiry: whether the state court ruling was an \"unreasonable application\" of the Court's precedent. As we said in O'Brien, the issue \"reduces to a question of whether the state court's derivation of a case-specific rule from the Court's generally relevant jurisprudence appears objectively reasonable.\" O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25. To find the state decision unreasonable, it must be \"so offensive to existing precedent, so devoid of record support, or so arbitrary, as to indicate that it is outside the universe of plausible, credible outcomes.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In divining the reasonableness of the Appeals Court's decision, we start by noting that the scope of the \"ordinary course of business\" exception has been the subject of a significant split in authority.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Relying on legislative history concerning the extensive use of electronic surveillance in marital disputes, some courts have ruled that the intra-family use of an extension phone does not fall within the ordinary course of business exception, and hence any conversation heard by some family members when eavesdropping on other family members is inadmissible in court. See, e.g., Kempf v. Kempf, 868 F.2d 970, 973 (8th Cir. 1989) (holding that no exception exists under federal wiretapping statute for instances of willful, unconsented-to electronic surveillance between spouses); Pritchard v. Pritchard, 732 F.2d 372, 374 (4th Cir. 1984) (same); United States v. Jones, 542 F.2d 661, 673 (6th Cir. 1976) (finding that the plain language of the statute and its legislative history compel the interpretation that the act includes interspousal wiretaps).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts, concerned about intruding on intra-family matters better left to state law, have ruled that eavesdropping by family members on an extension telephone falls within the ordinary course of the family member's business and thus is not outlawed by the federal electronic surveillance statute. See, e.g., Scheib v. Grant, 22 F.3d 149, 153-4 (7th Cir. 1994) (finding that father's monitoring and recording conversations between his child and his ex-wife was encompassed within the ordinary course of business exception); Newcomb v. Ingle, 944 F.2d 1534, 1535-36 (10th Cir. 1991) (ruling that custodial parent's recording of child's conversations with non-custodial parent was not an illegal interception under the statute); Anonymous v. Anonymous, 558 F.2d 677, 679 (2d Cir. 1977) (quoting testimony from the legislative history to the effect that \"nobody wants to make it a crime for a father to listen in on his teenage daughter or some such related problem\"); Simpson v. Simpson, 490 F.2d 803, 810 (5th Cir. 1974) (deciding that husband intercepting conversations between wife and another man did not fall within statute's prohibitions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that both positions are supportable. The Massachusetts Appeals Court's conclusion that an objection under the federal wiretapping statute would have been overruled was therefore not an \"unreasonable application\" of federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be clear. We are not deciding that, were the question presented to us, Marquise's use of the telephone extension was done in the ordinary course of business and thus was exempted from the federal wiretapping statute's restrictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Rather, we are holding only that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision to that effect was not \"contrary to\" or \"an unreasonable application of\" federal law. Consequently, its decision that Vieux's lawyer was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object on that basis was equally not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Vieux wants us to announce our views as to the scope of the ordinary business exception, and then apply the result, if favorable to him, to his trial in state court three years ago. We refuse to do so. As we said in O'Brien,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Teague taught that, apart from the Supreme Court, federal habeas courts ought not act as innovators in the field of criminal procedure, thereby upsetting state convictions because state courts were not prescient and thus failed to comply with federal law that did not exist at the time they ruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 23. This case falls precisely within that restriction. When confronted with Vieux's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the Massachusetts Appeals Court issued a decision that cannot be deemed unreasonable in light of a healthy debate among a number of courts. We are powerless to grant Vieux's subsequent petition for the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Vieux claims that the Massachusetts Appeals Court engaged in improper factfinding when it described Marquise's motivation as \"concern for her sister.\" Commonwealth v. Vieux, 671 N.E.2d 989, 993 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996). At trial Marquise had stated that she was listening in because she \"wanted to know what was going on.\" We do not read the court's language as being a determination of the facts, but rather a fair characterization of the trial testimony. Nevertheless, to the degree that interpreting Marquise's comment as \"concern for her sister\" does constitute a factual determination, we find that the Appeals Court's decision was not unreasonable under &#167; 2254(d)(2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although, as we noted in O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25 and n.6, Strickland v. Washington sets up a \"framework\" for analysis of ineffective assistance of counsel claims under section 2254(d)(1)'s \"contrary to\" prong, we also noted that it would be a rare case that could be said to forge a contrary rule. Moreover, whether counsel's assistance was ineffective depends on whether failure to object was deficient. This, in turn, depends on whether precedent from the Supreme Court or its surrogate, relevant lower court jurisprudence, has clearly barred an \"ordinary course of business\" exception to the wiretapping statute in similar circumstances.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  As we said in O'Brien, notwithstanding the statutory emphasis on Supreme Court caselaw, \"reference to [factually similar decisions by inferior federal courts] is appropriate in assessing the reasonableness vel non of the state court's treatment of the contested issue.\" O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This case demonstrates precisely why claims must be analyzed under both the \"contrary to\" and the \"unreasonable application\" prongs. Hypothetically speaking, if all courts, in applying the Supreme Court's broad language, had determined that intra-family eavesdropping was a violation of the federal wiretapping statute, it is more likely that we would have found the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision to be unreasonable, even though not actually \"contrary to\" the Court's pronouncements. This possibility arises entirely as a consequence of O'Brien's appropriate statement permitting habeas courts to consider decisions by other inferior federal courts in the course of assessing whether the state decision was an unreasonable application of Court caselaw.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> However, were the question, in fact, squarely before us, we note that this case, involving statements regarding an alleged crime against another family member, wouldn't be so close a question as one that fell within the scope of Congress's concern about evidence from wiretaps being used in marital disputes.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> While the Massachusetts Appeals court did not reach the issue, we note, only in passing, that we believe Vieux also failed to establish prejudice, the other Strickland element. He claims that Marquise's testimony prejudiced him because it depicted him as cruel and insensitive. However, he himself had testified that during one of the phone calls he had turned on the speaker phone for the amusement of the other mechanics in the shop. This act alone demonstrated his callous nature; any harm from Marquise's eavesdropping was merely cumulative. Consequently, he has not shown that the failure to object to Marquise's testimony actually prejudiced his defense.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

After the incident Marquise Dorcely, Marie's younger sister, eavesdropped on a telephone conversation Vieux had with Marie's mother. Over Vieux's objection on hearsay grounds, the court admitted Marquise's testimony regarding a comment Vieux had made. On appeal Vieux claimed ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object on other grounds. After the Massachusetts Appeals Court disagreed and affirmed his conviction, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court. The district court also rebuffed his entreaty, and he has now appealed to us. We agree that his argument lacks merit, and address once again the difficult issue of ascertaining the precise contours of federal court appraisal of habeas petitions filed by state prisoners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vieux was a close friend of the Dorcely family. On June 19, 1994, after spending the day at a beach with some friends, Vieux took them to the Dorcelys' house for something to drink. While his friends waited in the car, Vieux went inside and called out to see if anyone was present. Alone in the house, Marie allowed him upstairs, and, after he inspected some recent carpentry work, they both went to the kitchen to get him some ice water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point their accounts of the events differ. She claims that he pinned her against the refrigerator, fondled her breasts and inserted his finger into her vagina. She says that he then dragged her a couple feet to the living room where he pushed her forward over the back of a couch, lifted up her dress and had intercourse with her from behind. She asserts that throughout the episode she attempted to get him to stop and he told her not to make him exert himself too much. His version of events has her being the sexual aggressor, kissing him and leading him to the couch where they had brief consensual intercourse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Afterwards, he brought drinks out to his friends in the car. When they all eventually left, Marie called Dina Casimir and told Casimir she had been raped. Casimir immediately called an ambulance, and Marie was taken to the hospital. The hospital staff discovered semen but noted that Marie appeared to have no bruising or lacerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That night, Marie's mother, Degrace Dorcely, called Vieux to discuss the incident. He admitted that he and Marie had engaged in intercourse, but claimed it was consensual. They spoke a couple of times over the next few days, repeating the basic elements of that conversation. On one call Vieux turned on the speaker phone so other mechanics at the shop where Vieux worked could listen to the conversation. Vieux testified that the other mechanics listened and laughed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also during one of the calls, unbeknownst to either Degrace or Vieux, Marquise eavesdropped from a telephone extension because she \"wanted to know what was going on.\" After the end of the conversation, Degrace hung up, but Marquise stayed on the line and heard Vieux telling the other mechanics that Degrace should allow him to marry Marie, and explaining that he just \"got a little pussy.\" Vieux denies ever making such a vulgar comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vieux was charged with rape and indecent assault and battery. The central issue at trial involved whether Marie had consented to the intercourse. Both Marie and Vieux took the stand, and because they were the only witnesses to the encounter and had conflicting accounts, the jury was forced to weigh their credibility. Believing that the comment Marquise allegedly overheard would tarnish Vieux's image in the minds of the jury, Vieux's lawyer unsuccessfully attempted to suppress this evidence by objecting on hearsay grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberating for approximately six hours, the jury reported that it was deadlocked. The court then issued a supplemental charge, and the jury deliberated for another several hours before finding Vieux guilty of rape and not guilty of indecent assault and battery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Vieux claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Vieux argued that the federal wiretapping statute (outlawing \"any electronic . . . device\" used to intercept a telephone conversation and the evidence therefrom) prohibits the introduction of the statement Marquise claims to have overheard while eavesdropping. Vieux asserted that his lawyer should have objected on that basis, and the failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Massachusetts Appeals Court found that an objection based on the federal wiretapping statute would have been futile because the evidence fell into the statute's \"ordinary course of business\" exception (exempting from the definition of an \"electronic . . . device\" a telephone \"being used . . . in the ordinary course of . . . business\"). Consequently, the court concluded that counsel was not ineffective, and affirmed Vieux's conviction. He unsuccessfully sought review before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the United States Supreme Court, but each denied his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vieux then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. In a lengthy and thoughtful opinion, the court agreed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court and dismissed his petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. REVIEW UNDER AEDPA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the merits of Vieux's claim, we must first delve into an explication of our standard of review. When Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), it significantly altered our review of habeas petitions brought by state prisoners. Federal courts are now barred from granting a writ of habeas corpus to such individuals unless the underlying adjudication:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). The Massachusetts Appeals Court did not determine any facts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> so we need analyze its decision only under subsection (1), i.e., we must decide whether it was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we addressed this provision at length in O'Brien v. DuBois, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197969\"><a href=\"/opinion/197969/obrien-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1998), we held that the provision requires a two step inquiry. \"First, the habeas court asks whether the Supreme Court has prescribed a rule that governs the petitioner's claim. If so, the habeas court gauges whether the state court decision is 'contrary to' the governing rule.\" Id. at 24. If petitioner does not obtain relief under the \"contrary to\" prong, the inquiry shifts to the second step where the habeas court must decide whether the state decision is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. See id. In O'Brien, we found no Court precedent sufficiently on point to justify review under the \"contrary to\" prong, so we proceeded to evaluate the claim under the \"unreasonable application\" clause. See id. at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts argues that if a claim can be analyzed under the first prong, the court is not allowed to reach the second step in the analysis. As we shall demonstrate, this is simply incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial challenge in applying this statutory language is in determining precisely how similar the case must be to Supreme Court precedent to justify \"contrary to\" analysis. Quite obviously, the closer a case is to the factual and legal posture of a given Supreme Court decision, the easier it is to say that the Supreme Court has prescribed a governing rule, thereby triggering the \"contrary to\" clause. However, precise identicality of facts and legal issues is not required, for, if it were, no cases would be analyzed under the \"contrary to\" prong. Therefore, we commented that some \"Supreme Court holdings are 'general' in the sense that they erect a framework specifically intended for application to variant factual situations.\" Id. at 25. In a footnote by way of example we cited a number of familiar cases that would fit this mold, including Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1984), for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel. When a petitioner raised such a \"framework\" legal claim, we held that Court precedent \"sufficiently shape[d] the contours of . . . appropriate analysis . . . to merit review of a state court's decision under section 2254(d)(1)'s 'contrary to' prong.\" O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that \"framework\" claims may be analyzed under the \"contrary to\" clause does not, however, obviate the need also to apply the \"unreasonable application\" clause as well. Rather, O'Brien held that relief under the \"contrary to\" prong requires both: (1) identification of controlling Court precedent, whether a \"framework\" case like Strickland or not; and (2) a ruling that the identified precedent demands a particular outcome, i.e., one contrary to that reached by the state court. Specifically, we stated that the \"key inquiry\" was whether the relevant Supreme Court decision \"can fairly be said to require a particular result in a particular case.\" Id. (emphasis added). \"If no Supreme Court precedent is dispositive of a petitioner's claim, then, a fortiori, there is no specific rule to which the state court's decision can be 'contrary.'\" Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the petitioner may succeed under the \"contrary to\" clause only if Supreme Court caselaw directly governs the claim and the state court got it wrong. The case is not over, however, if the state court decision cannot be termed \"contrary to\" Court precedent. Instead, just as in cases where there is no specific rule on point, we must assess whether it is an \"unreasonable application\" of the Court's pronouncements. Admittedly, in certain cases, especially those involving non-\"framework\" claims, Court precedent will be sufficiently specific that petitioner's claim will either be contrary to or entirely consonant with the Court's rulings. If the state decision is consistent with the relevant Court decision, it plainly would not be an unreasonable application of Court precedent. Therefore, the federal court will be able to dispatch swiftly any argument under the second step of analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say this, however, is not to say that the second step analysis is unnecessary, for unless a habeas court grants relief under the \"contrary to\" prong, it will be required to analyze the petitioner's claim under the \"unreasonable application\" prong as well. To rule otherwise would be to ignore the word \"or\" in the statute limiting our power to grant the writ if the state decision was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\" federal law. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. PETITIONER'S CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the merits of Vieux's appeal. Vieux's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is analyzed under the familiar Strickland rubric, which requires Vieux to prove that his counsel's performance both was deficient and prejudiced his defense. See United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755141\"><a href=\"/opinion/755141/united-states-v-reynaldo-jeremias-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir. 1998). Obviously, counsel's performance was not deficient if he declined to pursue a futile tactic. See United States v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354307\"><a href=\"/opinion/354307/united-states-v-henry-j-wright-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span>, 684 (1st Cir. 1978) (\"Counsel is not required to waste the court's time with futile or frivolous motions.\"). The Massachusetts Appeals Court ruled that Vieux's counsel was not deficient because any objection on the basis of the federal wiretapping statute would have been overruled by the trial court. Consequently, the court denied his claim under Strickland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by noting that the Massachusetts Appeals Court conducted a proper Strickland analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> It identified both essential elements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and properly recognized that \"failing to pursue a futile tactic does not amount to constitutional ineffectiveness.\" Commonwealth v. Vieux, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></span>, 990 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996). So long as its underlying reasoning, i.e., that the objection would have been unsuccessful, was not \"contrary to, or [did not] involve[] an unreasonable application of\" Supreme Court precedent, we are powerless to grant the writ. We turn, then, to whether an objection would have been futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In relevant part, the federal wiretapping statute outlaws the unauthorized use of \"any electronic, mechanical, or other device\" to intercept a telephone conversation. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(b). The statute also prohibits courts from receiving any such illegally intercepted telephone conversations into evidence at trial. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2515. At issue is whether Marquise's telephone extension constitutes an \"electronic, mechanical or other device.\" The statute defines that term as \"any device . . . other than . . . any telephone . . . being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business[.]\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(5). Consequently, if Marquise was using the phone in the ordinary course of her business, she did not illegally intercept Vieux's alleged comment. On the other hand, if she was not using the phone in the ordinary course of her business, then her eavesdropping constituted the use of \"any electronic, mechanical or other device,\" and the trial court would have been barred from allowing the statement she overheard into evidence. Under this scenario, any objection on this basis should have been successful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Appeals Court conducted an extensive survey of the caselaw interpreting the contours of the \"ordinary course of business\" exception. See Commonwealth v. Vieux, 671 N.E.2d at 991-993. Because the first step of our review centers on whether the state decision was contrary to only those cases decided by the Supreme Court, we focus our inquiry there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the scope of the \"ordinary course of business\" exception. It has considered the statute on a number of occasions, but most decisions involve the authority of law enforcement personnel to wiretap criminal suspects. See, e.g., United States v. Ojeda Rios, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112421\"><a href=\"/opinion/112421/united-states-v-ojeda-rios/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span> (1990) (discussing the requirement that law enforcement seal tapes of authorized interceptions); Dalia v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110061\"><a href=\"/opinion/110061/dalia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span> (1979) (holding that electronic surveillance statute granted courts the power to allow government agents to enter private premises covertly). In his attempt to argue that the state decision was contrary to Supreme Court caselaw, Vieux cites two cases: Gelbard v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108596\"><a href=\"/opinion/108596/gelbard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span> (1972), and United States v. Giordano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109020\"><a href=\"/opinion/109020/united-states-v-giordano/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span> (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in Gelbard was a witness's attempt to invoke the statute to refuse to testify before a grand jury because any testimony would be based on illegally intercepted conversations. In the course of allowing this claim as a defense to the witness's contempt proceeding, the Court stated that unless \"expressly authorized in [the statute] . . . all interceptions of wire and oral communications are flatly prohibited.\" Gelbard, 408 U.S. at 46. Vieux relies heavily on this simple statement in his attempt to convince us that Marquise's eavesdropping was improper. He neglects to acknowledge, however, that the use of a telephone in the \"ordinary course of business\" does not fall within the definition of a prohibited intercepting device, and anything overheard therefore would not be an interception. The quotation provides no assistance in resolving the issue before us and instead begs the question. No other language in Gelbard indicates in any way whether Marquise's eavesdropping should fall within the \"ordinary course of business\" exception or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giordano provides equally little ammunition for Vieux's challenge. Giordano involved a motion to suppress evidence because the authority for a given wiretap did not come from one of the officials empowered to authorize electronic surveillance under the statute. Again Vieux highlights the Court's sweeping language, namely that \"[t]he purpose of the legislation . . . was effectively to prohibit . . . all interceptions of oral and wire communications, except those specifically provided for in the Act,\" most notably law enforcement personnel acting under a court order. Giordano, 416 U.S. at 514. And again, the quote fails to address the underlying question of whether Marquise's eavesdropping was not an interception because she used an extension telephone in the ordinary course of her business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence the Supreme Court has not ruled directly on the scope of the ordinary business exception, and its more general pronouncements provide no guidance as to whether Marquise's eavesdropping was done in the \"ordinary course of business.\" Consequently, we cannot say that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision that counsel was not deficient because the objection would be futile was \"contrary to\" Supreme Court caselaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus proceed to the second step of the inquiry: whether the state court ruling was an \"unreasonable application\" of the Court's precedent. As we said in O'Brien, the issue \"reduces to a question of whether the state court's derivation of a case-specific rule from the Court's generally relevant jurisprudence appears objectively reasonable.\" O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25. To find the state decision unreasonable, it must be \"so offensive to existing precedent, so devoid of record support, or so arbitrary, as to indicate that it is outside the universe of plausible, credible outcomes.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In divining the reasonableness of the Appeals Court's decision, we start by noting that the scope of the \"ordinary course of business\" exception has been the subject of a significant split in authority.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Relying on legislative history concerning the extensive use of electronic surveillance in marital disputes, some courts have ruled that the intra-family use of an extension phone does not fall within the ordinary course of business exception, and hence any conversation heard by some family members when eavesdropping on other family members is inadmissible in court. See, e.g., Kempf v. Kempf, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518914\"><a href=\"/opinion/518914/jillian-kempf-v-karl-gene-kempf/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span>, 973 (8th Cir. 1989) (holding that no exception exists under federal wiretapping statute for instances of willful, unconsented-to electronic surveillance between spouses); Pritchard v. Pritchard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434689\"><a href=\"/opinion/434689/donald-ray-pritchard-v-zee-warren-pritchard/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 374 (4th Cir. 1984) (same); United States v. Jones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339314\"><a href=\"/opinion/339314/united-states-v-william-allan-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 673 (6th Cir. 1976) (finding that the plain language of the statute and its legislative history compel the interpretation that the act includes interspousal wiretaps).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts, concerned about intruding on intra-family matters better left to state law, have ruled that eavesdropping by family members on an extension telephone falls within the ordinary course of the family member's business and thus is not outlawed by the federal electronic surveillance statute. See, e.g., Scheib v. Grant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668274\"><a href=\"/opinion/668274/lynn-a-scheib-benjamin-grosse-a-minor-by-lynn-ann-scheib-his-next/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 153-4 (7th Cir. 1994) (finding that father's monitoring and recording conversations between his child and his ex-wife was encompassed within the ordinary course of business exception); Newcomb v.

The Massachusetts Appeals Court's conclusion that an objection under the federal wiretapping statute would have been overruled was therefore not an \"unreasonable application\" of federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be clear. We are not deciding that, were the question presented to us, Marquise's use of the telephone extension was done in the ordinary course of business and thus was exempted from the federal wiretapping statute's restrictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Rather, we are holding only that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision to that effect was not \"contrary to\" or \"an unreasonable application of\" federal law. Consequently, its decision that Vieux's lawyer was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object on that basis was equally not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Vieux wants us to announce our views as to the scope of the ordinary business exception, and then apply the result, if favorable to him, to his trial in state court three years ago. We refuse to do so. As we said in O'Brien,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Teague taught that, apart from the Supreme Court, federal habeas courts ought not act as innovators in the field of criminal procedure, thereby upsetting state convictions because state courts were not prescient and thus failed to comply with federal law that did not exist at the time they ruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 23. This case falls precisely within that restriction. When confronted with Vieux's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the Massachusetts Appeals Court issued a decision that cannot be deemed unreasonable in light of a healthy debate among a number of courts. We are powerless to grant Vieux's subsequent petition for the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Vieux claims that the Massachusetts Appeals Court engaged in improper factfinding when it described Marquise's motivation as \"concern for her sister.\" Commonwealth v. Vieux, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></span>, 993 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996). At trial Marquise had stated that she was listening in because she \"wanted to know what was going on.\" We do not read the court's language as being a determination of the facts, but rather a fair characterization of the trial testimony. Nevertheless, to the degree that interpreting Marquise's comment as \"concern for her sister\" does constitute a factual determination, we find that the Appeals Court's decision was not unreasonable under &#167; 2254(d)(2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although, as we noted in O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25 and n.6, Strickland v. Washington sets up a \"framework\" for analysis of ineffective assistance of counsel claims under section 2254(d)(1)'s \"contrary to\" prong, we also noted that it would be a rare case that could be said to forge a contrary rule. Moreover, whether counsel's assistance was ineffective depends on whether failure to object was deficient. This, in turn, depends on whether precedent from the Supreme Court or its surrogate, relevant lower court jurisprudence, has clearly barred an \"ordinary course of business\" exception to the wiretapping statute in similar circumstances.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  As we said in O'Brien, notwithstanding the statutory emphasis on Supreme Court caselaw, \"reference to [factually similar decisions by inferior federal courts] is appropriate in assessing the reasonableness vel non of the state court's treatment of the contested issue.\" O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This case demonstrates precisely why claims must be analyzed under both the \"contrary to\" and the \"unreasonable application\" prongs. Hypothetically speaking, if all courts, in applying the Supreme Court's broad language, had determined that intra-family eavesdropping was a violation of the federal wiretapping statute, it is more likely that we would have found the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision to be unreasonable, even though not actually \"contrary to\" the Court's pronouncements. This possibility arises entirely as a consequence of O'Brien's appropriate statement permitting habeas courts to consider decisions by other inferior federal courts in the course of assessing whether the state decision was an unreasonable application of Court caselaw.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> However, were the question, in fact, squarely before us, we note that this case, involving statements regarding an alleged crime against another family member, wouldn't be so close a question as one that fell within the scope of Congress's concern about evidence from wiretaps being used in marital disputes.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> While the Massachusetts Appeals court did not reach the issue, we note, only in passing, that we believe Vieux also failed to establish prejudice, the other Strickland element. He claims that Marquise's testimony prejudiced him because it depicted him as cruel and insensitive. However, he himself had testified that during one of the phone calls he had turned on the speaker phone for the amusement of the other mechanics in the shop. This act alone demonstrated his callous nature; any harm from Marquise's eavesdropping was merely cumulative. Consequently, he has not shown that the failure to object to Marquise's testimony actually prejudiced his defense.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
