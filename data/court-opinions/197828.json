The  plaintiff-appellant,\r                    DICLERICO,  District Judge.\r                                              \r\n\nYvonne Gil Bonar  de Rebollo, was injured  by defendant-appellee,\r\n\nWes Lockard, who  portrays \"Burnie,\" the mascot  of co-defendant-\r\n\nappellee, Miami Heat Limited Partnership.1  The plaintiff brought\r\n\na tort action  seeking damages.   In  the first  trial, the  jury\r\n\nawarded the plaintiff $10,000 but  the trial court found that the\r\n\nverdict was most likely  the result of bias or compromise and set\r\n\nit aside.  After a  second trial, the jury awarded the  plaintiff\r\n\n$50,000.  The  district court also  awarded the defendants  costs\r\n\nwhich they incurred after an offer  of judgment had been made and\r\n\nawarded costs  to the plaintiff  as a prevailing party.   In this\r\n\nappeal, the plaintiff  contends that she should have been granted\r\n\na third trial because the  $50,000 damage award was  insufficient\r\n\nand  the trial  judge  improperly excluded  evidence.   In  their\r\n\ncross-appeal,  the defendants contend that (1) the district court\r\n\nerred in granting  a second trial;  (2) given  the fact that  the\r\n\nplaintiff ultimately received less than the amount the defendants\r\n\nhad  proposed in  an  offer  of judgment,  they  are entitled  to\r\n\nattorney's fees incurred after the offer; and (3) the trial court\r\n\nshould not  have awarded the  plaintiff costs  incurred after  an\r\n\noffer   of  judgment.    We   agree  with  the  district  court's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Florida Basketball Associates, Inc. is also a defendant to the\r\naction.  The record does  not make clear the relationship between\r\ndefendant Miami  Heat Limited  Partnership and  defendant Florida\r\nBasketball   Associates,   Inc.,  but   the   parties  have   not\r\ndistinguished  between  them  on appeal.    Therefore,  the court\r\nrefers   to  the  Miami  Heat  Limited  Partnership  and  Florida\r\nBasketball Associates,  Inc.  throughout the  remainder  of  this\r\nopinion collectively as \"the Heat.\"\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ndisposition of the case in all respects with the exception of its\r\n\nruling awarding costs to the plaintiff incurred after an offer of\r\n\njudgment.  Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\n                Factual and Procedural Background2\r                          Factual and Procedural Background\r                                                           \r\n\n          On   October  21,  1994,   the  plaintiff  attended  an\r\n\nexhibition basketball game between the Miami Heat and the Atlanta\r\n\nHawks at the Roberto  Clemente Coliseum.  She  was seated in  the\r\n\nfront  row as  part of  a group  that had  received complementary\r\n\ntickets to  the game.   She had attended another  exhibition game\r\n\nunder similar circumstances the prior year.\r\n\n          During  a  time-out,  defendant  Lockard,  dressed   as\r\n\nBurnie, approached  the plaintiff and  grabbed her hand.   He had\r\n\nselected her at random to participate  in a routine he planned to\r\n\nperform as  entertainment during the time-out.  When he attempted\r\n\nto pull her onto the floor, she  resisted and loudly told him no.\r\n\nHe persisted, however, grabbing her  left arm with both hands and\r\n\npulling, because in his experience people often were reluctant at\r\n\nfirst  but  later changed  their  minds.   Unbeknownst  to either\r\n\nparty, the  plaintiff's purse strap  had fallen over the  back of\r\n\nher seat  and was  providing additional  resistance to  Lockard's\r\n\nefforts.  He pulled the  plaintiff with such force, however, that\r\n\nher purse strap broke and as a result she surged forward, falling\r\n\nto the  floor.  Lockard took the plaintiff's sudden movement as a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Because the plaintiff  has challenged the sufficiency  of the\r\ndamages awarded by the second  jury, the court recounts the facts\r\nrelevant to damages  in the light most favorable  to the verdict.\r\nSee Molloy v. Blanchard, 115 F.3d 86, 88 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                                 \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nsign  that  she had  changed  her  mind about  participating  and\r\n\ndragged her by the  arm to the center of the court.   When he saw\r\n\nthat the plaintiff still did not wish to participate, he  did not\r\n\nfurther coerce her.   She stood up, composed  herself, and walked\r\n\noff  the  court  while  he  completed the  routine  alone.    The\r\n\nplaintiff was extremely  upset by the incident and  left the game\r\n\nprior  to  its  conclusion.   She  felt  as though  she  had been\r\n\nhumiliated in front of the entire crowd.\r\n\n          The plaintiff suffered both  physically and emotionally\r\n\nas a result of  the incident.  She felt pain in  her left arm and\r\n\nshoulder as well as pain to a lesser extent  throughout her body.\r\n\nShe also  suffered a  bruise on  her left  thigh.   She did  not,\r\n\nhowever,  break  any  bones or  suffer  any  neurological damage.\r\n\nAfter arriving  at home, the  plaintiff took pain  medication and\r\n\napplied ointment to her body.  A few days later, she consulted an\r\n\northopedist and  a physiatrist  in connection  with her  physical\r\n\ninjuries.     She  undertook  physical  therapy  which  had  been\r\n\nprescribed   for  her.    Surgery  was  neither  recommended  nor\r\n\nundertaken.\r\n\n          The plaintiff  has been  diagnosed with  post-traumatic\r\n\ntendonitis in her left shoulder,  the primary symptom of which is\r\n\npain.   She  continues  to experience  pain in  her left  arm and\r\n\nshoulder,   which  affects  her  when  she  engages  in  everyday\r\n\nactivities.  The  plaintiff takes  pain medication  on a  regular\r\n\nbasis, and her condition is not expected to improve further.  The\r\n\nplaintiff's condition has required her  to modify her behavior in\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\norder  to avoid  tasks and  activities that  will exacerbate  the\r\n\npain,   particularly  heavy   lifting   and  certain   repetitive\r\n\nmovements.  However, she has a pre-existing condition in her back\r\n\nthat  also  periodically  causes  her  pain  for  which  she  had\r\n\npreviously sought treatment.  This pre-existing condition imposed\r\n\nsimilar restrictions on her ability to perform certain activities\r\n\nsuch as lifting heavy objects.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff consulted  with a  psychiatrist  for her\r\n\nemotional  distress.    She  feels  that  the  event  has  had  a\r\n\nprofoundly  negative effect  on her  mental  and emotional  well-\r\n\nbeing,   which  she  attributes   in  part  to   her  traditional\r\n\nconservative  upbringing.  The  plaintiff avoids large gatherings\r\n\nand feels that  her privacy and dignity have been  injured by the\r\n\nincident.   She now takes  anti-anxiety medications on  a regular\r\n\nbasis.    The  defendants' expert  testified  that  the emotional\r\n\ndifficulties experienced by the plaintiff were not permanent, but\r\n\ninstead  represented a normal  reaction to an  adverse situation.\r\n\nExperts for  both parties  agree that  the plaintiff's  condition\r\n\ndoes  not  rise  to  the  level  of  a  recognized  psychological\r\n\ndisorder.   In addition to  the distress caused by  the incident,\r\n\nthe  plaintiff  had pre-existing  emotional  stressors, including\r\n\nmarital difficulty, that could account for some of her dysphoria.\r\n\n          Subsequent  to  the  incident,  the  plaintiff  brought\r\n\ncriminal charges against Lockard.   She felt the need to confront\r\n\nthe people  who she  felt  had wronged  her.   Lockard was  found\r\n\nguilty of misdemeanor  battery.  The plaintiff  also brought this\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ncivil  action  against  both  Lockard  and  the  Heat,  Lockard's\r\n\nemployer.   Her claim, brought pursuant  to the court's diversity\r\n\njurisdiction, alleged that Lockard had negligently injured her in\r\n\nviolation  of Puerto  Rico law  and that  the Heat,  as Lockard's\r\n\nemployer, was responsible for that injury.\r\n\n          Prior to the  civil trial, the  trial court ruled  that\r\n\nevidence   of  Lockard's  criminal  conviction  would  be  unduly\r\n\nprejudicial and precluded the plaintiff  from introducing it.  On\r\n\nOctober  30, 1996,  the plaintiff's  case went  to trial  for the\r\n\nfirst  time.   After  approximately  one  and one-half  hours  of\r\n\ndeliberation, the  jury  returned  a  verdict in  the  amount  of\r\n\n$100,000 in  favor of the plaintiff,  but it found  only the Heat\r\n\nliable and  not Lockard.   The trial  judge rejected  the verdict\r\n\nbecause  the plaintiff  had pursued  only a theory  of respondeat\r\n\nsuperior liability against the Heat,  and thus the Heat could not\r\n\nhave been found  liable unless Lockard was  liable as well.   The\r\n\njudge  reinstructed  the  jury  on the  issue  of  liability  and\r\n\ndirected it to continue deliberating.\r\n\n          After another hour,  the jury sent a note  to the court\r\n\nrequesting  guidance  on  the  amount  of  damages  to which  the\r\n\nplaintiff was entitled.   The trial judge instructed  the jury to\r\n\nreview  the instruction on  damages the court  had already given.\r\n\nThe  jury deliberated  for approximately  another  hour and  then\r\n\nreturned a  verdict that held  both Lockard and the  Heat liable.\r\n\nHowever, the jury awarded the plaintiff only $10,000 in damages.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          The plaintiff  filed a motion  for a new trial  and for\r\n\nrelief from judgment on November 14, 1996.  On December 16, 1996,\r\n\nthe  district  court ruled  that  the  jury's  verdict  was  most\r\n\nprobably an impermissible verdict based on compromise or bias and\r\n\ngranted a  new trial.   See  Gil de  Rebollo v.  Miami Heat  Ltd.\r                                                                           \r\n\nPartnership, 949  F. Supp.  62, 64-65 (D.P.R.  1996).   The trial\r                     \r\n\ncourt  reasoned  that three  possibilities  explained the  jury's\r\n\nreduction  of the  damage award  to one-tenth  the figure  it had\r\n\nselected  initially:     (1)   the  jury   may  have   rationally\r\n\nreconsidered its  decision on  damages when it  was sent  back to\r\n\ndeliberate  further;  (2)  the  jury  may  have  thought  Lockard\r\n\nunaccountable for his  interaction with the plaintiff  but wanted\r\n\nto compensate her anyway from the corporate deep pocket, and when\r\n\nconfronted with the requirements of respondeat superior, the jury\r\n\nlowered the amount of damages  which Lockard might be required to\r\n\npay, reflecting an improper compromise;  or (3) the jury may have\r\n\nthought  that the  plaintiff had  suffered  $100,000 damages  but\r\n\ntried to shield Lockard from having to pay because of an improper\r\n\nbias in  his  favor, and  when it  realized it  could not  shield\r\n\nLockard,  it  lowered the  amount  of  the  verdict so  that  his\r\n\nliability would be  minimized.  See id.  at 64.  The  court found\r                                                 \r\n\nthat the latter two alternatives, both improper, were more likely\r\n\nthan the first, which was proper,  and granted a new trial.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at 65.\r             \r\n\n          The  second trial commenced  on February 10,  1997.  On\r\n\nFebruary 14, 1997, the jury returned  a verdict for the plaintiff\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nin the  amount of $50,000, finding that both Lockard and the Heat\r\n\nwere liable.  The plaintiff again filed a motion for a new trial,\r\n\nasserting that the damages were insufficient, but the trial court\r\n\ndenied the motion.\r\n\n          During the course  of the litigation, the  parties made\r\n\nseveral attempts  to settle their  dispute without a trial.   The\r\n\nplaintiff's initial  demand in the  case was for $1,000,000.   On\r\n\nOctober 7, 1996, the defendants  made a written offer of judgment\r\n\nunder  Federal Rule  of Civil  Procedure 68  (\"Rule 68\")  to have\r\n\njudgment  entered against  them in  the amount  of $80,000.   The\r\n\nplaintiff  rejected the  offer  and countered  with  a demand  of\r\n\n$600,000  and a  public apology.   The  defendants  rejected this\r\n\nproposal and the first trial began on October 30, 1996.\r\n\n          After the  first trial,  the defendants  made a  second\r\n\noffer of judgment  on January 14, 1997, in the amount of $70,000.\r\n\nThe plaintiff rejected  the offer and countered with  a demand of\r\n\n$250,000, which  the defendants rejected.   On January  23, 1997,\r\n\nthe defendants made a  third offer of judgment  in the amount  of\r\n\n$100,000.   The  plaintiff also  rejected  that offer,  demanding\r\n\n$180,000.  The  $50,000 verdict obtained by the  plaintiff in the\r\n\nsecond trial was less than all three offers of judgment.\r\n\n          After  the second trial, the district court awarded the\r\n\ndefendants  $8,271.71 for  costs  incurred  after  the  offer  of\r\n\njudgment pursuant to Rule 68.   It denied the defendants' request\r\n\nfor attorney's  fees under  Puerto Rico Rule  of Civil  Procedure\r\n\n44.1 (\"Rule 44.1\"), finding that  the plaintiff had not conducted\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nher case with temerity.  The court awarded the plaintiff costs as\r\n\na prevailing  party under Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure  54 in\r\n\nthe amount of $7,894.84.\r\n\n          At  the  conclusion   of  this  legal  imbroglio,   the\r\n\nplaintiff filed  a timely  appeal.   The  defendants have  raised\r\n\nseveral issues on cross-appeal.\r\n\n                            Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          The parties raise the following  issues on appeal:  (1)\r\n\nthe defendants  claim that the trial court  abused its discretion\r\n\nby  setting aside  the $10,000  verdict  in the  first trial  and\r\n\ngranting a new  trial; (2) the plaintiff asserts  that the jury's\r\n\nverdict  of $50,000 damages in  the second trial was insufficient\r\n\nand the trial court therefore abused its discretion by failing to\r\n\ngrant her motion for a third trial; (3) the plaintiff claims that\r\n\nthe  trial  court  impermissibly excluded  evidence  of Lockard's\r\n\ncriminal misdemeanor  conviction; and  (4) the  defendants assert\r\n\nthat the  trial court  erred in  its award  of costs  and in  its\r\n\nfailure  to award  attorney's  fees.    We discuss  these  claims\r\n\nseriatim.\r                  \r\n\n          I.  Grant of the Second Trial\r                                                 \r\n\n          The  trial court granted  the plaintiff's motion  for a\r\n\nsecond trial  after it  found that the  jury possibly  could have\r\n\nproperly reconsidered  the amount of  damages to be  awarded, but\r\n\nmore likely  had acted  for an improper  reason.   The defendants\r\n\nargue that  the  trial court  should  have accepted  the  $10,000\r\n\nverdict and  erred by granting  the plaintiff's motion for  a new\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ntrial.   The  court, they  urge,  should not  have endeavored  to\r\n\nchoose among the  possible explanations for the  jury's behavior.\r\n\nAs  long as  there was  a  plausible explanation  for the  jury's\r\n\nconduct that was  permissible, the defendants contend,  the trial\r\n\ncourt should not have granted a new trial.\r\n\n          This  argument is unpersuasive.

Trueblood,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 915  F.2d 764,  766 (1st  Cir. 1990)  (denial of new  trial\r              \r\n\nreviewed  only  for abuse  of  discretion).   As  the  defendants\r\n\nacknowledge, First Circuit precedent  distinguishes between cases\r\n\nwhere a jury's verdict is challenged  as improper based only on a\r\n\ndamage  award that allegedly fails to  bear any rational relation\r\n\nto the  evidence of  the damages presented  at trial,  see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nCorrea v.

Where the allegation of  an improper verdict\r\n\nis  based  solely  on  the   amount  of  the  damage  award,  the\r\n\ncircumstances under which  a trial court  may overturn a  verdict\r\n\nare  more limited.   See,  e.g., CIGNA  Fire Underwriters  Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMacDonald &amp;  Johnson, Inc.,  86 F.3d 1260,  1267 (1st  Cir. 1996)\r                                    \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n(grant  of a  new  trial appropriate  where  damages were  easily\r\n\ncalculable and  damage award  exceeded maximum  value of  damages\r\n\nclaimed and did not take into account offset to damages); Torres-\r                                                                           \r\n\nTroche v.

However, where evidence of an\r\n\nimproper verdict exists other than  the amount of the jury award,\r\n\nsuch as when a jury  answers special questions in an inconsistent\r\n\nmanner,  the trial  court's discretion  to grant  a new  trial is\r\n\nbroader.   In  such  cases the  court  can  consider all  of  the\r\n\ncircumstances  surrounding  the  jury's  verdict,  including  the\r\n\namount of  the damage  award, in determining  whether or  not the\r\n\njury reached an improper verdict.  See Phav, 915 F.2d at 768-69.3\r                                                     \r\n\n          The  defendants  acknowledge  the  distinction  between\r\n\ncases  where the  only evidence  of  a compromise  verdict is  an\r\n\nallegedly insufficient  damage award  and cases  where additional\r\n\nevidence indicates a  compromise, but they  attempt to cast  this\r\n\ncase as falling into the  former rather than the latter category.\r\n\nHowever, in  this case the  trial court's  determination did  not\r\n\nturn solely on the amount of the verdict that the jury ultimately\r\n\nreturned.   Rather,  the ten-fold  reduction by  the jury  of its\r\n\ninitial  award of damages  and the circumstances  surrounding its\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3    Prior First  Circuit  cases,  however,  do not  endorse  the\r\nproposition  propounded  by  the  defendants that  an  inadequate\r\ndamage award is an indispensable element of a compromise verdict.\r\nSee Phav,  915 F.2d at  768-69 (inadequate damages  are potential\r                  \r\nevidence of compromise verdict, as are additional factors).\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ndetermination of Lockard's liability  provided the primary  basis\r\n\nfor  the trial court's determination that  the verdict as finally\r\n\nreturned was motivated  by compromise or  sympathy.  The  verdict\r\n\nform ultimately  completed by the  jury was free of  any internal\r\n\ninconsistency  because it  held Lockard  and the Heat  liable for\r\n\n$10,000 damages suffered by the plaintiff.  However, the sequence\r\n\nof events preceding  that verdict was properly considered  by the\r\n\ntrial court  as an indication  that the jury reached  the verdict\r\n\nbased on compromise or  bias.  See id. at 768  (odd chronology of\r                                                \r\n\njury  deliberations one \"telltale sign of a compromise verdict\").\r\n\nTherefore,  the trial  court had  more latitude  in this  case in\r\n\nexercising its discretion  to overturn the jury's verdict than it\r\n\nwould have had in a case where the only basis  for the grant of a\r\n\nnew trial  was the alleged insufficiency of  a damage award.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMekdici, 711 F.2d  at 1513, cited with approval in Phav, 915 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 768.\r\n\n          The  trial court determined that the sequence of events\r\n\nleading up to the  jury's final verdict in  the first trial  most\r\n\nlikely   indicated  that  the   jury  had  reached   its  verdict\r\n\nimproperly.  The jury initially had assessed $100,000  in damages\r\n\nagainst the Heat but  did not find Lockard liable.   A short time\r\n\nafter  being told to deliberate further and requesting additional\r\n\nguidance the  jury determined that Lockard was liable but reduced\r\n\nthe amount of damages to $10,000.   Based on the jury's behavior,\r\n\nit  was logical  for the trial  court to  conclude that  the jury\r\n\nwanted to  give the  plaintiff something but  it did not  want to\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nhold Lockard personally liable for a $100,000 award.  There is no\r\n\nindication  that the  trial  judge, who  observed the  trial, the\r\n\ntiming of the  questions, and the  results of the  deliberations,\r\n\nabused  his discretion in  arriving at this  determination.4  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nPhav, 915 F.2d  at 766.   We  therefore decline  to overturn  the\r              \r\n\ntrial court and to reinstate the initial $10,000 verdict.\r\n\n          II.  Insufficiency of the Jury Verdict\r                                                          \r\n\n          The plaintiff's main  contention on appeal is  that the\r\n\ntrial court erred by failing to grant  her motion for a new trial\r\n\nfollowing  the second  verdict, on  the grounds  that the  damage\r\n\naward  of  $50,000  is  insufficient.   As  noted  above,  it  is\r\n\ncomparatively more  difficult  to justify  overturning  a  jury's\r\n\nverdict where the  only evidence that something has  gone awry is\r\n\nan allegedly  insufficient damages award.   Indeed, the  jury \"is\r\n\nfree to run the whole gamut  of euphonious notes -- to  harmonize\r\n\nthe verdict at the highest or lowest points for which there  is a\r\n\nsound evidentiary predicate, or anywhere in between -- so long as\r\n\nthe end result does  not violate the conscience  of the court  or\r\n\nstrike such a  dissonant chord that justice would  be denied were\r\n\nthe judgment permitted to stand.\"   Milone, 847 F.2d at 37.   \"At\r                                                    \r\n\nbest,  plaintiff's  verdicts  in personal  injury  cases  are not\r\n\nmodels  of  mathematical  exactitude.    Thus,  the fact  that  a\r\n\nparticular award  is a few dollars long or short would rarely (if\r\n\never) translate into a manifest  miscarriage of justice.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4    In  reaching  this  decision we  intend  no  comment  on the\r\nsufficiency of the $10,000 damage award.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n41 n.7.  We  view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\n\njury's verdict,  see Molloy  v. Blanchard, 115  F.3d 86,  88 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1997), and will only overturn the jury's award and the trial\r\n\njudge's  ensuing  refusal to  grant  a  new  trial for  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion, see Correa, 69 F.3d at 1197.\r                                \r\n\n          The  record  demonstrates  that  most  of  the  damages\r\n\nsuffered by the plaintiff were intangible.  \"An appellate court's\r\n\nnormal  disinclination to second-guess a jury's evaluation of the\r\n\nproper amount of damages is magnified where, as here, the damages\r\n\nentail a monetary  valuation of intangible losses,  and the trial\r\n\njudge, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, accepts\r\n\nthe  jury's  appraisal.\"   Id.   Even  accepting  the plaintiff's\r                                        \r\n\ncomplaints uncritically, which the jury  was not required to  do,\r\n\nher  primary claims  for damages  are that  (1) she  suffers from\r\n\npain; (2) the quality of her life has been reduced because of her\r\n\npain and because of the measures she must take to avoid pain; and\r\n\n(3) her  dignity, self-image, and  sense of well-being  have been\r\n\nadversely affected by the incident.\r\n\n          In addition to the intangible nature of the plaintiff's\r\n\ninjuries, the  evidence in this  case permitted the jury  to find\r\n\nthat her injuries  were not as severe  as she claimed.   The jury\r\n\ncould also have found that  most of the plaintiff's physical pain\r\n\nwas caused not by the incident in question but by the plaintiff's\r\n\nfailure to  obey her doctor's  orders not to move  heavy objects,\r\n\nwhich  orders were given in connection with her pre-existing back\r\n\ninjury.    The jury  was  free  to  disbelieve  as  much  of  the\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nplaintiff's expert and lay testimony as it wished.  In short, the\r\n\nplaintiff has  provided no support  for the proposition  that the\r\n\njury's $50,000 verdict was so  far beyond the range of acceptable\r\n\nverdicts, based  on  the evidence  presented  at trial,  that  it\r\n\nconstituted  a manifest  miscarriage of  justice.   The  district\r\n\ncourt did not abuse  its discretion by  denying her motion for  a\r\n\nnew trial.\r\n\n          III.  Failure to Admit Evidence of Lockard's Conviction\r                                                                           \r\n\n          The  trial  court  ruled  that  evidence  of  Lockard's\r\n\ncriminal  misdemeanor  conviction  was inadmissible  because  its\r\n\nprejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative  value.\r\n\nSee Fed.  R. Evid. 403.   The plaintiff asserts  that this ruling\r             \r\n\nwas error.  We review the district court's determination that the\r\n\nevidence  of Lockard's conviction  should have been  excluded for\r\n\nabuse of discretion.   See Kowalski v.  Gagne, 914 F.2d  299, 306\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          The plaintiff places undue reliance on Kowalski, a case\r                                                                   \r\n\nwhich stands  for the  proposition  that the  district court  has\r\n\ndiscretion  to admit evidence  such as this.   See  id.  However,\r                                                                 \r\n\nKowalski  does not  support  the notion  that the  district court\r                  \r\n\nabused  its discretion  in this  case  by failing  to admit  this\r\n\nevidence.  Indeed, as Kowalski makes clear,  the district court's\r                                        \r\n\ndecision  that the  evidence was  substantially more  prejudicial\r\n\nthan probative was well within its discretion.  See id.\r                                                                 \r\n\n          Here,  the   jurors  were  presented   with  sufficient\r\n\nevidence to gauge the seriousness  of Lockard's actions and their\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\neffect  on the  plaintiff.  In  addition to the  testimony of the\r\n\nplaintiff  and other  witnesses,  the episode  was recorded  by a\r\n\ntelevision camera and the tape was made available for the jury to\r\n\nwatch.   The parties  stipulated that Lockard  was portraying the\r\n\nmascot Burnie  throughout the  incident.  The  jury did  not need\r\n\nevidence of Lockard's criminal  conviction to assess his  role in\r\n\nthe  incident.  Under  the circumstances, admission  of Lockard's\r\n\ncriminal conviction would have allowed the jury to substitute the\r\n\njudgment reached in the criminal proceeding for its own.\r\n\n          Furthermore, even assuming  arguendo that the exclusion\r                                                        \r\n\nof the evidence was error, the error had no effect on the outcome\r\n\nof the  case.  The only  issue on which  Lockard's conviction was\r\n\nprobative was  the  issue of  his liability  for the  plaintiff's\r\n\ninjury.   Both  juries found  Lockard liable for  the plaintiff's\r\n\ninjuries.   Lockard's  conviction had  relevance  neither to  the\r\n\nissue of  the plaintiff's injuries  nor to the amount  of damages\r\n\nnecessary to compensate her for those injuries.\r\n\n          The   plaintiff's   reliance   on   Kowalski  for   the\r                                                                \r\n\nproposition that a criminal conviction is, as a matter of course,\r\n\nrelevant to  the issue of  damages in an  ensuing civil trial  is\r\n\nalso misplaced.   Kowalski  dealt with  a Massachusetts  wrongful\r                                    \r\n\ndeath statute  which provides  that damages  should be  \"assessed\r\n\nwith reference to  the degree of [the  defendant's] culpability.\"\r\n\n914 F.2d at 306.  For  that reason, the defendant's conviction of\r\n\nthe crime of  second degree murder  was relevant to the  issue of\r\n\nculpability,  and  thus the  issue  of  damages.   See  id.   The\r                                                                     \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nplaintiff's cause of  action here was for negligence  and she was\r\n\nentitled only  to compensatory damages.   For these  reasons, the\r\n\ndistrict court did  not abuse its discretion by  failing to admit\r\n\nevidence  of Lockard's  conviction,  and  the  plaintiff  is  not\r\n\nentitled to a new trial.\r\n\n          IV.  The Award of  Costs &amp; Failure to  Award Attorney's\r                                                                           \r\n               Fees\r                             \r\n\n          The trial court  awarded the defendants costs  incurred\r\n\nafter their  first offer  of judgment but  declined to  award the\r\n\ndefendants their  attorney's fees.   It found that  the plaintiff\r\n\nhad  not  been obstinate  at any  point in  the proceedings.   In\r\n\naddition, it awarded  the plaintiff costs as a  prevailing party.\r\n\nThe  defendants contend  that  (1) the  district  court erred  by\r\n\nfailing to  award attorney's  fees  incurred after  the offer  of\r\n\njudgment; (2) the  court erred in finding that  the plaintiff was\r\n\nnot obstinate  under Rule 44.1; and  (3) the court erred  when it\r\n\nawarded  the  plaintiff  costs  incurred  after  their  offer  of\r\n\njudgment.  We discuss these claims seriatim.\r                                                     \r\n\nA.  Attorney's Fees Incurred After the Offer of Judgment\r                                                                  \r\n\n          The trial  court declined the defendants'  request that\r\n\nthey  be awarded attorney's  fees that were  incurred after their\r\n\noffer of judgment.  The defendants assert that it was error to do\r\n\nso.  Resolution of this  issue requires that we carefully analyze\r\n\nthe  relationship between two  rules of civil  procedure, Federal\r\n\nRule  68 and  Puerto Rico  Rule  35.1, both  of which  ostensibly\r\n\ngovern the situation at hand.\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n          In  Erie Railroad  Co. v.  Tompkins,  the United  State\r                                                       \r\n\nSupreme Court  set forth the  general doctrine  by which  federal\r\n\ncourts in diversity  cases determine whether state or federal law\r\n\nwill apply to a controversy.   See 304 U.S. 64 (1938).   In Hanna\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

See  380  U.S. 460,  471\r                                                      \r\n\n(1965).  Where  a Federal Rule is \"sufficiently  broad to control\r\n\nthe  issue\" but conflicts with a state law, the court applies the\r\n\nFederal  Rule unless  it  transgresses the  limits  of the  Rules\r\n\nEnabling Act, 28 U.S.C.   2072, or the Constitution.

Early cases indicated the necessity for a\r\n\"direct collision.\"  See, e.g.,  Walker v.

Subsequent\r                                          \r\ncases make clear,  however, that the \"direct  collision\" analysis\r\ndoes not involve the narrowest  possible reading of the  relevant\r\nFederal Rule.  See Stewart, 487 U.S.  at 26 n.4; Walker, 446 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\nat  751  &amp;  n.9.

Therefore, when the\r\n\ndefinition   of  \"costs\"  in  the  relevant  substantive  statute\r\n\nincludes  attorney's  fees,  attorney's fees  incurred  after the\r\n\noffer of  judgment must  be paid by  the offeree.

See Marek, 473\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 9.  The substantive law underlying this action  is Puerto\r\n\nRico's law of negligence.  See P.R.

The defendants urge that\r\n\nthe  plaintiff's conduct  was obstinate  because  she refused  to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  Rule 44.1(d) provides that:\r\n\n            In  the event any  party or its  lawyer has\r\n          acted obstinately  or frivolously,  the court\r\n          shall, in its judgment, impose on such person\r\n          the  payment  of a  sum  for attorney's  fees\r\n          which the  court decides corresponds  to such\r\n          conduct.\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App. III, Rule 44.1(d) (Supp. 1992).\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\naccept  multiple  offers  of  judgment  which  they  assert  were\r\n\nreasonable.9  The fact that the plaintiff was  eventually awarded\r\n\nless than  the amount of  the offers, the defendants  contend, is\r\n\nevidence  of their reasonableness.   The  defendants ask  that we\r\n\nadopt a rule  that failure to accept  an offer of judgment,  when\r\n\nthe verdict at  trial turns  out to  be less than  the offer,  be\r\n\nconsidered obstinate per se.  \r                                     \r\n\n          The  presumption  requested  by  the  defendants  lacks\r\n\nsupport in Puerto  Rico law,  and we  decline to adopt  it.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court judge,  who  observed  the  proceedings  as  they\r\n\nunfolded, made  a finding that  the plaintiff was  not obstinate.\r\n\nBecause  we find  no evidence  that  the trial  judge abused  his\r\n\ndiscretion  in that  determination, we  decline  to overturn  the\r\n\ndistrict court on this issue.\r\n\nC.  Plaintiff's Expert Fees Incurred After the Offer of Judgment\r                                                                          \r\n\n          The  defendants finally contend that the court erred by\r\n\nawarding the  plaintiff expert fees  incurred after the  offer of\r\n\njudgment.  Such an award  expressly contravenes the terms of Rule\r\n\n68, which provides that, if an offer of  judgment is rejected and\r\n\n\"the  judgment  finally  obtained  by  the  offeree  is not  more\r\n\nfavorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred\r\n\nafter  the making  of the  offer.\"   Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  68.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  erred  in  making  this  award.    Although  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9   The defendants argue  that the plaintiff was  obstinate under\r\nthe standards of either Rule 44.1 or Rule 35.1.  However, because\r\nwe  have determined that Rule  35.1 does not  apply in this case,\r\nsee section  IV.A supra,  we consider  here only  the defendants'\r                                 \r\nargument with respect to Rule 44.1.\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nplaintiff did  not distinguish  between costs  incurred pre-  and\r\n\npost-offer,  the  defendants  have only  contested  the  award of\r\n\n$3,950 paid  for the testimony of two  experts at the two trials.\r\n\nBecause  such amounts were  clearly incurred  after the  offer of\r\n\njudgment  and  the  defendants  have  not  challenged  the  other\r\n\ncomponents of the trial court's initial award of costs, we reduce\r\n\nthe plaintiff's award of costs by that amount.\r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          To conclude,  we find the parties'  remaining arguments\r\n\nand claimed errors  to be without merit and  unworthy of extended\r\n\ndiscussion.   For the reasons  stated above, the judgment  of the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed as  to the grant of the  second trial,\r                            affirmed\r                                    \r\n\nthe exclusion of evidence of Lockard's conviction, the refusal to\r\n\ngrant a third trial, and the refusal to grant attorney's  fees as\r\n\npart of costs  incurred after the first  offer of judgment.   The\r\n\ndistrict court's award  to the plaintiff of costs  incurred after\r\n\nthe offer of judgment  in the amount  of $3,950 is reversed,  and\r                                                             reversed\r                                                                     \r\n\nthe plaintiff's award  of costs shall be reduced  by that amount.\r\n\nBecause the plaintiff's appeal was wholly without merit, costs of\r\n\nthe appeal are awarded to the defendants.\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n",

In the first trial, the jury awarded the plaintiff $10,000 but the trial court found that the verdict was most likely the result of bias or compromise and set it aside.  After a second trial, the jury awarded the plaintiff $50,000.  The district court also awarded the defendants costs which they incurred after an offer of judgment had been made and awarded costs to the plaintiff as a prevailing party.  In this appeal, the plaintiff contends that she should have been granted a third trial because the $50,000 damage award was insufficient and the trial judge improperly excluded evidence.  In their cross-appeal, the defendants contend that (1) the district court erred in granting a second trial;  (2) given the fact that the plaintiff ultimately received less than the amount the defendants had proposed in an offer of judgment, they are entitled to attorney's fees incurred after the offer;  and (3) the trial court should not have awarded the plaintiff costs incurred after an offer of judgment.  We agree with the district court's disposition of the case in all respects with the exception of its ruling awarding costs to the plaintiff incurred after an offer of judgment.  Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 21, 1994, the plaintiff attended an exhibition basketball game between the Miami Heat and the Atlanta Hawks at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum.  She was seated in the front row as part of a group that had received complementary tickets to the game.  She had attended another exhibition game under similar circumstances the prior year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a time-out, defendant Lockard, dressed as Burnie, approached the plaintiff and grabbed her hand.  He had selected her at random to participate in a routine he planned to perform as entertainment during the time-out.  When he attempted to pull her onto the floor, she resisted and loudly told him no.  He persisted, however, grabbing her left arm with both hands and pulling, because in his experience people often were reluctant at first but later changed their minds.  Unbeknownst to either party, the plaintiff's purse strap had fallen over the back of her seat and was providing additional resistance to Lockard's efforts.  He pulled the plaintiff with such force, however, that her purse strap broke and as a result she surged forward, falling to the floor.  Lockard took the plaintiff's sudden movement as a sign that she had changed her mind about participating and dragged her by the arm to the center of the court.  When he saw that the plaintiff still did not wish to participate, he did not further coerce her.  She stood up, composed herself, and walked off the court while he completed the routine alone.  The plaintiff was extremely upset by the incident and left the game prior to its conclusion.  She felt as though she had been humiliated in front of the entire crowd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff suffered both physically and emotionally as a result of the incident.  She felt pain in her left arm and shoulder as well as pain to a lesser extent throughout her body.  She also suffered a bruise on her left thigh.  She did not, however, break any bones or suffer any neurological damage.  After arriving at home, the plaintiff took pain medication and applied ointment to her body.  A few days later, she consulted an orthopedist and a physiatrist in connection with her physical injuries.  She undertook physical therapy which had been prescribed for her.  Surgery was neither recommended nor undertaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff has been diagnosed with post-traumatic tendonitis in her left shoulder, the primary symptom of which is pain.  She continues to experience pain in her left arm and shoulder, which affects her when she engages in everyday activities.  The plaintiff takes pain medication on a regular basis, and her condition is not expected to improve further.  The plaintiff's condition has required her to modify her behavior in order to avoid tasks and activities that will exacerbate the pain, particularly heavy lifting and certain repetitive movements.  However, she has a pre-existing condition in her back that also periodically causes her pain for which she had previously sought treatment.  This pre-existing condition imposed similar restrictions on her ability to perform certain activities such as lifting heavy objects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff consulted with a psychiatrist for her emotional distress.  She feels that the event has had a profoundly negative effect on her mental and emotional well-being, which she attributes in part to her traditional conservative upbringing.  The plaintiff avoids large gatherings and feels that her privacy and dignity have been injured by the incident.  She now takes anti-anxiety medications on a regular basis.  The defendants' expert testified that the emotional difficulties experienced by the plaintiff were not permanent, but instead represented a normal reaction to an adverse situation.  Experts for both parties agree that the plaintiff's condition does not rise to the level of a recognized psychological disorder.  In addition to the distress caused by the incident, the plaintiff had pre-existing emotional stressors, including marital difficulty, that could account for some of her dysphoria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to the incident, the plaintiff brought criminal charges against Lockard.  She felt the need to confront the people who she felt had wronged her.  Lockard was found guilty of misdemeanor battery.  The plaintiff also brought this civil action against both Lockard and the Heat, Lockard's employer.  Her claim, brought pursuant to the court's diversity jurisdiction, alleged that Lockard had negligently injured her in violation of Puerto Rico law and that the Heat, as Lockard's employer, was responsible for that injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the civil trial, the trial court ruled that evidence of Lockard's criminal conviction would be unduly prejudicial and precluded the plaintiff from introducing it.  On October 30, 1996, the plaintiff's case went to trial for the first time.  After approximately one and one-half hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $100,000 in favor of the plaintiff, but it found only the Heat liable and not Lockard.  The trial judge rejected the verdict because the plaintiff had pursued only a theory of respondeat superior liability against the Heat, and thus the Heat could not have been found liable unless Lockard was liable as well.  The judge reinstructed the jury on the issue of liability and directed it to continue deliberating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After another hour, the jury sent a note to the court requesting guidance on the amount of damages to which the plaintiff was entitled.  The trial judge instructed the jury to review the instruction on damages the court had already given.  The jury deliberated for approximately another hour and then returned a verdict that held both Lockard and the Heat liable.  However, the jury awarded the plaintiff only $10,000 in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial and for relief from judgment on November 14, 1996.  On December 16, 1996, the district court ruled that the jury's verdict was most probably an impermissible verdict based on compromise or bias and granted a new trial.  See Gil de Rebollo v. Miami Heat Ltd. Partnership, 949 F.Supp. 62, 64-65 (D.P.R.1996).  The trial court reasoned that three possibilities explained the jury's reduction of the damage award to one-tenth the figure it had selected initially:  (1) the jury may have rationally reconsidered its decision on damages when it was sent back to deliberate further;  (2) the jury may have thought Lockard unaccountable for his interaction with the plaintiff but wanted to compensate her anyway from the corporate deep pocket, and when confronted with the requirements of respondeat superior, the jury lowered the amount of damages which Lockard might be required to pay, reflecting an improper compromise;  or (3) the jury may have thought that the plaintiff had suffered $100,000 damages but tried to shield Lockard from having to pay because of an improper bias in his favor, and when it realized it could not shield Lockard, it lowered the amount of the verdict so that his liability would be minimized.  See id. at 64.   The court found that the latter two alternatives, both improper, were more likely than the first, which was proper, and granted a new trial.  See id. at 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second trial commenced on February 10, 1997.  On February 14, 1997, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $50,000, finding that both Lockard and the Heat were liable.  The plaintiff again filed a motion for a new trial, asserting that the damages were insufficient, but the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the litigation, the parties made several attempts to settle their dispute without a trial.  The plaintiff's initial demand in the case was for $1,000,000.  On October 7, 1996, the defendants made a written offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (\"Rule 68\") to have judgment entered against them in the amount of $80,000.  The plaintiff rejected the offer and countered with a demand of $600,000 and a public apology.  The defendants rejected this proposal and the first trial began on October 30, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first trial, the defendants made a second offer of judgment on January 14, 1997, in the amount of $70,000.  The plaintiff rejected the offer and countered with a demand of $250,000, which the defendants rejected.  On January 23, 1997, the defendants made a third offer of judgment in the amount of $100,000.  The plaintiff also rejected that offer, demanding $180,000.  The $50,000 verdict obtained by the plaintiff in the second trial was less than all three offers of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the second trial, the district court awarded the defendants $8,271.71 for costs incurred after the offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68.  It denied the defendants' request for attorney's fees under Puerto Rico Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 (\"Rule 44.1\"), finding that the plaintiff had not conducted her case with temerity.  The court awarded the plaintiff costs as a prevailing party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 in the amount of $7,894.84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of this legal imbroglio, the plaintiff filed a timely appeal.  The defendants have raised several issues on cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties raise the following issues on appeal:  (1) the defendants claim that the trial court abused its discretion by setting aside the $10,000 verdict in the first trial and granting a new trial;  (2) the plaintiff asserts that the jury's verdict of $50,000 damages in the second trial was insufficient and the trial court therefore abused its discretion by failing to grant her motion for a third trial;  (3) the plaintiff claims that the trial court impermissibly excluded evidence of Lockard's criminal misdemeanor conviction;  and (4) the defendants assert that the trial court erred in its award of costs and in its failure to award attorney's fees.  We discuss these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Grant of the Second Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court granted the plaintiff's motion for a second trial after it found that the jury possibly could have properly reconsidered the amount of damages to be awarded, but more likely had acted for an improper reason.  The defendants argue that the trial court should have accepted the $10,000 verdict and erred by granting the plaintiff's motion for a new trial.  The court, they urge, should not have endeavored to choose among the possible explanations for the jury's behavior.  As long as there was a plausible explanation for the jury's conduct that was permissible, the defendants contend, the trial court should not have granted a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unpersuasive.  See Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., 915 F.2d 764, 766 (1st Cir.1990) (denial of new trial reviewed only for abuse of discretion).  As the defendants acknowledge, First Circuit precedent distinguishes between cases where a jury's verdict is challenged as improper based only on a damage award that allegedly fails to bear any rational relation to the evidence of the damages presented at trial, see, e.g., Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1197-98 (1st Cir.1995) (verdict alleged to be excessive), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1136, 116 S.Ct. 1423, 134 L.Ed.2d 547 (1996);  Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc., 847 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir.1988) (verdict alleged to be insufficient), and cases where there is some evidence of an improper verdict based on factors other than the amount of the damage award, see, e.g., Skinner v. Total Petroleum, Inc., 859 F.2d 1439, 1446 (10th Cir.1988), cited with approval in Phav, 915 F.2d at 768;  Mekdeci ex rel. Mekdeci v. Merrell Nat'l Lab., 711 F.2d 1510, 1514 (11th Cir.1983) (same).  Where the allegation of an improper verdict is based solely on the amount of the damage award, the circumstances under which a trial court may overturn a verdict are more limited.  See, e.g., Cigna Fire Underwriters Co. v. Macdonald &amp; Johnson, Inc., 86 F.3d 1260, 1267 (1st Cir.1996) (grant of a new trial appropriate where damages were easily calculable and damage award exceeded maximum value of damages claimed and did not take into account offset to damages);  Torres-Troche v. Municipality of Yauco, 873 F.2d 499, 501 &amp; n. 6 (1st Cir.1989) (suggestion that allegedly low damage award indicated compromise verdict was speculation not meeting heavy burden of showing entitlement to new trial).  However, where evidence of an improper verdict exists other than the amount of the jury award, such as when a jury answers special questions in an inconsistent manner, the trial court's discretion to grant a new trial is broader.  In such cases the court can consider all of the circumstances surrounding the jury's verdict, including the amount of the damage award, in determining whether or not the jury reached an improper verdict.  See Phav, 915 F.2d at 768-69.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants acknowledge the distinction between cases where the only evidence of a compromise verdict is an allegedly insufficient damage award and cases where additional evidence indicates a compromise, but they attempt to cast this case as falling into the former rather than the latter category.  However, in this case the trial court's determination did not turn solely on the amount of the verdict that the jury ultimately returned.  Rather, the ten-fold reduction by the jury of its initial award of damages and the circumstances surrounding its determination of Lockard's liability provided the primary basis for the trial court's determination that the verdict as finally returned was motivated by compromise or sympathy.  The verdict form ultimately completed by the jury was free of any internal inconsistency because it held Lockard and the Heat liable for $10,000 damages suffered by the plaintiff.  However, the sequence of events preceding that verdict was properly considered by the trial court as an indication that the jury reached the verdict based on compromise or bias.  See id. at 768 (odd chronology of jury deliberations one \"telltale sign of a compromise verdict\").  Therefore, the trial court had more latitude in this case in exercising its discretion to overturn the jury's verdict than it would have had in a case where the only basis for the grant of a new trial was the alleged insufficiency of a damage award.  See Mekdeci, 711 F.2d at 1513, cited with approval in Phav, 915 F.2d at 768.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court determined that the sequence of events leading up to the jury's final verdict in the first trial most likely indicated that the jury had reached its verdict improperly.  The jury initially had assessed $100,000 in damages against the Heat but did not find Lockard liable.  A short time after being told to deliberate further and requesting additional guidance the jury determined that Lockard was liable but reduced the amount of damages to $10,000.  Based on the jury's behavior, it was logical for the trial court to conclude that the jury wanted to give the plaintiff something but it did not want to hold Lockard personally liable for a $100,000 award.  There is no indication that the trial judge, who observed the trial, the timing of the questions, and the results of the deliberations, abused his discretion in arriving at this determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Phav, 915 F.2d at 766.   We therefore decline to overturn the trial court and to reinstate the initial $10,000 verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Insufficiency of the Jury Verdict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's main contention on appeal is that the trial court erred by failing to grant her motion for a new trial following the second verdict, on the grounds that the damage award of $50,000 is insufficient.  As noted above, it is comparatively more difficult to justify overturning a jury's verdict where the only evidence that something has gone awry is an allegedly insufficient damages award.  Indeed, the jury \"is free to run the whole gamut of euphonious notes--to harmonize the verdict at the highest or lowest points for which there is a sound evidentiary predicate, or anywhere in between--so long as the end result does not violate the conscience of the court or strike such a dissonant chord that justice would be denied were the judgment permitted to stand.\"  Milone, 847 F.2d at 37.  \"At best, plaintiff's verdicts in personal injury cases are not models of mathematical exactitude.  Thus, the fact that a particular award is a few dollars long or short would rarely (if ever) translate into a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  Id. at 41 n. 7. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, see Molloy v. Blanchard, 115 F.3d 86, 88 (1st Cir.1997), and will only overturn the jury's award and the trial judge's ensuing refusal to grant a new trial for abuse of discretion, see Correa, 69 F.3d at 1197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates that most of the damages suffered by the plaintiff were intangible.  \"An appellate court's normal disinclination to second-guess a jury's evaluation of the proper amount of damages is magnified where, as here, the damages entail a monetary valuation of intangible losses, and the trial judge, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, accepts the jury's appraisal.\"  Id. Even accepting the plaintiff's complaints uncritically, which the jury was not required to do, her primary claims for damages are that (1) she suffers from pain;  (2) the quality of her life has been reduced because of her pain and because of the measures she must take to avoid pain;  and (3) her dignity, self-image, and sense of well-being have been adversely affected by the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the intangible nature of the plaintiff's injuries, the evidence in this case permitted the jury to find that her injuries were not as severe as she claimed.  The jury could also have found that most of the plaintiff's physical pain was caused not by the incident in question but by the plaintiff's failure to obey her doctor's orders not to move heavy objects, which orders were given in connection with her pre-existing back injury.  The jury was free to disbelieve as much of the plaintiff's expert and lay testimony as it wished.  In short, the plaintiff has provided no support for the proposition that the jury's $50,000 verdict was so far beyond the range of acceptable verdicts, based on the evidence presented at trial, that it constituted a manifest miscarriage of justice.  The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying her motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. Failure to Admit Evidence of Lockard's Conviction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court ruled that evidence of Lockard's criminal misdemeanor conviction was inadmissible because its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.  The plaintiff asserts that this ruling was error.  We review the district court's determination that the evidence of Lockard's conviction should have been excluded for abuse of discretion.  See Kowalski v. Gagne, 914 F.2d 299, 306 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff places undue reliance on Kowalski, a case which stands for the proposition that the district court has discretion to admit evidence such as this.  See id.   However, Kowalski does not support the notion that the district court abused its discretion in this case by failing to admit this evidence.  Indeed, as Kowalski makes clear, the district court's decision that the evidence was substantially more prejudicial than probative was well within its discretion.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jurors were presented with sufficient evidence to gauge the seriousness of Lockard's actions and their effect on the plaintiff.  In addition to the testimony of the plaintiff and other witnesses, the episode was recorded by a television camera and the tape was made available for the jury to watch.  The parties stipulated that Lockard was portraying the mascot Burnie throughout the incident.  The jury did not need evidence of Lockard's criminal conviction to assess his role in the incident.  Under the circumstances, admission of Lockard's criminal conviction would have allowed the jury to substitute the judgment reached in the criminal proceeding for its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even assuming arguendo that the exclusion of the evidence was error, the error had no effect on the outcome of the case.  The only issue on which Lockard's conviction was probative was the issue of his liability for the plaintiff's injury.  Both juries found Lockard liable for the plaintiff's injuries.  Lockard's conviction had relevance neither to the issue of the plaintiff's injuries nor to the amount of damages necessary to compensate her for those injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's reliance on Kowalski for the proposition that a criminal conviction is, as a matter of course, relevant to the issue of damages in an ensuing civil trial is also misplaced.  Kowalski dealt with a Massachusetts wrongful death statute which provides that damages should be \"assessed with reference to the degree of [the defendant's] culpability.\"  914 F.2d at 306.   For that reason, the defendant's conviction of the crime of second degree murder was relevant to the issue of culpability, and thus the issue of damages.  See id.   The plaintiff's cause of action here was for negligence and she was entitled only to compensatory damages.  For these reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to admit evidence of Lockard's conviction, and the plaintiff is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV.

It found that the plaintiff had not been obstinate at any point in the proceedings.  In addition, it awarded the plaintiff costs as a prevailing party.  The defendants contend that (1) the district court erred by failing to award attorney's fees incurred after the offer of judgment;  (2) the court erred in finding that the plaintiff was not obstinate under Rule 44.1;  and (3) the court erred when it awarded the plaintiff costs incurred after their offer of judgment.

Resolution of this issue requires that we carefully analyze the relationship between two rules of civil procedure, Federal Rule 68 and Puerto Rico Rule 35.1, both of which ostensibly govern the situation at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, the United States Supreme Court set forth the general doctrine by which federal courts in diversity cases determine whether state or federal law will apply to a controversy.  See 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938).  In Hanna v. Plumer, the Supreme Court set forth the test for determining how a court should choose between a federal procedural rule and a conflicting state substantive rule.  See 380 U.S. 460, 471, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 1143-44, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965).  Where a Federal Rule is \"sufficiently broad to control the issue\" but conflicts with a state law, the court applies the Federal Rule unless it transgresses the limits of the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2072, or the Constitution.

Rule 68 does not itself supply a definition of \"costs.\"   Instead, it incorporates the definition of \"costs\" found in the relevant substantive statute of the jurisdiction whose substantive law applies to the case.  Therefore, when the definition of \"costs\" in the relevant substantive statute includes attorney's fees, attorney's fees incurred after the offer of judgment must be paid by the offeree.  See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 9, 105 S.Ct. 3012, 3016-17, 87 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).  In addition, Rule 68 applies only when a plaintiff/offeree obtains an award that is less than the offer of judgment, and not when the plaintiff/offeree loses the suit in its entirety.  See Delta Air Lines, Inc. v.

See Marek, 473 U.S. at 9, 105 S.Ct. at 3016-17.  The substantive law underlying this action is Puerto Rico's law of negligence.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5141 (\"A person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\").  Puerto Rico law makes no provision for the award of attorney's fees as any part of \"costs\" in such cases.  Compare Rule 44.1(a) (\"Costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party, except when otherwise directed by law or by these rules.  The costs which may be allowed by the court are those expenses necessarily incurred in prosecuting an action or proceeding which, according to law or to the discretion of the court, one of the parties should reimburse to the other.\"), with Rule 44.1(d) (\"In the event any party or its lawyer has acted obstinately or frivolously, the court shall, in its judgment, impose on such person the payment of a sum for attorney's fees which the court decides corresponds to such conduct.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other source of Puerto Rico law that might supply a definition of costs that includes attorney's fees is Rule 35.1 itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  However, Rule 35.1 allows for the award of \"costs, expenses and attorney's fees.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App.  III, Rule 35.1 (1983).  On its face, the rule treats costs and attorney's fees as separate items;  it does not define attorney's fees as part of costs.  See id.;   see also, e.g., Knight v. Snap-On Tools Corp., 3 F.3d 1398, 1405 (10th Cir.1993) (\"[T]he fee-shifting provision clearly identifies attorney's fees separately from costs.\");  Oates v.

See S.A. Healy Co., 60 F.3d at 312 (\"[T]here cannot be any doubt that Rule 68 is within the scope of the Rules Enabling Act.\").

See De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion Insular de Seguros, 931 F.2d 116, 126-27 (1st Cir.1991).  The defendants urge that the plaintiff's conduct was obstinate because she refused to accept multiple offers of judgment which they assert were reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The fact that the plaintiff was eventually awarded less than the amount of the offers, the defendants contend, is evidence of their reasonableness.

The district court erred in making this award.  Although the plaintiff did not distinguish between costs incurred pre- and post-offer, the defendants have only contested the award of $3,950 paid for the testimony of two experts at the two trials.  Because such amounts were clearly incurred after the offer of judgment and the defendants have not challenged the other components of the trial court's initial award of costs, we reduce the plaintiff's award of costs by that amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To conclude, we find the parties' remaining arguments and claimed errors to be without merit and unworthy of extended discussion.  For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed as to the grant of the second trial, the exclusion of evidence of Lockard's conviction, the refusal to grant a third trial, and the refusal to grant attorney's fees as part of costs incurred after the first offer of judgment.  The district court's award to the plaintiff of costs incurred after the offer of judgment in the amount of $3,950 is reversed, and the plaintiff's award of costs shall be reduced by that amount.

Subsequent cases make clear, however, that the \"direct collision\" analysis does not involve the narrowest possible reading of the relevant Federal Rule.

In Stewart, the Supreme Court stated the following:</p>\n        <p>Our cases at times have referred to the question at this stage of the analysis as an inquiry into whether there is a \"direct collision\" between state and federal law.  Logic indicates, however, and a careful reading of the relevant passages confirms, that this language is not meant to mandate that federal law and state law be perfectly coextensive and equally applicable to the issue at hand;  rather, the \"direct collision\" language, at least where the applicability of a federal statute is at issue, expresses the requirement that the federal statute be sufficiently broad to cover the point in dispute.  It would make no sense for the supremacy of federal law to wane precisely because there is no state law directly on point.</p>\n        <p>487 U.S. at 26-27 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. at 2242 n. 4 (citations omitted).  Subsequent First Circuit cases confirm that the relevant inquiry for evaluating a potential conflict is whether the Federal Rule is \"sufficiently broad to control the issue.\"   See Commercial Union Ins.

This case differs from Ganapolsky, because here the plaintiff received a verdict less favorable than the defendants' offer of judgment and thus Rule 68 applies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Rule 44.1(d) provides that:</p>\n        <p>In the event any party or its lawyer has acted obstinately or frivolously, the court shall, in its judgment, impose on such person the payment of a sum for attorney's fees which the court decides corresponds to such conduct.</p>\n        <p>P.R.

In the first trial, the jury awarded the plaintiff $10,000 but the trial court found that the verdict was most likely the result of bias or compromise and set it aside.  After a second trial, the jury awarded the plaintiff $50,000.  The district court also awarded the defendants costs which they incurred after an offer of judgment had been made and awarded costs to the plaintiff as a prevailing party.  In this appeal, the plaintiff contends that she should have been granted a third trial because the $50,000 damage award was insufficient and the trial judge improperly excluded evidence.  In their cross-appeal, the defendants contend that (1) the district court erred in granting a second trial;  (2) given the fact that the plaintiff ultimately received less than the amount the defendants had proposed in an offer of judgment, they are entitled to attorney's fees incurred after the offer;  and (3) the trial court should not have awarded the plaintiff costs incurred after an offer of judgment.  We agree with the district court's disposition of the case in all respects with the exception of its ruling awarding costs to the plaintiff incurred after an offer of judgment.  Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 21, 1994, the plaintiff attended an exhibition basketball game between the Miami Heat and the Atlanta Hawks at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum.  She was seated in the front row as part of a group that had received complementary tickets to the game.  She had attended another exhibition game under similar circumstances the prior year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a time-out, defendant Lockard, dressed as Burnie, approached the plaintiff and grabbed her hand.  He had selected her at random to participate in a routine he planned to perform as entertainment during the time-out.  When he attempted to pull her onto the floor, she resisted and loudly told him no.  He persisted, however, grabbing her left arm with both hands and pulling, because in his experience people often were reluctant at first but later changed their minds.  Unbeknownst to either party, the plaintiff's purse strap had fallen over the back of her seat and was providing additional resistance to Lockard's efforts.  He pulled the plaintiff with such force, however, that her purse strap broke and as a result she surged forward, falling to the floor.  Lockard took the plaintiff's sudden movement as a sign that she had changed her mind about participating and dragged her by the arm to the center of the court.  When he saw that the plaintiff still did not wish to participate, he did not further coerce her.  She stood up, composed herself, and walked off the court while he completed the routine alone.  The plaintiff was extremely upset by the incident and left the game prior to its conclusion.  She felt as though she had been humiliated in front of the entire crowd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff suffered both physically and emotionally as a result of the incident.  She felt pain in her left arm and shoulder as well as pain to a lesser extent throughout her body.  She also suffered a bruise on her left thigh.  She did not, however, break any bones or suffer any neurological damage.  After arriving at home, the plaintiff took pain medication and applied ointment to her body.  A few days later, she consulted an orthopedist and a physiatrist in connection with her physical injuries.  She undertook physical therapy which had been prescribed for her.  Surgery was neither recommended nor undertaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff has been diagnosed with post-traumatic tendonitis in her left shoulder, the primary symptom of which is pain.  She continues to experience pain in her left arm and shoulder, which affects her when she engages in everyday activities.  The plaintiff takes pain medication on a regular basis, and her condition is not expected to improve further.  The plaintiff's condition has required her to modify her behavior in order to avoid tasks and activities that will exacerbate the pain, particularly heavy lifting and certain repetitive movements.  However, she has a pre-existing condition in her back that also periodically causes her pain for which she had previously sought treatment.  This pre-existing condition imposed similar restrictions on her ability to perform certain activities such as lifting heavy objects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff consulted with a psychiatrist for her emotional distress.  She feels that the event has had a profoundly negative effect on her mental and emotional well-being, which she attributes in part to her traditional conservative upbringing.  The plaintiff avoids large gatherings and feels that her privacy and dignity have been injured by the incident.  She now takes anti-anxiety medications on a regular basis.  The defendants' expert testified that the emotional difficulties experienced by the plaintiff were not permanent, but instead represented a normal reaction to an adverse situation.  Experts for both parties agree that the plaintiff's condition does not rise to the level of a recognized psychological disorder.  In addition to the distress caused by the incident, the plaintiff had pre-existing emotional stressors, including marital difficulty, that could account for some of her dysphoria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to the incident, the plaintiff brought criminal charges against Lockard.  She felt the need to confront the people who she felt had wronged her.  Lockard was found guilty of misdemeanor battery.  The plaintiff also brought this civil action against both Lockard and the Heat, Lockard's employer.  Her claim, brought pursuant to the court's diversity jurisdiction, alleged that Lockard had negligently injured her in violation of Puerto Rico law and that the Heat, as Lockard's employer, was responsible for that injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the civil trial, the trial court ruled that evidence of Lockard's criminal conviction would be unduly prejudicial and precluded the plaintiff from introducing it.  On October 30, 1996, the plaintiff's case went to trial for the first time.  After approximately one and one-half hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $100,000 in favor of the plaintiff, but it found only the Heat liable and not Lockard.  The trial judge rejected the verdict because the plaintiff had pursued only a theory of respondeat superior liability against the Heat, and thus the Heat could not have been found liable unless Lockard was liable as well.  The judge reinstructed the jury on the issue of liability and directed it to continue deliberating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After another hour, the jury sent a note to the court requesting guidance on the amount of damages to which the plaintiff was entitled.  The trial judge instructed the jury to review the instruction on damages the court had already given.  The jury deliberated for approximately another hour and then returned a verdict that held both Lockard and the Heat liable.  However, the jury awarded the plaintiff only $10,000 in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial and for relief from judgment on November 14, 1996.  On December 16, 1996, the district court ruled that the jury's verdict was most probably an impermissible verdict based on compromise or bias and granted a new trial.  See Gil de Rebollo v. Miami Heat Ltd. Partnership, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></span>, 64-65 (D.P.R.1996).  The trial court reasoned that three possibilities explained the jury's reduction of the damage award to one-tenth the figure it had selected initially:  (1) the jury may have rationally reconsidered its decision on damages when it was sent back to deliberate further;  (2) the jury may have thought Lockard unaccountable for his interaction with the plaintiff but wanted to compensate her anyway from the corporate deep pocket, and when confronted with the requirements of respondeat superior, the jury lowered the amount of damages which Lockard might be required to pay, reflecting an improper compromise;  or (3) the jury may have thought that the plaintiff had suffered $100,000 damages but tried to shield Lockard from having to pay because of an improper bias in his favor, and when it realized it could not shield Lockard, it lowered the amount of the verdict so that his liability would be minimized.  See id. at 64.   The court found that the latter two alternatives, both improper, were more likely than the first, which was proper, and granted a new trial.  See id. at 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second trial commenced on February 10, 1997.  On February 14, 1997, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $50,000, finding that both Lockard and the Heat were liable.  The plaintiff again filed a motion for a new trial, asserting that the damages were insufficient, but the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the litigation, the parties made several attempts to settle their dispute without a trial.  The plaintiff's initial demand in the case was for $1,000,000.  On October 7, 1996, the defendants made a written offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (\"Rule 68\") to have judgment entered against them in the amount of $80,000.  The plaintiff rejected the offer and countered with a demand of $600,000 and a public apology.  The defendants rejected this proposal and the first trial began on October 30, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first trial, the defendants made a second offer of judgment on January 14, 1997, in the amount of $70,000.  The plaintiff rejected the offer and countered with a demand of $250,000, which the defendants rejected.  On January 23, 1997, the defendants made a third offer of judgment in the amount of $100,000.  The plaintiff also rejected that offer, demanding $180,000.  The $50,000 verdict obtained by the plaintiff in the second trial was less than all three offers of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the second trial, the district court awarded the defendants $8,271.71 for costs incurred after the offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68.  It denied the defendants' request for attorney's fees under Puerto Rico Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 (\"Rule 44.1\"), finding that the plaintiff had not conducted her case with temerity.  The court awarded the plaintiff costs as a prevailing party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 in the amount of $7,894.84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of this legal imbroglio, the plaintiff filed a timely appeal.  The defendants have raised several issues on cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties raise the following issues on appeal:  (1) the defendants claim that the trial court abused its discretion by setting aside the $10,000 verdict in the first trial and granting a new trial;  (2) the plaintiff asserts that the jury's verdict of $50,000 damages in the second trial was insufficient and the trial court therefore abused its discretion by failing to grant her motion for a third trial;  (3) the plaintiff claims that the trial court impermissibly excluded evidence of Lockard's criminal misdemeanor conviction;  and (4) the defendants assert that the trial court erred in its award of costs and in its failure to award attorney's fees.  We discuss these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Grant of the Second Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court granted the plaintiff's motion for a second trial after it found that the jury possibly could have properly reconsidered the amount of damages to be awarded, but more likely had acted for an improper reason.  The defendants argue that the trial court should have accepted the $10,000 verdict and erred by granting the plaintiff's motion for a new trial.  The court, they urge, should not have endeavored to choose among the possible explanations for the jury's behavior.  As long as there was a plausible explanation for the jury's conduct that was permissible, the defendants contend, the trial court should not have granted a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unpersuasive.  See Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548929\"><a href=\"/opinion/548929/chat-phav-v-trueblood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span>, 766 (1st Cir.1990) (denial of new trial reviewed only for abuse of discretion).  As the defendants acknowledge, First Circuit precedent distinguishes between cases where a jury's verdict is challenged as improper based only on a damage award that allegedly fails to bear any rational relation to the evidence of the damages presented at trial, see, e.g., Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196369\"><a href=\"/opinion/196369/correa-gonzalez-v-hospital-sf/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1197-98 (1st Cir.1995) (verdict alleged to be excessive), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Total Petroleum, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513250\"><a href=\"/opinion/513250/dennis-skinner-and-cross-appellant-v-total-petroleum-inc-a-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span>, 1446 (10th Cir.1988), cited with approval in Phav, 915 F.2d at 768;  Mekdeci ex rel. Mekdeci v. Merrell Nat'l Lab., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421682\"><a href=\"/opinion/421682/mekdeci-david-an-infant-by-and-through-michael-and-elizabeth-mekdeci/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span>, 1514 (11th Cir.1983) (same).  Where the allegation of an improper verdict is based solely on the amount of the damage award, the circumstances under which a trial court may overturn a verdict are more limited.  See, e.g., Cigna Fire Underwriters Co. v. Macdonald &amp; Johnson, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196843\"><a href=\"/opinion/196843/cigna-fire-insurance-v-macdonald-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1260</span></a></span>, 1267 (1st Cir.1996) (grant of a new trial appropriate where damages were easily calculable and damage award exceeded maximum value of damages claimed and did not take into account offset to damages);  Torres-Troche v. Municipality of Yauco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522156\"><a href=\"/opinion/522156/carlos-torres-troche-v-municipality-of-yauco/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 501 &amp; n. 6 (1st Cir.1989) (suggestion that allegedly low damage award indicated compromise verdict was speculation not meeting heavy burden of showing entitlement to new trial).  However, where evidence of an improper verdict exists other than the amount of the jury award, such as when a jury answers special questions in an inconsistent manner, the trial court's discretion to grant a new trial is broader.  In such cases the court can consider all of the circumstances surrounding the jury's verdict, including the amount of the damage award, in determining whether or not the jury reached an improper verdict.  See Phav, 915 F.2d at 768-69.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants acknowledge the distinction between cases where the only evidence of a compromise verdict is an allegedly insufficient damage award and cases where additional evidence indicates a compromise, but they attempt to cast this case as falling into the former rather than the latter category.  However, in this case the trial court's determination did not turn solely on the amount of the verdict that the jury ultimately returned.  Rather, the ten-fold reduction by the jury of its initial award of damages and the circumstances surrounding its determination of Lockard's liability provided the primary basis for the trial court's determination that the verdict as finally returned was motivated by compromise or sympathy.  The verdict form ultimately completed by the jury was free of any internal inconsistency because it held Lockard and the Heat liable for $10,000 damages suffered by the plaintiff.  However, the sequence of events preceding that verdict was properly considered by the trial court as an indication that the jury reached the verdict based on compromise or bias.  See id. at 768 (odd chronology of jury deliberations one \"telltale sign of a compromise verdict\").  Therefore, the trial court had more latitude in this case in exercising its discretion to overturn the jury's verdict than it would have had in a case where the only basis for the grant of a new trial was the alleged insufficiency of a damage award.  See Mekdeci, 711 F.2d at 1513, cited with approval in Phav, 915 F.2d at 768.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court determined that the sequence of events leading up to the jury's final verdict in the first trial most likely indicated that the jury had reached its verdict improperly.  The jury initially had assessed $100,000 in damages against the Heat but did not find Lockard liable.  A short time after being told to deliberate further and requesting additional guidance the jury determined that Lockard was liable but reduced the amount of damages to $10,000.  Based on the jury's behavior, it was logical for the trial court to conclude that the jury wanted to give the plaintiff something but it did not want to hold Lockard personally liable for a $100,000 award.  There is no indication that the trial judge, who observed the trial, the timing of the questions, and the results of the deliberations, abused his discretion in arriving at this determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Phav, 915 F.2d at 766.   We therefore decline to overturn the trial court and to reinstate the initial $10,000 verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Insufficiency of the Jury Verdict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's main contention on appeal is that the trial court erred by failing to grant her motion for a new trial following the second verdict, on the grounds that the damage award of $50,000 is insufficient.  As noted above, it is comparatively more difficult to justify overturning a jury's verdict where the only evidence that something has gone awry is an allegedly insufficient damages award.  Indeed, the jury \"is free to run the whole gamut of euphonious notes--to harmonize the verdict at the highest or lowest points for which there is a sound evidentiary predicate, or anywhere in between--so long as the end result does not violate the conscience of the court or strike such a dissonant chord that justice would be denied were the judgment permitted to stand.\"  Milone, 847 F.2d at 37.  \"At best, plaintiff's verdicts in personal injury cases are not models of mathematical exactitude.  Thus, the fact that a particular award is a few dollars long or short would rarely (if ever) translate into a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  Id. at 41 n. 7. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, see Molloy v. Blanchard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741736\"><a href=\"/opinion/741736/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-176-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44829-lori-ann/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir.1997), and will only overturn the jury's award and the trial judge's ensuing refusal to grant a new trial for abuse of discretion, see Correa, 69 F.3d at 1197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates that most of the damages suffered by the plaintiff were intangible.  \"An appellate court's normal disinclination to second-guess a jury's evaluation of the proper amount of damages is magnified where, as here, the damages entail a monetary valuation of intangible losses, and the trial judge, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, accepts the jury's appraisal.\"  Id. Even accepting the plaintiff's complaints uncritically, which the jury was not required to do, her primary claims for damages are that (1) she suffers from pain;  (2) the quality of her life has been reduced because of her pain and because of the measures she must take to avoid pain;  and (3) her dignity, self-image, and sense of well-being have been adversely affected by the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the intangible nature of the plaintiff's injuries, the evidence in this case permitted the jury to find that her injuries were not as severe as she claimed.  The jury could also have found that most of the plaintiff's physical pain was caused not by the incident in question but by the plaintiff's failure to obey her doctor's orders not to move heavy objects, which orders were given in connection with her pre-existing back injury.  The jury was free to disbelieve as much of the plaintiff's expert and lay testimony as it wished.  In short, the plaintiff has provided no support for the proposition that the jury's $50,000 verdict was so far beyond the range of acceptable verdicts, based on the evidence presented at trial, that it constituted a manifest miscarriage of justice.  The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying her motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. Failure to Admit Evidence of Lockard's Conviction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court ruled that evidence of Lockard's criminal misdemeanor conviction was inadmissible because its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.  The plaintiff asserts that this ruling was error.  We review the district court's determination that the evidence of Lockard's conviction should have been excluded for abuse of discretion.  See Kowalski v. Gagne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548343\"><a href=\"/opinion/548343/linda-kowalski-aka-linda-larochelle-etc-v-richard-j-gagne-aetna/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 306 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff places undue reliance on Kowalski, a case which stands for the proposition that the district court has discretion to admit evidence such as this.  See id.   However, Kowalski does not support the notion that the district court abused its discretion in this case by failing to admit this evidence.  Indeed, as Kowalski makes clear, the district court's decision that the evidence was substantially more prejudicial than probative was well within its discretion.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jurors were presented with sufficient evidence to gauge the seriousness of Lockard's actions and their effect on the plaintiff.  In addition to the testimony of the plaintiff and other witnesses, the episode was recorded by a television camera and the tape was made available for the jury to watch.  The parties stipulated that Lockard was portraying the mascot Burnie throughout the incident.  The jury did not need evidence of Lockard's criminal conviction to assess his role in the incident.  Under the circumstances, admission of Lockard's criminal conviction would have allowed the jury to substitute the judgment reached in the criminal proceeding for its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even assuming arguendo that the exclusion of the evidence was error, the error had no effect on the outcome of the case.  The only issue on which Lockard's conviction was probative was the issue of his liability for the plaintiff's injury.  Both juries found Lockard liable for the plaintiff's injuries.  Lockard's conviction had relevance neither to the issue of the plaintiff's injuries nor to the amount of damages necessary to compensate her for those injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's reliance on Kowalski for the proposition that a criminal conviction is, as a matter of course, relevant to the issue of damages in an ensuing civil trial is also misplaced.  Kowalski dealt with a Massachusetts wrongful death statute which provides that damages should be \"assessed with reference to the degree of [the defendant's] culpability.\"  914 F.2d at 306.   For that reason, the defendant's conviction of the crime of second degree murder was relevant to the issue of culpability, and thus the issue of damages.  See id.   The plaintiff's cause of action here was for negligence and she was entitled only to compensatory damages.  For these reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to admit evidence of Lockard's conviction, and the plaintiff is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Puerto Rico law makes no provision for the award of attorney's fees as any part of \"costs\" in such cases.

The district court erred in making this award.  Although the plaintiff did not distinguish between costs incurred pre- and post-offer, the defendants have only contested the award of $3,950 paid for the testimony of two experts at the two trials.  Because such amounts were clearly incurred after the offer of judgment and the defendants have not challenged the other components of the trial court's initial award of costs, we reduce the plaintiff's award of costs by that amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To conclude, we find the parties' remaining arguments and claimed errors to be without merit and unworthy of extended discussion.  For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed as to the grant of the second trial, the exclusion of evidence of Lockard's conviction, the refusal to grant a third trial, and the refusal to grant attorney's fees as part of costs incurred after the first offer of judgment.  The district court's award to the plaintiff of costs incurred after the offer of judgment in the amount of $3,950 is reversed, and the plaintiff's award of costs shall be reduced by that amount.

Early cases indicated the necessity for a \"direct collision.\"   See, e.g., Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110274\"><a href=\"/opinion/110274/walker-v-armco-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 749-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110274\"><a href=\"/opinion/110274/walker-v-armco-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span> (1980);  Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472, 85 S.Ct. at 1144-45.   Subsequent cases make clear, however, that the \"direct collision\" analysis does not involve the narrowest possible reading of the relevant Federal Rule.  See Stewart, 487 U.S. at 26-27 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. at 2242 n. 4;  Walker, 446 U.S. at 750 &amp; n. 9, 100 S.Ct. at 1985 &amp; n. 9. In Stewart, the Supreme Court stated the following:</p>\n        <p>Our cases at times have referred to the question at this stage of the analysis as an inquiry into whether there is a \"direct collision\" between state and federal law.  Logic indicates, however, and a careful reading of the relevant passages confirms, that this language is not meant to mandate that federal law and state law be perfectly coextensive and equally applicable to the issue at hand;  rather, the \"direct collision\" language, at least where the applicability of a federal statute is at issue, expresses the requirement that the federal statute be sufficiently broad to cover the point in dispute.  It would make no sense for the supremacy of federal law to wane precisely because there is no state law directly on point.</p>\n        <p>487 U.S. at 26-27 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. at 2242 n. 4 (citations omitted).  Subsequent First Circuit cases confirm that the relevant inquiry for evaluating a potential conflict is whether the Federal Rule is \"sufficiently broad to control the issue.\"   See Commercial Union Ins.

See 823 F.2d at 702.  Ganapolsky, however, did not involve an actual conflict between Rule 68 and Rule 35.1.  The defendant in Ganapolsky prevailed because the plaintiff's case was dismissed as a sanction.  See id. at 701.   Therefore, Rule 68 did not apply.  See Delta Air Lines, 450 U.S. at 352, 101 S.Ct. at 1150;  Ganapolsky, 823 F.2d at 701-02.  Rule 35.1, on the other hand, did apply.  See id. at 701 (citing Hermandad ).  This case differs from Ganapolsky, because here the plaintiff received a verdict less favorable than the defendants' offer of judgment and thus Rule 68 applies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Rule 44.1(d) provides that:</p>\n        <p>In the event any party or its lawyer has acted obstinately or frivolously, the court shall, in its judgment, impose on such person the payment of a sum for attorney's fees which the court decides corresponds to such conduct.</p>\n        <p>P.R.
