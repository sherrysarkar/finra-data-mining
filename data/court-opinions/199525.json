Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jack M. Atwood on brief for appellant.\n     James B. Farmer, United States Attorney, and Lori J. Holik,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          July 24, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam. Lawrence B. Hiltz appeals from the\n\ndenial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.                  Hiltz\n\nmoved to withdraw his plea prior to sentencing.            Therefore,\n\nthe court was permitted to grant the motion for “any fair and\n\njust   reason.”     Fed.R.Crim.P.     32(e).    In    reviewing     plea\n\nwithdrawal    rulings,      this   court    “accord[s]   considerable\n\ndeference to the firsthand assessment ultimately made by the\n\ndistrict court, which must be affirmed absent a demonstrable\n\nabuse of discretion.” United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124\n\nF.3d   342,   348   (1 st   Cir.   1997).      In    particular,    “the\n\nfactfinding underlying the plea withdrawal ruling may not be\n\nset aside for anything less than ‘clear error.’” Id. at 347.\n\nBecause we conclude that the district court’s determination\n\nthat the plea was knowing and voluntary was neither clear\n\nerror nor an abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n\n          I. Background\n\n          Hiltz pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to\n\ntraffic in counterfeit goods, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n371, and multiple counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2320. He entered his plea,\n\npursuant to a written plea agreement, after seven days of\n\njury trial. Represented by new counsel, he filed his motion\n\nto withdraw his guilty plea after the presentence report was\n\fissued, but before sentencing.           The district court held a\n\nhearing and Hiltz submitted affidavits in support of the\n\nmotion.     He did not request an evidentiary hearing and none\n\nwas held.    The court considered the affidavits and rejected\n\nHiltz’ claims that he did not understand the charges against\n\nhim   and   that   he   had   received   ineffective   assistance   of\n\ncounsel which invalidated his plea.\n\n            On appeal, Hiltz argues that: 1) his plea violated\n\ncore concerns of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 because Hiltz did not\n\nunderstand the charges to which he was pleading guilty and\n\n2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his\n\nattorney misinformed him about the sentencing consequences\n\nof his plea and pressured him to plead guilty.\n\n            II. Understanding of the Charges\n\n            In his brief on appeal, Hiltz makes only vague\n\nreferences to his claim that he did not understand the\n\ncharges against him.          He does not identify the specific\n\nelements of the charges that he did not understand.           Having\n\nfailed to make a developed argument on appeal, Hiltz has\n\nwaived this issue. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            Even if he had not waived the argument, however, it\n\nwould not entitle him to relief.          In his motion to withdraw\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fhis guilty plea, Hiltz argued that he pled guilty without an\n\nunderstanding of the charges against him.                In his affidavit\n\naccompanying that motion, he stated that when he pled guilty\n\nhe was “confused, and did not have any understanding as to\n\nwhat it was I was pleading guilty to.”               More specifically,\n\nhe recounted that at the change-of-plea hearing he denied\n\nthat    he   had   conspired    with   Mr.   Leppo    and    that   he   had\n\n“knowingly” trafficked in counterfeit goods.                 Hiltz stated\n\nin his affidavit that he now understands that “the government\n\nwould be required to prove that at the time I took the\n\nactions set forth in the indictment I knew and intended to\n\ncommit a crime.       I had no such knowledge or intent.”\n\n             The district court, in its Memorandum and Order of\n\nJune 16, 2000, denying Hiltz’ motion to withdraw his plea,\n\nfound that “the plea colloquy met the requirements of Rule\n\n11,” that the court had “addressed the three core concerns\n\nunderlying the rule” and that “Hiltz plainly, and on the\n\nrecord, plead to the facts as outlined.”                  We agree.       The\n\nrecord,      including   the    transcript    of   the      change-of-plea\n\nhearing,      supports    those    conclusions.             “[W]here     the\n\nprosecutor’s statement or the defendant’s description of the\n\nfacts sets forth all elements of the offense and the conduct\n\nof     the   defendant   that     constitutes      the    offense,       ‘the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdefendant’s       admission    that     the   allegations      are   true   is\n\nsufficient evidence that he understands the charge.’” United\n\nStates v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1995).                     That\n\nwas the case here.\n\n            Although Hiltz initially denied that he conspired\n\nwith     Andrew    Leppo,     he    admitted     that    he    obtained     the\n\ncounterfeit packaging from Mr. Leppo and that he conferred\n\nwith Mr. Leppo about how the invoices should read and on\n\nmatters of “quality control.”               Those admissions demonstrate\n\nHiltz’ understanding of the charges that he conspired with\n\nMr. Leppo.         Hiltz admitted that he was guilty “at the\n\nminimum”     of    “willful        blindness.”      That      satisfies     the\n\nknowledge requirement under § 2320. See 130 Cong. Rec. 31,674\n\n(1984)     (Joint     Statement        on     Trademark       Counterfeiting\n\nLegislation).        Hiltz claims in his affidavit that he was\n\nunaware of the requirement that the government prove that\n\nHiltz knew that his conduct was a crime.                  There is no such\n\nrequirement under § 2320, however. See United States v.\n\nBaker, 807 F.2d 427, 428 (5th Cir. 1986).\n\n            III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n            “[T]he    two-part        Strickland    v.     Washington     test\n\napplies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f(1985).     The first part of the test requires a showing that\n\n“counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard\n\nof reasonableness.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n687-88 (1984).       The second part of the test, in the context\n\nof guilty pleas, requires a defendant to show that “but for\n\ncounsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would\n\nhave insisted on going to trial.” Hill, 474 U.S. at 59.\n\n            “We     do     not     normally         consider      ineffective-\n\nassistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal.” United States\n\nv. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).                 However, this\n\ncase seems to fall within the following exception to that\n\nrule: “where the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute\n\nand the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned\n\nconsideration       of     an    ineffective        assistance      claim,    an\n\nappellate    court       may    dispense     with   the   usual    praxis    and\n\ndetermine the merits of such a contention on direct appeal.”\n\nId.\n\n            Hiltz’ primary claim of ineffective assistance is\n\nthat his attorney misrepresented that, although the plea\n\nagreement precluded him from arguing for a downward departure\n\nfrom the guideline imprisonment range, he could still argue\n\nfor a downward departure.              Based upon its review of the\n\naffidavits     of    Hiltz       and   his     former     counsel     and    its\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\ffamiliarity with the parties and the case, the district court\n\nconcluded that counsel’s statements regarding the effect of\n\nthe plea agreement on Hiltz’ ability to argue for a downward\n\ndeparture did not constitute a misrepresentation on which\n\nHiltz relied in deciding to plead guilty.                On this record,\n\nthere is no basis for concluding that that determination by\n\nthe district court was clearly erroneous or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n               Similarly, the record also provides no grounds for\n\noverturning the district court’s rejection of Hiltz’ claim\n\nthat his attorney told him that he was not prepared to\n\ncontinue with the case.          The court was entitled to rely upon\n\nits observation of Hiltz’ performance during the trial and\n\nat the change of plea hearing and on Hiltz’ statements at the\n\nchange    of    plea   hearing    that    he   was   satisfied   with   his\n\nattorney’s representation and that no one had pressured him\n\n“in any way” to plead guilty. See Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d\n\nat 349.    Nor did the district court err in rejecting Hiltz’\n\nargument that his attorney’s allegedly inaccurate description\n\nof the leniency he would receive at sentencing if he pled\n\nguilty invalidated the plea. See id.                 Finally, counsel’s\n\nalleged attempt to persuade Hiltz to plead guilty did not\n\nrise to the level of coercion.             An attorney’s mere attempt\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fto persuade his client that a guilty plea is in his best\n\ninterest does not invalidate the plea. See, e.g., Miles v.\n\nDorsey, 61 F.3d 1459, 1470 (10th Cir. 1995);     Williams v.\n\nChrans, 945 F.2d 926, 933 (7th Cir. 1991); Lunz v. Henderson,\n\n533 F.2d 1322, 1377 (2d Cir. 1976).\n\n         The judgment of the district court is     affirmed.\n\nSee Loc. R. 27(c).   The motion for release pending appeal is\n\ndenied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                             -8-\n\f",

Natanel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).                 However, this\n\ncase seems to fall within the following exception to that\n\nrule: “where the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute\n\nand the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned\n\nconsideration       of     an    ineffective        assistance      claim,    an\n\nappellate    court       may    dispense     with   the   usual    praxis    and\n\ndetermine the merits of such a contention on direct appeal.”\n\nId.\n\n            Hiltz’ primary claim of ineffective assistance is\n\nthat his attorney misrepresented that, although the plea\n\nagreement precluded him from arguing for a downward departure\n\nfrom the guideline imprisonment range, he could still argue\n\nfor a downward departure.              Based upon its review of the\n\naffidavits     of    Hiltz       and   his     former     counsel     and    its\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\ffamiliarity with the parties and the case, the district court\n\nconcluded that counsel’s statements regarding the effect of\n\nthe plea agreement on Hiltz’ ability to argue for a downward\n\ndeparture did not constitute a misrepresentation on which\n\nHiltz relied in deciding to plead guilty.                On this record,\n\nthere is no basis for concluding that that determination by\n\nthe district court was clearly erroneous or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n               Similarly, the record also provides no grounds for\n\noverturning the district court’s rejection of Hiltz’ claim\n\nthat his attorney told him that he was not prepared to\n\ncontinue with the case.          The court was entitled to rely upon\n\nits observation of Hiltz’ performance during the trial and\n\nat the change of plea hearing and on Hiltz’ statements at the\n\nchange    of    plea   hearing    that    he   was   satisfied   with   his\n\nattorney’s representation and that no one had pressured him\n\n“in any way” to plead guilty. See Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d\n\nat 349.    Nor did the district court err in rejecting Hiltz’\n\nargument that his attorney’s allegedly inaccurate description\n\nof the leniency he would receive at sentencing if he pled\n\nguilty invalidated the plea. See id.                 Finally, counsel’s\n\nalleged attempt to persuade Hiltz to plead guilty did not\n\nrise to the level of coercion.             An attorney’s mere attempt\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fto persuade his client that a guilty plea is in his best\n\ninterest does not invalidate the plea.
