Raymond L. Acosta, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nAgustin Morales-Rivera on brief pro se.\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Miguel A. Fernandez,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Lisa E. Bhatia Gautier, Assistant U.S.\r\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nAugust 25, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  We are presented with the issue of whether the\r\nprisoner mailbox rule applies to the filing of motions under 28\r\nU.S.C.  2255 and  2254.  We hold that a pro se prisoner's motion\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  2255 or  2254 is filed on the date that it is\r\ndeposited in the prison's internal mail-system for forwarding to\r\nthe district court, provided that the prisoner utilizes, if\r\navailable, the prison's system for recording legal mail.\r\nIn 1992, the appellant pled guilty to drug charges and was\r\nsentenced to 151 months in prison.  On August 5, 1997, the district\r\ncourt received his motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C.  2255\r\nalleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\r\nand sentencing errors.  Without deciding the merits, the district\r\ncourt dismissed the motion as untimely because it was not filed\r\nwithin one-year of the effective date of the Antiterrorism and\r\nEffective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), April 24, 1996. \r\nThe appellant moved for reconsideration.   He  asserted that\r\nalthough his motion was received by the district court three-months\r\nafter the deadline, the motion was timely filed under the prisoner\r\nmailbox rule because he placed it \"first-class postage prepaid in\r\nthe institution's internal mail system before the last day of\r\nfiling.\"\r\nThe district court denied the motion.  It acknowledged that in\r\ncertain cases pro se prisoners' pleadings are deemed filed when\r\nsubmitted to prison authorities for mailing to the district court. \r\nHouston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 108 S. Ct. 2379  (1988); Reid v.\r\nState of New Hampshire, 56 F.3d 334, 340 n. 16 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nNonetheless, it concluded that as a matter of law the prisoner\r\nmailbox rule governs only pleadings with filing periods which are\r\nshorter than AEDPA's one-year period.  We granted a certificate of\r\nappealability on the issue of the timeliness of the appellant's \r\n2255 motion. \r\nIn Houston, the Supreme Court held that a pro se prisoner's\r\nnotice of appeal is filed on the date that it is submitted to\r\nprison officials for forwarding to the district court, rather than\r\non the date that it is received by the clerk.  The Court reasoned\r\nthat the moment of filing was not specified in the procedural rules\r\ngoverning notices of appeal.  The prisoner mailbox rule fosters\r\nparity between pro se prisoners and other litigants and furthers\r\nthe policies which generally inform the concept of filing.  Pro se\r\nprisoners have no choice but to rely for filing on prison\r\nauthorities and the postal service.  They cannot monitor delivery\r\nprocesses or take independent, remedial measures to ensure\r\ntimeliness when the mail goes awry.  Their isolation impairs their\r\nability to prove, where applicable, that delays are due to prison\r\nauthorities or clerical error.  In short, unlike other litigants,\r\nthey cannot ensure that their pleadings will be recognized as\r\ntimely by the district court no matter how promptly and diligently\r\nthey act. \r\nIn addition, definitions of filing reflect pragmatic\r\ndesiderata, including, the need to limit factors affecting\r\ntimeliness to those within litigants' control and the need to\r\ndiscourage disputes about filing-dates.  Pro se prisoners loose\r\ncontrol over their pleadings upon submission to the warden. \r\nReliance on the date of submission to determine the time of\r\nfiling minimizes uncertainty, given prison procedures for logging\r\nlegal-mail.  \r\nThese considerations apply with equal force to  2255 and \r\n2254 motions.  Unlike represented prisoners or non-incarcerated\r\nconvicts, pro se prisoners have no choice but to rely for filing\r\nupon prison and postal authorities over whom they exercise no\r\ncontrol.  They cannot ensure that their motions will be received\r\nby the clerk on time no matter how diligently or far in advance\r\nthey act.  The mailbox rule helps ensure equal access to the\r\ncourts and functionally equivalent time-bars for pro se\r\nprisoners.  See Alves v. Matesans, 20 F. Supp. 2d. 135, 137 (D.\r\nMass. 1998)(finding no practical or principled justification for\r\nrefusing to apply the prisoner mailbox rule to a petition under\r\n28 U.S.C.  2254); Piacentini v. Levangie, 998 F. Supp. 86, 87\r\n(D. Mass. 1998)( 1983 complaint with a 3-year limitations period\r\nwas timely-filed under Fed. Rule Civ. P. 5 when sent through the\r\nprison's legal-mail system).  \r\nOther circuits which have considered the issue have applied\r\nthe prisoner mailbox rule to motions under 28 U.S.C.  2254 or \r\n2255.  Although Allen v. Dowd, 964 F.2d 745 (8th Cir. 1992), has\r\nbeen invoked for the proposition that the mailbox rule governs\r\nonly short filling-deadlines, after the district court issued its\r\nopinion in the present case, the Eighth Circuit ruled that Dowd\r\ndoes not survive AEDPA.  Nichols v. Bowersox, 172 F.3d 1068 (8th\r\nCir. 1999)(until AEDPA established a limitations period for \r\n2254 petitions, Houston's concerns about the special hurdles\r\nfaced by pro se prisoners in meeting filing deadlines were\r\nirrelevant).  \r\nWe agree that there is no practical or principled\r\njustification for refusing to apply the prisoner mailbox rule to\r\nthe filing of motions under 28 U.S.C. 2255 and  2254.  We\r\nvacate the judgment of the district court and remand for a\r\ndetermination of whether the appellant deposited his petition in\r\nthe prison's internal mail system by the deadline using, if\r\navailable, the prison's legal-mail system.\r\nVacated and remanded.\n",
