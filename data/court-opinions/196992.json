Nancy and  Lyle Strickland,  the\r\n\nappellants here, issue a similar call, again requesting that this\r\n\ncourt invalidate a regulation  which the Secretary of Agriculture\r\n\n(the Secretary)  promulgated under authority granted  by the Food\r\n\nStamp Act, 7 U.S.C.    2011-2025 (1988) (the Act).  In Strickland\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Commissioner,  Me.

See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 21\r                                                            \r\n\n(upholding 7 C.F.R.    273.11(a)(4)(ii)(D) (1994) as a reasonable\r\n\nrendition of 7 U.S.C.   2014(d)(9)).  This second time around the\r\n\nappellants seek to strike down  a different (but closely related)\r\n\nsection of the same regulation.  Because Chevron is still the law\r                                                          \r\n\nof  the  land,  we affirm  the  lower  court's  entry of  summary\r\n\njudgment in the appellees' favor.\r\n\nI.  THE STATUTORY SCHEME\r          I.  THE STATUTORY SCHEME\r\n\n          First  enacted  in  1964,   the  Act  is  designed  \"to\r\n\nsafeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by\r\n\nraising  levels of  nutrition  among low-income  households.\"   7\r\n\nU.S.C.   2011; see generally Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 14-15.  The\r                                                   \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nstates  administer most  aspects of the  Food Stamp  Program (the\r\n\nProgram) while the federal government underwrites the cost (which\r\n\nnow amounts to  some $29  billion per year).   Recipients,  whose\r\n\neligibility  is determined  by  income and  family size,  receive\r\n\nassistance in  the form of coupons  that may be used  to purchase\r\n\ngroceries  at local stores.   In order to  implement the Program,\r\n\nCongress  has   authorized  the  Secretary  to  promulgate  \"such\r\n\nregulations . . . as [he]  deems necessary or appropriate for the\r\n\neffective and efficient administration\"  of the Program's federal\r\n\naspects.  See  7 U.S.C.   2013(a), (c).  Responsibility for other\r                       \r\n\nelements  of the Program devolves upon state agencies.  In Maine,\r\n\nthat  obligation reposes  with the  Department of  Human Services\r\n\n(DHS).\r\n\n          In  1971, Congress  instructed  the  Secretary  to  set\r\n\nnational eligibility  standards for  the Program.   The Secretary\r\n\ndid  so.    Of  particular  interest for  present  purposes,  the\r\n\nSecretary barred any consideration  of principal payments made on\r\n\nthe purchase price of capital assets in computing the costs which\r\n\ncould be offset against the income of a self-employed  individual\r\n\nto  determine whether  that person  met the  national eligibility\r\n\nstandard.   See 36 Fed. Reg.  14102, 14107 (July 29,  1971).  Six\r                         \r\n\nyears later,  Congress overhauled  the Act.   It directed,  inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia,   that  for   purposes  of   determining  eligibility   for\r              \r\n\nparticipation  in  the  Program,  a person's  income  should  not\r\n\ninclude the \"cost of producing self-employment income.\"  7 U.S.C.\r\n\n   2014(d)(9).  Though Congress  did not define  the term \"cost,\"\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthe  House   Committee  on  Agriculture  noted,   seemingly  with\r\n\napprobation,  that existing  Program  regulations  did not  treat\r\n\nprincipal  payments as  a \"cost\"  that could  be set  off against\r\n\nincome.  See H. Rep. No. 464, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 25, reprinted\r                                                                           \r\n\nin 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1978, 2001-02.\r            \r\n\n          Throughout, the Secretary has consistently hewed to the\r\n\nposition that principal payments on capital assets are not a cost\r\n\nof  producing self-employment  income.    The current  regulation\r\n\nepitomizes this  longstanding viewpoint;  it states  that \"cost,\"\r\n\nwhen figured  for that purpose, shall not  include \"[p]ayments on\r\n\nthe  principal of  the  purchase price  of income-producing  real\r\n\nestate  and  capital  assets,  equipment,  machinery,  and  other\r\n\ndurable goods.\"  7 C.F.R.   273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A).\r\n\nII.  THE COURSE OF LITIGATION\r          II.  THE COURSE OF LITIGATION\r\n\n          Mr. and Mrs. Strickland operate a construction business\r\n\nin  Belgrade,  Maine (where  they reside).   When  their business\r\n\nfaltered, they  applied for  admission to the  Program and  began\r\n\nreceiving  benefits.    In  1993  the  DHS  determined  that  the\r\n\nStricklands'  average monthly  income  was more  than double  the\r\n\nProgram's eligibility limit.   Had they been  permitted to deduct\r\n\ndepreciation on business equipment as a \"cost of  producing self-\r\n\nemployment income,\"  they would  have remained eligible  for food\r\n\nstamp assistance.   Consequently, they challenged  the regulation\r\n\nthat  excluded  depreciation,  7  C.F.R.     273.11(a)(4)(ii)(D),\r\n\narguing that it had been promulgated in derogation  of 7 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2014(d)(9).  See Strickland I,  48 F.3d at 15-16.  In  due season\r                                       \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthe  appellants  asserted claims  against  both the  DHS  and the\r\n\nSecretary, and  the district  court certified the  Stricklands as\r\n\nrepresentatives of a class of \"all Maine food stamp applicants or\r\n\nrecipients adversely affected  by the []  regulation on or  after\r\n\nJuly 1, 1992.\"  Id. at 16.\r                             \r\n\n          The appellants enjoyed some initial success.  After the\r\n\nparties  submitted  the case  on a  stipulated record,  the trial\r\n\ncourt  invalidated the Secretary's  \"no depreciation\" regulation.\r\n\nSee Strickland v. Commissioner, Me. DHS, 849 F. Supp. 818 (D. Me.\r                                                 \r\n\n1994).  We reversed, finding ambiguity in the term \"cost\" as used\r\n\nin  the  statutory  phrase  \"cost  of  producing  self-employment\r\n\nincome.\"   See  Strickland I,  48  F.3d at  19.   Stressing  that\r                                      \r\n\nambiguity made deference  appropriate, we upheld  the Secretary's\r\n\nright  to  exclude  depreciation  from \"cost\"  as  a  permissible\r\n\nrendition  of the statute.   See id. at  21.  In what  may now be\r                                              \r\n\nviewed as an overabundance of caution, we noted that the parties'\r\n\narguments in Strickland I  did \"not require us to  decide whether\r                                   \r\n\nself-employed  food   stamp   recipients  must   be  given   some\r\n\nalternative deduction, such as a deduction for replacement costs,\r\n\nin recognition of either  the cost of acquiring capital  goods or\r\n\ntheir consumption in  the course of producing income.\"  Id. at 21\r                                                                     \r\n\nn.6.1\r\n\n          Apparently  convinced that  a  judicial  footnote is  a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1That issue  was neither  briefed nor  argued in  this court\r\nduring  the  pendency  of  Strickland  I.    In  any  event,  the\r                                                  \r\nappellants  had told the district court that they did not dispute\r\nthe  Secretary's  authority  to  disallow  principal  payments on\r\nequipment loans as a cost of producing self-employment income. \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nterrible thing  to waste,  the Stricklands  promptly reformulated\r\n\ntheir   suit  to   challenge   that  portion   of   7  C.F.R.    \r\n\n273.11(a)(4)(ii)  in  which  the  Secretary purposed  to  exclude\r\n\npayments on  the  principal  of the  purchase  price  of  capital\r\n\nassets, averring that a favorable  finding would entitle them  to\r\n\ncontinued eligibility for food stamp assistance.\r\n\n          This  about-face proved  unproductive.    The  district\r\n\ncourt  granted summary judgment in favor of the state and federal\r\n\ndefendants,  holding  that  the  Secretary  permissibly  excluded\r\n\nprincipal  payments in  determining the  cost of  producing self-\r\n\nemployment income.  See Strickland  v. Commissioner, Me. DHS, 921\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.  Supp. 21, 24 (D.  Me. 1996) (Strickland  II) (concluding that\r                                                         \r\n\n\"if the Secretary is not required to recognize even depreciation,\r\n\nhe  certainly  cannot be  required  to  recognize cash  principal\r                                            \r\n\npayments\").  This appeal followed.\r\n\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r          III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          Because the interpretation  of a statute or  regulation\r\n\npresents  a   purely   legal  question,   courts   subject   that\r\n\ninterpretation  to de novo review.  See United States v. Gifford,\r                                                                          \r\n\n17  F.3d  462, 472  (1st  Cir. 1994);  Liberty  Mut. Ins.  Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCommercial Union Ins.  Co., 978  F.2d 750, 757  (1st Cir.  1992).\r                                    \r\n\nThis standard of  review is between appellate tribunals and lower\r\n\ncourts.   It  does not  diminish the  deference that  courts must\r\n\naccord  to  authoritative  interpretations  of  opaque  statutory\r\n\nprovisions  undertaken by  those whom  Congress has  empowered to\r\n\nadminister  or enforce  particular laws.    As we  have regularly\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nheld, such  deference is due the Secretary's  interpretation of a\r\n\nless-than-pellucid food stamp statute.   See, e.g., Strickland I,\r                                                                          \r\n\n48 F.3d at  16; Massachusetts  v.

ANALYSIS\r          IV.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          When  courts review  an  agency's  interpretation of  a\r\n\nstatute  that it administers, Chevron directs them to engage in a\r                                               \r\n\nbifurcated  inquiry.  See Passamaquoddy Tribe v. State of Me., 75\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 784, 794  (1st Cir. 1996); Strickland I, 48 F.3d  at 16.  In\r                                                      \r\n\nan oft-quoted passage, the Chevron Court delineated the nature of\r                                            \r\n\nthe inquiry:\r\n\n          First,  always,  is   the  question   whether\r\n          Congress has directly  spoken to the  precise\r\n          question at issue.  If the intent of Congress\r\n          is clear, that is the  end of the matter; for\r\n          the court,  as well as the  agency, must give\r\n          effect to the unambiguously  expressed intent\r\n          of   Congress.     If,  however,   the  court\r\n          determines   Congress    has   not   directly\r\n          addressed the precise  question at issue, the\r\n          court   does  not   simply  impose   its  own\r\n          construction  on the  statute,  as  would  be\r\n          necessary in the absence of an administrative\r\n          interpretation.   Rather,  if the  statute is\r\n          silent  or  ambiguous  with  respect  to  the\r\n          specific issue, the question for the court is\r\n          whether the  agency's  answer is  based on  a\r\n          permissible construction of the statute.\r\n\nChevron, 467 U.S. at  842-43 (footnotes omitted).  These  are the\r                 \r\n\nsame questions that this  court posed in Strickland I, 48 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n16, and we retrace our steps to the extent appropriate.\r\n\n                                A\r                                          A\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          We  first look  to see  if Congress  has spoken  to the\r\n\nprecise question  at issue by  mandating either the  inclusion or\r\n\nthe exclusion  of principal payments  on capital assets  from the\r\n\ncomputation of  the  \"cost of  producing self-employment  income\"\r\n\nunder 7 U.S.C.    2014(d)(9).2  Since this branch  of the inquiry\r\n\ndeals exclusively  with statutory construction  and congressional\r\n\nintent, no deference is due the Secretary's views.\r\n\n          In  Strickland  I we  determined  that  the statute,  7\r                                     \r\n\nU.S.C.   2014(d)(9), did not  require depreciation to be included\r\n\nas  a \"cost  of producing self-employment  income.\"   In reaching\r\n\nthis conclusion, we focused on the ambiguity inherent in the word\r\n\n\"cost\"   a word that Congress  chose not to define.  We concluded\r\n\nthat  \"the word  `cost'  is a  chameleon,  capable of  taking  on\r\n\ndifferent  meanings,  and shades  of  meaning,  depending on  the\r\n\nsubject matter  and the circumstances of  each particular usage.\"\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2In their complaint, the appellants asked the district court\r\nto strike down  the Secretary's  policy, embodied in  7 C.F.R.   \r\n273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A),  of disallowing  principal payments  made to\r\npurchase capital assets (which  they term \"capital costs\").   The\r\ndistrict court  confined its ruling accordingly.   See Strickland\r                                                                           \r\nII, 921  F. Supp. at 24-25.  At oral argument before us, however,\r            \r\nthe appellants'  counsel suggested that the  pivotal issue should\r\nbe  cast  in broader  terms; he  posed  the ultimate  question of\r\nwhether  the  Secretary's  general   regulatory  scheme,  in  not\r\nallowing any  offset for wear and tear on capital assets by means\r\nof   depreciation,   principal   payments,   or   otherwise,   is\r\npermissible.  For purposes  of Chevron's first step, it  makes no\r                                                \r\ndifference whether we  accept or reject  this formulation of  the\r\nissue.  Because the statute (and, particularly, the  word \"cost\")\r\nis ambiguous,  see text  infra, either formulation  of the  issue\r                                        \r\nleads ineluctably to the second step of the Chevron inquiry.\r                                                             \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nStrickland I, 48  F.3d at 19.3  We  therefore found that Congress\r                      \r\n\nhad not spoken directly  to the matter at issue.  See  id. at 19-\r                                                                    \r\n\n20.\r\n\n          Although Strickland I did  not address exactly the same\r                                         \r\n\nquestion that  confronts  us today,  we agree  with the  district\r\n\ncourt that its analysis  controls.  The appellants would  have us\r\n\nbelieve  that  by  some thaumaturgical  sleight-of-hand  the word\r\n\n\"cost\" has acquired a  plain meaning in the brief  interval since\r\n\nwe decided  Strickland I.  They seek  to persuade us that, though\r                                  \r\n\n\"cost\"  was  not   clear  enough  to   force  the  inclusion   of\r\n\ndepreciation,  the word nonetheless  possesses sufficient clarity\r\n\nto force  the inclusion of  either principal payments  on capital\r\n\nassets,  or, at least, some  offset for the  expense of acquiring\r\n\nand  using up  such  assets.4   We  are unconvinced.    Statutory\r\n\nambiguity does not flash on and  off like a bank of strobe lights\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Though noting  the open question as  to whether legislative\r\nhistory  could  be considered  at the  first  stage of  a Chevron\r                                                                           \r\ninquiry, see Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16-18, we examined the slim\r                                   \r\nlegislative history underpinning 7 U.S.C.   2014(d)(9) and deemed\r\nit  insufficient to \"suck the elasticity from the word `cost' and\r\nconvey an  `unambiguously expressed intent of  Congress,'\" id. at\r                                                                        \r\n19-20 (quoting  Chevron, 467  U.S. at  842-43).   That conclusion\r                                 \r\nremains unscathed.\r\n\n     4In  this  connection, we  are  puzzled  by the  appellants'\r\nreliance on Estey  v. Commissioner,  Me. DHS, 21  F.3d 1198  (1st\r                                                      \r\nCir. 1994).  We ruled there that the term \"energy assistance\" had\r\na generally understood meaning and  then proceeded to apply  that\r\nmeaning to a  particular set of  facts.  See  id. at 1201,  1207.\r                                                           \r\nThe appellants'  suggestion that the  term \"cost\" has  an equally\r\nfamiliar meaning   a meaning  that includes principal payments on\r\ncapital  assets as a component of \"cost\"    flies in the teeth of\r\nour unequivocal holding that \"cost,\" as that term is used  in the\r\nAct,  does not have any readily apparent meaning.  See Strickland\r                                                                           \r\nI, 48 F.3d at 19.\r           \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nat a discotheque, shining brightly at the time of one lawsuit and\r\n\nthen vanishing mysteriously in the interlude before the next suit\r\n\nappears.\r\n\n          We need not  dawdle.   There is nothing  in the  record\r\n\nbefore  us to indicate  that Congress  ever had  an unambiguously\r\n\nexpressed intent to include  principal payments on capital assets\r\n\nas a cost of producing  self-employment income.  The text  of the\r\n\nstatute  does not encourage such  a construction and  there is no\r\n\nlegislative history  (beyond that  already considered  and deemed\r\n\ninsufficient  in Strickland  I, 48 F.3d  at 19-20)  that supports\r                                        \r\n\nincluding principal payments  or any proxy therefor  as a \"cost.\"\r\n\nTo the precise contrary, all the extrinsic evidence suggests that\r\n\nCongress  concurred in  the Secretary's longstanding  decision to\r\n\ndisregard  such payments.   The most persuasive  datum comes from\r\n\nthe  archives of the Program.   The Secretary  had been excluding\r\n\nprincipal  payments from  the cost  of producing  self-employment\r\n\nincome for several years by the time Congress enacted  7 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2014(d)(9).   That  being so,  the presumption  is that  Congress\r\n\nintended  the word  \"cost\"  to be  given  the same  meaning  that\r\n\nalready  had been  established in  the regulatory  context.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCommissioner v. Keystone Consol.

This contention reflects a\r\nmisunderstanding of the thrust of our opinion.  The first step of\r\na Chevron  inquiry  requires a  court  to determine  whether  the\r                   \r\nlanguage of a  statute is  susceptible to more  than one  natural\r\nmeaning.    Finding \"cost\"  to  be  inherently ambiguous  in  the\r\ncontext of the Act, we held that plain meaning did not  foreclose\r\nthe Secretary's decision to exclude depreciation from the cost of\r\nproducing self-employment income.   See Strickland I, 48 F.3d  at\r                                                              \r\n19.   Our intention was to  explain why the courts  must defer to\r\nany   permissible  interpretation  of   \"cost\"  adopted   by  the\r             \r\nSecretary,  not  to endorse  a  particular  conception of  \"cost\"\r\n(whether it  be that of an  economist, a layman, or  a food stamp\r\nrecipient).\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nThus,  an interpretive  regulation must be  honored unless  it is\r\n\n\"arbitrary, capricious,  or manifestly contrary to  the statute.\"\r\n\nChevron, 467 U.S.  at 844.  In deciding this  issue, a court must\r                 \r\n\navoid inserting its own policy considerations into the mix.  \"The\r\n\nagency need  not write a rule that serves the statute in the best\r\n\nor most  logical manner; it  need only  write a  rule that  flows\r\n\nrationally  from a  permissible  construction  of  the  statute.\"\r\n\nStrickland I,  48 F.3d at  17; accord  Cohen v.

Bullen,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1996) [No.\r                                   \r\n\n95-1849, slip op. at 24].\r\n\n          Applying  these standards,  we readily conclude  that 7\r\n\nC.F.R.    273.11(a)(4)(ii) is within  the pale.   The regulation,\r\n\nwhich  reflects the  agency's consistent  interpretation for  the\r\n\npast  quarter-century, emanates  from the  Secretary's reasonable\r\n\ndetermination that the purpose  of the Act is to  help low-income\r\n\nfamilies  purchase food,  not  to underwrite  the acquisition  of\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\ncapital assets.6  To  be sure, rental payments on  capital assets\r\n\nare, as the  appellants point  out, deductible as  a \"cost,\"  but\r\n\nsuch  payments  easily   can  be  distinguished  from   principal\r\n\npayments.   When one leases  a capital asset  (say, a tractor) no\r\n\nownership  interest  is  acquired,  and  the  lease  payments  go\r\n\nentirely toward producing  self-employment income.   By contrast,\r\n\nwhen one  buys a capital asset  and pays for  it in installments,\r\n\nthe payments  not only permit  the payer  to use the  asset as  a\r\n\nmeans of producing self-employment income  but also permit him to\r\n\nbuild  equity.  This additional feature changes the nature of the\r\n\ntransaction.   The  Secretary's regulation  reasonably  seeks  to\r\n\navoid subsidizing such \"dual purpose\" payments.\r\n\n          Of  course, the appellants now  put a different spin on\r\n\nthe situation.   See supra note 2.  They suggest that, instead of\r                                    \r\n\nappraising  the validity  of 7  C.F.R.    273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A), we\r\n\nshould view the matter in broader terms and determine whether the\r\n\nSecretary must allow some offset for expenses associated with the\r                                   \r\n\nacquisition  and depletion of capital  assets used in  a trade or\r\n\nbusiness.\r\n\n          Passing  potential  procedural problems  and addressing\r\n\nthis  argument on the merits, it does not benefit the appellants.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Our  determination that  the Secretary  reasonably excluded\r\nprincipal payments  on capital assets from the  cost of producing\r\nself-employment  income  is bolstered  by  the  evidence, already\r\nchronicled, that this interpretation of \"cost\" is very likely the\r\none that  Congress  intended.   See  supra pp.  10-11.   When  an\r                                                    \r\nagency's  interpretation  jibes  with  discernible  congressional\r\nintent, a  court is  hard-pressed to declare  that interpretation\r\nimpermissible under Chevron's second step.\r                                     \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nTheir premise is that, by putting capital assets to one side, the\r\n\nSecretary has defined \"cost  of producing self-employment income\"\r\n\nso grudgingly as to frustrate Congress' intent.  But this premise\r\n\nis  faulty.   The Secretary  has not ignored  the costs  of doing\r\n\nbusiness; rather,  he has recognized numerous  items as allowable\r\n\ncosts, e.g.,  labor, stock, inventory,  business-related interest\r\n\n(including  interest  associated  with  installment  payments  on\r\n\ncapital  assets), and  taxes paid  on income-producing  property.\r\n\nSee  7  C.F.R.    273.11(a)(4)(i).    He  simply  has refused  to\r             \r\n\nrecognize the kind of costs for which the appellants seek credit,\r\n\nsaying in  effect that  when a  self-employed person  is building\r\n\nequity  (a  phenomenon  that  almost  invariably  accompanies the\r\n\npurchase  of capital  assets), the  Secretary will  define \"cost\"\r\n\nvery restrictively (probably because no good way exists to give a\r\n\ncredit  for expenses  related to  the purchase of  capital assets\r\n\nwithout also subsidizing some intangible ownership interest).  As\r\n\na result, food stamp  recipients who buy capital assets  are able\r\n\nto claim  relatively few offsets  for the expense  connected with\r\n\nacquiring and using those assets.\r\n\n          We   frankly   acknowledge    that   the    Secretary's\r\n\ninterpretation is  a  harsh  one,  especially as  it  relates  to\r\n\npersons in the appellants' position.  The regulatory edifice that\r\n\nnow exists may not be the  one which we, if building on an  empty\r\n\nsite, would choose to  construct.  But that is largely beside the\r\n\npoint.  The term \"cost\" is ambiguous, and a harsh interpretation,\r\n\nas here, which  arises out of the Secretary's  reasonable refusal\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nto subsidize ownership, is not per se arbitrary or capricious.\r                                               \r\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further.   The  \"cost of producing  self-\r\n\nemployment  income,\"  7 U.S.C.     2014(d)(9),  is imprecise  and\r\n\nCongress has neither specified that payments designed to amortize\r\n\nthe  purchase price of capital assets  must be deemed part of the\r\n\ncost  nor   decreed  that  some  equivalent   write-off  must  be\r\n\nrecognized in calculating the cost.

Nancy and Lyle Strickland, the appellants here, issue a similar call, again requesting that this court invalidate a regulation which the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) promulgated under authority granted by the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2011-2025 (1988) (the Act).  In  Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and upheld a portion of the regulation that gave meaning to an ambiguous phrase contained within the Act.  See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 21 (upholding 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(D) (1994) as a reasonable rendition of 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9)).  This second time around the appellants seek to strike down a different (but closely related) section of the same regulation.  Because  Chevron is still the law of the land, we affirm the lower court's entry of summary judgment in the appellees' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First enacted in 1964, the Act is designed \"to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households.\"  7 U.S.C. &#167; 2011;  see generally Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 14-15.   The states administer most aspects of the Food Stamp Program (the Program) while the federal government underwrites the cost (which now amounts to some $29 billion per year).  Recipients, whose eligibility is determined by income and family size, receive assistance in the form of coupons that may be used to purchase groceries at local stores.  In order to implement the Program, Congress has authorized the Secretary to promulgate \"such regulations ... as [he] deems necessary or appropriate for the effective and efficient administration\" of the Program's federal aspects.  See 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2013(a), (c).  Responsibility for other elements of the Program devolves upon state agencies.  In Maine, that obligation reposes with the Department of Human Services (DHS).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1971, Congress instructed the Secretary to set national eligibility standards for the Program.  The Secretary did so.  Of particular interest for present purposes, the Secretary barred any consideration of principal payments made on the purchase price of capital assets in computing the costs which could be offset against the income of a self-employed individual to determine whether that person met the national eligibility standard.  See 36 Fed.Reg. 14102, 14107 (July 29, 1971).  Six years later, Congress overhauled the Act.  It directed, inter alia, that for purposes of determining eligibility for participation in the Program, a person's income should not include the \"cost of producing self-employment income.\"  7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9).  Though Congress did not define the term \"cost,\" the House Committee on Agriculture noted, seemingly with approbation, that existing Program regulations did not treat principal payments as a \"cost\" that could be set off against income.  See H. Rep.  No. 464, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 25,  reprinted in 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1704, 1978, 2001-02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout, the Secretary has consistently hewed to the position that principal payments on capital assets are not a cost of producing self-employment income.  The current regulation epitomizes this longstanding viewpoint;  it states that \"cost,\" when figured for that purpose, shall not include \"[p]ayments on the principal of the purchase price of income-producing real estate and capital assets, equipment, machinery, and other durable goods.\"  7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE COURSE OF LITIGATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. and Mrs. Strickland operate a construction business in Belgrade, Maine (where they reside).  When their business faltered, they applied for admission to the Program and began receiving benefits.  In 1993 the DHS determined that the Stricklands' average monthly income was more than double the Program's eligibility limit.  Had they been permitted to deduct depreciation on business equipment as a \"cost of producing self-employment income,\" they would have remained eligible for food stamp assistance.  Consequently, they challenged the regulation that excluded depreciation, 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(D), arguing that it had been promulgated in derogation of 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9).  See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 15-16.   In due season the appellants asserted claims against both the DHS and the Secretary, and the district court certified the Stricklands as representatives of a class of \"all Maine food stamp applicants or recipients adversely affected by the [ ] regulation on or after July 1, 1992.\"   Id. at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants enjoyed some initial success.  After the parties submitted the case on a stipulated record, the trial court invalidated the Secretary's \"no depreciation\" regulation.  See Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.  DHS, 849 F.Supp. 818 (D.Me.1994).  We reversed, finding ambiguity in the term \"cost\" as used in the statutory phrase \"cost of producing self-employment income.\"   See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19.   Stressing that ambiguity made deference appropriate, we upheld the Secretary's right to exclude depreciation from \"cost\" as a permissible rendition of the statute.  See id. at 21.   In what may now be viewed as an overabundance of caution, we noted that the parties' arguments in  Strickland I did \"not require us to decide whether self-employed food stamp recipients must be given some alternative deduction, such as a deduction for replacement costs, in recognition of either the cost of acquiring capital goods or their consumption in the course of producing income.\"   Id. at 21 n. 6.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently convinced that a judicial footnote is a terrible thing to waste, the Stricklands promptly reformulated their suit to challenge that portion of 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii) in which the Secretary purposed to exclude payments on the principal of the purchase price of capital assets, averring that a favorable finding would entitle them to continued eligibility for food stamp assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This about-face proved unproductive.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state and federal defendants, holding that the Secretary permissibly excluded principal payments in determining the cost of producing self-employment income.  See Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.  DHS, 921 F.Supp. 21, 24 (D.Me.1996) (Strickland II ) (concluding that \"if the Secretary is not required to recognize even depreciation, he certainly cannot be required to recognize cash principal payments\").  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the interpretation of a statute or regulation presents a purely legal question, courts subject that interpretation to de novo review.  See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 472 (1st Cir.1994);   Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir.1992).  This standard of review is between appellate tribunals and lower courts.  It does not diminish the deference that courts must accord to authoritative interpretations of opaque statutory provisions undertaken by those whom Congress has empowered to administer or enforce particular laws.  As we have regularly held, such deference is due the Secretary's interpretation of a less-than-pellucid food stamp statute.  See, e.g., Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16;   Massachusetts v. Secretary of Agric., 984 F.2d 514, 520-21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 822, 114 S.Ct. 81, 126 L.Ed.2d 49 (1993);  see also 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2013(a), (c) (empowering the Secretary to administer the Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When courts review an agency's interpretation of a statute that it administers,  Chevron directs them to engage in a bifurcated inquiry.  See Passamaquoddy Tribe v. State of Me., 75 F.3d 784, 794 (1st Cir.1996);   Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16.   In an oft-quoted passage, the  Chevron Court delineated the nature of the inquiry:First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.  If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter;  for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.  If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.  Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82 (footnotes omitted).  These are the same questions that this court posed in  Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16, and we retrace our steps to the extent appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* We first look to see if Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue by mandating either the inclusion or the exclusion of principal payments on capital assets from the computation of the \"cost of producing self-employment income\" under 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Since this branch of the inquiry deals exclusively with statutory construction and congressional intent, no deference is due the Secretary's views.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  Strickland I we determined that the statute, 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9), did not require depreciation to be included as a \"cost of producing self-employment income.\"   In reaching this conclusion, we focused on the ambiguity inherent in the word \"cost\"--a word that Congress chose not to define.  We concluded that \"the word 'cost' is a chameleon, capable of taking on different meanings, and shades of meaning, depending on the subject matter and the circumstances of each particular usage.\"   Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We therefore found that Congress had not spoken directly to the matter at issue.  See id. at 19-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although  Strickland I did not address exactly the same question that confronts us today, we agree with the district court that its analysis controls.  The appellants would have us believe that by some thaumaturgical sleight-of-hand the word \"cost\" has acquired a plain meaning in the brief interval since we decided  Strickland I. They seek to persuade us that, though \"cost\" was not clear enough to force the inclusion of depreciation, the word nonetheless possesses sufficient clarity to force the inclusion of either principal payments on capital assets, or, at least, some offset for the expense of acquiring and using up such assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We are unconvinced.  Statutory ambiguity does not flash on and off like a bank of strobe lights at a discotheque, shining brightly at the time of one lawsuit and then vanishing mysteriously in the interlude before the next suit appears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dawdle.  There is nothing in the record before us to indicate that Congress ever had an unambiguously expressed intent to include principal payments on capital assets as a cost of producing self-employment income.  The text of the statute does not encourage such a construction and there is no legislative history (beyond that already considered and deemed insufficient in  Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19-20) that supports including principal payments or any proxy therefor as a \"cost.\"   To the precise contrary, all the extrinsic evidence suggests that Congress concurred in the Secretary's longstanding decision to disregard such payments.  The most persuasive datum comes from the archives of the Program.  The Secretary had been excluding principal payments from the cost of producing self-employment income for several years by the time Congress enacted 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9).  That being so, the presumption is that Congress intended the word \"cost\" to be given the same meaning that already had been established in the regulatory context.  See Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 152, 159, 113 S.Ct. 2006, 2011, 124 L.Ed.2d 71 (1993);   Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, it cannot plausibly be argued that Congress merely overlooked the Secretary's contemporaneous treatment of principal payments, for the House Committee on Agriculture explicitly recognized the prevailing practice.  See H. Rep.  No. 464,  supra, 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2001-02.   This combination--congressional awareness of an existing administrative praxis coupled with a concomitant unwillingness to revise that praxis--strongly implies legislative approval.  \"[W]hen Congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without pertinent change, the 'congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency's interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.' \"   CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 846, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 3254, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986) (quoting  NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 274-75, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1761-62, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) (footnotes omitted)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, because Congress has not plainly resolved the interpretive question that is now before us, we must move to the second step of the  Chevron pavane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the second stage of a  Chevron analysis, an inquiring court accords substantial respect to authoritative agency interpretations.  See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 17-18.   Thus, an interpretive regulation must be honored unless it is \"arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\"   Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782.   In deciding this issue, a court must avoid inserting its own policy considerations into the mix.  \"The agency need not write a rule that serves the statute in the best or most logical manner;  it need only write a rule that flows rationally from a permissible construction of the statute.\"   Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 17;  accord Cohen v. Brown Univ., 991 F.2d 888, 899 (1st Cir.1993).  Though the level of respect varies with the circumstances, deference to an agency's interpretation is \"particularly appropriate in complex and highly specialized areas where the regulatory net has been intricately woven.\"  Massachusetts Dept. of Educ. v. United States Dept. of Educ., 837 F.2d 536, 541 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting  Citizens Sav. Bank v. Bell, 605 F.Supp. 1033, 1041 (D.R.I.1985)).  Moreover, longstanding agency interpretations generally receive greater deference than newly contrived ones.  See Visiting Nurse Ass'n of No. Shore, Inc. v. Bullen, 93 F.3d 997, 1008 (1st Cir.1996) .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards, we readily conclude that 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii) is within the pale.  The regulation, which reflects the agency's consistent interpretation for the past quarter-century, emanates from the Secretary's reasonable determination that the purpose of the Act is to help low-income families purchase food, not to underwrite the acquisition of capital assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  To be sure, rental payments on capital assets are, as the appellants point out, deductible as a \"cost,\" but such payments easily can be distinguished from principal payments.  When one leases a capital asset (say, a tractor) no ownership interest is acquired, and the lease payments go entirely toward producing self-employment income.  By contrast, when one buys a capital asset and pays for it in installments, the payments not only permit the payer to use the asset as a means of producing self-employment income but also permit him to build equity.  This additional feature changes the nature of the transaction.  The Secretary's regulation reasonably seeks to avoid subsidizing such \"dual purpose\" payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the appellants now put a different spin on the situation.  See supra note 2. They suggest that, instead of appraising the validity of 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A), we should view the matter in broader terms and determine whether the Secretary must allow some offset for expenses associated with the acquisition and depletion of capital assets used in a trade or business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Passing potential procedural problems and addressing this argument on the merits, it does not benefit the appellants.  Their premise is that, by putting capital assets to one side, the Secretary has defined \"cost of producing self-employment income\" so grudgingly as to frustrate Congress' intent.  But this premise is faulty.  The Secretary has not ignored the costs of doing business;  rather, he has recognized numerous items as allowable costs, e.g., labor, stock, inventory, business-related interest (including interest associated with installment payments on capital assets), and taxes paid on income-producing property.  See 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(i).  He simply has refused to recognize the kind of costs for which the appellants seek credit, saying in effect that when a self-employed person is building equity (a phenomenon that almost invariably accompanies the purchase of capital assets), the Secretary will define \"cost\" very restrictively (probably because no good way exists to give a credit for expenses related to the purchase of capital assets without also subsidizing some intangible ownership interest).  As a result, food stamp recipients who buy capital assets are able to claim relatively few offsets for the expense connected with acquiring and using those assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We frankly acknowledge that the Secretary's interpretation is a harsh one, especially as it relates to persons in the appellants' position.  The regulatory edifice that now exists may not be the one which we, if building on an empty site, would choose to construct.  But that is largely beside the point.  The term \"cost\" is ambiguous, and a harsh interpretation, as here, which arises out of the Secretary's reasonable refusal to subsidize ownership, is not per se arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The \"cost of producing self-employment income,\" 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9), is imprecise and Congress has neither specified that payments designed to amortize the purchase price of capital assets must be deemed part of the cost nor decreed that some equivalent write-off must be recognized in calculating the cost.  Thus, the regulation here at issue represents a permissible construction of the statute.  After all, within the wide limits that  Chevron sets, courts must respect the Secretary's policy choices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> That issue was neither briefed nor argued in this court during the pendency of  Strickland I. In any event, the appellants had told the district court that they did not dispute the Secretary's authority to disallow principal payments on equipment loans as a cost of producing self-employment income</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In their complaint, the appellants asked the district court to strike down the Secretary's policy, embodied in 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A), of disallowing principal payments made to purchase capital assets (which they term \"capital costs\").  The district court confined its ruling accordingly.  See Strickland II, 921 F.Supp. at 24-25.   At oral argument before us, however, the appellants' counsel suggested that the pivotal issue should be cast in broader terms;  he posed the ultimate question of whether the Secretary's general regulatory scheme, in not allowing any offset for wear and tear on capital assets by means of depreciation, principal payments, or otherwise, is permissible.  For purposes of  Chevron 's first step, it makes no difference whether we accept or reject this formulation of the issue.  Because the statute (and, particularly, the word \"cost\") is ambiguous, see text  infra, either formulation of the issue leads ineluctably to the second step of the  Chevron inquiry</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Though noting the open question as to whether legislative history could be considered at the first stage of a  Chevron inquiry, see Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16-18, we examined the slim legislative history underpinning 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9) and deemed it insufficient to \"suck the elasticity from the word 'cost' and convey an 'unambiguously expressed intent of Congress,' \"  id. at 19-20 (quoting  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781).

Commissioner, Me.  DHS, 21 F.3d 1198 (1st Cir.1994).  We ruled there that the term \"energy assistance\" had a generally understood meaning and then proceeded to apply that meaning to a particular set of facts.  See id. at 1201, 1207.   The appellants' suggestion that the term \"cost\" has an equally familiar meaning--a meaning that includes principal payments on capital assets as a component of \"cost\"--flies in the teeth of our unequivocal holding that \"cost,\" as that term is used in the Act, does not have any readily apparent meaning.  See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We dismiss out of hand the appellants' contention that  Strickland I etched in stone a particular conception of \"cost,\" equating the word with cash outlays.  This contention reflects a misunderstanding of the thrust of our opinion.  The first step of a  Chevron inquiry requires a court to determine whether the language of a statute is susceptible to more than one natural meaning.  Finding \"cost\" to be inherently ambiguous in the context of the Act, we held that plain meaning did not foreclose the Secretary's decision to exclude depreciation from the cost of producing self-employment income.  See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19.   Our intention was to explain why the courts must defer to any permissible interpretation of \"cost\" adopted by the Secretary, not to endorse a particular conception of \"cost\" (whether it be that of an economist, a layman, or a food stamp recipient)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Our determination that the Secretary reasonably excluded principal payments on capital assets from the cost of producing self-employment income is bolstered by the evidence, already chronicled, that this interpretation of \"cost\" is very likely the one that Congress intended.  See supra p. 547.   When an agency's interpretation jibes with discernible congressional intent, a court is hard-pressed to declare that interpretation impermissible under  Chevron 's second step</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Because  Chevron is still the law of the land, we affirm the lower court's entry of summary judgment in the appellees' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First enacted in 1964, the Act is designed \"to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households.\"  7 U.S.C. &#167; 2011;  see generally Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 14-15.   The states administer most aspects of the Food Stamp Program (the Program) while the federal government underwrites the cost (which now amounts to some $29 billion per year).  Recipients, whose eligibility is determined by income and family size, receive assistance in the form of coupons that may be used to purchase groceries at local stores.  In order to implement the Program, Congress has authorized the Secretary to promulgate \"such regulations ... as [he] deems necessary or appropriate for the effective and efficient administration\" of the Program's federal aspects.  See 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2013(a), (c).  Responsibility for other elements of the Program devolves upon state agencies.  In Maine, that obligation reposes with the Department of Human Services (DHS).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1971, Congress instructed the Secretary to set national eligibility standards for the Program.  The Secretary did so.  Of particular interest for present purposes, the Secretary barred any consideration of principal payments made on the purchase price of capital assets in computing the costs which could be offset against the income of a self-employed individual to determine whether that person met the national eligibility standard.  See 36 Fed.Reg. 14102, 14107 (July 29, 1971).  Six years later, Congress overhauled the Act.  It directed, inter alia, that for purposes of determining eligibility for participation in the Program, a person's income should not include the \"cost of producing self-employment income.\"  7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9).  Though Congress did not define the term \"cost,\" the House Committee on Agriculture noted, seemingly with approbation, that existing Program regulations did not treat principal payments as a \"cost\" that could be set off against income.  See H. Rep.  No. 464, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 25,  reprinted in 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1704, 1978, 2001-02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout, the Secretary has consistently hewed to the position that principal payments on capital assets are not a cost of producing self-employment income.  The current regulation epitomizes this longstanding viewpoint;  it states that \"cost,\" when figured for that purpose, shall not include \"[p]ayments on the principal of the purchase price of income-producing real estate and capital assets, equipment, machinery, and other durable goods.\"  7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE COURSE OF LITIGATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. and Mrs. Strickland operate a construction business in Belgrade, Maine (where they reside).  When their business faltered, they applied for admission to the Program and began receiving benefits.  In 1993 the DHS determined that the Stricklands' average monthly income was more than double the Program's eligibility limit.  Had they been permitted to deduct depreciation on business equipment as a \"cost of producing self-employment income,\" they would have remained eligible for food stamp assistance.  Consequently, they challenged the regulation that excluded depreciation, 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(D), arguing that it had been promulgated in derogation of 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9).  See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 15-16.   In due season the appellants asserted claims against both the DHS and the Secretary, and the district court certified the Stricklands as representatives of a class of \"all Maine food stamp applicants or recipients adversely affected by the [ ] regulation on or after July 1, 1992.\"   Id. at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants enjoyed some initial success.  After the parties submitted the case on a stipulated record, the trial court invalidated the Secretary's \"no depreciation\" regulation.  See Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.  DHS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></span> (D.Me.1994).  We reversed, finding ambiguity in the term \"cost\" as used in the statutory phrase \"cost of producing self-employment income.\"   See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19.   Stressing that ambiguity made deference appropriate, we upheld the Secretary's right to exclude depreciation from \"cost\" as a permissible rendition of the statute.  See id. at 21.   In what may now be viewed as an overabundance of caution, we noted that the parties' arguments in  Strickland I did \"not require us to decide whether self-employed food stamp recipients must be given some alternative deduction, such as a deduction for replacement costs, in recognition of either the cost of acquiring capital goods or their consumption in the course of producing income.\"   Id. at 21 n. 6.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently convinced that a judicial footnote is a terrible thing to waste, the Stricklands promptly reformulated their suit to challenge that portion of 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii) in which the Secretary purposed to exclude payments on the principal of the purchase price of capital assets, averring that a favorable finding would entitle them to continued eligibility for food stamp assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This about-face proved unproductive.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state and federal defendants, holding that the Secretary permissibly excluded principal payments in determining the cost of producing self-employment income.  See Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.  DHS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, 24 (D.Me.1996) (Strickland II ) (concluding that \"if the Secretary is not required to recognize even depreciation, he certainly cannot be required to recognize cash principal payments\").  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the interpretation of a statute or regulation presents a purely legal question, courts subject that interpretation to de novo review.  See United States v. Gifford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 472 (1st Cir.1994);   Liberty Mut.

This standard of review is between appellate tribunals and lower courts.  It does not diminish the deference that courts must accord to authoritative interpretations of opaque statutory provisions undertaken by those whom Congress has empowered to administer or enforce particular laws.  As we have regularly held, such deference is due the Secretary's interpretation of a less-than-pellucid food stamp statute.  See, e.g., Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16;   Massachusetts v. Secretary of Agric., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599123\"><a href=\"/opinion/599123/commonwealth-of-massachusetts-department-of-public-welfare-v-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 520-21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When courts review an agency's interpretation of a statute that it administers,  Chevron directs them to engage in a bifurcated inquiry.  See Passamaquoddy Tribe v. State of Me., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196568\"><a href=\"/opinion/196568/passamaquoddy-tribe-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, 794 (1st Cir.1996);   Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16.   In an oft-quoted passage, the  Chevron Court delineated the nature of the inquiry:First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.  If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter;  for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.  If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.  Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82 (footnotes omitted).  These are the same questions that this court posed in  Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16, and we retrace our steps to the extent appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* We first look to see if Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue by mandating either the inclusion or the exclusion of principal payments on capital assets from the computation of the \"cost of producing self-employment income\" under 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Since this branch of the inquiry deals exclusively with statutory construction and congressional intent, no deference is due the Secretary's views.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  Strickland I we determined that the statute, 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9), did not require depreciation to be included as a \"cost of producing self-employment income.\"   In reaching this conclusion, we focused on the ambiguity inherent in the word \"cost\"--a word that Congress chose not to define.  We concluded that \"the word 'cost' is a chameleon, capable of taking on different meanings, and shades of meaning, depending on the subject matter and the circumstances of each particular usage.\"   Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We therefore found that Congress had not spoken directly to the matter at issue.  See id. at 19-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although  Strickland I did not address exactly the same question that confronts us today, we agree with the district court that its analysis controls.  The appellants would have us believe that by some thaumaturgical sleight-of-hand the word \"cost\" has acquired a plain meaning in the brief interval since we decided  Strickland I. They seek to persuade us that, though \"cost\" was not clear enough to force the inclusion of depreciation, the word nonetheless possesses sufficient clarity to force the inclusion of either principal payments on capital assets, or, at least, some offset for the expense of acquiring and using up such assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We are unconvinced.  Statutory ambiguity does not flash on and off like a bank of strobe lights at a discotheque, shining brightly at the time of one lawsuit and then vanishing mysteriously in the interlude before the next suit appears.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dawdle.  There is nothing in the record before us to indicate that Congress ever had an unambiguously expressed intent to include principal payments on capital assets as a cost of producing self-employment income.  The text of the statute does not encourage such a construction and there is no legislative history (beyond that already considered and deemed insufficient in  Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19-20) that supports including principal payments or any proxy therefor as a \"cost.\"   To the precise contrary, all the extrinsic evidence suggests that Congress concurred in the Secretary's longstanding decision to disregard such payments.  The most persuasive datum comes from the archives of the Program.  The Secretary had been excluding principal payments from the cost of producing self-employment income for several years by the time Congress enacted 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9).  That being so, the presumption is that Congress intended the word \"cost\" to be given the same meaning that already had been established in the regulatory context.  See Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112862\"><a href=\"/opinion/112862/commissioner-v-keystone-consol-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 159, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112862\"><a href=\"/opinion/112862/commissioner-v-keystone-consol-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See H. Rep.  No. 464,  supra, 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2001-02.   This combination--congressional awareness of an existing administrative praxis coupled with a concomitant unwillingness to revise that praxis--strongly implies legislative approval.  \"[W]hen Congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without pertinent change, the 'congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency's interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.' \"   CFTC v.

Though the level of respect varies with the circumstances, deference to an agency's interpretation is \"particularly appropriate in complex and highly specialized areas where the regulatory net has been intricately woven.\"  Massachusetts Dept. of Educ. v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1033</span></a></span>, 1041 (D.R.I.1985)).  Moreover, longstanding agency interpretations generally receive greater deference than newly contrived ones.  See Visiting Nurse Ass'n of No. Shore, Inc. v. Bullen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724996\"><a href=\"/opinion/724996/51-socsecrepser-522-medicare-medicaid-guide-p-44573-visiting-nurse/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span>, 1008 (1st Cir.1996) .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards, we readily conclude that 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii) is within the pale.  The regulation, which reflects the agency's consistent interpretation for the past quarter-century, emanates from the Secretary's reasonable determination that the purpose of the Act is to help low-income families purchase food, not to underwrite the acquisition of capital assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  To be sure, rental payments on capital assets are, as the appellants point out, deductible as a \"cost,\" but such payments easily can be distinguished from principal payments.  When one leases a capital asset (say, a tractor) no ownership interest is acquired, and the lease payments go entirely toward producing self-employment income.  By contrast, when one buys a capital asset and pays for it in installments, the payments not only permit the payer to use the asset as a means of producing self-employment income but also permit him to build equity.  This additional feature changes the nature of the transaction.  The Secretary's regulation reasonably seeks to avoid subsidizing such \"dual purpose\" payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the appellants now put a different spin on the situation.  See supra note 2. They suggest that, instead of appraising the validity of 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A), we should view the matter in broader terms and determine whether the Secretary must allow some offset for expenses associated with the acquisition and depletion of capital assets used in a trade or business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Passing potential procedural problems and addressing this argument on the merits, it does not benefit the appellants.  Their premise is that, by putting capital assets to one side, the Secretary has defined \"cost of producing self-employment income\" so grudgingly as to frustrate Congress' intent.  But this premise is faulty.  The Secretary has not ignored the costs of doing business;  rather, he has recognized numerous items as allowable costs, e.g., labor, stock, inventory, business-related interest (including interest associated with installment payments on capital assets), and taxes paid on income-producing property.  See 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(i).  He simply has refused to recognize the kind of costs for which the appellants seek credit, saying in effect that when a self-employed person is building equity (a phenomenon that almost invariably accompanies the purchase of capital assets), the Secretary will define \"cost\" very restrictively (probably because no good way exists to give a credit for expenses related to the purchase of capital assets without also subsidizing some intangible ownership interest).  As a result, food stamp recipients who buy capital assets are able to claim relatively few offsets for the expense connected with acquiring and using those assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We frankly acknowledge that the Secretary's interpretation is a harsh one, especially as it relates to persons in the appellants' position.  The regulatory edifice that now exists may not be the one which we, if building on an empty site, would choose to construct.  But that is largely beside the point.  The term \"cost\" is ambiguous, and a harsh interpretation, as here, which arises out of the Secretary's reasonable refusal to subsidize ownership, is not per se arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The \"cost of producing self-employment income,\" 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9), is imprecise and Congress has neither specified that payments designed to amortize the purchase price of capital assets must be deemed part of the cost nor decreed that some equivalent write-off must be recognized in calculating the cost.  Thus, the regulation here at issue represents a permissible construction of the statute.  After all, within the wide limits that  Chevron sets, courts must respect the Secretary's policy choices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> That issue was neither briefed nor argued in this court during the pendency of  Strickland I. In any event, the appellants had told the district court that they did not dispute the Secretary's authority to disallow principal payments on equipment loans as a cost of producing self-employment income</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In their complaint, the appellants asked the district court to strike down the Secretary's policy, embodied in 7 C.F.R. &#167; 273.11(a)(4)(ii)(A), of disallowing principal payments made to purchase capital assets (which they term \"capital costs\").  The district court confined its ruling accordingly.  See Strickland II, 921 F.Supp. at 24-25.   At oral argument before us, however, the appellants' counsel suggested that the pivotal issue should be cast in broader terms;  he posed the ultimate question of whether the Secretary's general regulatory scheme, in not allowing any offset for wear and tear on capital assets by means of depreciation, principal payments, or otherwise, is permissible.  For purposes of  Chevron 's first step, it makes no difference whether we accept or reject this formulation of the issue.  Because the statute (and, particularly, the word \"cost\") is ambiguous, see text  infra, either formulation of the issue leads ineluctably to the second step of the  Chevron inquiry</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Though noting the open question as to whether legislative history could be considered at the first stage of a  Chevron inquiry, see Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 16-18, we examined the slim legislative history underpinning 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2014(d)(9) and deemed it insufficient to \"suck the elasticity from the word 'cost' and convey an 'unambiguously expressed intent of Congress,' \"  id. at 19-20 (quoting  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781).   That conclusion remains unscathed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In this connection, we are puzzled by the appellants' reliance on  Estey v. Commissioner, Me.  DHS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668218\"><a href=\"/opinion/668218/debra-estey-v-commissioner-maine-department-of-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994).  We ruled there that the term \"energy assistance\" had a generally understood meaning and then proceeded to apply that meaning to a particular set of facts.  See id. at 1201, 1207.   The appellants' suggestion that the term \"cost\" has an equally familiar meaning--a meaning that includes principal payments on capital assets as a component of \"cost\"--flies in the teeth of our unequivocal holding that \"cost,\" as that term is used in the Act, does not have any readily apparent meaning.  See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We dismiss out of hand the appellants' contention that  Strickland I etched in stone a particular conception of \"cost,\" equating the word with cash outlays.  This contention reflects a misunderstanding of the thrust of our opinion.  The first step of a  Chevron inquiry requires a court to determine whether the language of a statute is susceptible to more than one natural meaning.  Finding \"cost\" to be inherently ambiguous in the context of the Act, we held that plain meaning did not foreclose the Secretary's decision to exclude depreciation from the cost of producing self-employment income.  See Strickland I, 48 F.3d at 19.   Our intention was to explain why the courts must defer to any permissible interpretation of \"cost\" adopted by the Secretary, not to endorse a particular conception of \"cost\" (whether it be that of an economist, a layman, or a food stamp recipient)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Our determination that the Secretary reasonably excluded principal payments on capital assets from the cost of producing self-employment income is bolstered by the evidence, already chronicled, that this interpretation of \"cost\" is very likely the one that Congress intended.  See supra p. 547.   When an agency's interpretation jibes with discernible congressional intent, a court is hard-pressed to declare that interpretation impermissible under  Chevron 's second step</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
