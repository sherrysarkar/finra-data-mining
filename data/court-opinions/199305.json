Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                 Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Thomas R. Mason for appellants.\n     Brian D. Carlson, with whom Thomas E. Shirley and Choate,\nHall & Stewart, were on brief, for appellee.\n\f                           February 28, 2001\n\n\n\n\n           Per curiam.     On May 1, 1991, plaintiffs-appellants, a\n\ngroup of former employees of defendant-appellee Raytheon Company\n\n(“Raytheon”), accepted layoffs pursuant to a voluntary layoff\n\nprogram (“the 1991 Plan”).     The 1991 Plan was not covered by the\n\nEmployer Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”).            In\n\nApril 1992, Raytheon implemented a second early retirement plan\n\n(“the 1992 Plan”), which was an ERISA plan.             The 1992 Plan\n\nprovided more favorable benefits than the 1991 Plan.\n\n           On January 2, 1998, plaintiffs brought a state court\n\naction against Raytheon for breach of contract, alleging that\n\nRaytheon   had   induced    them   to    accept   the   1991   Plan   by\n\nrepresenting that the Plan would be the “best benefits package\n\nthat Raytheon would ever offer its employees” and then not\n\nhonoring this representation.       Raytheon removed the case to the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\non the ground that plaintiffs’ cause of action was preempted by\n\nERISA, and then moved to dismiss on the same ground.                  The\n\ndistrict court granted Raytheon’s motion, but gave plaintiffs\n\nleave to amend their complaint to set forth a claim under ERISA.\n\nPlaintiffs did not and do not appeal from this ruling.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f               Subsequently, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint\n\nalleging that Raytheon’s conduct with respect to the 1991 Plan\n\nviolated ERISA.          Although it is not entirely clear, plaintiffs’\n\ncase theory appears to have been that Raytheon breached the 1991\n\nPlan, in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) (permitting\n\nsuits by an ERISA plan’s participants and beneficiaries to\n\nrecover benefits due, enforce rights, or clarify rights to\n\nfuture benefits under the terms of the plan), by not offering\n\nplaintiffs the same benefits offered to employees under the 1992\n\nPlan.         Raytheon    again    moved    to   dismiss   and/or   for   summary\n\njudgment, arguing, inter alia, that plaintiffs’ case theory did\n\nnot     fit    within     the     parameters     of   §    1132(a)(1)(B);   that\n\nplaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies\n\nwith respect to the only ERISA plan arguably at issue in this\n\nlitigation; and that plaintiffs filed suit well after expiration\n\nof the three-year limitations provision set forth in that same\n\nERISA plan.\n\n               On March 2, 200, the district court granted the motion.\n\nIn doing so, the court set forth its reasoning clearly and\n\nsuccinctly:\n\n               Plaintiffs are unquestionably participants\n               in the 1991 Plan, whether it be an ERISA\n               plan or not.     The difficulty with their\n               complaint is that they are not claiming\n               benefits due under that plan; nor are they\n               seeking to enforce any rights under the 1991\n\n                                           -3-\n\f          Plan.   If they are asserting that because\n          defendant misrepresented the terms of the\n          1991 Plan, they are entitled to benefits\n          equal to those of the 1992 Plan, they have\n          no claim because the statute does not\n          authorize such a suit.      If, on the other\n          hand,   plaintiffs    contend   that,  absent\n          defendant’s misrepresentations, they would\n          be participants in the 1992 Plan and that\n          they are entitled to the benefits thereof,\n          then they would be bound by all of its\n          terms,    including     its   claims   review\n          procedures    and   three-year    limitations\n          provision. It is undisputed that plaintiffs\n          have not followed, let alone exhausted, the\n          claims procedure contained in Article VI of\n          the 1992 Plan.     Article VIII of the 1992\n          Plan requires any suit thereon to be brought\n          within three years after denial of a claim.\n          The   record    is   clear,   however,   that\n          plaintiffs have known of defendant’s refusal\n          to recognize their claim since, at the\n          latest, March 1993, nearly five years before\n          they instituted suit.\n\n          On appeal, plaintiffs broadly assert that the court’s\n\nruling undermines ERISA’s purposes and hint at theories of\n\nrecovery not fairly presented in the amended complaint.                But\n\nplaintiffs utterly fail to specify where and how the district\n\ncourt went erred in ruling as it did.        That being the case, and\n\nbecause   the   court   was   entirely   correct   in   its   ruling   and\n\nreasoning, we affirm for the reasons set forth in the March 2,\n\n2000 memorandum of decision.       See, e.g., Ruiz Rivera v. Riley,\n\n209 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Affirmed.     Costs to appellee.\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
