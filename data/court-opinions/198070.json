Pierce, Assistant Regional Counsel, Department of\r\nHealth and Human Services, with whom Frank W. Hunger, Assistant\r\nAttorney General, Department of Justice, Harriet S. Rabb, General\r\nCounsel, and Nancy S. Nemon, Chief Counsel, Region I, Department of \r\nHealth and Human Services, were on brief for appellants.\r\n\nJames P. Kelly with whom Patrick M. Connolly, Kelly Law Firm,\r\nCraig E. Stewart, Anne Robbins and Palmer &amp; Dodge LLP were on brief\r\nfor appellees.\r\n\n                                \r\n\n               July 27, 1998\r\n                                \r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  This appeal relates to\r\nthe classification, for Medicare Part B reimbursement purposes, of\r\nmedical equipment made for persons suffering from severe\r\nmusculoskeletal problems.  Produced by Appellees OrthoConcepts and\r\nused by Appellee Warder, the equipment consists of braces, fitted\r\nto the individual patient, on a wheeled base.  The district court\r\nupheld OrthoConcepts' challenge to an administrative ruling (\"the\r\nRuling\" or \"HCFAR 96-1\") from the Health Care Financing\r\nAdministration (\"HCFA\") that classifies this equipment as \"durable\r\nmedical equipment\" rather than as \"braces.\"  The former\r\nclassification limits Medicare reimbursement to devices used at\r\nhome, precluding reimbursement for such devices when used in\r\ncertain hospital and institutional settings.  \r\nHolding that HCFAR 96-1 was a substantive, or\r\nlegislative, rule requiring notice and comment, the court ruled it\r\nto be invalid because notice and comment procedures had not been\r\nfollowed prior to its issuance.  The court also found that the\r\nequipment in dispute was not \"durable medical equipment,\" and\r\nenjoined HCFA from treating it as such.  \r\nWe disagree.  We hold that HCFAR 96-1 is an interpretive\r\nrule, and was not invalidated by HCFA's failure to have adopted\r\nnotice and comment procedures.  We vacate the injunction on the\r\nground that HCFA's interpretation was a permissible one.\r\n\n                  BACKGROUND\r\n1.        Statutory and Regulatory Background\r\nA.   Part B of the Medicare Act\r\nThe Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C.  1395 et seq., establishes\r\na national health insurance program for the elderly and the\r\ndisabled.  Congress authorized Appellant Secretary of Health and\r\nHuman Services to implement the Medicare statute by issuing both\r\nsubstantive regulations and interpretive rules.  See 42 U.S.C. \r\n1395hh.  The Secretary has in turn delegated this authority to the\r\nHCFA Administrator.\r\nPart B of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C.  1395j et seq.,\r\nestablishes a voluntary supplemental insurance program.  Eligible\r\nindividuals enrolled in the program pay a monthly premium that,\r\nalong with congressionally appropriated funds, finances physicians'\r\nand other health services.  See id.  1395j.  Part B has been\r\nreferred to as \"a private medical insurance program that is\r\nsubsidized in major part by the Federal Government.\"  Schweiker v.\r\nMcClure, 456 U.S. 188, 190 (1982).\r\nPart B benefits are administered by private insurance\r\ncarriers under contract with HCFA.  See 42 U.S.C.  1395u.  HCFA\r\nreimburses a carrier for the costs of administering claims, and the\r\ncarriers act as HCFA's agents.  See id.  1395u(a); 42 C.F.R. \r\n421.5(b).  The carrier bears the initial responsibility for\r\ndetermining whether an item or service billed to the Part B program\r\nis covered and, if so, the amount to be paid.  See 42 U.S.C. \r\n1395u. \r\nB.   Part B Coverage of DME and Braces\r\nMedicare Part B provides coverage for \"medical and other\r\nhealth services,\" 42 U.S.C.  1395x(s), that are \"reasonable and\r\nnecessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to\r\nimprove the functioning of a malformed body member,\" id. \r\n1395y(a)(1)(A).  The statute expressly covers braces, including\r\n\"leg, arm, back, and neck braces.\"  Id.  1395x(s)(9).  \r\nOrdinarily, coverage will extend to any piece of\r\nequipment that is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of an\r\neligible patient regardless of the place where it is used. \r\nHowever, Part B reimburses devices classified as \"durable medical\r\nequipment\" (\"DME\") only when provided at the patient's \"home\" or\r\nother \"institution used as [the patient's] home,\" and not in a\r\nhospital or skilled nursing facility (\"SNF\").  42 U.S.C.  1395x(n)\r\n(citing  1395x(e)(1) (defining hospital), 1395i-3(a)(1) (defining\r\nSNF)).  In other words, DME is reimbursable only when used in a\r\npatient's home, with \"home\" being defined to exclude hospitals and\r\nSNFs.  \r\nNo similar restriction relates to \"braces.\"  See 42\r\nU.S.C.  1395x(s)(9).  Hence if a piece of medical equipment used\r\nin a hospital or SNF is a \"brace,\" it is reimbursable   but not if\r\ndeemed to be DME.\r\nC.        DME and Braces Defined\r\nThe medical device here, intended for persons with severe\r\nmusculosekeletal failure, includes a set of connected braces\r\nattached to a wheeled base.  See infra.  While various provisions\r\ndefine braces and DME, no single provision concisely differentiates\r\nthe two, leaving it open which category is implicated when, as\r\nhere, a brace-like device is used as part of a wheeled item that\r\nmight be classified as DME. \r\nThe principal statutory definition of DME states that\r\n\"[DME] includes iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and\r\nwheelchairs.\"  42 U.S.C.  1395x(s)(6) (emphasis supplied). \r\nElsewhere the statute includes special payment provisions for\r\ncertain types of DME, including \"items requiring frequent and\r\nsubstantial servicing,\" id.  1395m(a)(3), and equipment customized\r\nto an individual patient's needs, see id.  1395m(a)(4).  However,\r\nneither of these provisions can be read to expand  1395x(s)(6)'s\r\ndefinition of DME, because both are expressly limited to a subset\r\nof DME.  See id.  1395m(13) (defining \"covered item[s]\" under \r\n1395m to be DME \"as defined in section 1395x(n)\").\r\nIn 1990, Congress amended  1395m(a)(4) to add a\r\nprovision   which ultimately, by its own terms, was superseded by\r\na HCFA regulation   expressly providing that customized wheelchairs\r\nwere DME.  P.L. 101-508,  4152(c)(4)(B).  The amendment provided\r\nthat it would become effective on January 1, 1992, unless HCFA\r\ndeveloped its own criteria for the treatment of customized\r\nwheelchairs as DME.  In December, 1991, HCFA addressed customized\r\nwheelchairs in a regulation that substantially tracked the language\r\nof the amendment, providing that a wheelchair is DME if \"uniquely\r\nconstructed or substantially modified for a specific beneficiary\"\r\nand \"so different from another item used for the same purpose that\r\nthe two items cannot be grouped together for pricing purposes.\"  42\r\nC.F.R.  414.224.  In effect, Congress, and subsequently HCFA,\r\ntreated as DME any wheelchair modified in light of an individual\r\npatient's disability, per a physician's instructions.\r\nThe regulatory definition of DME focuses not on examples,\r\nbut rather on qualitative criteria, including the equipment's\r\ndurability:\r\n          equipment, furnished by a supplier or a home\r\n          health agency that   \r\n               (1)  Can withstand repeated use;\r\n               (2)  Is primarily and customarily used to\r\n               serve a medical purpose;\r\n               (3)  Generally is not useful to an\r\n               individual in the absence of an illness\r\n               or injury; and\r\n               (4)  Is appropriate for use in the home\r\n               [citing 42 C.F.R.  410.38, which in turn\r\n               cites statutory provisions defining\r\n               \"home\" to exclude hospitals and SNFs].\r\n\n42 C.F.R.  414.202.  \r\nThe manual HCFA prepares for its carriers repeats the\r\nregulatory criteria.  See Medicare Carrier's Manual (\"MCM\") \r\n2000.1.  Another provision in the manual goes farther, explaining\r\nthat DME includes \"supplies and accessories\" that are \"necessary\r\nfor the effective use of [DME].\"  MCM,  2100.5.\r\nThe statutory definition of \"brace\" is ostensive, listing\r\nthe sorts of braces that are covered.  Id.  1395x(s)(9) (defining\r\northotics as \"leg, arm, back, and neck braces, and artificial legs,\r\narms, and eyes, including requirements if required because of a\r\nchange in the patient's physical condition\").  The accompanying\r\nregulation, 42 C.F.R.  414.202, tracks the statutory language.  \r\n2.        The OrthoConcepts Product\r\nDue to illness, injury, and in some cases old age,\r\nthousands of Medicare beneficiaries suffer from musculoskeletal\r\nfailure so severe as to render them incapable of moving or\r\nsupporting their own limbs.  These catastrophically crippled\r\npatients are vulnerable to numerous painful conditions.  One of the\r\nmost serious is contractures, a condition in which muscles become\r\nrigid and resistant to elongation following a long period of\r\ndisuse.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 373 (28th ed.\r\n1994).  Other complications include the development of pressure\r\nsores, circulatory problems, and infections. \r\nTo manage the condition of patients with grave\r\nmusculoskeletal failure, OrthoConcepts designed what it has\r\nmarketed as the \"OrthoConcepts Seating System.\"  The Seating System\r\nconsists of a set of connected braces   the number and type\r\ndepending on the patient's condition   attached to a wheeled base. \r\nThe patient sits, or reclines, on the Seating System, and the\r\ncomponent braces maintain the patient in a position designed to\r\nreduce the weight borne by weaker extremities and to prevent\r\ncontractures.  Since 1989, OrthoConcepts has supplied the Seating\r\nSystem to more than 2700 patients.\r\n3.        HCFA's Classification of the OrthoConcepts Seating System\r\nOn December 7, 1989, OrthoConcepts informed a regional\r\nHCFA office that OrthoConcepts would soon begin marketing the\r\nSeating System nationwide.  OrthoConcepts' letter inquired about\r\nthe Medicare coverage status of the Seating System and asked HCFA\r\nto establish a new billing code (known as a \"L code,\" a\r\nstandardized billing classification for \"orthotics,\" or braces)\r\nthat would allow the Seating System to be reimbursed as a brace. \r\nThe regional office replied in January of 1990, advising\r\nOrthoConcepts that Part B covered the Seating System as DME, not as\r\northotics, and that it would provide no L Code for billing the\r\nSeating System as an orthotic.  \r\nThe regional office also wrote its private carriers\r\nregarding the Seating System, instructing them to treat the device\r\nas DME.  By letter dated February 21, 1990, the carrier then\r\nresponsible for OrthoConcepts' claims, Nationwide Insurance,\r\nnotified OrthoConcepts of the HCFA regional office's letter and\r\ninformed it that its products \"are classified as [DME]; not\r\northotics.\"\r\nIn late 1992, HCFA reorganized its system for processing\r\nclaims for DME and orthotics, replacing local carriers with four\r\nregional carriers known as \"DMERCs.\"  HCFA instructed the DMERCs to\r\nissue uniform reimbursement policies.  In August, 1993, the DMERCs\r\nannounced that they would reimburse certain orthotic seating\r\nsystems (known by the billing designations or \"K-codes\" as K-0115\r\nand K-0116) as braces.  These seating systems were functionally\r\nquite similar to the OrthoConcepts Seating System, differing\r\nprincipally in that they were fitted using a plaster cast of the\r\nindividual patient rather than the manually-adjusted attachments\r\nthat are part of the Seating System.  The following April, after\r\nlearning of this billing practice, HCFA informed the DMERCs that K-\r\ncodes 0115 and 0116 described DME, not orthotics.  The DMERCs in\r\nturn notified their respective suppliers of HCFA's determination.\r\nDespite HCFA's 1990 letter declaring the Seating System\r\nDME, OrthoConcepts, through its corporate affiliates, continued to\r\nbill Seating Systems supplied to patients at SNFs as an orthotic. \r\nUpon learning of this practice, HCFA's Region A DMERC suspended\r\nMedicare payments to OrthoConcepts in December, 1994.  Following a\r\nmeeting with OrthoConcepts representatives and an inspection of\r\nSNFs where the Seating System was in use, one of the carriers\r\nconcluded that the billed equipment was in fact DME, and notified\r\nthe OrthoConcepts affiliates that it was obligated to refund the\r\nPart B payments.  Soon thereafter, the Region B and Region C DMERCs\r\ndenied OrthoConcepts reimbursement.\r\nOrthoConcepts appealed from the carriers' denials of\r\ntheir Part B claims.  In the Region A appeal, a Part B hearing\r\nofficer issued a decision on August 30, 1995, finding that the\r\nSeating System was DME and concluding that Part B did not provide\r\nreimbursement for the disputed claims.  However, after an ex partehearing, an ALJ reversed the hearing officer's decision on January\r\n3, 1996, ruling that the Seating Systems \"[were] orthotic braces\r\nand not wheelchairs.\"  On March 1, 1996, the Appeals Board denied\r\nHCFA's petition to review the ALJ's decision.  \r\nThe Region B and Region C appeals were consolidated\r\nbefore a carrier fair hearing officer.  On February 9, 1996, the\r\nhearing officer decided that the Seating System was an orthotic\r\ndevice rather than DME.  This ended the matter, as the statute\r\ngives HCFA no administrative appeal from a hearing officer's\r\nadverse decision.  \r\nThe net result of these proceedings was that by early\r\n1996, HCFA's view of the Seating System as DME   as expressed in\r\nits 1990 letter to OrthoConcepts and its 1994 notice to its\r\ncarriers   was at odds with the decisions of an ALJ and a hearing\r\nofficer.\r\nThese decisions prompted HCFA to issue HCFAR 96-1, which\r\nbecame effective September 18, 1996.  Noting the above-mentioned\r\ndecisions classifying the Seating System as an orthotic, the\r\nRuling's stated purpose is \"to provide clarification and guidance\r\nregarding the scope and meaning of the statutory benefits for\r\n'orthotics' and '[DME].'\"  HCFAR 96-1 at 2.  The Ruling discusses\r\nthe relevant statutes, regulations, legislative history, and\r\nadministrative materials before reaching its conclusion:  the\r\ndefinition of \"orthotics\" \"is limited to leg, arm, back, and neck\r\nbraces that are used independently [of], rather than in conjunction\r\nwith, or as components of, other kinds of medical equipment.\"  Id.at 10.  The Ruling also provides several illustrations of DME, one\r\nof which unmistakably refers to the OrthoConcepts Seating System. \r\nSee id. at 7-8.\r\nOn February 26, 1997, two Medicare beneficiaries who used\r\nthe Seating System in SNFs and three OrthoConcepts suppliers\r\n(hereinafter, Appellees will be referred to collectively as\r\n\"OrthoConcepts\") brought the present district court action\r\nchallenging HCFAR 96-1.  Appellees advanced the procedural claim\r\nthat HCFAR 96-1 was invalid, having been adopted without compliance\r\nwith the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative\r\nProcedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C.  553, and the Medicare statute, 42\r\nU.S.C.  1395hh.  Appellees also made the substantive claim that\r\nHCFAR 96-1 was arbitrary and capricious, see 5 U.S.C.  706(2)(A). \r\nAppellees sought a declaration that the Ruling was void and that\r\nthe Seating System was reimbursable as a brace.  They also\r\nrequested a preliminary injunction blocking HCFA from enforcing the\r\nRuling.\r\nAfter holding a hearing on Appellees' motion for a\r\npreliminary injunction, the district court notified the parties\r\nthat it would issue a final determination on the merits of\r\nAppellees' claims.  On March 7, 1997, the district court ruled that\r\nHCFAR 96-1 is a substantive rule and, therefore, invalid because\r\nHCFA issued it without following notice and comment procedures. \r\nThe court went on to hold that, the definitions of DME and\r\northotics in effect prior to the Ruling prevented HCFA from\r\ntreating the Seating System as DME.  (The court left open the\r\npossibility that HCFA could validly re-enact the Ruling after using\r\nnotice and comment procedures.)  The court also enjoined HCFA from\r\ndenying Appellees reimbursement for the Seating System.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\n                  DISCUSSION\r\n1.        The Interpretative Rule Exception to the Requirement of \r\nNotice and Comment\r\n\nWhether an administrative ruling is substantive or\r\ninterpretative is a question of law that this court reviews denovo.  See La Casa Del Convaleciente v. Sullivan, 965 F.2d 1175,\r\n1177 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Convaleciente\").  \r\nThe APA exempts \"interpretative rules\" from its notice\r\nand comment procedures.  5 U.S.C.  553(b)(B).  The Medicare Act\r\nexpressly incorporates the APA's exemption for interpretive rules. \r\nSee 42 U.S.C.  1395hh(b)(2)(C) (1994).  \r\nThe line between a legislative or substantive rule and an\r\ninterpretative one is, as many courts have noted, far from clear. \r\nSee, e.g., Convaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1177.  The APA itself does\r\nnot define \"substantive\" and \"interpretive\" (or, in the APA's\r\nnomenclature, \"interpretative\") rules.  Moreover, courts and other\r\nauthorities have provided any number of definitions, lending\r\nfurther imprecision to the field.  Nevertheless, a few reasonably\r\nclear principles have emerged, leading us to conclude that HCFAR\r\n96-1 is interpretative, and could be promulgated without notice and\r\ncomment procedures.\r\nThe most authoritative explanation of the\r\nsubstantive/interpretative distinction is that provided by the\r\nAttorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act\r\n(1947).  The Attorney General's Manual described an interpretive\r\nrule as one \"issued by an agency to advise the public of the\r\nagency's construction of the statutes and rules which it\r\nadministers.\" Id. at 30 n.3.  Courts have routinely quoted this\r\ndefinition with approval.  See Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hosp.,\r\n514 U.S. 87, 99 (1995); Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302\r\nn.31 (1979); Convaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1178.  The Attorney\r\nGeneral's Manual defines substantive, or legislative, rules as\r\nthose that \r\n          are issued by an agency pursuant to statutory\r\n          authority and which implement the statute\r\n          [such as the Securities and Exchange\r\n          Commission's proxy rules issued pursuant to\r\n          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.\r\n           78n(b)].  Such rules have the force and\r\n          effect of law.  \r\n\nId.\r\nThese definitions have caused us to observe \"that the\r\ndistinction between legislative and interpretative rules has to do\r\nin part with the authority\"   law-making versus law-interpreting\r\n\"under which the rule is promulgated.\"  Levesque v. Block, 723\r\nF.2d 175, 182 (1st Cir. 1982).  The Seventh Circuit has stated that\r\n\"rules are legislative when the agency is exercising delegated\r\npower to make law through rules, and rules are interpretative when\r\nthe agency is not exercising such delegated power in issuing them.\" \r\nMetropolitan Sch. Dist. v. Davila, 969 F.2d 485, 490 (7th Cir.\r\n1992).  \r\nWhere a rule falls along the interpretative/legislative\r\nspectrum will turn in many cases on the novelty of a rule's\r\nsubstantive content.  \"If a rule creates rights, assigns duties, or\r\nimposes obligations, the basic tenor of which is not already\r\noutlined in the law itself, then it is substantive.\" \r\nConvaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1178 (emphasis supplied); see alsoAmerican Mining Congress v. Mine Safety &amp; Health Admin., 995 F.2d\r\n1106, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (stating that a rule is legislative if\r\n\"in the absence of the rule there would not be an adequate\r\nlegislative basis for enforcement action or other agency action to\r\nconfer benefits or ensure the performance of duties\").  Put more\r\nsuccinctly, a rule is exempt from notice and comment as an\r\ninterpretative rule if it does not \"effect a substantive change in\r\nthe regulations.\"  Guernsey, 514 U.S. at 100 (internal quotation\r\nmarks and citation omitted).\r\nOn its face, HCFAR 96-1 appears to satisfy the criteria\r\nfor an interpretive rule.  We have said that an important factor in\r\ndetermining whether a rule is interpretive is the agency's own\r\ncharacterization.  See Convaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1178; Levesque,\r\n723 F.2d at 182.  It is not disputed that HCFA intended HCFAR 96-1\r\nto be interpretative.  The Ruling itself purports only to \"clarify\"\r\nthe proper application of existing statutory and regulatory\r\ndefinitions to a particular case.\r\nMore importantly, the Ruling does not establish any new\r\nstandard.  Rather, it addresses an area of ambiguity:  whether a\r\ndevice comprising both orthotic and DME components should be\r\nreimbursed as a brace or as DME.  The statutory and regulatory\r\ndefinitions of DME and orthotics predated the Ruling, but neither\r\nwas so complete as to provide an unambiguous answer to the question\r\nof the Seating System's classification.  These definitions created\r\nthe need for clarification   precisely the function of an\r\ninterpretative rule   and they provided an \"adequate legislative\r\nbasis for [the agency action].\"  American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d\r\nat 1112.  The Ruling does not stake out any ground \"the basic tenor\r\nof which [was] not already outlined in the law itself.\" \r\nConvaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1178.\r\nWe find guidance in the Supreme Court's recent Guernseydecision.  There, the Court considered whether the interpretative\r\nrule exemption applied to an accounting provision in HCFA's\r\nProvider Reimbursement Manual (\"PRM\").  Like HCFAR 96-1, the PRM\r\nprovision at issue in Guernsey \"[did] not purport to be a\r\nregulation and [had] not been adopted pursuant to the notice-and-\r\ncomment procedures of the [APA].\"  514 U.S. at 90.  The Court\r\ndetermined that the PRM provision concerned \"[t]he only question\r\nunaddressed by the otherwise comprehensive regulations on this\r\nparticular subject.\"  Id. at 97.  The Court concluded that the\r\nmeasure \"[was] a prototypical example of an interpretive rule\"\r\nbecause the PRM provision merely applied existing law, id. at 99,\r\nand was not \"inconsistent with any of the Secretary's existing\r\nregulations,\" id. at 100.\r\nThe reasoning in Guernsey applies here.  The Medicare\r\nstatute and regulations provide a comprehensive classification of\r\nequipment as DME or orthotics.  The Ruling addresses a small\r\noverlap in this scheme.  The answer the Ruling provides is\r\nconsistent with the existing definitions.  The statute and\r\nregulations define braces only by referring to particular types of\r\nbraces, none of which would have to include a system of braces\r\nattached to a wheeled base.  See 42 U.S.C.  1395x(s)(9).  But\r\nclearly the Seating System fits within one category or the other,\r\nso HCFA was acting in an interpretive, rather than legislative,\r\ncapacity.  See United Technologies Corp. v. EPA, 821 F.2d 714, 719-\r\n20 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (\"If the rule is based on specific statutory\r\nprovisions, and its validity stands or falls on the correctness of\r\nthe agency's interpretation of those provisions, it is an\r\ninterpretative rule.\").\r\nBy the same token, the Ruling is not inconsistent with\r\nexisting law because the statutory and regulatory definitions of\r\nDME are broad enough to include the Seating System.  It is conceded\r\nthat the Seating System \"[c]an withstand repeated use,\" 42 C.F.R.\r\n414.202, a principal regulatory criterion differentiating DME\r\nfrom other equipment.  Moreover, it is not inconsistent to treat\r\nthe Seating System   which is, after all, a wheeled device in which\r\na patient sits   as a customized wheelchair, a piece of equipment\r\nspecifically identified as DME.  See 42 U.S.C.  1395x(n); 42\r\nC.F.R.  414.224.  Nothing in any of the existing statutory or\r\nregulatory definitions is inconsistent with HCFAR 96-1.  Together,\r\nthe extant definitions were ambiguous in respect to the category\r\nwithin which the Seating System best fit, and  \"the quintessential\r\nexample of an interpretive rule\" is \"[a] statement seeking to\r\ninterpret a statutory or regulatory term.\"  Orengo Carballo v.\r\nReich, 11 F.3d 186, 195 (D.C. Cir. 1993).\r\nOrthoConcepts' main contention both in the district court\r\nand on appeal was that HCFAR 96-1 was legislative because it\r\nchanged HCFA's policy of reimbursing the Seating System as DME. \r\nThis argument rests on erroneous views of both the law and the\r\nfacts.  \r\nThe legal point is clear enough:  in order for notice and\r\ncomment to be necessary, \"the [later] rule would have to be\r\ninconsistent with another rule having the force of law, not just\r\nany agency interpretation regardless of whether it had been\r\ncodified.\"  Chief Probation Officers v. Shalala, 118 F.3d 1327,\r\n1337 (9th Cir. 1997) (White, J. (Retired, sitting by designation)). \r\nThe Supreme Court in Guernsey intimated this much, concluding that\r\nthe provision there was interpretive because it did not contradict\r\n\"any of the Secretary's existing regulations.\"  514 U.S. at 100\r\n(emphasis supplied); see also id. at 111 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)\r\n(observing that interpretive rules \"must explain existing law and\r\nnot contradict what the [extant] regulations require\").  The lower\r\nfederal courts are in agreement on this score.  See, e.g., Orengo,\r\n11 F.3d at 196 (explaining that a subsequent rule is legislative\r\n\"[o]nly where [the] second rule repudiates or is irreconcilable\r\nwith [a prior legislative rule]\"); White v. Shalala, 7 F.3d 296,\r\n304 (2d Cir. 1993) (\"If the rule is an interpretation of a statute\r\nrather than an extra-statutory imposition of rights, duties or\r\nobligations, it remains interpretive even if the rule embodies the\r\nSecretary's changed interpretation of the statute.\"); Davila, 969\r\nF.2d at 492 (\"[A]n agency's change in its reading of the statute\r\ndoes not necessarily make the rule announcing the change\r\nlegislative.\").  As already stated, see supra, nothing in the\r\nstatute or regulations addresses the precise issue decided in HCFAR\r\n96-1.  Thus, even supposing HCFA's pre-Ruling policy was different,\r\nthe earlier policy would not prevent HCFA from adopting a contrary\r\nnew interpretative rule.\r\nHowever, we very much doubt that the Ruling, by limiting\r\nthe coverage of braces to devices used independently of DME, added\r\nsomething new to HCFA's policies.  In siding with OrthoConcepts,\r\nthe district court concluded that the agency's informal\r\npronouncements and practices regarding the reimbursement of the\r\nSeating System indicated a pre-Ruling policy to treat the Seating\r\nSystem as an orthotic.  A number of factors, however, suggest the\r\nopposite conclusion.\r\nFirst, the HCFA regional office's 1990 letter to\r\nOrthoConcepts specifically stated that the Seating System was DME. \r\nThe district court disregarded this letter because a former\r\nOrthoConcepts attorney submitted an unsworn affidavit stating that\r\nthe office promised to issue a letter rescinding the corresponding\r\norder instructing its carriers to treat the Seating System as DME. \r\nHowever, as the district court found, \"there is no evidence that\r\nHCFA ever sent such a letter,\" nor is there any evidence\r\ncorroborating the unsworn affidavit.  \r\nSecond, HCFA instructed its carriers on three separate\r\noccasions that devices quite similar to the Seating System should\r\nbe treated as DME.  The first two memoranda, issued in 1987 and\r\n1989, dealt with \"contoured corrective seats,\" and concluded, as\r\nthe 1989 memorandum put it, that the \"only statutory provision that\r\ncould apply to such equipment\" was DME.  The district court\r\ndismissed these memoranda on the ground that, by questioning\r\nwhether the devices served a medical purpose, they relied on an\r\nalternative basis for denying the contoured corrective seats\r\ncoverage.  However, we cannot see how the inclusion of this\r\ncomplementary argument contradicts or negates the independent\r\nconclusion that the equipment at issue was DME.  \r\nA further manifestation of HCFA's earlier policy was its\r\n1994 instruction to treat as DME equipment designated by the K-\r\ncodes 0115 and 0116.  The district court dismissed the 1994\r\ninstruction as \"not directly on point,\" but the instruction set out\r\na policy for equipment that, like the Seating System and the first\r\nillustration given in HCFAR 96-1, contained orthotic attachments. \r\nWhile the 1994 instruction addressed equipment with a different\r\ntechnical design, it implicitly contained the same principle as the\r\nRuling:  DME includes orthotic components that cannot be used\r\nindependently of attached DME.  That the 1994 instruction (as well\r\nas the 1987 and 1989 memoranda) did not address the precise\r\nequipment at issue here does not mean that HCFA had no relevant\r\npolicy:  \"an interpretive statement may 'suppl[y] crisper and more\r\ndetailed lines than the authority being interpreted.'\"  Orengo, 11\r\nF.3d at 195 (quoting American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1112). \r\nThus, we reject OrthoConcepts' contention that HCFAR 96-1 effected\r\na substantive change in the regulations.\r\nAs a fallback position, OrthoConcepts argues that HCFAR\r\n96-1 could not be valid without notice-and-comment rulemaking\r\nbecause it has a binding effect on agency personnel.  This argument\r\nconfuses two senses in which a rule may bind.  Of course, a rule\r\nwith the force and effect of law   binding not only the agency and\r\nregulated parties, but also the courts   is by definition a\r\nsubstantive rule.  However, a rule may lack this force and still\r\nbind agency personnel.  Accordingly, \"[a]n interpretative rule\r\nbinds an agency's employees, including its ALJs, but it does not\r\nbind the agency itself.\"  Kenneth C. Davis &amp; Richard J. Pierce,\r\nJr., Administrative Law Treatise  6.3 at 104 (3d ed. 1996 &amp; Supp.\r\n1997).  In other words, a rule may be \"binding\" but not, for\r\npurposes of notice and comment, \"substantive,\" or legislative.  We\r\nrejected an argument almost identical to OrthoConcepts' in\r\nLevesque:  \"If plaintiffs mean that any rule that an agency intends\r\nto be effective must be legislative, they are plainly wrong.  Every\r\nrule is intended to have some effect.\"  723 F.2d at 181-82; see\r\nalso American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1111 (\"[R]estricting\r\ndiscretion tells one little about whether a rule is\r\ninterpretive.\"); Davila, 969 F.2d at 493 (\"All rules which\r\ninterpret the underlying statute must be binding because they set\r\nforth what the agency believes is congressional intent.\").  The\r\nfact that the Ruling binds HCFA carriers and ALJs is entirely\r\nconsistent with its status as an interpretative rule.\r\nWe therefore reject OrthoConcepts' argument that HCFAR\r\n96-1 was not legally adopted because of the absence of notice and\r\ncomment procedures.    \r\n2.        Injunction\r\nThe district court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing \r\nthe Ruling and from denying OrthoConcepts' reimbursement for its\r\nSeating System under the braces benefit.  It granted this relief\r\nbased on the erroneous belief, supra, that HCFAR 96-1 was invalidly\r\npromulgated, leaving HCFA without an adequate basis for treating\r\nthe Seating System as DME.  As held above, however, HCFAR 96-1 was\r\nproperly promulgated; we now further hold that the Ruling's\r\ninterpretation of the Seating System as DME is adequately supported\r\nby the Medicare statute and regulations.  We therefore vacate the\r\ninjunction.\r\nA threshold question is what deference is owed to an\r\ninterpretative rule such as HCFAR 96-1.  The Supreme Court has not\r\nexpressed a view on whether or to what extent the Chevronframework, see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\r\nCouncil, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), applies to interpretive, rather than\r\nlegislative rules, and other circuits are split on the issue.  \r\nWe need not decide the issue here because, even assuming\r\narguendo that Chevron deference is not applicable to interpretative\r\nrules, we are persuaded that HCFAR 96-1 is an appropriate\r\nconstruction of the statute.  We are guided in this regard by\r\nSkidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944).  There, the Court\r\nconsidered a rule that, having been issued by an agency not\r\nauthorized to make legislative rules, was necessarily\r\ninterpretative and without the force of law.  See id. at 138.  The\r\nSupreme Court approved the agency's interpretation and explained\r\nthe proper approach to judicial review of interpretative rules:\r\n          [T]he rulings, interpretations and opinions of\r\n          the Administrator under this Act, while not\r\n          controlling upon the courts by reason of their\r\n          authority, do constitute a body of experience\r\n          and informed judgment to which courts and\r\n          litigants may properly resort for guidance. \r\n          The weight of such a judgment in a particular\r\n          case will depend upon the thoroughness evident\r\n          in its consideration, the validity of its\r\n          reasoning, its consistency with earlier and\r\n          later pronouncements, and all those factors\r\n          which give it power to persuade, if lacking\r\n          power to control.\r\n\n323 U.S. at 140.  Considering all of these factors, we think the\r\ninterpretation embodied in HCFAR 96-1 is wholly supportable.\r\nFirst, as already discussed, see supra, HCFAR 96-1 is\r\ngenerally consistent with HCFA's earlier informal pronouncements. \r\nSee Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. 504, 517 n.13\r\n(1981) (describing \"scrutiny applicable to interpretive rules\" as\r\ninvolving \"due deference to consistent agency practice\").  Hence to\r\nthe extent that inconsistency with prior policies might lead us to\r\nfind an interpretative rule arbitrary or capricious, we see no\r\ninconsistencies of such a nature.  \r\nSecond, we find the Ruling to be a persuasive reading of\r\nthe statute and HCFA's regulations.  Those materials establish\r\nthree criteria for classifying a device as DME:  the item must be\r\n\"durable,\" i.e., able to \"withstand repeated use\"; it must be\r\nreasonably necessary \"medical equipment\"; and it must be\r\n\"appropriate for use in the home.\"  42 U.S.C.  1395x(n); 42 C.F.R.\r\n414.202.  The Seating System meets each of these criteria, and\r\nOrthoConcepts advances no serious argument to the contrary.  \r\nMoreover, DME unequivocally includes \"wheelchairs,\" see \r\n42 U.S.C.  1395x(n), and the Seating System serves the same (as\r\nwell as additional) functions as a wheelchair.  OrthoConcepts' own\r\nexpert admitted that a casual observer might conclude that the\r\nproduct \"looks like a wheelchair.\"  HCFAR 96-1 also conforms to\r\ncongressional intent as expressed in P.L. 101-508,  4152(c)(4),\r\nthe interim amendment to 42 U.S.C.  1395m(a)(4) specifying that\r\ncustomized wheelchairs are DME.  The legislative history of this\r\nprovision shows that Congress intended DME to include \"postural\r\ncontrol devices\" and \"custom molded cushions and inserts, or\r\nlateral supports\" associated with wheelchairs.  H.R. No. 101-881,\r\nat 268 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2017, 2270.  In\r\nshort, it takes no great leap to conclude that congressional intent\r\nis well effectuated by treating the Seating System as DME.\r\nFurther support for HCFA's view is provided by the\r\nAmerican Orthotic and Prosthetic Association, which has stated that\r\nthe Seating System is a brace only when that term is used \"in its\r\nmost broad sense,\" and that the items are \"more accurately\r\ndescribed as a subset of orthoses called seating systems or wheeled\r\nmobility devices.\"  \r\nEven assuming that the entire device could alternatively\r\nbe reasonably construed to satisfy the definition of a brace (which\r\nincludes only examples of individual braces), there was nothing\r\nprecluding HCFA from resolving the ambiguity in favor of DME.  The\r\ndistrict court concluded that equipment that could be categorized\r\nas both DME and an orthotic must be treated as an orthotic based on\r\na portion of the MCM's definition of DME that provides that\r\n\"[t]here are other items which, although durable in nature, may\r\n[sic] fall into other coverage categories such as braces [and other\r\ncategories].\"  MCM  2000.1.  We do not read this language as\r\nestablishing DME as a category of last resort; it does not say, for\r\ninstance, that any equipment that could be classified as a brace is\r\nnecessarily not DME.  Instead, it uses the term \"may,\" suggesting\r\nthat the classification of equipment that is both brace-like and\r\ndurable is left to HCFA.  Accordingly, we do not accept\r\nOrthoConcepts' argument that HCFA had bound itself to resolve cases\r\nof ambiguity on the side of braces.\r\nWe also note that in establishing its policy, HCFA has\r\nbeen deliberate.  HCFA has on multiple occasions met with\r\nOrthoConcepts' representatives, examined the equipment at issue,\r\nand given consideration to the statute and regulations as applied\r\nto the Seating System and comparable devices.  HCFA's thoroughness\r\nbelies OrthoConcepts' claim that HCFAR 96-1 is merely a litigating\r\nposition entitled to no deference under Smiley v. Citibank, N.A.,\r\n116 S. Ct. 1730, 1736 (1996).  \r\nFinally, the classification of medical equipment for\r\nreimbursement purposes is the sort of technical question that\r\ngenerally benefits from HCFA's expertise and experience.  SeeStowell v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 3 F.3d 539, 544 (1st\r\nCir. 1993) (stating that \"[c]ourts should not cavalierly discount\r\nthe value of agency expertise painstakingly garnered in the\r\nadministration, over time, of programs of remarkable intricacy\" and\r\nciting cases); Hospital San Jorge v. Secretary of Health, Educ. &amp;\r\nWelfare, 616 F.2d 580, 589 (1st Cir. 1980) (Campbell, J.,\r\nconcurring) (stating that \"[m]atters of [Medicare] accounting,\r\nunless they 'be the expression of a whim rather than an exercise of\r\njudgment,' are for the agency\" (quoting American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v.\r\nUnited States, 299 U.S. 232, 237 (1936))).  Given HCFA's expertise\r\nin administering Medicare Part B, the logic of its interpretation,\r\nand the consistency of its policy, we conclude that the denial of\r\nclaims for reimbursement of the Seating System under the brace\r\nbenefit was not arbitrary or capricious, and thus withstands\r\nOrthoConcepts' challenge under 5 U.S.C.  706(2)(A).\r\nThe judgment of the district court is reversed and\r\nremanded with instruction to vacate the injunction and to enter\r\njudgment for Appellants.\n",

These catastrophically crippled patients are vulnerable to numerous painful conditions.  One of the most serious is contractures, a condition in which muscles become rigid and resistant to elongation following a long period of disuse.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 373 (28th ed.1994).  Other complications include the development of pressure sores, circulatory problems, and infections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To manage the condition of patients with grave musculoskeletal failure, OrthoConcepts designed what it has marketed as the \"OrthoConcepts Seating System.\"   The Seating System consists of a set of connected braces--the number and type depending on the patient's condition--attached to a wheeled base.  The patient sits, or reclines, on the Seating System, and the component braces maintain the patient in a position designed to reduce the weight borne by weaker extremities and to prevent contractures.  Since 1989, OrthoConcepts has supplied the Seating System to more than 2700 patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>3. HCFA's Classification of the OrthoConcepts Seating System</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, 1989, OrthoConcepts informed a regional HCFA office that OrthoConcepts would soon begin marketing the Seating System nationwide.  OrthoConcepts' letter inquired about the Medicare coverage status of the Seating System and asked HCFA to establish a new billing code (known as a \"L code,\" a standardized billing classification for \"orthotics,\" or braces) that would allow the Seating System to be reimbursed as a brace.  The regional office replied in January of 1990, advising OrthoConcepts that Part B covered the Seating System as DME, not as orthotics, and that it would provide no L Code for billing the Seating System as an orthotic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regional office also wrote its private carriers regarding the Seating System, instructing them to treat the device as DME.  By letter dated February 21, 1990, the carrier then responsible for OrthoConcepts' claims, Nationwide Insurance, notified OrthoConcepts of the HCFA regional office's letter and informed it that its products \"are classified as [DME];  not orthotics.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1992, HCFA reorganized its system for processing claims for DME and orthotics, replacing local carriers with four regional carriers known as \"DMERCs.\"   HCFA instructed the DMERCs to issue uniform reimbursement policies.  In August, 1993, the DMERCs announced that they would reimburse certain orthotic seating systems (known by the billing designations or \"K-codes\" as K-0115 and K-0116) as braces.  These seating systems were functionally quite similar to the OrthoConcepts Seating System, differing principally in that they were fitted using a plaster cast of the individual patient rather than the manually-adjusted attachments that are part of the Seating System.  The following April, after learning of this billing practice, HCFA informed the DMERCs that K-codes 0115 and 0116 described DME, not orthotics.  The DMERCs in turn notified their respective suppliers of HCFA's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite HCFA's 1990 letter declaring the Seating System DME, OrthoConcepts, through its corporate affiliates, continued to bill Seating Systems supplied to patients at SNFs as an orthotic.  Upon learning of this practice, HCFA's Region A DMERC suspended Medicare payments to OrthoConcepts in December, 1994.  Following a meeting with OrthoConcepts representatives and an inspection of SNFs where the Seating System was in use, one of the carriers concluded that the billed equipment was in fact DME, and notified the OrthoConcepts affiliates that it was obligated to refund the Part B payments.  Soon thereafter, the Region B and Region C DMERCs denied OrthoConcepts reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OrthoConcepts appealed from the carriers' denials of their Part B claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In the Region A appeal, a Part B hearing officer issued a decision on August 30, 1995, finding that the Seating System was DME and concluding that Part B did not provide reimbursement for the disputed claims.  However, after an ex parte hearing, an ALJ reversed the hearing officer's decision on January 3, 1996, ruling that the Seating Systems \"[were] orthotic braces and not wheelchairs.\"   On March 1, 1996, the Appeals Board denied HCFA's petition to review the ALJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Region B and Region C appeals were consolidated before a carrier fair hearing officer.  On February 9, 1996, the hearing officer decided that the Seating System was an orthotic device rather than DME.  This ended the matter, as the statute gives HCFA no administrative appeal from a hearing officer's adverse decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The net result of these proceedings was that by early 1996, HCFA's view of the Seating System as DME--as expressed in its 1990 letter to OrthoConcepts and its 1994 notice to its carriers--was at odds with the decisions of an ALJ and a hearing officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These decisions prompted HCFA to issue HCFAR 96-1, which became effective September 18, 1996.  Noting the above-mentioned decisions classifying the Seating System as an orthotic, the Ruling's stated purpose is \"to provide clarification and guidance regarding the scope and meaning of the statutory benefits for 'orthotics' and '[DME].' \" HCFAR 96-1 at 2. The Ruling discusses the relevant statutes, regulations, legislative history, and administrative materials before reaching its conclusion:  the definition of \"orthotics\" \"is limited to leg, arm, back, and neck braces that are used independently [of], rather than in conjunction with, or as components of, other kinds of medical equipment.\"  Id. at 10.   The Ruling also provides several illustrations of DME, one of which unmistakably refers to the OrthoConcepts Seating System.  See id. at 7-8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, 1997, two Medicare beneficiaries who used the Seating System in SNFs and three OrthoConcepts suppliers (hereinafter, Appellees will be referred to collectively as \"OrthoConcepts\") brought the present district court action challenging HCFAR 96-1.  Appellees advanced the procedural claim that HCFAR 96-1 was invalid, having been adopted without compliance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 553, and the Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395hh.  Appellees also made the substantive claim that HCFAR 96-1 was arbitrary and capricious, see 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A).  Appellees sought a declaration that the Ruling was void and that the Seating System was reimbursable as a brace.  They also requested a preliminary injunction blocking HCFA from enforcing the Ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding a hearing on Appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction, the district court notified the parties that it would issue a final determination on the merits of Appellees' claims.  On March 7, 1997, the district court ruled that HCFAR 96-1 is a substantive rule and, therefore, invalid because HCFA issued it without following notice and comment procedures.  The court went on to hold that, the definitions of DME and orthotics in effect prior to the Ruling prevented HCFA from treating the Seating System as DME.  (The court left open the possibility that HCFA could validly re-enact the Ruling after using notice and comment procedures.)   The court also enjoined HCFA from denying Appellees reimbursement for the Seating System.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>1.

See La Casa Del Convaleciente v. Sullivan, 965 F.2d 1175, 1177 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Convaleciente \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The APA exempts \"interpretative rules\" from its notice and comment procedures.  5 U.S.C. &#167; 553(b)(B).  The Medicare Act expressly incorporates the APA's exemption for interpretive rules.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395hh(b)(2)(C) (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The line between a legislative or substantive rule and an interpretative one is, as many courts have noted, far from clear.  See, e.g., Convaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1177.   The APA itself does not define \"substantive\" and \"interpretive\" (or, in the APA's nomenclature, \"interpretative\") rules.  Moreover, courts and other authorities have provided any number of definitions, lending further imprecision to the field.  Nevertheless, a few reasonably clear principles have emerged, leading us to conclude that HCFAR 96-1 is interpretative, and could be promulgated without notice and comment procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most authoritative explanation of the substantive/interpretative distinction is that provided by the Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act (1947).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The Attorney General's Manual described an interpretive rule as one \"issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.\"  Id. at 30 n. 3. Courts have routinely quoted this definition with approval.  See Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 99, 115 S.Ct. 1232, 131 L.Ed.2d 106 (1995);  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 n. 31, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979);  Convaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1178.   The Attorney General's Manual defines substantive, or legislative, rules as those that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>are issued by an agency pursuant to statutory authority and which implement the statute [such as the Securities and Exchange Commission's proxy rules issued pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78n(b) ].

Block, 723 F.2d 175, 182 (1st Cir.1983).  The Seventh Circuit has stated that \"rules are legislative when the agency is exercising delegated power to make law through rules, and rules are interpretative when the agency is not exercising such delegated power in issuing them.\"  Metropolitan Sch. Dist. v. Davila, 969 F.2d 485, 490 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a rule falls along the interpretative/legislative spectrum will turn in many cases on the novelty of a rule's substantive content.  \"If a rule creates rights, assigns duties, or imposes obligations, the basic tenor of which is not already outlined in the law itself, then it is substantive.\"  Convaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1178 (emphasis supplied);  see also American Mining Congress v. Mine Safety &amp; Health Admin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1112 (D.C.Cir.1993) (stating that a rule is legislative if \"in the absence of the rule there would not be an adequate legislative basis for enforcement action or other agency action to confer benefits or ensure the performance of duties\").  Put more succinctly, a rule is exempt from notice and comment as an interpretative rule if it does not \"effect a substantive change in the regulations.\"  Guernsey, 514 U.S. at 100, 115 S.Ct. 1232 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its face, HCFAR 96-1 appears to satisfy the criteria for an interpretive rule.  We have said that an important factor in determining whether a rule is interpretive is the agency's own characterization.  See Convaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1178;  Levesque, 723 F.2d at 182.   It is not disputed that HCFA intended HCFAR 96-1 to be interpretative.  The Ruling itself purports only to \"clarify\" the proper application of existing statutory and regulatory definitions to a particular case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the Ruling does not establish any new standard.  Rather, it addresses an area of ambiguity:  whether a device comprising both orthotic and DME components should be reimbursed as a brace or as DME.  The statutory and regulatory definitions of DME and orthotics predated the Ruling, but neither was so complete as to provide an unambiguous answer to the question of the Seating System's classification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  These definitions created the need for clarification--precisely the function of an interpretative rule--and they provided an \"adequate legislative basis for [the agency action].\"  American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1112.   The Ruling does not stake out any ground \"the basic tenor of which [was] not already outlined in the law itself.\"  Convaleciente, 965 F.2d at 1178.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find guidance in the Supreme Court's recent Guernsey decision.  There, the Court considered whether the interpretative rule exemption applied to an accounting provision in HCFA's Provider Reimbursement Manual (\"PRM\").  Like HCFAR 96-1, the PRM provision at issue in Guernsey \"[did] not purport to be a regulation and [had] not been adopted pursuant to the notice-and-comment procedures of the [APA].\" 514 U.S. at 90, 115 S.Ct. 1232.   The Court determined that the PRM provision concerned \"[t]he only question unaddressed by the otherwise comprehensive regulations on this particular subject.\"  Id. at 97, 115 S.Ct. 1232.   The Court concluded that the measure \"[was] a prototypical example of an interpretive rule\" because the PRM provision merely applied existing law, id. at 99, 115 S.Ct. 1232, and was not \"inconsistent with any of the Secretary's existing regulations,\" id. at 100, 115 S.Ct. 1232.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasoning in Guernsey applies here.  The Medicare statute and regulations provide a comprehensive classification of equipment as DME or orthotics.  The Ruling addresses a small overlap in this scheme.  The answer the Ruling provides is consistent with the existing definitions.  The statute and regulations define braces only by referring to particular types of braces, none of which would have to include a system of braces attached to a wheeled base.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(s)(9).  But clearly the Seating System fits within one category or the other, so HCFA was acting in an interpretive, rather than legislative, capacity.  See United Technologies Corp. v. EPA, 821 F.2d 714, 719-20 (D.C.Cir.1987) (\"If the rule is based on specific statutory provisions, and its validity stands or falls on the correctness of the agency's interpretation of those provisions, it is an interpretative rule.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, the Ruling is not inconsistent with existing law because the statutory and regulatory definitions of DME are broad enough to include the Seating System.  It is conceded that the Seating System \"[c]an withstand repeated use,\" 42 C.F.R. &#167; 414.202, a principal regulatory criterion differentiating DME from other equipment.  Moreover, it is not inconsistent to treat the Seating System--which is, after all, a wheeled device in which a patient sits--as a customized wheelchair, a piece of equipment specifically identified as DME.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(n);  42 C.F.R. &#167; 414.224.  Nothing in any of the existing statutory or regulatory definitions is inconsistent with HCFAR 96-1.  Together, the extant definitions were ambiguous in respect to the category within which the Seating System best fit, and \"the quintessential example of an interpretive rule\" is \"[a] statement seeking to interpret a statutory or regulatory term.\"  Orengo Caraballo v. Reich, 11 F.3d 186, 195 (D.C.Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OrthoConcepts' main contention both in the district court and on appeal was that HCFAR 96-1 was legislative because it changed HCFA's policy of reimbursing the Seating System as DME.  This argument rests on erroneous views of both the law and the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal point is clear enough:  in order for notice and comment to be necessary, \"the [later] rule would have to be inconsistent with another rule having the force of law, not just any agency interpretation regardless of whether it had been codified.\"  Chief Probation Officers v. Shalala, 118 F.3d 1327, 1337 (9th Cir.1997) (White, J.  (Retired, sitting by designation)).  The Supreme Court in Guernsey intimated this much, concluding that the provision there was interpretive because it did not contradict \"any of the Secretary's existing regulations.\"  514 U.S. at 100, 115 S.Ct. 1232 (emphasis supplied);  see also id. at 111, 115 S.Ct. 1232 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (observing that interpretive rules \"must explain existing law and not contradict what the [extant] regulations require\").  The lower federal courts are in agreement on this score.  See, e.g., Orengo, 11 F.3d at 196 (explaining that a subsequent rule is legislative \"[o]nly where [the] second rule repudiates or is irreconcilable with [a prior legislative rule]\");  White v. Shalala, 7 F.3d 296, 304 (2d Cir.1993) (\"If the rule is an interpretation of a statute rather than an extra-statutory imposition of rights, duties or obligations, it remains interpretive even if the rule embodies the Secretary's changed interpretation of the statute.\");  Davila, 969 F.2d at 492 (\"[A]n agency's change in its reading of the statute does not necessarily make the rule announcing the change legislative.\").  As already stated, see supra, nothing in the statute or regulations addresses the precise issue decided in HCFAR 96-1.  Thus, even supposing HCFA's pre-Ruling policy was different, the earlier policy would not prevent HCFA from adopting a contrary new interpretative rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we very much doubt that the Ruling, by limiting the coverage of braces to devices used independently of DME, added something new to HCFA's policies.  In siding with OrthoConcepts, the district court concluded that the agency's informal pronouncements and practices regarding the reimbursement of the Seating System indicated a pre-Ruling policy to treat the Seating System as an orthotic.  A number of factors, however, suggest the opposite conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the HCFA regional office's 1990 letter to OrthoConcepts specifically stated that the Seating System was DME.  The district court disregarded this letter because a former OrthoConcepts attorney submitted an unsworn affidavit stating that the office promised to issue a letter rescinding the corresponding order instructing its carriers to treat the Seating System as DME.  However, as the district court found, \"there is no evidence that HCFA ever sent such a letter,\" nor is there any evidence corroborating the unsworn affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, HCFA instructed its carriers on three separate occasions that devices quite similar to the Seating System should be treated as DME.  The first two memoranda, issued in 1987 and 1989, dealt with \"contoured corrective seats,\" and concluded, as the 1989 memorandum put it, that the \"only statutory provision that could apply to such equipment\" was DME.  The district court dismissed these memoranda on the ground that, by questioning whether the devices served a medical purpose, they relied on an alternative basis for denying the contoured corrective seats coverage.  However, we cannot see how the inclusion of this complementary argument contradicts or negates the independent conclusion that the equipment at issue was DME.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further manifestation of HCFA's earlier policy was its 1994 instruction to treat as DME equipment designated by the K-codes 0115 and 0116.  The district court dismissed the 1994 instruction as \"not directly on point,\" but the instruction set out a policy for equipment that, like the Seating System and the first illustration given in HCFAR 96-1, contained orthotic attachments.  While the 1994 instruction addressed equipment with a different technical design, it implicitly contained the same principle as the Ruling:  DME includes orthotic components that cannot be used independently of attached DME.  That the 1994 instruction (as well as the 1987 and 1989 memoranda) did not address the precise equipment at issue here does not mean that HCFA had no relevant policy:  \"an interpretive statement may 'suppl[y] crisper and more detailed lines than the authority being interpreted.' \"  Orengo, 11 F.3d at 195 (quoting American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1112).   Thus, we reject OrthoConcepts' contention that HCFAR 96-1 effected a substantive change in the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback position, OrthoConcepts argues that HCFAR 96-1 could not be valid without notice-and-comment rulemaking because it has a binding effect on agency personnel.  This argument confuses two senses in which a rule may bind.  Of course, a rule with the force and effect of law--binding not only the agency and regulated parties, but also the courts--is by definition a substantive rule.  However, a rule may lack this force and still bind agency personnel.  Accordingly, \"[a]n interpretative rule binds an agency's employees, including its ALJs, but it does not bind the agency itself.\"   Kenneth C. Davis &amp; Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 6.3 at 104 (3d ed. 1996 &amp; Supp.1997).  In other words, a rule may be \"binding\" but not, for purposes of notice and comment, \"substantive,\" or legislative.  We rejected an argument almost identical to OrthoConcepts' in Levesque:  \"If plaintiffs mean that any rule that an agency intends to be effective must be legislative, they are plainly wrong.  Every rule is intended to have some effect.\"  723 F.2d at 181-82;  see also American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1111 (\"[R]estricting discretion tells one little about whether a rule is interpretive.\");  Davila, 969 F.2d at 493 (\"All rules which interpret the underlying statute must be binding because they set forth what the agency believes is congressional intent.\").  The fact that the Ruling binds HCFA carriers and ALJs is entirely consistent with its status as an interpretative rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject OrthoConcepts' argument that HCFAR 96-1 was not legally adopted because of the absence of notice and comment procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing the Ruling and from denying OrthoConcepts' reimbursement for its Seating System under the braces benefit.  It granted this relief based on the erroneous belief, supra, that HCFAR 96-1 was invalidly promulgated, leaving HCFA without an adequate basis for treating the Seating System as DME.  As held above, however, HCFAR 96-1 was properly promulgated;  we now further hold that the Ruling's interpretation of the Seating System as DME is adequately supported by the Medicare statute and regulations.  We therefore vacate the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A threshold question is what deference is owed to an interpretative rule such as HCFAR 96-1.  The Supreme Court has not expressed a view on whether or to what extent the Chevron framework, see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), applies to interpretive, rather than legislative rules, and other circuits are split on the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide the issue here because, even assuming arguendo that Chevron deference is not applicable to interpretative rules, we are persuaded that HCFAR 96-1 is an appropriate construction of the statute.  We are guided in this regard by Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).  There, the Court considered a rule that, having been issued by an agency not authorized to make legislative rules, was necessarily interpretative and without the force of law.  See id. at 138, 65 S.Ct. 161.   The Supreme Court approved the agency's interpretation and explained the proper approach to judicial review of interpretative rules:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>[T]he rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.  The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161.   Considering all of these factors, we think the interpretation embodied in HCFAR 96-1 is wholly supportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as already discussed, see supra, HCFAR 96-1 is generally consistent with HCFA's earlier informal pronouncements.  See Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. 504, 517 n. 13, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981) (describing \"scrutiny applicable to interpretive rules\" as involving \"due deference to consistent agency practice\").  Hence to the extent that inconsistency with prior policies might lead us to find an interpretative rule arbitrary or capricious, we see no inconsistencies of such a nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we find the Ruling to be a persuasive reading of the statute and HCFA's regulations.  Those materials establish three criteria for classifying a device as DME:  the item must be \"durable,\" i.e., able to \"withstand repeated use\";  it must be reasonably necessary \"medical equipment\";  and it must be \"appropriate for use in the home.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(n);  42 C.F.R. &#167; 414.202.  The Seating System meets each of these criteria, and OrthoConcepts advances no serious argument to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, DME unequivocally includes \"wheelchairs,\" see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(n), and the Seating System serves the same (as well as additional) functions as a wheelchair.  OrthoConcepts' own expert admitted that a casual observer might conclude that the product \"looks like a wheelchair.\"   HCFAR 96-1 also conforms to congressional intent as expressed in P.L. 101-508, &#167; 4152(c)(4), the interim amendment to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395m(a)(4) specifying that customized wheelchairs are DME.  The legislative history of this provision shows that Congress intended DME to include \"postural control devices\" and \"custom molded cushions and inserts, or lateral supports\" associated with wheelchairs.  H.R. No. 101-881, at 268 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2017, 2270.   In short, it takes no great leap to conclude that congressional intent is well effectuated by treating the Seating System as DME.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further support for HCFA's view is provided by the American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association, which has stated that the Seating System is a brace only when that term is used \"in its most broad sense,\" and that the items are \"more accurately described as a subset of orthoses called seating systems or wheeled mobility devices.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that the entire device could alternatively be reasonably construed to satisfy the definition of a brace (which includes only examples of individual braces), there was nothing precluding HCFA from resolving the ambiguity in favor of DME.  The district court concluded that equipment that could be categorized as both DME and an orthotic must be treated as an orthotic based on a portion of the MCM 's definition of DME that provides that \"[t]here are other items which, although durable in nature, may [sic] fall into other coverage categories such as braces [and other categories].\"  MCM &#167; 2000.1.  We do not read this language as establishing DME as a category of last resort;  it does not say, for instance, that any equipment that could be classified as a brace is necessarily not DME.  Instead, it uses the term \"may,\" suggesting that the classification of equipment that is both brace-like and durable is left to HCFA.  Accordingly, we do not accept OrthoConcepts' argument that HCFA had bound itself to resolve cases of ambiguity on the side of braces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that in establishing its policy, HCFA has been deliberate.  HCFA has on multiple occasions met with OrthoConcepts' representatives, examined the equipment at issue, and given consideration to the statute and regulations as applied to the Seating System and comparable devices.  HCFA's thoroughness belies OrthoConcepts' claim that HCFAR 96-1 is merely a litigating position entitled to no deference under Smiley v. Citibank, N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 1736, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the classification of medical equipment for reimbursement purposes is the sort of technical question that generally benefits from HCFA's expertise and experience.  See Stowell v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 3 F.3d 539, 544 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that \"[c]ourts should not cavalierly discount the value of agency expertise painstakingly garnered in the administration, over time, of programs of remarkable intricacy\" and citing cases);  Hospital San Jorge v. Secretary of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare, 616 F.2d 580, 589 (1st Cir.1980) (Campbell, J., concurring) (stating that \"[m]atters of [Medicare] accounting, unless they 'be the expression of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment,' are for the agency\" (quoting American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. United States, 299 U.S. 232, 237, 57 S.Ct. 170, 81 L.Ed. 142 (1936))).  Given HCFA's expertise in administering Medicare Part B, the logic of its interpretation, and the consistency of its policy, we conclude that the denial of claims for reimbursement of the Seating System under the brace benefit was not arbitrary or capricious, and thus withstands OrthoConcepts' challenge under 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and remanded with instruction to vacate the injunction and to enter judgment for Appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See also 42 C.F.R. &#167; 410.38(a), (b) (explaining that \"Medicare Part B pays for [DME], if the equipment is used in the patient's home or in an institution that is used as a home\" and that \"[a]n institution that is used as a home may not be a hospital or a [critical access hospital as defined at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(mm) ] or a SNF\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The amended definition of DME included any wheelchair \"measured, fitted, or adapted in consideration of the patient's body size, disability, period of need, or intended use, and ... assembled by a supplier ... who makes available customized features, modifications, or components for wheelchairs that are intended for an individual patient's use in accordance with instructions from the patient's physician.\"   P.L. 101-508, &#167; 4152(c)(4)(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To receive reimbursement of past medical expenditures or pre-payment of expected costs, the beneficiary of the expenditures (or a \"supplier of services\" that has accepted assignment of the beneficiary's claim) must request payment from HCFA' designated carrier.

See infra.   While various provisions define braces and DME, no single provision concisely differentiates the two, leaving it open which category is implicated when, as here, a brace-like device is used as part of a wheeled item that might be classified as DME.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal statutory definition of DME states that \"[DME] includes iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and wheelchairs.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(s)(6) (emphasis supplied).  Elsewhere the statute includes special payment provisions for certain types of DME, including \"items requiring frequent and substantial servicing,\" id. &#167; 1395m(a)(3), and equipment customized to an individual patient's needs, see id. &#167; 1395m(a)(4).  However, neither of these provisions can be read to expand &#167; 1395x(s)(6)'s definition of DME, because both are expressly limited to a subset of DME.  See id. &#167; 1395m(13) (defining \"covered item[s]\" under &#167; 1395m to be DME \"as defined in section 1395x(n)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, Congress amended &#167; 1395m(a)(4) to add a provision--which ultimately, by its own terms, was superseded by a HCFA regulation--expressly providing that customized wheelchairs were DME.

The OrthoConcepts Product</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to illness, injury, and in some cases old age, thousands of Medicare beneficiaries suffer from musculoskeletal failure so severe as to render them incapable of moving or supporting their own limbs.  These catastrophically crippled patients are vulnerable to numerous painful conditions.  One of the most serious is contractures, a condition in which muscles become rigid and resistant to elongation following a long period of disuse.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 373 (28th ed.1994).  Other complications include the development of pressure sores, circulatory problems, and infections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To manage the condition of patients with grave musculoskeletal failure, OrthoConcepts designed what it has marketed as the \"OrthoConcepts Seating System.\"   The Seating System consists of a set of connected braces--the number and type depending on the patient's condition--attached to a wheeled base.  The patient sits, or reclines, on the Seating System, and the component braces maintain the patient in a position designed to reduce the weight borne by weaker extremities and to prevent contractures.  Since 1989, OrthoConcepts has supplied the Seating System to more than 2700 patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>3. HCFA's Classification of the OrthoConcepts Seating System</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, 1989, OrthoConcepts informed a regional HCFA office that OrthoConcepts would soon begin marketing the Seating System nationwide.  OrthoConcepts' letter inquired about the Medicare coverage status of the Seating System and asked HCFA to establish a new billing code (known as a \"L code,\" a standardized billing classification for \"orthotics,\" or braces) that would allow the Seating System to be reimbursed as a brace.  The regional office replied in January of 1990, advising OrthoConcepts that Part B covered the Seating System as DME, not as orthotics, and that it would provide no L Code for billing the Seating System as an orthotic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regional office also wrote its private carriers regarding the Seating System, instructing them to treat the device as DME.  By letter dated February 21, 1990, the carrier then responsible for OrthoConcepts' claims, Nationwide Insurance, notified OrthoConcepts of the HCFA regional office's letter and informed it that its products \"are classified as [DME];  not orthotics.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1992, HCFA reorganized its system for processing claims for DME and orthotics, replacing local carriers with four regional carriers known as \"DMERCs.\"   HCFA instructed the DMERCs to issue uniform reimbursement policies.  In August, 1993, the DMERCs announced that they would reimburse certain orthotic seating systems (known by the billing designations or \"K-codes\" as K-0115 and K-0116) as braces.  These seating systems were functionally quite similar to the OrthoConcepts Seating System, differing principally in that they were fitted using a plaster cast of the individual patient rather than the manually-adjusted attachments that are part of the Seating System.  The following April, after learning of this billing practice, HCFA informed the DMERCs that K-codes 0115 and 0116 described DME, not orthotics.  The DMERCs in turn notified their respective suppliers of HCFA's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite HCFA's 1990 letter declaring the Seating System DME, OrthoConcepts, through its corporate affiliates, continued to bill Seating Systems supplied to patients at SNFs as an orthotic.  Upon learning of this practice, HCFA's Region A DMERC suspended Medicare payments to OrthoConcepts in December, 1994.  Following a meeting with OrthoConcepts representatives and an inspection of SNFs where the Seating System was in use, one of the carriers concluded that the billed equipment was in fact DME, and notified the OrthoConcepts affiliates that it was obligated to refund the Part B payments.  Soon thereafter, the Region B and Region C DMERCs denied OrthoConcepts reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OrthoConcepts appealed from the carriers' denials of their Part B claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In the Region A appeal, a Part B hearing officer issued a decision on August 30, 1995, finding that the Seating System was DME and concluding that Part B did not provide reimbursement for the disputed claims.  However, after an ex parte hearing, an ALJ reversed the hearing officer's decision on January 3, 1996, ruling that the Seating Systems \"[were] orthotic braces and not wheelchairs.\"   On March 1, 1996, the Appeals Board denied HCFA's petition to review the ALJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Region B and Region C appeals were consolidated before a carrier fair hearing officer.  On February 9, 1996, the hearing officer decided that the Seating System was an orthotic device rather than DME.  This ended the matter, as the statute gives HCFA no administrative appeal from a hearing officer's adverse decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The net result of these proceedings was that by early 1996, HCFA's view of the Seating System as DME--as expressed in its 1990 letter to OrthoConcepts and its 1994 notice to its carriers--was at odds with the decisions of an ALJ and a hearing officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These decisions prompted HCFA to issue HCFAR 96-1, which became effective September 18, 1996.  Noting the above-mentioned decisions classifying the Seating System as an orthotic, the Ruling's stated purpose is \"to provide clarification and guidance regarding the scope and meaning of the statutory benefits for 'orthotics' and '[DME].' \" HCFAR 96-1 at 2. The Ruling discusses the relevant statutes, regulations, legislative history, and administrative materials before reaching its conclusion:  the definition of \"orthotics\" \"is limited to leg, arm, back, and neck braces that are used independently [of], rather than in conjunction with, or as components of, other kinds of medical equipment.\"  Id. at 10.   The Ruling also provides several illustrations of DME, one of which unmistakably refers to the OrthoConcepts Seating System.  See id. at 7-8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, 1997, two Medicare beneficiaries who used the Seating System in SNFs and three OrthoConcepts suppliers (hereinafter, Appellees will be referred to collectively as \"OrthoConcepts\") brought the present district court action challenging HCFAR 96-1.  Appellees advanced the procedural claim that HCFAR 96-1 was invalid, having been adopted without compliance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 553, and the Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395hh.  Appellees also made the substantive claim that HCFAR 96-1 was arbitrary and capricious, see 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A).  Appellees sought a declaration that the Ruling was void and that the Seating System was reimbursable as a brace.  They also requested a preliminary injunction blocking HCFA from enforcing the Ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding a hearing on Appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction, the district court notified the parties that it would issue a final determination on the merits of Appellees' claims.  On March 7, 1997, the district court ruled that HCFAR 96-1 is a substantive rule and, therefore, invalid because HCFA issued it without following notice and comment procedures.  The court went on to hold that, the definitions of DME and orthotics in effect prior to the Ruling prevented HCFA from treating the Seating System as DME.  (The court left open the possibility that HCFA could validly re-enact the Ruling after using notice and comment procedures.)   The court also enjoined HCFA from denying Appellees reimbursement for the Seating System.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>1.

Moreover, courts and other authorities have provided any number of definitions, lending further imprecision to the field.

The Medicare statute and regulations provide a comprehensive classification of equipment as DME or orthotics.  The Ruling addresses a small overlap in this scheme.  The answer the Ruling provides is consistent with the existing definitions.  The statute and regulations define braces only by referring to particular types of braces, none of which would have to include a system of braces attached to a wheeled base.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(s)(9).  But clearly the Seating System fits within one category or the other, so HCFA was acting in an interpretive, rather than legislative, capacity.  See United Technologies Corp. v. EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490091\"><a href=\"/opinion/490091/united-technologies-corporation-pratt-whitney-group-v-us/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 719-20 (D.C.Cir.1987) (\"If the rule is based on specific statutory provisions, and its validity stands or falls on the correctness of the agency's interpretation of those provisions, it is an interpretative rule.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, the Ruling is not inconsistent with existing law because the statutory and regulatory definitions of DME are broad enough to include the Seating System.  It is conceded that the Seating System \"[c]an withstand repeated use,\" 42 C.F.R. &#167; 414.202, a principal regulatory criterion differentiating DME from other equipment.  Moreover, it is not inconsistent to treat the Seating System--which is, after all, a wheeled device in which a patient sits--as a customized wheelchair, a piece of equipment specifically identified as DME.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(n);  42 C.F.R. &#167; 414.224.  Nothing in any of the existing statutory or regulatory definitions is inconsistent with HCFAR 96-1.  Together, the extant definitions were ambiguous in respect to the category within which the Seating System best fit, and \"the quintessential example of an interpretive rule\" is \"[a] statement seeking to interpret a statutory or regulatory term.\"  Orengo Caraballo v. Reich, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658534\"><a href=\"/opinion/658534/jose-a-orengo-caraballo-wilfred-santiago-santiago-comite-de-apoyo-a-los/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 195 (D.C.Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OrthoConcepts' main contention both in the district court and on appeal was that HCFAR 96-1 was legislative because it changed HCFA's policy of reimbursing the Seating System as DME.  This argument rests on erroneous views of both the law and the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal point is clear enough:  in order for notice and comment to be necessary, \"the [later] rule would have to be inconsistent with another rule having the force of law, not just any agency interpretation regardless of whether it had been codified.\"  Chief Probation Officers v.

The Supreme Court in Guernsey intimated this much, concluding that the provision there was interpretive because it did not contradict \"any of the Secretary's existing regulations.\"  514 U.S. at 100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117909\"><a href=\"/opinion/117909/shalala-v-guernsey-memorial-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1232</span></a></span> (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (observing that interpretive rules \"must explain existing law and not contradict what the [extant] regulations require\").  The lower federal courts are in agreement on this score.  See, e.g., Orengo, 11 F.3d at 196 (explaining that a subsequent rule is legislative \"[o]nly where [the] second rule repudiates or is irreconcilable with [a prior legislative rule]\");  White v. Shalala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655294\"><a href=\"/opinion/655294/cecile-white-and-dorothy-e-greene-intervenor-on-behalf-of-themselves-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 304 (2d Cir.1993) (\"If the rule is an interpretation of a statute rather than an extra-statutory imposition of rights, duties or obligations, it remains interpretive even if the rule embodies the Secretary's changed interpretation of the statute.\");  Davila, 969 F.2d at 492 (\"[A]n agency's change in its reading of the statute does not necessarily make the rule announcing the change legislative.\").  As already stated, see supra, nothing in the statute or regulations addresses the precise issue decided in HCFAR 96-1.  Thus, even supposing HCFA's pre-Ruling policy was different, the earlier policy would not prevent HCFA from adopting a contrary new interpretative rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we very much doubt that the Ruling, by limiting the coverage of braces to devices used independently of DME, added something new to HCFA's policies.  In siding with OrthoConcepts, the district court concluded that the agency's informal pronouncements and practices regarding the reimbursement of the Seating System indicated a pre-Ruling policy to treat the Seating System as an orthotic.  A number of factors, however, suggest the opposite conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the HCFA regional office's 1990 letter to OrthoConcepts specifically stated that the Seating System was DME.  The district court disregarded this letter because a former OrthoConcepts attorney submitted an unsworn affidavit stating that the office promised to issue a letter rescinding the corresponding order instructing its carriers to treat the Seating System as DME.  However, as the district court found, \"there is no evidence that HCFA ever sent such a letter,\" nor is there any evidence corroborating the unsworn affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, HCFA instructed its carriers on three separate occasions that devices quite similar to the Seating System should be treated as DME.  The first two memoranda, issued in 1987 and 1989, dealt with \"contoured corrective seats,\" and concluded, as the 1989 memorandum put it, that the \"only statutory provision that could apply to such equipment\" was DME.  The district court dismissed these memoranda on the ground that, by questioning whether the devices served a medical purpose, they relied on an alternative basis for denying the contoured corrective seats coverage.  However, we cannot see how the inclusion of this complementary argument contradicts or negates the independent conclusion that the equipment at issue was DME.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further manifestation of HCFA's earlier policy was its 1994 instruction to treat as DME equipment designated by the K-codes 0115 and 0116.  The district court dismissed the 1994 instruction as \"not directly on point,\" but the instruction set out a policy for equipment that, like the Seating System and the first illustration given in HCFAR 96-1, contained orthotic attachments.  While the 1994 instruction addressed equipment with a different technical design, it implicitly contained the same principle as the Ruling:  DME includes orthotic components that cannot be used independently of attached DME.  That the 1994 instruction (as well as the 1987 and 1989 memoranda) did not address the precise equipment at issue here does not mean that HCFA had no relevant policy:  \"an interpretive statement may 'suppl[y] crisper and more detailed lines than the authority being interpreted.' \"  Orengo, 11 F.3d at 195 (quoting American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1112).   Thus, we reject OrthoConcepts' contention that HCFAR 96-1 effected a substantive change in the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback position, OrthoConcepts argues that HCFAR 96-1 could not be valid without notice-and-comment rulemaking because it has a binding effect on agency personnel.  This argument confuses two senses in which a rule may bind.  Of course, a rule with the force and effect of law--binding not only the agency and regulated parties, but also the courts--is by definition a substantive rule.  However, a rule may lack this force and still bind agency personnel.  Accordingly, \"[a]n interpretative rule binds an agency's employees, including its ALJs, but it does not bind the agency itself.\"   Kenneth C. Davis &amp; Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 6.3 at 104 (3d ed. 1996 &amp; Supp.1997).  In other words, a rule may be \"binding\" but not, for purposes of notice and comment, \"substantive,\" or legislative.  We rejected an argument almost identical to OrthoConcepts' in Levesque:  \"If plaintiffs mean that any rule that an agency intends to be effective must be legislative, they are plainly wrong.  Every rule is intended to have some effect.\"  723 F.2d at 181-82;  see also American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1111 (\"[R]estricting discretion tells one little about whether a rule is interpretive.\");  Davila, 969 F.2d at 493 (\"All rules which interpret the underlying statute must be binding because they set forth what the agency believes is congressional intent.\").  The fact that the Ruling binds HCFA carriers and ALJs is entirely consistent with its status as an interpretative rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject OrthoConcepts' argument that HCFAR 96-1 was not legally adopted because of the absence of notice and comment procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing the Ruling and from denying OrthoConcepts' reimbursement for its Seating System under the braces benefit.  It granted this relief based on the erroneous belief, supra, that HCFAR 96-1 was invalidly promulgated, leaving HCFA without an adequate basis for treating the Seating System as DME.  As held above, however, HCFAR 96-1 was properly promulgated;  we now further hold that the Ruling's interpretation of the Seating System as DME is adequately supported by the Medicare statute and regulations.  We therefore vacate the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A threshold question is what deference is owed to an interpretative rule such as HCFAR 96-1.  The Supreme Court has not expressed a view on whether or to what extent the Chevron framework, see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We are guided in this regard by Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span> (1944).  There, the Court considered a rule that, having been issued by an agency not authorized to make legislative rules, was necessarily interpretative and without the force of law.  See id. at 138, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court approved the agency's interpretation and explained the proper approach to judicial review of interpretative rules:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>[T]he rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.  The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">323 U.S. at 140, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>.   Considering all of these factors, we think the interpretation embodied in HCFAR 96-1 is wholly supportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as already discussed, see supra, HCFAR 96-1 is generally consistent with HCFA's earlier informal pronouncements.  See Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110477\"><a href=\"/opinion/110477/alessi-v-raybestos-manhattan-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 517 n. 13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110477\"><a href=\"/opinion/110477/alessi-v-raybestos-manhattan-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span> (1981) (describing \"scrutiny applicable to interpretive rules\" as involving \"due deference to consistent agency practice\").  Hence to the extent that inconsistency with prior policies might lead us to find an interpretative rule arbitrary or capricious, we see no inconsistencies of such a nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we find the Ruling to be a persuasive reading of the statute and HCFA's regulations.  Those materials establish three criteria for classifying a device as DME:  the item must be \"durable,\" i.e., able to \"withstand repeated use\";  it must be reasonably necessary \"medical equipment\";  and it must be \"appropriate for use in the home.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(n);  42 C.F.R. &#167; 414.202.  The Seating System meets each of these criteria, and OrthoConcepts advances no serious argument to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, DME unequivocally includes \"wheelchairs,\" see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(n), and the Seating System serves the same (as well as additional) functions as a wheelchair.  OrthoConcepts' own expert admitted that a casual observer might conclude that the product \"looks like a wheelchair.\"   HCFAR 96-1 also conforms to congressional intent as expressed in P.L. 101-508, &#167; 4152(c)(4), the interim amendment to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395m(a)(4) specifying that customized wheelchairs are DME.  The legislative history of this provision shows that Congress intended DME to include \"postural control devices\" and \"custom molded cushions and inserts, or lateral supports\" associated with wheelchairs.  H.R. No. 101-881, at 268 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2017, 2270.   In short, it takes no great leap to conclude that congressional intent is well effectuated by treating the Seating System as DME.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further support for HCFA's view is provided by the American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association, which has stated that the Seating System is a brace only when that term is used \"in its most broad sense,\" and that the items are \"more accurately described as a subset of orthoses called seating systems or wheeled mobility devices.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that the entire device could alternatively be reasonably construed to satisfy the definition of a brace (which includes only examples of individual braces), there was nothing precluding HCFA from resolving the ambiguity in favor of DME.  The district court concluded that equipment that could be categorized as both DME and an orthotic must be treated as an orthotic based on a portion of the MCM 's definition of DME that provides that \"[t]here are other items which, although durable in nature, may [sic] fall into other coverage categories such as braces [and other categories].\"  MCM &#167; 2000.1.  We do not read this language as establishing DME as a category of last resort;  it does not say, for instance, that any equipment that could be classified as a brace is necessarily not DME.  Instead, it uses the term \"may,\" suggesting that the classification of equipment that is both brace-like and durable is left to HCFA.  Accordingly, we do not accept OrthoConcepts' argument that HCFA had bound itself to resolve cases of ambiguity on the side of braces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that in establishing its policy, HCFA has been deliberate.  HCFA has on multiple occasions met with OrthoConcepts' representatives, examined the equipment at issue, and given consideration to the statute and regulations as applied to the Seating System and comparable devices.  HCFA's thoroughness belies OrthoConcepts' claim that HCFAR 96-1 is merely a litigating position entitled to no deference under Smiley v. Citibank, N.A., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118032\"><a href=\"/opinion/118032/smiley-v-citibank-south-dakota-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118032\"><a href=\"/opinion/118032/smiley-v-citibank-south-dakota-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Given HCFA's expertise in administering Medicare Part B, the logic of its interpretation, and the consistency of its policy, we conclude that the denial of claims for reimbursement of the Seating System under the brace benefit was not arbitrary or capricious, and thus withstands OrthoConcepts' challenge under 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and remanded with instruction to vacate the injunction and to enter judgment for Appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See also 42 C.F.R. &#167; 410.38(a), (b) (explaining that \"Medicare Part B pays for [DME], if the equipment is used in the patient's home or in an institution that is used as a home\" and that \"[a]n institution that is used as a home may not be a hospital or a [critical access hospital as defined at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(mm) ] or a SNF\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The amended definition of DME included any wheelchair \"measured, fitted, or adapted in consideration of the patient's body size, disability, period of need, or intended use, and ... assembled by a supplier ... who makes available customized features, modifications, or components for wheelchairs that are intended for an individual patient's use in accordance with instructions from the patient's physician.\"   P.L. 101-508, &#167; 4152(c)(4)(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To receive reimbursement of past medical expenditures or pre-payment of expected costs, the beneficiary of the expenditures (or a \"supplier of services\" that has accepted assignment of the beneficiary's claim) must request payment from HCFA' designated carrier.

In Linoz, the court considered a change to the MCM instructing carriers that coverage of ambulance trips to the \"nearest hospital with appropriate facilities\" did not include trips \"solely to avail a patient of the service of ... a physician in a specific specialty.\"   See id. at 876.   The Linoz court held that the limitation imposed by the new provision \"withdrew coverage previously provided,\" id. at 877, therefore changing substantive law</p>\n        <p>Unlike the rule in Linoz, which altered rather than clarified the coverage of ambulance trips, HCFAR 96-1 does not \"carve[ ] out a per se exception\" to a rule that previously contained no exceptions.
