Raymond J. Pettine, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                               \r\n\n                  Before\r\n\n          Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nWellford, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n        and Lynch, Circuit Judge. \r\n\n                               \r\n\nWilliam J. Murphy, by appointment of the Court, for appellant.\r\nRichard W. Rose, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nSheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                               \r\n\n           September 22, 1998\r\n                                        Per Curiam.  Defendant, Jos Figueroa, was charged with\r\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21\r\nU.S.C.  841(a)(1), and carrying a firearm during and in relation\r\nto a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \r\n924(c)(1).  Prior to trial, Figueroa moved to suppress evidence\r\nthat was found after a warrantless search and seizure of a\r\nclosed, opaque box that Figueroa was allegedly carrying during\r\nhis flight from police officers.  Figueroa claimed that the\r\nsearch of the box, which produced a handgun and crack cocaine,\r\nconstituted a violation of his Fourth Amendment protection\r\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures.  On May 30, 1996,\r\nafter an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied\r\nFigueroa's motion to suppress.  Figueroa's trial commenced at the\r\nconclusion of the suppression hearing, and on June 3, 1996, the\r\njury found him guilty on both counts in the indictment.  Figueroa\r\nnow appeals the district court's denial of his motion to\r\nsuppress.  For the following reasons, we affirm.\r\nOn January 22, 1996, Detective Robert Lepre of the Providence\r\nPolice Department obtained a search warrant for Figueroa's\r\npremises on the first floor at 40 Whittier Avenue in Providence. \r\nAlthough 40 Whittier Avenue is a three-floor tenement with an\r\napartment on each floor, the search warrant was for the first-\r\nfloor apartment only.  At approximately 6:30 p.m., Detective\r\nLepre, with eight or nine other members of the Providence Special\r\nInvestigations Bureau, approached the building to execute the\r\nsearch warrant.  As the raid team approached the building, the\r\ndetectives saw Figueroa looking out the front window and saw him\r\nflee from the window.  Detective Colanduono and Detective Harris\r\nwent to cover the rear of the building.  By the time they arrived\r\nat the rear door of the house, they heard Figueroa running from\r\nthe first to the second floor.  They observed that the rear\r\nexterior door was \"wide open,\" and they ran up the stairs after\r\nFigueroa.  Seeing the second-floor apartment door partly open,\r\nthe men entered and saw Figueroa emerging from \"the baby's room\"\r\nwearing shorts, a tee shirt, and socks, standing in an open\r\ndoorway breathing very heavily.  Recognizing that Figueroa\r\nmatched the description of the target of the raid, who was\r\ndescribed as having orange hair, they escorted the defendant out\r\nof the apartment.\r\nThe residents of the second-floor apartment, Rosa Peguero and\r\nAdley Francois, testified that they heard the loud banging of a\r\nforced entry, and then heard somebody coming up the stairs of the\r\napartment building.  Francois opened the door, and Figueroa came\r\nin, carrying a \"small white box\" with a \"pinkish or reddish\"\r\ncover.  Figueroa then went into their baby's room, and the police\r\ncame after him a few seconds later.  Francois indicated to the\r\ndetectives that Figueroa had just run into the apartment, and\r\nthat Figueroa was the person who lived on the first floor. \r\nDetective Harris asked Francois whether Figueroa had carried\r\nanything into the apartment, and Francois pointed to a baby wipes\r\nbox on a changing table in the baby's bedroom.\r\nAfter obtaining Francois' consent to search the baby's room,\r\nHarris opened the box to which Francois had pointed, but it\r\ncontained only baby wipes.  Harris asked Francois, \"Are you sure\r\nit was like this box?\"  Francois replied that the box Figueroa\r\nhad carried was like the baby wipes box, and he suggested that\r\nFigueroa may have thrown it out the window.  Harris, having found\r\nthe window locked and secured, briefly continued searching the\r\nbedroom, and then exited the room to bring Figueroa downstairs to\r\nDetective Lepre.\r\nDetective Colanduono continued the search of the baby's room, and\r\nfound another baby wipes container.  He asked Francois if the box\r\nwas his, and Francois replied, \"No, I think that's what\r\n[Figueroa] brought into the room.\"  Colanduono kicked it and then\r\nbent down and opened it, and observed that it contained a\r\nhandgun, a magazine with three live rounds in the magazine, and\r\npackages of crack cocaine.  The cocaine found in the baby wipes\r\nbox was in the same type of packaging as the cocaine found on the\r\nfirst floor.  The baby wipes box and its contents were seized.\r\nA federal grand jury in the District of Rhode Island returned a\r\ntwo-count indictment charging Figueroa with possession with\r\nintent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\r\n841(a)(1), and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a\r\ndrug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1). \r\nPrior to trial, Figueroa moved to suppress the contents of the\r\nbaby wipes box, claiming that the search of the closed, opaque\r\nbox violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures.  On May 30, 1996, after an\r\nevidentiary hearing, the district court denied Figueroa's motion\r\nto suppress.  The court reasoned that Figueroa had a privacy\r\ninterest in the box, but that the exigency of the circumstances\r\njustified the officer's search.  Though Figueroa had been\r\ndetained by the officers, the court found that \"[i]t is\r\nreasonable and logical to conclude that [Peguero and Francois]\r\nmight well have destroyed the evidence.\"  The trial commenced at\r\nthe conclusion of the suppression hearing, and on June 3, 1996, a\r\njury found Figueroa guilty on both counts.  On September 6, 1996,\r\nthe court sentenced Figueroa to 123 months imprisonment. \r\nFigueroa now appeals, claiming that the district court erred in\r\ndenying his motion to suppress.\r\nPursuant to Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690 (1996), the\r\nstandard of review is de novo for determinations of probable\r\ncause, clear error for findings of fact, and \"due weight\" to\r\ninferences judges and police officers may draw from the facts. \r\nId. at 699.  In United States v. Young, 105 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\r\n1997), we employed this \"dual standard\" in reviewing a motion to\r\nsuppress:\r\nWe review the district court's findings of fact for clear error.\r\n. . .  Deference to the district court's findings of fact\r\nreflects our awareness that the trial judge, who hears the\r\ntestimony, observes the witness' demeanor and evaluates the facts\r\nfirst hand, sits in the best position to determine what actually\r\nhappened.  By contrast, we review conclusions of law de novo and\r\nsubject the trial court's constitutional conclusions to plenary\r\nreview.  Determinations of probable cause and reasonable\r\nsuspicion, relevant to the constitutionality of law enforcement\r\nseizures and arrests under the Fourth Amendment, present mixed\r\nquestions of law and fact which we review de novo.\r\n\nId. at 5 (citations omitted).  \"[W]e can affirm the admission of\r\nevidence on any proper basis, even if the trial judge relied on a\r\ndifferent ground.\"  LaBarre v. Shepard, 84 F.3d 496, 500-01 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (citing United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1127\r\n(1st Cir. 1989)).\r\nIn this appeal, Figueroa argues that, while the seizure of the\r\nbox may have been constitutional under the \"exigent\r\ncircumstances\" exception, the opening of the box was certainly\r\nunconstitutional.  Figueroa cites several cases for the\r\nproposition that the exigent circumstances that may justify the\r\nseizure of a closed package do not justify the opening of the\r\nclosed package which may have been properly seized.  See United\r\nStates v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 114 (1984) (\"Even when\r\ngovernment agents may lawfully seize . . . a package to prevent\r\nloss or destruction of suspected contraband, the Fourth Amendment\r\nrequires that they obtain a warrant before examining the contents\r\nof such a package.\"); United States v. Doe, 61 F.3d 107, 111 (1st\r\nCir. 1995) (\"Although probable cause, as well as exigent\r\ncircumstances, may support the warrantless seizure of an enclosed\r\nopaque container, . . . the same probable-cause showing is not\r\nnecessarily sufficient to justify its subsequent warrantless\r\nsearch.\"); United States v. Garay, 477 F.2d 1306, 1308 (5th Cir.\r\n1973) (\"While the exigencies of the situation may well have\r\njustified the warrantless detention of [the defendants], they\r\ncannot validate the search of the suitcases made at the time when\r\n[the defendants] were under restraint . . . .  At that point,\r\n[the defendants] were incapable of concealing or destroying the\r\nsuitcases or their contents.\").  The government argues that the\r\npolice officers were justified in searching the closed container\r\nfor at least four reasons.  First, the government argues that the\r\npolice officers were justified by the continued exigent\r\ncircumstances.  Second, the government claims that the box\r\npreviously held by Figueroa was abandoned in the second-floor\r\napartment, and he therefore had no standing to challenge the\r\nsearch.  Third, the government argues that the search and seizure\r\nof the box was incident to Figueroa's arrest.  The government's\r\nfinal argument is that the box was still covered by the search\r\nwarrant for the first floor from which the box had just been\r\ntaken.\r\nIn our view, the wisdom of the district court's reliance on the\r\n\"exigent circumstances\" exception to the warrant requirement is\r\nsomewhat debatable, given the fact that Figueroa had been\r\ndetained, and the exigency of the situation arguably had ceased,\r\nprior to the opening of the box.  Indeed, counsel for the\r\ngovernment stated that its argument based on the \"exigency of the\r\ncircumstances\" was probably its weakest.  We do not, however,\r\nbase our opinion on the propriety of the district court's\r\nconclusion in that regard.  Rather, after a careful review of the\r\nrecord, we find that this case falls squarely into the\r\n\"abandonment\" line of cases.\r\nIt is well settled that if a defendant abandons property while he\r\nis being pursued by police officers, he forfeits any reasonable\r\nexpectation of privacy he may have had in that property.  SeeAbel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 241 (1960) (holding that it\r\nis lawful for the government to seize property that has been\r\nabandoned by the defendant); United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d\r\n1325, 1334 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding that defendant had\r\n\"abandoned\" a rock of cocaine that was tossed from his person\r\nduring pursuit, and that the seizure of such property was\r\nlawful); United States v. Wilson, 36 F.3d 205, 209 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (holding that \"because defendant could have had no\r\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the packet dropped and left\r\nbehind in a public street, [the] inspection of it was not a\r\nsearch\"); United States v. Sealey, 30 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(reasoning that dropping the contraband during pursuit of the\r\ndefendant constituted abandonment of that contraband).  \"[T]he\r\nact of abandonment extinguishe[s] [a defendant's] Fourth\r\nAmendment claim.\"  Sealey, 30 F.3d at 10.  Determining whether\r\ncertain property has been \"abandoned\" involves an objective test\r\n\"under which intent may be inferred from words spoken, acts done,\r\nand other objective facts.\"  United States v. Wider, 951 F.2d\r\n1283, 1285 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nIn this case, the evidence showed that Figueroa saw the police\r\napproaching his apartment, and that he tried to flee from the\r\nscene, carrying with him the box in question.  During the\r\nofficers' pursuit, he attempted to stash the box in his\r\nneighbors' apartment.  There is no evidence to suggest that he\r\nintended to retrieve the box at a later time, or that he obtained\r\nthe owners' permission to leave the box with them for\r\nsafekeeping.  Therefore, when Figueroa left the box in that\r\napartment, he abandoned it and all expectations of privacy\r\ntherein.\r\nFigueroa argues that the facts of this case are distinguishable\r\nfrom those in the \"abandonment\" line of cases cited above,\r\nbecause he discarded his box in a private residence rather than\r\nin a public place.  Therefore, he should not be deemed to have\r\nforfeited his privacy interest in the box.  Furthermore, he\r\nargues, he should not be deemed to have \"abandoned\" the box,\r\nbecause the objective evidence shows that he intended to retrieve\r\nthe box at a later time, perhaps when the officers had completed\r\ntheir business at the apartment.  According to Figueroa, this\r\ncase is more akin to the situation in a recent case decided by\r\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, United States v. Fultz, No.\r\n97-30337, 1998 WL 334146 (9th Cir. June 24, 1998).  \r\nIn Fultz, the defendant lived \"on and off\" with his friend,\r\nTiffany Kassedyne, and he stored many of his belongings in closed\r\nboxes in Kassedyne's garage.  Law officers went to Kassedyne's\r\nhouse to investigate a store burglary, and Kassedyne gave them\r\nwritten permission to search the premises.  She directed the\r\nofficers to the specific area in the garage where the defendant\r\nstored his belongings.  Without Kassedyne's specific consent to\r\nsearch Fultz's belongings, the officers opened the boxes and\r\nfound the contraband involved in the case.  In a split decision,\r\nthe Ninth Circuit found that the search of the boxes violated the\r\nFourth Amendment.  Id. at *3.  Initially, the court determined\r\nthat Fultz had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his\r\nbelongings, even though those belongings were kept in a place\r\nthat was not exclusively controlled by him.  Id. at *2.  The\r\ncourt then found that Kassedyne had no actual or apparent\r\nauthority to consent to the search of the defendant's belongings. \r\nId. at *2-*3.  Among other things, the court cited to Justice\r\nO'Connor's concurring opinion in United States v. Karo, 468 U.S.\r\n705 (1984), for the proposition that a homeowner lacks the power\r\nto give consent to search the closed container of a guest in that\r\nhome.\r\nThe reasoning in Fultz does not persuade, because those facts are\r\nclearly distinguishable from those of the instant case.  Figueroa\r\nwas not a \"guest\" of his neighbors at the time he entered the\r\napartment to flee from the officers.  Furthermore, there was no\r\nevidence that Figueroa had previously obtained the permission of\r\nhis neighbors to keep the box in their apartment, nor was there\r\nevidence that he intended to retrieve the box at a later time. \r\nWe are mindful that the instant case is slightly different from\r\nthe \"abandonment\" cases cited above, in that the contraband here\r\nwas discarded in a private residence rather than in a public\r\nplace.  That distinction, however, makes no difference under\r\nthese circumstances.  Figueroa simply stashed the box in the\r\nnearest available place in hopes that it would not be discovered\r\nby the officers who were in pursuit of him.  The legal result\r\nwould be the same if Figueroa had put the box in the stairwell\r\nduring the chase.  When he left the box in the second-floor\r\napartment, a place in which he concededly had no expectations of\r\nprivacy, Figueroa relinquished any expectation of privacy he may\r\nhave otherwise had in the box.  See United States v. Morgan, 936\r\nF.2d 1561, 1570-71 (10th Cir. 1991) (holding that defendant had\r\n\"abandoned [a] gym bag and any privacy interests he had in it\"\r\nwhen he tossed it into an acquaintance's yard while fleeing\r\npolice, since the item was not \"left to the care or\r\nresponsibility of another\" and since there was no \"delayed\r\nindication of an intent to retain an expectation of privacy in\r\nthe item\"); United States v. Hershenow, 680 F.2d 847, 855-56 (1st\r\nCir. 1982) (holding that a defendant who left a container in the\r\nbarn of a nursing home where he was employed lost his reasonable\r\nexpectation of privacy in the container because, inter alia, he\r\n\"did not have regular access to the barn . . . and, most\r\nimportant, . . . had no right of control over the locus of the\r\nbox\").\r\nUnder these circumstances, we conclude that Figueroa's Fourth\r\nAmendment rights were not violated by the search of the box in\r\nquestion based on the fact that he \"abandoned\" the box during the\r\nofficer's pursuit.  Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the\r\ndistrict court.\r\n\n                                 Concurrence Follows     WELLFORD, Senior Circuit Judge (Concurring).  I agree with the\r\nreasoning set forth in the main opinion in this case.  I write\r\nseparately, however, to add that I would have also upheld the\r\ndistrict court's decision to admit the evidence found in the\r\nopaque box because, in my view, the box and its contents were\r\ncovered by the valid search warrant issued in this case.  The\r\nsearch warrant covered the entire first floor at 40 Whittier\r\nAvenue.  I would hold that the box, though it was taken out of\r\nthe apartment immediately after the police arrived, should have\r\nbeen deemed to have been within the scope of the search warrant\r\n                         under these circumstances.  \n",

On September 6, 1996,\r\nthe court sentenced Figueroa to 123 months imprisonment. \r\nFigueroa now appeals, claiming that the district court erred in\r\ndenying his motion to suppress.\r\nPursuant to Ornelas v.

Figueroa cites several cases for the\r\nproposition that the exigent circumstances that may justify the\r\nseizure of a closed package do not justify the opening of the\r\nclosed package which may have been properly seized.

At that point,\r\n[the defendants] were incapable of concealing or destroying the\r\nsuitcases or their contents.\").  The government argues that the\r\npolice officers were justified in searching the closed container\r\nfor at least four reasons.  First, the government argues that the\r\npolice officers were justified by the continued exigent\r\ncircumstances.  Second, the government claims that the box\r\npreviously held by Figueroa was abandoned in the second-floor\r\napartment, and he therefore had no standing to challenge the\r\nsearch.  Third, the government argues that the search and seizure\r\nof the box was incident to Figueroa's arrest.  The government's\r\nfinal argument is that the box was still covered by the search\r\nwarrant for the first floor from which the box had just been\r\ntaken.\r\nIn our view, the wisdom of the district court's reliance on the\r\n\"exigent circumstances\" exception to the warrant requirement is\r\nsomewhat debatable, given the fact that Figueroa had been\r\ndetained, and the exigency of the situation arguably had ceased,\r\nprior to the opening of the box.  Indeed, counsel for the\r\ngovernment stated that its argument based on the \"exigency of the\r\ncircumstances\" was probably its weakest.  We do not, however,\r\nbase our opinion on the propriety of the district court's\r\nconclusion in that regard.  Rather, after a careful review of the\r\nrecord, we find that this case falls squarely into the\r\n\"abandonment\" line of cases.\r\nIt is well settled that if a defendant abandons property while he\r\nis being pursued by police officers, he forfeits any reasonable\r\nexpectation of privacy he may have had in that property.

Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nIn this case, the evidence showed that Figueroa saw the police\r\napproaching his apartment, and that he tried to flee from the\r\nscene, carrying with him the box in question.  During the\r\nofficers' pursuit, he attempted to stash the box in his\r\nneighbors' apartment.  There is no evidence to suggest that he\r\nintended to retrieve the box at a later time, or that he obtained\r\nthe owners' permission to leave the box with them for\r\nsafekeeping.  Therefore, when Figueroa left the box in that\r\napartment, he abandoned it and all expectations of privacy\r\ntherein.\r\nFigueroa argues that the facts of this case are distinguishable\r\nfrom those in the \"abandonment\" line of cases cited above,\r\nbecause he discarded his box in a private residence rather than\r\nin a public place.  Therefore, he should not be deemed to have\r\nforfeited his privacy interest in the box.  Furthermore, he\r\nargues, he should not be deemed to have \"abandoned\" the box,\r\nbecause the objective evidence shows that he intended to retrieve\r\nthe box at a later time, perhaps when the officers had completed\r\ntheir business at the apartment.  According to Figueroa, this\r\ncase is more akin to the situation in a recent case decided by\r\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, United States v. Fultz, No.\r\n97-30337, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">334146</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. June 24, 1998).  \r\nIn Fultz, the defendant lived \"on and off\" with his friend,\r\nTiffany Kassedyne, and he stored many of his belongings in closed\r\nboxes in Kassedyne's garage.  Law officers went to Kassedyne's\r\nhouse to investigate a store burglary, and Kassedyne gave them\r\nwritten permission to search the premises.  She directed the\r\nofficers to the specific area in the garage where the defendant\r\nstored his belongings.  Without Kassedyne's specific consent to\r\nsearch Fultz's belongings, the officers opened the boxes and\r\nfound the contraband involved in the case.  In a split decision,\r\nthe Ninth Circuit found that the search of the boxes violated the\r\nFourth Amendment.  Id. at *3.  Initially, the court determined\r\nthat Fultz had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his\r\nbelongings, even though those belongings were kept in a place\r\nthat was not exclusively controlled by him.  Id. at *2.  The\r\ncourt then found that Kassedyne had no actual or apparent\r\nauthority to consent to the search of the defendant's belongings. \r\nId. at *2-*3.  Among other things, the court cited to Justice\r\nO'Connor's concurring opinion in United States v. Karo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111257\"><a href=\"/opinion/111257/united-states-v-karo/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), for the proposition that a homeowner lacks the power\r\nto give consent to search the closed container of a guest in that\r\nhome.\r\nThe reasoning in Fultz does not persuade, because those facts are\r\nclearly distinguishable from those of the instant case.  Figueroa\r\nwas not a \"guest\" of his neighbors at the time he entered the\r\napartment to flee from the officers.  Furthermore, there was no\r\nevidence that Figueroa had previously obtained the permission of\r\nhis neighbors to keep the box in their apartment, nor was there\r\nevidence that he intended to retrieve the box at a later time. \r\nWe are mindful that the instant case is slightly different from\r\nthe \"abandonment\" cases cited above, in that the contraband here\r\nwas discarded in a private residence rather than in a public\r\nplace.  That distinction, however, makes no difference under\r\nthese circumstances.  Figueroa simply stashed the box in the\r\nnearest available place in hopes that it would not be discovered\r\nby the officers who were in pursuit of him.  The legal result\r\nwould be the same if Figueroa had put the box in the stairwell\r\nduring the chase.  When he left the box in the second-floor\r\napartment, a place in which he concededly had no expectations of\r\nprivacy, Figueroa relinquished any expectation of privacy he may\r\nhave otherwise had in the box.  See United States v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563786\"><a href=\"/opinion/563786/united-states-v-rodney-lee-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1570-71 (10th Cir. 1991) (holding that defendant had\r\n\"abandoned [a] gym bag and any privacy interests he had in it\"\r\nwhen he tossed it into an acquaintance's yard while fleeing\r\npolice, since the item was not \"left to the care or\r\nresponsibility of another\" and since there was no \"delayed\r\nindication of an intent to retain an expectation of privacy in\r\nthe item\"); United States v. Hershenow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405158\"><a href=\"/opinion/405158/united-states-v-steven-v-hershenow-stuart-m-rosenthal-steven-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855-56 (1st\r\nCir. 1982) (holding that a defendant who left a container in the\r\nbarn of a nursing home where he was employed lost his reasonable\r\nexpectation of privacy in the container because, inter alia, he\r\n\"did not have regular access to the barn . . . and, most\r\nimportant, . . . had no right of control over the locus of the\r\nbox\").\r\nUnder these circumstances, we conclude that Figueroa's Fourth\r\nAmendment rights were not violated by the search of the box in\r\nquestion based on the fact that he \"abandoned\" the box during the\r\nofficer's pursuit.  Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the\r\ndistrict court.\r\n\n                                 Concurrence Follows     WELLFORD, Senior Circuit Judge (Concurring).  I agree with the\r\nreasoning set forth in the main opinion in this case.  I write\r\nseparately, however, to add that I would have also upheld the\r\ndistrict court's decision to admit the evidence found in the\r\nopaque box because, in my view, the box and its contents were\r\ncovered by the valid search warrant issued in this case.  The\r\nsearch warrant covered the entire first floor at 40 Whittier\r\nAvenue.  I would hold that the box, though it was taken out of\r\nthe apartment immediately after the police arrived, should have\r\nbeen deemed to have been within the scope of the search warrant\r\n                         under these circumstances.  \n</pre>",
