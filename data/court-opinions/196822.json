Defendant Robert A.\r                                                   \r\n\nDiIanni found himself in serious trouble with the Securities\r\n\nand Exchange Commission; was indicted, and ultimately pleaded\r\n\nguilty to three counts of mail fraud, three counts of wire\r\n\nfraud, one count of interstate transportation of property\r\n\ntaken by fraud and one count of securities fraud.  He\r\n\nreceived two consecutive sentences of 42 and 60 months,\r\n\nexecution of the latter suspended with three years supervised\r\n\nrelease.  A special condition of his probation required\r\n\ncompliance with a permanent injunction entered in an SEC-\r\n\ninitiated civil case that arose out of some of the same\r\n\nfraudulent activities.  This forbade defendant from, inter\r                                                                      \r\n\nalia, engaging in any conduct \"in connection with the\r                \r\n\npurchase or sale of any security,\" that would violate Rule\r\n\n10b-5,1 under the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The Rule provides, in relevant part:\r\n\n               It shall be unlawful for any person,\r\n          directly or indirectly, by the use of\r\n          . . . any facility of any national\r\n          securities exchange,\r\n\n               (a) To employ any device, scheme, or\r\n          artifice to defraud,\r\n\n               (b) To make any untrue statement of\r\n          a material fact or to omit to state a\r\n          material fact necessary in order to make\r\n          the statements made, in the light of the\r\n          circumstances under which they were made,\r\n          not misleading, or\r\n\n               (c) To engage in any act, practice\r\n          or course of business which operates or\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n  78j(b).  In May, 1992, defendant was released from prison\r\n\nand, in due course, engaged in conduct which led the\r\n\ngovernment to successfully charge him with having breached\r\n\nthis special condition by impersonating his stepson in\r\n\nsecurities dealings with the brokerage firm National\r\n\nFinancial Services Corporation (\"NFSC\"), as well as a general\r\n\ncondition that he refrain from lying to his probation\r\n\nofficer.  The court revoked probation and sentenced defendant\r\n\nto two years imprisonment.  He appeals.  We affirm.\r\n\n          To revoke probation the sentencing court must make\r\n\nboth a retrospective determination that the probationer has\r\n\nviolated a condition of his probation, and a discretionary,\r\n\nprospective determination that any violation(s) warrants\r\n\nrevocation.  Black v. Romano, 471 U.S. 606, 611 (1985)\r                                        \r\n\n(revocation must meet due process requirements); United\r                                                                   \r\n\nStates v. Gallo, 20 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 1994).  The\r                           \r\n\ngovernment need not prove a violation beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt, but must merely satisfy the court that a violation\r\n\noccurred.  Id. at 14.  The second step requires\r                          \r\n\nindividualized evaluation of the particular probationer and\r\n\n\"a predictive decision, based in part on [an] assessment of\r\n\n[his] propensity toward antisocial conduct.\"  Id.  We review\r                                                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          would operate as a fraud or deceit upon\r\n          any person, in connection with the\r\n          purchase or sale of any security.\r\n\n17 C.F.R.   240.10b-5.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthe court's decision for abuse of discretion.  Id. at 13;\r                                                              \r\n\nUnited States v. Nolan, 932 F.2d 1005, 1006 (1st Cir. 1991)\r                                  \r\n\n(court's revocation determination \"will not be disturbed\r\n\nabsent a showing of manifest abuse\").\r\n\n          Condition Four of defendant's probation requires\r\n\nthat he \"answer truthfully all inquiries by the probation\r\n\nofficer . . . .\"  Defendant does not dispute that he falsely\r\n\ndenied to his probation officer that he was \"in any way\r\n\ninvolved\" in managing or trading the securities appearing on\r\n\na brokerage account statement that the officer happened to\r\n\nnotice during an unannounced visit to defendant's home.  He\r\n\nsimply contends his prevarication is immaterial because,\r\n\ncontrary to what the probation officer apparently believed,\r\n\nthe conditions of his probation do not forbid him from\r\n\ntrading in securities.  Condition Four is not limited to\r\n\ninquiries that relate to other conditions of defendant's\r\n\nprobation, however, and cannot be read to leave defendant\r\n\nfree to pick and choose which inquiries deserve a truthful\r\n\nanswer.\r\n\n          The court also found defendant had willfully\r\n\nconcealed his identity -- and therefore his status as felon\r\n\nconvicted for fraud in connection with securities\r\n\ntransactions -- as the person controlling certain brokerage\r\n\naccounts with NFSC, and the limited partnerships ostensibly\r\n\nbehind them, and that this amounted to a violation of\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ndefendant's special condition of probation.  The record\r\n\ndiscloses that defendant incorporated a consulting outfit in\r\n\nhis wife's name, set up two limited partnerships naming his\r\n\nstepson, Mark Pinguey, as general partner, and opened a\r\n\nmargin account with NFSC for each partnership, signing\r\n\nPinguey's name.  He then deposited 600,000 shares of a\r\n\nmarginable stock borrowed through the consulting firm to one\r\n\nof the accounts, enabling him to obtain a $2.5 million credit\r\n\nfrom NFSC to purchase more stock.  During all ensuing\r\n\ntransactions and other dealings with NFSC, defendant held\r\n\nhimself out as Pinguey.  Even when defendant, posing as\r\n\nPinguey, was asked by an NFSC representative whether \"a Mr.\r\n\nDiIanni\" was impersonating Pinguey, defendant kept up the\r\n\nruse.  The record supports the court's finding that defendant\r\n\ndeliberately made untrue statements in identifying and\r\n\nrepresenting himself as Pinguey in his dealings with NFSC,\r\n\nand -- contrary to his story that he was acting under\r\n\nPinguey's \"authorization\" -- did so systematically with the\r\n\nintent to conceal the fact that he, not Pinguey, controlled\r\n\nthe transactions that NFSC processed through the accounts.\r\n\n          In order for defendant's untruths and omissions to\r\n\ncome within the prohibitions of the civil injunction,\r\n\nhowever, they had to have been of \"material fact\" within the\r\n\nmeaning of Rule 10b-5.  17 C.F.R.   240.10b-5(b).  See Basic\r                                                                        \r\n\nInc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231 (1988).  The true\r                            \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nidentity of an investor is not always material, see United\r                                                                      \r\n\nStates v. Bingham, 992 F.2d 975 (9th Cir. 1993), but where\r                             \r\n\nthere is a \"substantial likelihood\" that a reasonable\r\n\ndecision-maker would have viewed the omitted fact \"as having\r\n\nsignificantly altered the total mix of information made\r\n\navailable,\" the Rule's materiality requirement is fulfilled. \r\n\nBasic Inc., 485 U.S. at 231-32 (internal quotations omitted). \r                      \r\n\nThe record indicates that in his heyday defendant was a\r\n\nsuccessful, high-profile investment advisor, well-known in\r\n\nthe financial world.  His indictment and convictions were\r\n\nwell documented in the local press, which detailed the\r\n\nmillions he bilked from his victims, as well as the fast and\r\n\nloose financial dealings that had prompted SEC sanctions\r\n\nyears earlier.  A 1990 feature on the cover of the Boston\r\n\nGlobe's business pages dubbed him \"one of Boston's most\r\n\nnotorious investment advisors of the 1980s,\" and reported his\r\n\npost-incarceration plans to jump back into the financial fray\r\n\nupon release from prison.  Had defendant signed his own name\r\n\nto the margin account agreements in December of 1992, rather\r\n\nthan Pinguey's, there is a substantial likelihood that it\r\n\nwould have rung someone's bell at NFSC, and the means of\r\n\nuncovering the details of defendant's past were readily\r\n\navailable.  We have no doubt this information would have\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nsignificantly transformed the picture.2  We also think it\r\n\nreasonable to conclude that an intent to preclude NFSC from\r\n\nobtaining this information was in large measure the reason\r\n\ndefendant employed Pinguey as his puppet.  Defendant's\r\n\nbehavior was manifestly outside the bounds of Rule 10b-5.3\r\n\n          Given the relationship between defendant's\r\n\nprobation infractions and his past criminal conduct, it was\r\n\nnot unreasonable for the court to conclude that defendant's\r\n\npost-release activities suggested he was positioning himself\r\n\nincognito to get right back into his old heists.  The court\r\n\nfound his new offenses \"in many ways a kind of shadow of the\r\n\noffenses that led initially to Mr. DiIanni's incarceration\r\n\n. . . .  Moreover, they come after considerable experience\r\n\nhere with violations of the federal securities law, a SEC\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.    The court credited testimony that NFSC would not have\r\nentered into any margin account agreements with a convicted\r\nfelon.  It is of no moment that NFSC did not perform a credit\r\ncheck on Pinguey, which of course would not have revealed\r\nanything about defendant.  Defendant's assertion in his\r\nappellate brief that NFSC was not checking any accounts at\r\nthe time is unsupported and in any event does not alter the\r\nfact that, under defendant's particular circumstance, his\r\nidentity alone would have been material to NFSC's decision\r\nwhether to open the margin accounts. Compare Bingham, 992\r                                                                \r\nF.2d at 976 (no evidence was introduced to show investors\r\nwould have found the misrepresented or omitted information\r\nsignificant).\r\n\n3.  The civil injunction requires defendant to conform his\r\nbehavior to the provisions of Rule 10b-5.  Proof of material\r\nreliance, although necessary to state a private cause of\r\naction for damages under Rule 10b-5, see Estate of Soler v.\r                                                                    \r\nRodriguez, 63 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir. 1995), is not required to\r                     \r\ndemonstrate violation of the terms of the injunction, and\r\ntherefore also of defendant's special condition of probation.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\ninjunction, a criminal prosecution . . . .  And so, what I\r\n\nhave before me is a recidivist who -- offered any opportunity\r\n\n-- will undertake to engage in conduct that is proscribed by\r\n\nthe federal securities laws.\"  The court reasonably found\r\n\ndefendant's efforts to explain away his behavior not\r\n\ncredible, and his propensity for \"anti-social\" conduct\r\n\nsubstantial.\r\n\n          Finally, defendant contends that a two year\r\n\nsentence is too harsh.  It was well within the court's\r\n\nauthority to impose and, for the reasons amplified above, we\r\n\nfind no abuse of discretion.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n",

A special condition of his probation required compliance with a permanent injunction entered in an SEC-initiated civil case that arose out of some of the same fraudulent activities.

Basic Inc., 485 U.S. at 231-32, 108 S.Ct. at 983 (internal quotations omitted).   The record indicates that in his heyday defendant was a successful, high-profile investment advisor, well-known in the financial world.

DiIanni found himself in serious trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission;  was indicted, and ultimately pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud, three counts of wire fraud, one count of interstate transportation of property taken by fraud and one count of securities fraud.   He received two consecutive sentences of 42 and 60 months, execution of the latter suspended with three years supervised release.   A special condition of his probation required compliance with a permanent injunction entered in an SEC-initiated civil case that arose out of some of the same fraudulent activities.   This forbade defendant from, inter alia, engaging in any conduct \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,\" that would violate Rule 10b-5,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> under the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b).   In May, 1992, defendant was released from prison and, in due course, engaged in conduct which led the government to successfully charge him with having breached this special condition by impersonating his stepson in securities dealings with the brokerage firm National Financial Services Corporation (\"NFSC\"), as well as a general condition that he refrain from lying to his probation officer.   The court revoked probation and sentenced defendant to two years imprisonment.   He appeals.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To revoke probation the sentencing court must make both a retrospective determination that the probationer has violated a condition of his probation, and a discretionary, prospective determination that any violation(s) warrants revocation.

The government need not prove a violation beyond a reasonable doubt, but must merely satisfy the court that a violation occurred.  Id. at 14.   The second step requires individualized evaluation of the particular probationer and \"a predictive decision, based in part on [an] assessment of [his] propensity toward antisocial conduct.\"  Id.

He simply contends his prevarication is immaterial because, contrary to what the probation officer apparently believed, the conditions of his probation do not forbid him from trading in securities.   Condition Four is not limited to inquiries that relate to other conditions of defendant's probation, however, and cannot be read to leave defendant free to pick and choose which inquiries deserve a truthful answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found defendant had willfully concealed his identity--and therefore his status as felon convicted for fraud in connection with securities transactions--as the person controlling certain brokerage accounts with NFSC, and the limited partnerships ostensibly behind them, and that this amounted to a violation of defendant's special condition of probation.   The record discloses that defendant incorporated a consulting outfit in his wife's name, set up two limited partnerships naming his stepson, Mark Pinguey, as general partner, and opened a margin account with NFSC for each partnership, signing Pinguey's name.   He then deposited 600,000 shares of a marginable stock borrowed through the consulting firm to one of the accounts, enabling him to obtain a $2.5 million credit from NFSC to purchase more stock.   During all ensuing transactions and other dealings with NFSC, defendant held himself out as Pinguey.   Even when defendant, posing as Pinguey, was asked by an NFSC representative whether \"a Mr. DiIanni\" was impersonating Pinguey, defendant kept up the ruse.   The record supports the court's finding that defendant deliberately made untrue statements in identifying and representing himself as Pinguey in his dealings with NFSC, and--contrary to his story that he was acting under Pinguey's \"authorization\"--did so systematically with the intent to conceal the fact that he, not Pinguey, controlled the transactions that NFSC processed through the accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for defendant's untruths and omissions to come within the prohibitions of the civil injunction, however, they had to have been of \"material fact\" within the meaning of Rule 10b-5.  17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5(b).
