After  a four day jury trial,  both defendants\r\n\nwere  found  guilty  on  all  counts  and  now  appeal  their\r\n\nconvictions  and   sentences.    We  affirm,   with  a  minor\r\n\nexception.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          In 1989, James offered to purchase 80 acres of land\r\n\nin  Coventry, Rhode  Island, from  George  Dupont (\"Dupont\").\r\n\nThe  agreed upon  price  was $120,000,  financing to  include\r\n\nDupont  holding  a  mortgage  of $60,000.    James  signed  a\r\n\nPurchase and Sale agreement and gave Dupont a  $2,000 deposit\r\n\ncheck, but  it required additional financing  to complete the\r\n\nsale.\r\n\n          In April  of 1990, James  met with officers  of the\r\n\nCoventry Credit Union (\"CCU\").   During this meeting  he told\r\n\nthe  officers that  the purchase  price  of the  property was\r\n\n$205,000 and that he  was seeking to finance $160,000.   They\r\n\ninformed him that due  to his prior bankruptcy, no  such loan\r\n\ncould  be granted.  James  then suggested that  his son Scott\r\n\npurchase  the property and take  the loan.   The CCU officers\r\n\nagreed  to consider  the  request, but  cautioned that  Scott\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nwould likely require a  co-signer due to his youth  and short\r\n\ncredit history.\r\n\n          In  May  of  1990,  James and  Dupont  attended  an\r\n\ninformal \"closing\" in the back seat of the car of  Leo Dailey\r\n\n(\"Dailey\"), an  attorney whose  firm had represented  CCU for\r\n\nover  twenty years.  Dupont signed  two closing statements --\r\n\none reflecting the  actual purchase price of $120,000 and the\r\n\nother blank.  Dailey  told Dupont he needed the blank form to\r\n\nmake  a correction to  a tax computation.   At the same time,\r\n\nDupont  endorsed a  deed  conveying the  property to  Scott's\r\n\nconstruction  company.   No  money  or financial  instruments\r\n\nchanged hands  at this  time.   After two  abortive attempts,\r\n\nJames found  a co-signer  and  CCU approved  a $160,000  loan\r\n\nbased  on the  inflated purchase  price of  $205,000.   CCU's\r\n\nappraisal of the fair market value of the property came in at\r\n\n$225,000.\r\n\n          The \"formal\" closing was held on June  15.  Present\r\n\nwere James,  Scott, Scott's co-signer, a CCU loan officer and\r\n\nDailey who was  acting as CCU's  attorney.  Dailey  explained\r\n\nthat  Dupont was  unavailable and  produced the  signed blank\r\n\nclosing  form.   He  then filled  in  the purchase  price  as\r\n\n$205,000.   After  Scott signed,  the loan  officer disbursed\r\n\n$160,000  to Dailey  who  then paid  the  closing costs,  the\r\n\nexisting  $58,740  mortgage  on  the property  and  gave  the\r\n\nremaining  approximately $95,000  to Scott  who in  turn paid\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nDailey  $5,000 for  his  work.   A  short time  later  Dupont\r\n\nreceived Scott's  signed promissory note and  mortgage in the\r\n\namount of $60,000 in the mail.   Dupont was not informed that\r\n\nCCU held a $160,000 first mortgage on the property.\r\n\n          Within  six months  of  the sale,  Scott filed  for\r\n\nbankruptcy.     As  part  of  bankruptcy   proceedings,  both\r\n\ndefendants,  represented by Dailey, gave deposition testimony\r\n\nthat  they had  given CCU  an inflated  price for  the Dupont\r\n\nproperty.   At approximately the same time, Dailey's law firm\r\n\nmailed Dupont a tax form indicating  that Dupont had received\r\n\n$205,000 from  Scott  for  the  property.    In  response  to\r\n\nDupont's  complaints, he  was provided  with a  corrected tax\r\n\nform but,  along with it, he  received a copy  of the closing\r\n\nstatement stating the purchase price as $205,000.\r\n\n          Also  about this  time,  the loan  to Scott  became\r\n\ndelinquent and CCU discovered  that the actual purchase price\r\n\nof the  property  was $120,000  instead of  $205,000 and  the\r\n\nexistence of two different  closing statements.  Dailey's law\r\n\nfirm,  wanting  to keep  CCU as  a  client, arranged  for its\r\n\npension fund to pay CCU $160,000 and take over the mortgage.\r\n\n          In  October  1993,  James, Scott  and  Dailey  were\r\n\nindicted on  charges of bank fraud, mail  fraud, making false\r\n\nstatements to a federally insured lending institution, aiding\r\n\nand abetting,  and conspiracy  under the Taft-Hartley  Act to\r\n\ncommit  these offenses.  Dailey  died prior to  trial.  James\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nand Scott were found guilty on all counts and sentenced to 37\r\n\nmonths  and 24 months respectively.  Both were also sentenced\r\n\nto identical  terms of supervised release,  joint and several\r\n\nrestitution of $54,000 to Dupont, $200 in special assessments\r\n\nand reimbursement  of all attorney's fees  and expert witness\r\n\nfees paid pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act (\"CJA\").\r\n\n                       II.  Discussion\r                                                  \r\n\n          Defendants   raise   multiple  grounds   on  appeal\r\n\nencompassing  issues   relating  to  indictment,   trial  and\r\n\nsentencing.  For  clarity's sake we  address these issues  in\r\n\nchronological order.\r\n\n          A.   Indictment\r                                     \r\n\n          Defendants  contend that Count II, knowingly making\r\n\nfalse statements to a  federally insured lending institution,\r\n\n18 U.S.C.    1014,  and  Count  III, bank  fraud,  18  U.S.C.\r\n\n  1344,  are multiplicitous,  thereby  violating  the  Double\r\n\nJeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.\r\n\n          Our  analysis begins  with application of  the test\r\n\nlaid  out  in  Blockburger v.  United  States,  284 U.S.  299\r                                                         \r\n\n(1932), which provides that double jeopardy is not implicated\r\n\nif,  when comparing  two  offenses arising  out  of the  same\r\n\ntransaction, each offense  \"requires proof  of an  additional\r\n\nfact which the other does  not.\"  Id. at 304.   This analysis\r                                                 \r\n\nis sometimes referred to as the Blockburger \"elements test.\"\r                                                       \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          In United States v.  Norberg, 612 F.2d 1  (1st Cir.\r                                                  \r\n\n1979), we set forth the elements to be proven under 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1014.  They are:\r\n\n          (1)  that  the  [Institution's]  deposits\r\n          were [federally insured];\r\n\n          (2)   that   the  defendant   made  false\r\n          statements to the [Institution];\r\n\n          (3)   that   the   defendant   knew   the\r\n          statements were false; and\r\n\n          (4) that the  statements were  materially\r\n          false  and   made  for  the   purpose  of\r\n          influencing the [Institution]  to make  a\r\n          loan or advance.\r\n\nId. at  3.  More  recently, in  United States v.  Brandon, 17\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  409 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,      U.S.    , 115 S. Ct.\r                                              \r\n\n80 (1994), we construed  the elements of bank fraud  under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   1344 as:\r\n\n          (1) engag[ing] in a scheme or artifice to\r\n          defraud, or ma[king] false  statements or\r\n          misrepresentations to obtain money from;\r\n\n          (2)   a   federally   insured   financial\r\n          institution; and\r\n\n          (3) d[oing] so knowingly.\r\n\nId. at 424.\r               \r\n\n          Thus, on the plain  language of these statutes, the\r\n\nrequirements  of  Blockburger are  satisfied.   Section  1014\r                                         \r\n\ncontains an element not  contained in   1344, that is,  proof\r\n\nthat  the  statements  were \"materially  false.\"    Likewise,\r\n\n  1344 encompasses  a \"scheme or artifice  to defraud,\" which\r\n\nis not an  element of   1014.   Defendants, nonetheless, urge\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nus to adopt the opinion of a divided Second Circuit in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Seda, 978 F.2d 779 (2d Cir. 1992), which held that\r                           \r\n\n   1014 and  1344, when  arising from  the same  offense, are\r\n\nmultiplicitous.  978 F.2d at 781.  We do not agree.\r\n\n          In   Seda,  the  court   moved  beyond  Blockburger\r                                                                         \r\n\nstatutory  analysis,  relying  instead on  Whalen  v.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 445 U.S. 684 (1980), where the Court held that counts\r                  \r\n\nof rape and felony murder were not  separate offenses because\r\n\nin  that case  \"proof of  rape [was]  a necessary  element of\r\n\nproof  of the  felony murder.\"   445  U.S. at  694.   We read\r\n\nWhalen,  however,  as the  rule only  in  cases of  lesser or\r                  \r\n\ngreater included  offenses, see  United States v.  Dixon, 509\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  688, 698  (1993),  for  which  rape and  felony  murder\r\n\nqualify,  but bank  fraud and  making false  statements to  a\r\n\nfederally  insured lending  institution do  not.   Indeed, in\r\n\nDixon,  the Court overruled the  \"same conduct\" test of Grady\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Rossetti v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCurran, 80 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v.

Because  it is possible  to violate  either\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nstatute without violating the other, we believe the best view\r\n\nis that these two counts are not multiplicitous.\r\n\n          B.   Trial\r                                \r\n\n          First, defendants contend that as regards Count IV,\r\n\nMail Fraud, there was  no evidence that co-conspirator Dailey\r\n\nmailed, or caused to be mailed, the  mortgage to Dupont.  The\r\n\nevidence,  however,  shows  that  when  Dupont  received  the\r\n\nmortgage  in the mail, the return address on the envelope was\r\n\nthat  of  Dailey's law  firm.   In  addition, the  jury heard\r\n\nevidence  that  Dailey  acted  as closing  attorney  in  this\r\n\ntransaction and recorded the mortgage.  From this testimony a\r\n\nreasonable jury  could infer that Dailey  mailed the mortgage\r\n\nto Dupont.\r\n\n          Defendants next maintain that  deposition testimony\r\n\ngiven by each defendant during  Scott's bankruptcy proceeding\r\n\nwas non-admissible  as former  testimony under Fed.

In the\r\n\nfirst place, each  deposition was redacted  to apply only  to\r\n\nthe  deponent.    Against  him  it  was  clearly  admissible;\r\n\nanything affecting  its weight  could be  offered separately.\r\n\nIf the other defendant  was entitled to have it  limited, and\r\n\nnot  apply  to  him, it  was  his  obligation  to request  an\r\n\ninstruction.   United States v.  Barnett, 989  F.2d 546,  558\r                                                    \r\n\nn.14 (1st  Cir. 1993);  United States v.

Neither\r\n\ndid.\r\n\n          Defendants next object to the introduction of their\r\n\ndeposition  testimony by  claiming violations of  their Fifth\r\n\nAmendment  privilege  against  self-incrimination.     It  is\r\n\nelementary that the privilege must be asserted at the time of\r\n\nthe  questioning.  Minnesota v.  Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 429-30\r                                                   \r\n\n(1984).   Defendants  seek  to excuse  themselves by  blaming\r\n\ntheir failure  to assert  on their attorney  Dailey, claiming\r\n\nthat  he failed  to  advise  them  due  to  his  conflict  of\r\n\ninterest.     We   give  present   counsel  high   marks  for\r\n\nimagination, but  nothing else.   The deposition  inquiry was\r\n\nnot  by a government official  and therefore not  an abuse of\r\n\ndefendants'  Fifth   Amendment  rights.    See   Colorado  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nConnelly,  479 U.S. 157, 170 (1986) (\"The sole concern of the\r                    \r\n\nFifth Amendment . . . is  governmental coercion.\").

U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(1) provides a sliding scale requiring\r\nan increase to  the offense  level calculation  based on  the\r\namount  of the loss caused  by or intended  by the defendant.\r\nLosses  greater than $120,000 but less than $200,000 call for\r\na seven level increase.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\ncalculation of a $124,000 loss to  the victims of defendants'\r\n\nfraud.2   They  maintain that  because Dailey's  pension fund\r\n\n\"purchased\" Scott's mortgage from  CCU for the full $160,000,\r\n\nthis figure should not enter into the loss calculation.  This\r\n\nwas  not a  purchase  for  value,  however,  but  a  form  of\r\n\nlaundering.\r\n\n          We   previously  examined  the  mechanics  of  loss\r\n\ncalculation as pertaining to   2F1.1 in some detail in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

(emphasis supplied).\r                                                    \r\n\nBecause CCU  discovered the fraud before  Dailey's law firm's\r\n\npension  fund acquired  the mortgage,  the full  $160,000 was\r\n\ncorrectly included in the loss calculation.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The court calculated the loss as of the time of discovery\r\nof  the fraud as $160,000  for the CCU  mortgage plus $60,000\r\nfor Dupont's  mortgage, less $96,000, the  appraised value of\r\nthe property on that date.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n          Defendants  also  contend that  the court  erred in\r\n\nincluding the $60,000 Dupont mortgage in the loss calculation\r\n\nbecause  the amount  of  the loss  attributed  to Dupont  was\r\n\nspeculative.   We  agree with  the government,  however, that\r\n\nwith  an appraised  value  of only  $96,000  at the  time  of\r\n\ndiscovery  and  a  first  mortgage  to  the  pension fund  of\r\n\n$160,000, Dupont's second mortgage was worthless.\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\n          2.   Obstruction of Justice\r                                                 \r\n\n          Defendants  next   complain   of  the   two   level\r\n\nenhancement each  received for obstruction  of justice  under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    3C1.1.    We  review  factual  determinations  of\r\n\nwhether a defendant obstructed  justice only for clear error.\r\n\nUnited States v.  Thomas, 86  F.3d 263, 263  (1st Cir.  1996)\r                                    \r\n\n(citing United States v.  St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698,  705-06 (1st\r                                             \r\n\nCir.  1992)).    The  record  contains  evidence  of  several\r\n\nindependent   acts  by   the   defendants  supporting   these\r\n\nenhancements, including submitting a false affidavit by James\r\n\n(later admitted to  be untrue), witness  intimidation, albeit\r\n\nafter  the fact,  and  false objections  to the  Pre-Sentence\r\n\nReport.       See   U.S.S.G.     3C1.1,   Application   Notes\r                             \r\n\n3(a),(f),(h).   Faced  with multiple  reasons supporting  the\r\n\nenhancement,  we cannot say that the  2 level enhancement for\r\n\nobstruction of justice was error, clear or otherwise.\r\n\n          3.   Role in the Offense Determinations\r                                                             \r\n\n          James  contests his two level enhancement for being\r\n\na  manager or  organizer  of the  criminal activity,  seeking\r\n\ninstead to award that role to Dailey.  We can dispose of this\r\n\ncontention forthwith.  Reviewing  again only for clear error,\r\n\nUnited States v. Voccola, 99 F.3d  37, 44 (1st Cir. 1996), we\r                                    \r\n\nfind  that  James' admission  in  his  response to  the  Pre-\r\n\nSentencing  Report that  \"to  the extent  that his  son Scott\r\n\nFraza is  involved in this  case, it  is solely due  to James\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nFraza's fault and not Scott Fraza,\" is enough to  allow us to\r\n\nsay again that we discern no error here.\r\n\n          Scott complains  of the court's refusal  to grant a\r\n\ndownward adjustment  for his  minor  role in  the offense,  a\r\n\nposition   which   was   not  opposed   by   the  government.\r\n\nApparently, at  sentencing this  brass ring was  within reach\r\n\nwhen  the Probation  Officer interrupted  the proceeding  and\r\n\nengaged in an ex parte communication with the court some time\r                                  \r\n\nafter which the downward adjustment was denied.  According to\r\n\nScott, \"the Probation Officer discarded his  role as . . . an\r\n\nimpartial  'arm of  the Court'  and donned  the mantle  of an\r\n\nadvocate  for rejection  of the  requested  2-point deduction\r\n\n. . . .\"\r\n\n          Defendant's moral outrage regarding this  issue was\r\n\nevident  at oral  argument, but  we are  perplexed as  to his\r\n\nexpectations of the Probation  Officer's proper behavior.  We\r\n\nwould expect the officer to exercise his independent judgment\r\n\nas to the  application of the guidelines and  we see no error\r\n\nin his interruption of  the proceedings to make  his judgment\r\n\nknown.  See  United States  v. Belgard, 894  F.2d 1092,  1097\r                                                  \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1990) (observing that a probation officer's duty is\r\n\nto  \"provide  the trial  judge  with as  much  information as\r\n\npossible in order  to enable  the judge to  make an  informed\r\n\ndecision\").   Anything less would  be a dereliction  of duty.\r\n\nScott's attempt to condemn  the officer for doing his  job is\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nmisplaced and can not act as a basis for overturning a ruling\r\n\nthat is not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          4.   Reimbursement\r                                        \r\n\n          Included in defendants' sentences was an obligation\r\n\nto repay the cost of their court-appointed attorneys, who had\r\n\nbeen   obtained  on   defendants'  allegation   of  financial\r\n\ninability.  See  18 U.S.C.   3006A(a).   To the  government's\r                           \r\n\nrepeated  allegation  of  misrepresentations  in   their  CJA\r\n\napplication  defendants failed  to  respond.   They did  not,\r\n\nuntil  threatened   with  contempt,  even   respond  to   the\r\n\ngovernment's  extensive financial report, with exhibits.  The\r\n\ncourt's ultimate sentence apparently rejected their replies.\r\n\n          Our  difficulty  is  that the  court  conducted  no\r\n\nhearing,  and  made  no  findings as  to  either  defendant's\r\n\nfinancial  viability.   See United  States v.  Santarpio, 560\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  448, 455 (1st Cir. 1977); cf. United States v. Chorney,\r                                                                        \r\n\n63  F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir. 1995).  We must remand that that be\r\n\ndone.\r\n\n          5.   Restitution\r                                      \r\n\n          Finally, defendants protest the court's  order that\r\n\nthey jointly and  severally pay restitution to  Dupont in the\r\n\namount of  $54,000, citing the second mortgage  still held by\r\n\nDupont.    Restitution  orders  are subject  to  clear  error\r\n\nreview.  United States v. Hensley, 91 F.3d 274, 277 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1996).  As  we noted ante,  Dupont's mortgage is  essentially\r                                     \r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\nworthless.  If circumstances  were to change, i.e,  the first\r\n\nmortgage to disappear or land values increase to the point of\r\n\nvalidating  Dupont's mortgage,  defendants  would be  free to\r\n\napply for relief from the restitution order.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          The convictions  and sentences are affirmed  in all\r                                                                 \r\n\nrespects, except  that the reimbursement orders  are vacated.\r\n\nThe cases are remanded for further proceedings  on the matter\r\n\nof reimbursement in accordance herewith.\r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n",

After a four day jury trial, both defendants were found guilty on all counts and now appeal their convictions and sentences.  We affirm, with a minor exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, James offered to purchase 80 acres of land in Coventry, Rhode Island, from George Dupont (\"Dupont\").  The agreed upon price was $120,000, financing to include Dupont holding a mortgage of $60,000.  James signed a Purchase and Sale agreement and gave Dupont a $2,000 deposit check, but it required additional financing to complete the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1990, James met with officers of the Coventry Credit Union (\"CCU\").  During this meeting he told the officers that the purchase price of the property was $205,000 and that he was seeking to finance $160,000.  They informed him that due to his prior bankruptcy, no such loan could be granted.  James then suggested that his son Scott purchase the property and take the loan.  The CCU officers agreed to consider the request, but cautioned that Scott would likely require a co-signer due to his youth and short credit history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May of 1990, James and Dupont attended an informal \"closing\" in the back seat of the car of Leo Dailey (\"Dailey\"), an attorney whose firm had represented CCU for over twenty years.  Dupont signed two closing statements--one reflecting the actual purchase price of $120,000 and the other blank.  Dailey told Dupont he needed the blank form to make a correction to a tax computation.  At the same time, Dupont endorsed a deed conveying the property to Scott's construction company.  No money or financial instruments changed hands at this time.  After two abortive attempts, James found a cosigner and CCU approved a $160,000 loan based on the inflated purchase price of $205,000.  CCU's appraisal of the fair market value of the property came in at $225,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"formal\" closing was held on June 15.  Present were James, Scott, Scott's co-signer, a CCU loan officer and Dailey who was acting as CCU's attorney.  Dailey explained that Dupont was unavailable and produced the signed blank closing form.  He then filled in the purchase price as $205,000.  After Scott signed, the loan officer disbursed $160,000 to Dailey who then paid the closing costs, the existing $58,740 mortgage on the property and gave the remaining approximately $95,000 to Scott who in turn paid Dailey $5,000 for his work.  A short time later Dupont received Scott's signed promissory note and mortgage in the amount of $60,000 in the mail.  Dupont was not informed that CCU held a $160,000 first mortgage on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within six months of the sale, Scott filed for bankruptcy.  As part of bankruptcy proceedings, both defendants, represented by Dailey, gave deposition testimony that they had given CCU an inflated price for the Dupont property.  At approximately the same time, Dailey's law firm mailed Dupont a tax form indicating that Dupont had received $205,000 from Scott for the property.  In response to Dupont's complaints, he was provided with a corrected tax form but, along with it, he received a copy of the closing statement stating the purchase price as $205,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also about this time, the loan to Scott became delinquent and CCU discovered that the actual purchase price of the property was $120,000 instead of $205,000 and the existence of two different closing statements.  Dailey's law firm, wanting to keep CCU as a client, arranged for its pension fund to pay CCU $160,000 and take over the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, James, Scott and Dailey were indicted on charges of bank fraud, mail fraud, making false statements to a federally insured lending institution, aiding and abetting, and conspiracy under the Taft-Hartley Act to commit these offenses.  Dailey died prior to trial.  James and Scott were found guilty on all counts and sentenced to 37 months and 24 months respectively.  Both were also sentenced to identical terms of supervised release, joint and several restitution of $54,000 to Dupont, $200 in special assessments and reimbursement of all attorney's fees and expert witness fees paid pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act (\"CJA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

They are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>(1) that the [Institution's] deposits were [federally insured];</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>(2) that the defendant made false statements to the [Institution];</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>(3) that the defendant knew the statements were false;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>(4) that the statements were materially false and made for the purpose of influencing the [Institution] to make a loan or advance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 3.   More recently, in United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 820, 115 S.Ct. 80, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994), we construed the elements of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>(1) engag[ing] in a scheme or artifice to defraud, or ma[king] false statements or misrepresentations to obtain money from;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(2) a federally insured financial institution;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(3) d[oing] so knowingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 424.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, on the plain language of these statutes, the requirements of Blockburger are satisfied.  Section 1014 contains an element not contained in &#167; 1344, that is, proof that the statements were \"materially false.\"   Likewise, &#167; 1344 encompasses a \"scheme or artifice to defraud,\" which is not an element of &#167; 1014.  Defendants, nonetheless, urge us to adopt the opinion of a divided Second Circuit in United States v. Seda, 978 F.2d 779 (2d Cir.1992), which held that &#167;&#167; 1014 and 1344, when arising from the same offense, are multiplicitous.  978 F.2d at 781.   We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Seda, the court moved beyond Blockburger statutory analysis, relying instead on Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980), where the Court held that counts of rape and felony murder were not separate offenses because in that case \"proof of rape [was] a necessary element of proof of the felony murder.\"  445 U.S. at 694, 100 S.Ct. at 1439.   We read Whalen, however, as the rule only in cases of lesser or greater included offenses, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 698, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 2857, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993), for which rape and felony murder qualify, but bank fraud and making false statements to a federally insured lending institution do not.  Indeed, in Dixon, the Court overruled the \"same conduct\" test of Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990) id. at 711-12, 113 S.Ct. at 2864, and reaffirmed the mandatory application of Blockburger statutory analysis.  Id. at 696, 113 S.Ct. at 2855-56;  cf. United States v. Wolfswinkel, 44 F.3d 782, 785 (9th Cir.1995) (finding Seda non-viable in the wake of Dixon ).   Although the Blockburger elements test is mechanistic and often criticized, we are already bound by it.  Rossetti v. Curran, 80 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Black, 78 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 254, 136 L.Ed.2d 180 (1996).  Because it is possible to violate either statute without violating the other, we believe the best view is that these two counts are not multiplicitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, defendants contend that as regards Count IV, Mail Fraud, there was no evidence that co-conspirator Dailey mailed, or caused to be mailed, the mortgage to Dupont.  The evidence, however, shows that when Dupont received the mortgage in the mail, the return address on the envelope was that of Dailey's law firm.  In addition, the jury heard evidence that Dailey acted as closing attorney in this transaction and recorded the mortgage.  From this testimony a reasonable jury could infer that Dailey mailed the mortgage to Dupont.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next maintain that deposition testimony given by each defendant during Scott's bankruptcy proceeding was non-admissible as former testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) because neither defendant had motive or opportunity to cross-examine the other.  This is a misconception.  In the first place, each deposition was redacted to apply only to the deponent.  Against him it was clearly admissible;  anything affecting its weight could be offered separately.  If the other defendant was entitled to have it limited, and not apply to him, it was his obligation to request an instruction.  United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 558 n. 14 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 238 (1st Cir.1988);  Fed.R.Evid. 105.  Neither did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next object to the introduction of their deposition testimony by claiming violations of their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  It is elementary that the privilege must be asserted at the time of the questioning.  Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1143-44, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984).  Defendants seek to excuse themselves by blaming their failure to assert on their attorney Dailey, claiming that he failed to advise them due to his conflict of interest.  We give present counsel high marks for imagination, but nothing else.  The deposition inquiry was not by a government official and therefore not an abuse of defendants' Fifth Amendment rights.  See Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 170, 107 S.Ct. 515, 523, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986) (\"The sole concern of the Fifth Amendment ... is governmental coercion.\").  Once the answer was given, we know of no authority suggesting that the government could not use it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing</p>\n    <p>1. Calculation of the Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next challenge the court's seven level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167;   2F1.1(b)(1),<sup>1</sup> based on its calculation of a $124,000 loss to the victims of defendants' fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  They maintain that because Dailey's pension fund \"purchased\" Scott's mortgage from CCU for the full $160,000, this figure should not enter into the loss calculation.  This was not a purchase for value, however, but a form of laundering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We previously examined the mechanics of loss calculation as pertaining to &#167; 2F1.1 in some detail in United States v. Bennett, 37 F.3d 687 (1st Cir.1994), and again in United States v. Kelley, 76 F.3d 436 (1st Cir.1996), and see no need to engage in lengthy analysis here.  In Bennett, we concluded that Application Note 7(b) controls the methodology for calculating loss under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1).  37 F.3d at 695.   Note 7(b) provides that in the case of a fraudulent loan, \"[t]he loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered (or can expect to recover) from any assets pledged to secure the loan.\"  Id. (emphasis supplied).  Because CCU discovered the fraud before Dailey's law firm's pension fund acquired the mortgage, the full $160,000 was correctly included in the loss calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also contend that the court erred in including the $60,000 Dupont mortgage in the loss calculation because the amount of the loss attributed to Dupont was speculative.  We agree with the government, however, that with an appraised value of only $96,000 at the time of discovery and a first mortgage to the pension fund of $160,000, Dupont's second mortgage was worthless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next complain of the two level enhancement each received for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.  We review factual determinations of whether a defendant obstructed justice only for clear error.  United States v. Thomas, 86 F.3d 263, 263 (1st Cir.1996) (citing United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 705-06 (1st Cir.1992)).  The record contains evidence of several independent acts by the defendants supporting these enhancements, including submitting a false affidavit by James (later admitted to be untrue), witness intimidation, albeit after the fact, and false objections to the Pre-Sentence Report.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, Application Notes 3(a),(f),(h).  Faced with multiple reasons supporting the enhancement, we cannot say that the 2 level enhancement for obstruction of justice was error, clear or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Role in the Offense Determinations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James contests his two level enhancement for being a manager or organizer of the criminal activity, seeking instead to award that role to Dailey.  We can dispose of this contention forthwith.  Reviewing again only for clear error, United States v. Voccola, 99 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir.1996), we find that James' admission in his response to the Pre-Sentencing Report that \"to the extent that his son Scott Fraza is involved in this case, it is solely due to James Fraza's fault and not Scott Fraza,\" is enough to allow us to say again that we discern no error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott complains of the court's refusal to grant a downward adjustment for his minor role in the offense, a position which was not opposed by the government.  Apparently, at sentencing this brass ring was within reach when the Probation Officer interrupted the proceeding and engaged in an ex parte communication with the court some time after which the downward adjustment was denied.  According to Scott, \"the Probation Officer discarded his role as ... an impartial 'arm of the Court' and donned the mantle of an advocate for rejection of the requested 2-point deduction....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's moral outrage regarding this issue was evident at oral argument, but we are perplexed as to his expectations of the Probation Officer's proper behavior.  We would expect the officer to exercise his independent judgment as to the application of the guidelines and we see no error in his interruption of the proceedings to make his judgment known.  See United States v. Belgard, 894 F.2d 1092, 1097 (9th Cir.1990) (observing that a probation officer's duty is to \"provide the trial judge with as much information as possible in order to enable the judge to make an informed decision\").  Anything less would be a dereliction of duty.  Scott's attempt to condemn the officer for doing his job is misplaced and can not act as a basis for overturning a ruling that is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Reimbursement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Included in defendants' sentences was an obligation to repay the cost of their court-appointed attorneys, who had been obtained on defendants' allegation of financial inability.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(a).  To the government's repeated allegation of misrepresentations in their CJA application defendants failed to respond.  They did not, until threatened with contempt, even respond to the government's extensive financial report, with exhibits.  The court's ultimate sentence apparently rejected their replies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our difficulty is that the court conducted no hearing, and made no findings as to either defendant's financial viability.  See United States v. Santarpio, 560 F.2d 448, 455 (1st Cir.1977);  cf. United States v. Chorney, 63 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir.1995).  We must remand that that be done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Restitution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendants protest the court's order that they jointly and severally pay restitution to Dupont in the amount of $54,000, citing the second mortgage still held by Dupont.  Restitution orders are subject to clear error review.  United States v. Hensley, 91 F.3d 274, 277 (1st Cir.1996).  As we noted ante, Dupont's mortgage is essentially worthless.  If circumstances were to change, i.e, the first mortgage to disappear or land values increase to the point of validating Dupont's mortgage, defendants would be free to apply for relief from the restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions and sentences are affirmed in all respects, except that the reimbursement orders are vacated.  The cases are remanded for further proceedings on the matter of reimbursement in accordance herewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>1 U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1) provides a sliding scale requiring an increase to the offense level calculation based on the amount of the loss caused by or intended by the defendant.  Losses greater than $120,000 but less than $200,000 call for a seven level increase.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court calculated the loss as of the time of discovery of the fraud as $160,000 for the CCU mortgage plus $60,000 for Dupont's mortgage, less $96,000, the appraised value of the property on that date</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

After a four day jury trial, both defendants were found guilty on all counts and now appeal their convictions and sentences.  We affirm, with a minor exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, James offered to purchase 80 acres of land in Coventry, Rhode Island, from George Dupont (\"Dupont\").  The agreed upon price was $120,000, financing to include Dupont holding a mortgage of $60,000.  James signed a Purchase and Sale agreement and gave Dupont a $2,000 deposit check, but it required additional financing to complete the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1990, James met with officers of the Coventry Credit Union (\"CCU\").  During this meeting he told the officers that the purchase price of the property was $205,000 and that he was seeking to finance $160,000.  They informed him that due to his prior bankruptcy, no such loan could be granted.  James then suggested that his son Scott purchase the property and take the loan.  The CCU officers agreed to consider the request, but cautioned that Scott would likely require a co-signer due to his youth and short credit history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May of 1990, James and Dupont attended an informal \"closing\" in the back seat of the car of Leo Dailey (\"Dailey\"), an attorney whose firm had represented CCU for over twenty years.  Dupont signed two closing statements--one reflecting the actual purchase price of $120,000 and the other blank.  Dailey told Dupont he needed the blank form to make a correction to a tax computation.  At the same time, Dupont endorsed a deed conveying the property to Scott's construction company.  No money or financial instruments changed hands at this time.  After two abortive attempts, James found a cosigner and CCU approved a $160,000 loan based on the inflated purchase price of $205,000.  CCU's appraisal of the fair market value of the property came in at $225,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"formal\" closing was held on June 15.  Present were James, Scott, Scott's co-signer, a CCU loan officer and Dailey who was acting as CCU's attorney.  Dailey explained that Dupont was unavailable and produced the signed blank closing form.  He then filled in the purchase price as $205,000.  After Scott signed, the loan officer disbursed $160,000 to Dailey who then paid the closing costs, the existing $58,740 mortgage on the property and gave the remaining approximately $95,000 to Scott who in turn paid Dailey $5,000 for his work.  A short time later Dupont received Scott's signed promissory note and mortgage in the amount of $60,000 in the mail.  Dupont was not informed that CCU held a $160,000 first mortgage on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within six months of the sale, Scott filed for bankruptcy.  As part of bankruptcy proceedings, both defendants, represented by Dailey, gave deposition testimony that they had given CCU an inflated price for the Dupont property.  At approximately the same time, Dailey's law firm mailed Dupont a tax form indicating that Dupont had received $205,000 from Scott for the property.  In response to Dupont's complaints, he was provided with a corrected tax form but, along with it, he received a copy of the closing statement stating the purchase price as $205,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also about this time, the loan to Scott became delinquent and CCU discovered that the actual purchase price of the property was $120,000 instead of $205,000 and the existence of two different closing statements.  Dailey's law firm, wanting to keep CCU as a client, arranged for its pension fund to pay CCU $160,000 and take over the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, James, Scott and Dailey were indicted on charges of bank fraud, mail fraud, making false statements to a federally insured lending institution, aiding and abetting, and conspiracy under the Taft-Hartley Act to commit these offenses.  Dailey died prior to trial.  James and Scott were found guilty on all counts and sentenced to 37 months and 24 months respectively.  Both were also sentenced to identical terms of supervised release, joint and several restitution of $54,000 to Dupont, $200 in special assessments and reimbursement of all attorney's fees and expert witness fees paid pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act (\"CJA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants raise multiple grounds on appeal encompassing issues relating to indictment, trial and sentencing.

Section 1014 contains an element not contained in &#167; 1344, that is, proof that the statements were \"materially false.\"   Likewise, &#167; 1344 encompasses a \"scheme or artifice to defraud,\" which is not an element of &#167; 1014.  Defendants, nonetheless, urge us to adopt the opinion of a divided Second Circuit in United States v.

We read Whalen, however, as the rule only in cases of lesser or greater included offenses, see United States v. Dixon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112906\"><a href=\"/opinion/112906/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, 698, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112906\"><a href=\"/opinion/112906/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the Blockburger elements test is mechanistic and often criticized, we are already bound by it.  Rossetti v.

Because it is possible to violate either statute without violating the other, we believe the best view is that these two counts are not multiplicitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, defendants contend that as regards Count IV, Mail Fraud, there was no evidence that co-conspirator Dailey mailed, or caused to be mailed, the mortgage to Dupont.  The evidence, however, shows that when Dupont received the mortgage in the mail, the return address on the envelope was that of Dailey's law firm.  In addition, the jury heard evidence that Dailey acted as closing attorney in this transaction and recorded the mortgage.  From this testimony a reasonable jury could infer that Dailey mailed the mortgage to Dupont.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next maintain that deposition testimony given by each defendant during Scott's bankruptcy proceeding was non-admissible as former testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) because neither defendant had motive or opportunity to cross-examine the other.  This is a misconception.  In the first place, each deposition was redacted to apply only to the deponent.  Against him it was clearly admissible;  anything affecting its weight could be offered separately.  If the other defendant was entitled to have it limited, and not apply to him, it was his obligation to request an instruction.  United States v. Barnett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603504\"><a href=\"/opinion/603504/united-states-v-michael-barnett-united-states-of-america-v-barry-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 558 n. 14 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v.

It is elementary that the privilege must be asserted at the time of the questioning.  Minnesota v. Murphy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 429-30, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span> (1984).  Defendants seek to excuse themselves by blaming their failure to assert on their attorney Dailey, claiming that he failed to advise them due to his conflict of interest.  We give present counsel high marks for imagination, but nothing else.  The deposition inquiry was not by a government official and therefore not an abuse of defendants' Fifth Amendment rights.  See Colorado v. Connelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111779\"><a href=\"/opinion/111779/colorado-v-connelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 170, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111779\"><a href=\"/opinion/111779/colorado-v-connelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span> (1986) (\"The sole concern of the Fifth Amendment ... is governmental coercion.\").  Once the answer was given, we know of no authority suggesting that the government could not use it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing</p>\n    <p>1. Calculation of the Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next challenge the court's seven level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167;   2F1.1(b)(1),<sup>1</sup> based on its calculation of a $124,000 loss to the victims of defendants' fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  They maintain that because Dailey's pension fund \"purchased\" Scott's mortgage from CCU for the full $160,000, this figure should not enter into the loss calculation.  This was not a purchase for value, however, but a form of laundering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We previously examined the mechanics of loss calculation as pertaining to &#167; 2F1.1 in some detail in United States v. Bennett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195606\"><a href=\"/opinion/195606/united-states-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994), and again in United States v. Kelley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196587\"><a href=\"/opinion/196587/united-states-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), and see no need to engage in lengthy analysis here.  In Bennett, we concluded that Application Note 7(b) controls the methodology for calculating loss under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1).  37 F.3d at 695.   Note 7(b) provides that in the case of a fraudulent loan, \"[t]he loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered (or can expect to recover) from any assets pledged to secure the loan.\"  Id. (emphasis supplied).  Because CCU discovered the fraud before Dailey's law firm's pension fund acquired the mortgage, the full $160,000 was correctly included in the loss calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also contend that the court erred in including the $60,000 Dupont mortgage in the loss calculation because the amount of the loss attributed to Dupont was speculative.  We agree with the government, however, that with an appraised value of only $96,000 at the time of discovery and a first mortgage to the pension fund of $160,000, Dupont's second mortgage was worthless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next complain of the two level enhancement each received for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.  We review factual determinations of whether a defendant obstructed justice only for clear error.  United States v. Thomas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196832\"><a href=\"/opinion/196832/united-states-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.1996) (citing United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 705-06 (1st Cir.1992)).  The record contains evidence of several independent acts by the defendants supporting these enhancements, including submitting a false affidavit by James (later admitted to be untrue), witness intimidation, albeit after the fact, and false objections to the Pre-Sentence Report.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, Application Notes 3(a),(f),(h).  Faced with multiple reasons supporting the enhancement, we cannot say that the 2 level enhancement for obstruction of justice was error, clear or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Role in the Offense Determinations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James contests his two level enhancement for being a manager or organizer of the criminal activity, seeking instead to award that role to Dailey.  We can dispose of this contention forthwith.  Reviewing again only for clear error, United States v. Voccola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197057\"><a href=\"/opinion/197057/united-states-v-voccola/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1996), we find that James' admission in his response to the Pre-Sentencing Report that \"to the extent that his son Scott Fraza is involved in this case, it is solely due to James Fraza's fault and not Scott Fraza,\" is enough to allow us to say again that we discern no error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott complains of the court's refusal to grant a downward adjustment for his minor role in the offense, a position which was not opposed by the government.  Apparently, at sentencing this brass ring was within reach when the Probation Officer interrupted the proceeding and engaged in an ex parte communication with the court some time after which the downward adjustment was denied.  According to Scott, \"the Probation Officer discarded his role as ... an impartial 'arm of the Court' and donned the mantle of an advocate for rejection of the requested 2-point deduction....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's moral outrage regarding this issue was evident at oral argument, but we are perplexed as to his expectations of the Probation Officer's proper behavior.  We would expect the officer to exercise his independent judgment as to the application of the guidelines and we see no error in his interruption of the proceedings to make his judgment known.  See United States v. Belgard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535685\"><a href=\"/opinion/535685/united-states-v-david-keith-belgard/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span>, 1097 (9th Cir.1990) (observing that a probation officer's duty is to \"provide the trial judge with as much information as possible in order to enable the judge to make an informed decision\").  Anything less would be a dereliction of duty.  Scott's attempt to condemn the officer for doing his job is misplaced and can not act as a basis for overturning a ruling that is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Reimbursement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Included in defendants' sentences was an obligation to repay the cost of their court-appointed attorneys, who had been obtained on defendants' allegation of financial inability.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(a).  To the government's repeated allegation of misrepresentations in their CJA application defendants failed to respond.  They did not, until threatened with contempt, even respond to the government's extensive financial report, with exhibits.  The court's ultimate sentence apparently rejected their replies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our difficulty is that the court conducted no hearing, and made no findings as to either defendant's financial viability.  See United States v. Santarpio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348376\"><a href=\"/opinion/348376/united-states-v-victor-santarpio-aka-lefty-no-76-1178/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 455 (1st Cir.1977);  cf.

We must remand that that be done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Restitution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendants protest the court's order that they jointly and severally pay restitution to Dupont in the amount of $54,000, citing the second mortgage still held by Dupont.  Restitution orders are subject to clear error review.  United States v. Hensley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196912\"><a href=\"/opinion/196912/united-states-v-hensley/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 277 (1st Cir.1996).  As we noted ante, Dupont's mortgage is essentially worthless.  If circumstances were to change, i.e, the first mortgage to disappear or land values increase to the point of validating Dupont's mortgage, defendants would be free to apply for relief from the restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions and sentences are affirmed in all respects, except that the reimbursement orders are vacated.
