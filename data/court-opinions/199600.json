Ronald M. Tyler appeals following entry\n\nof a conditional guilty plea to a one-count indictment charging\n\nuse of a false Social Security number in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 408(a)(7)(B).   Under the plea agreement, the scope of this\n\nappeal is limited solely to the question of whether the district\n\ncourt erred in denying appellant's motion to suppress the Social\n\nSecurity card that provided the basis for the charge, based on\n\nthe argument that the police officer lacked reasonable suspicion\n\nto stop his vehicle and question him.            For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we find no merit to appellant's argument.\n\n          Appellant was stopped by a police officer in Ellsworth,\n\nMaine on August 1, 2000.        The officer had been alerted to\n\nappellant's presence in Maine by a pastor of a local church who\n\nhad once before provided information to the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation   leading    to   the    arrests    of   two   fugitives.\n\nAccording to the pastor, the appellant, who had been attending\n\nchurch services, had spoken to the pastor about making the\n\nchurch his \"home church.\"1      Appellant explained to the pastor\n\nthat he had moved from Arkansas shortly after his wife and son\n\nwere killed in a car accident.         The pastor was concerned by\n\n\n\n    1   Appellant had been using the alias Mark VanZant.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fappellant's seemingly inconsistent stories about his past, and\n\nthe aggregation of the quick proximity between the deaths, his\n\nmove to Maine, and his courtship of a vulnerable member of the\n\npastor's congregation.\n\n            Not suspecting appellant of a crime, but wanting to\n\nfollow up on the pastor's concerns, the officer drove to the\n\nhouse     where   appellant   was    living.     As    he   arrived,    a   gold\n\nOldsmobile Cutlass with Arkansas license plates and a novelty\n\n\"Aloha\" license plate, which he had seen several times in the\n\npast, was pulling out of the driveway.                The officer testified\n\nthat he stopped the vehicle on the suspicion that Tyler was its\n\ndriver and that he had possessed the vehicle in Maine, without\n\nregistering it, for more than thirty days since establishing\n\nresidency, a violation of Maine law.2            The officer's suspicion\n\nthat appellant had been living in Maine for some time was based\n\non his recollection of having seen the vehicle as long ago as\n\nMarch, and the information from the pastor regarding appellant's\n\nintent to remain in Maine.          In response to the officer's request\n\nfor   identification,     appellant      could   produce     only   a   Social\n\nSecurity card that did not belong to him.              The officer issued a\n\nsummons for operating without a license and for failure to\n\n\n      2Maine law requires that all motor vehicles be registered\nwithin thirty days of establishing residency. See 29-A M.R.S.A.\n§ 514.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fprovide proof of insurance. A federal grand jury subsequently\n\nissued an indictment alleging use of a false Social Security\n\nnumber.\n\n          Appellant contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to suppress because the police officer was\n\nunable to proffer \"specific and articulable\" facts sufficient to\n\nestablish reasonable suspicion to stop his vehicle, and the stop\n\ntherefore violated the Fourth Amendment.    See Terry v. Ohio, 392\n\nU.S. 1, 21 (1968) (\"[T]he police officer must be able to point\n\nto specific and articulable facts which, taken together with\n\nrational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [an]\n\nintrusion.\"). First, he maintains that the officer had only a\n\nvague recollection of having seen the vehicle as early as March.\n\nTherefore, he argues, the officer could not reasonably have\n\nthought the vehicle had been in Maine for more than thirty days\n\nbecause his only other recollections of having seen the car had\n\nbeen during the month of July.       Second, appellant argues that\n\nbecause the officer had never seen the driver of the vehicle, he\n\ncould not have reasonably inferred that the driver on August 1,\n\n2000 was the same driver that the officer had seen in the past.\n\n          The legal determination of whether appellant's Fourth\n\nAmendment rights were violated is reviewable de novo. See United\n\nStates v. Charles, 213 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).   The district\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fcourt's findings of fact, by contrast, are reviewed for clear\n\nerror.      See id.    We are satisfied that the officer had a\n\nsufficient    basis   for    stopping    appellant    to     ascertain   his\n\nidentity and investigate whether he had violated the state's\n\nmotor vehicle registration law.          Based on information from the\n\npastor, he knew that appellant was from Arkansas.             He also knew\n\nappellant's address. Upon seeing a vehicle with Arkansas license\n\nplates pull out of the driveway of appellant's home, the officer\n\nreasonably could have assumed that the driver was appellant.\n\nHaving some recollection of seeing the vehicle some months\n\nbefore, along with the pastor's information about appellant's\n\ninvolvement in the church community, the officer reasonably\n\ncould have suspected that appellant had been living in Maine for\n\nmore than thirty days.       The officer's articulated reasons for\n\nsuspicion were particular to appellant, see United States v.\n\nWoodrum, 202 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2000), and relied in part on the\n\nofficer's own knowledge of the vehicle's presence in the area.\n\nTaken together, the facts establish that the traffic stop was\n\npermissible and the motion to suppress was properly denied.\n\n            The   judgment   of   the    district    court    is   therefore\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
