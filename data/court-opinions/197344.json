The\r\n\ndistrict  court  granted summary  judgment  in  favor of  the\r\n\nUnion, from  which Delgado-Biaggi  now appeals.   Because the\r\n\ndistrict court's failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil\r\n\nProcedure   56(c)   denied   Delgado-Biaggi    a   meaningful\r\n\nopportunity to oppose the Union's summary judgment motion, we\r\n\nvacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n               Background and Prior Proceedings\r                           Background and Prior Proceedings\r                                                           \r\n\n          We  recite the  pertinent facts  in the  light most\r\n\nfavorable  to  Delgado-Biaggi,  the  party  opposing  summary\r\n\njudgment.  See Hachikian  v. F.D.I.C., 96 F.3d 502,  504 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1996).\r\n\n          Delgado-Biaggi joined the Local  501 chapter of the\r\n\nTWU in 1991 when he began  working for American Airlines as a\r\n\nbaggage handler.  One  year later, Delgado-Biaggi was elected\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Delgado-Biaggi's wife, Nilda  Fernandez-Zayas, and  their\r\nconjugal partnership are also plaintiffs.  For simplicity, we\r\nrefer only to Eric Delgado-Biaggi and his claims.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nto a union  shop-steward position  for the  bag room,  second\r\n\nshift.2   In September  1993, Delgado-Biaggi bid  for a first\r\n\nshift position, which he obtained because of his seniority.\r\n\n          In  October  1993,  shortly   after  Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\nchanged work shifts, the  chairman of Local 501 handed  him a\r\n\nletter  from Local  501's  Executive Vice-President,  William\r\n\nTlasek,  which  purported  to   acknowledge  Delgado-Biaggi's\r\n\n\"resignation\" of  his shop  steward's position.   In November\r\n\n1993, Delgado-Biaggi responded to Tlasek by letter, asserting\r\n\nthat he  had not resigned as  shop steward and that  he had a\r\n\nright to remain in office unless he was duly removed pursuant\r\n\nto  Local 501's  bylaws.   Tlasek,  in  turn, responded  that\r\n\nDelgado-Biaggi's  shift-change   automatically  effected  his\r\n\nresignation under  Article VII(a) of the  union bylaws, which\r\n\nprovides: \"A Shop Steward who leaves the unit or shift he was\r\n\nelected by, will continue  to serve at the discretion  of the\r\n\nExecutive Board.\"\r\n\n          Dissatisfied  with  that  response,  Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\ncomplained again to Tlasek by letter  dated January 14, 1994,\r\n\nalso to  no avail.  Not willing to concede the issue, he then\r\n\nretained  an attorney who, in  March 1994, wrote  a letter to\r\n\nLocal  501 claiming denial of  due process in  the removal of\r\n\nDelgado-Biaggi  as  steward.   The  leadership  of Local  501\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Shop  stewards are  union representatives  who personally\r\nhandle problems that their fellow employees raise  concerning\r\nmanagement.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nremained unmoved.   In April  1994, Delgado-Biaggi's  counsel\r\n\nattempted   to  appeal  by   letter  to  TWU's  International\r\n\nExecutive Council.  The Council's stated reason for rejecting\r\n\nthe  appeal was  Delgado-Biaggi's failure to  personally file\r\n\nthe letter.  Delgado-Biaggi did  not resubmit his appeal, but\r\n\ninstead commenced this litigation in June 1994.\r\n\n          On June  13, 1996,  after a desultory  beginning to\r\n\nthe  prosecution of this case, the district court set a trial\r\n\ndate of July 1, 1996.  On June 17, the Union responded to the\r\n\nsetting  of the  trial date  by filing  a motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment.3   On  Friday, June  28, the  parties met  with the\r\n\ndistrict  court  judge  in   chambers  for  a   non-scheduled\r\n\nconference.   During  this meeting,  Delgado-Biaggi announced\r\n\nhis  intention  to  oppose  the Union's  motion  for  summary\r\n\njudgment with oral and  documentary evidence on the following\r\n\nMonday, July 1, the scheduled first day of trial.\r\n\n          The following Monday morning, before Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\nhad  an opportunity  to  present his  opposing evidence,  the\r\n\nparties were handed an opinion and order granting the Union's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We note  that  the  Union submitted  the  June  17,  1996\r\nsummary judgment motion well  after the court's November 1995\r\ndeadline for the filing of the dispositive motion.  The court\r\nallowed the untimely motion although, as the record reflects,\r\nthe Union did  not first  seek and obtain  leave to file  the\r\nmotion out  of time.  See  In re San Juan  Dupont Plaza Hotel\r                                                                         \r\nFire Litigation, 45 F.3d 564, 566 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining\r                           \r\nthat  summary judgment  proponent must  obtain permission  to\r\nfile motion out of time where filing deadline \"had long since\r\npassed\").\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment.   The terse opinion  stated that\r\n\n\"[t]he union's actions in [construing  Delgado-Biaggi's shift\r\n\nchange as a resignation  of shop stewardship] were authorized\r\n\nby its by-laws, which make perfect sense, since, of course, a\r\n\nshop steward is of little  use if he does not work  the shift\r\n\nhe represents.\"    The  order  concluded that  \"none  of  the\r\n\nunion's conduct violates the rights protected under 29 U.S.C.\r\n\n  411.\"  The  court did  not entertain oral  argument on  the\r\n\nmotion.\r\n\n          Thereafter,  Delgado-Biaggi  filed   a  motion   to\r\n\nreconsider  along  with   a  sworn  declaration   from  Jorge\r\n\nBrignoni, a  former Chairman of  Local 501.   The declaration\r\n\nstated  that  union  stewardships are  \"never\"  withdrawn  or\r\n\ndeemed resigned as a result of a shift change, and that\r\n\n          [i]t  has  never  been  the  practice  in\r\n          Puerto Rico to consider a change of shift\r\n          as an automatic  resignation . . . .  The\r\n          only  case  where such  an interpretation\r\n          has  been  attempted  is  when  Mr.  Eric\r\n          Delgado was unilaterally  removed by  the\r\n          then Chairman Mr. Rafael Perez.\r\n\nDelgado-Biaggi   further  submitted   an  excerpt   from  the\r\n\ndeposition of  Jose Rodriguez, a Board  member, who testified\r\n\nthat  the Executive  Board had  never removed  Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\nfrom his shop  steward position.   The district court  denied\r\n\nthe motion to reconsider.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          On  appeal, Delgado-Biaggi argues that the district\r\n\ncourt  prematurely granted summary  judgment and  that, given\r\n\nthe proper opportunity  to respond to the  Union's motion, he\r\n\nwould have produced  evidence sufficient to  preclude summary\r\n\njudgment.  The Union offers a  host of arguments in favor  of\r\n\nupholding the  court's disposition of the  action and insists\r\n\nthat \"the district court handled the case properly.\"\r\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that\r\n\na summary judgment motion  \"shall be served at least  10 days\r\n\nbefore  the time  fixed for  the hearing.\"   Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n56(c).   We have interpreted  Rule 56(c) to  allow an adverse\r\n\nparty at  least ten days  to respond to a  motion for summary\r\n\njudgment.   See  Stella v. Town  of Tewksbury, 4  F.3d 53, 55\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (\"[S]ummary judgment targets should be secure\r\n\nin the knowledge  that they will  have at least  ten days  in\r\n\nwhich to  formulate  and prepare  their  best  opposition.\");\r\n\nMelanson  v.

Indeed, \"the purpose of Rule 56(c) is to allow a\r\n\nparty to have a meaningful opportunity to challenge a summary\r\n\njudgment  motion.\"    Cia.  Petrolera Caribe,  Inc.  v.  Arco\r                                                                         \r\n\nCaribbean, Inc., 754 F.2d 404,  409 (1st Cir. 1985) (internal\r                           \r\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  We note that, while  Rule 56(c) refers to a  \"hearing\" in\r\nrelation  to the ten day  proviso, the rule  does not require\r\noral argument  in  connection  with  the motion.    See  Cia.\r                                                                         \r\nPetrolera Caribe, 754 F.2d at 411 (explaining that the motion\r                            \r\nmay be \"heard\" on the papers).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          The Union filed its  motion for summary judgment on\r\n\nMonday, June 17, 1996.  Excluding the day on which the motion\r\n\nwas filed as well as the intervening Saturday and Sunday, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  6(a), the  ten-day  requirement  afforded\r\n\nDelgado-Biaggi until the end of the business day Monday, July\r\n\n1, to submit  his opposition.   By ruling  on the morning  of\r\n\nJuly  1, before  Delgado-Biaggi  could  present his  opposing\r\n\nevidence,  the  district  court  denied   him  the  requisite\r\n\nopportunity  to contest  the motion.   As we  previously have\r\n\nadmonished, the  \"[ten day] notice requirement  is not merely\r\n\nwindow   dressing\"  and  the  \"proper  province\"  of  summary\r\n\njudgment is \"to  weed out  claims that do  not warrant  trial\r\n\nrather than simply  to clear  a court's docket.\"   Stella,  4\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  at 55.   We find that  the court erred  when it granted\r\n\nsummary   judgment   before   Delgado-Biaggi  exhausted   his\r\n\nopportunity to challenge the Union's motion.5\r\n\n          The   Union   overlooks   the    procedural   flaws\r\n\naccompanying the  entry of summary judgment  and endeavors to\r\n\npersuade  us  that,  in any  event,  the  record reflects  no\r\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.  In Stella, we \"decline[d] to\r                                                      \r\n\ndelve into  the substantive  aspects of plaintiffs'  cause of\r\n\naction\"  because  \"leapfrogging to  the merits  would display\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The error  is somewhat  amplified by the  undisputed fact\r\nthat, during the June  28 chambers conference, Delgado-Biaggi\r\nnotified the district court that he would submit his opposing\r\nevidence the following Monday, July 1.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nmuch the same disregard  for established protocol that marred\r\n\nthe district court's performance.\"   4 F.3d at 55.   Assuming\r\n\nharmless error jurisprudence applied  in such cases, we noted\r\n\nthat  the  peculiar  procedural  regime  the  district  court\r\n\nemployed in that case thwarted any such analysis.  See id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n56 n.4.\r\n\n          We acknowledge that this  case does not present the\r\n\nextreme procedural shortcomings involved  in Stella.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 54  (reversing summary  judgment where,  on  first day  of\r\n\ntrial, judge directed defendants to move for summary judgment\r\n\nand   afforded  plaintiffs  thirty  minutes  to  prepare  for\r\n\nargument).6  The district court's failure to comply with Rule\r\n\n56(c),  however, necessitates  that we  afford Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\n\"every  latitude to show that [the Union] was not entitled to\r\n\nsummary  judgment.\"   Melanson,  667 F.2d  at 214.   Assuming\r                                          \r\n\narguendo that  harmless error analysis applies  to Rule 56(c)\r                    \r\n\ninfirmities,  we cannot  say  that the  court's noncompliance\r\n\nwith the ten-day notice requirement was harmless.\r\n\n          The  sworn  statements   submitted  with   Delgado-\r\n\nBiaggi's motion  to reconsider  comprise evidence  that Local\r\n\n501 never  previously considered a shift-change  an automatic\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Although we construed the district court's proceedings in\r\nStella as involving  a sua sponte grant  of summary judgment,\r                                             \r\nour  observations concerning  Rule 56(c)'s  requirements were\r\nnot limited  to that summary judgment subset.   See 4 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n55;  see also Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24,\r                                                            \r\n29-30 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nresignation of a  shop steward's  position and  that, in  any\r\n\nevent, the  Executive  Board never  exercised its  discretion\r\n\nwithin the  meaning of  Article VII(a) to  terminate Delgado-\r\n\nBiaggi's  stewardship.   Indeed, the  Union conceded  at oral\r\n\nargument before us that  there was no evidence in  the record\r\n\nto  establish  that  the  Board  had  met  to   exercise  its\r\n\ndiscretion.7   This  undisputed fact  undermines the  court's\r\n\ncrucial   findings   in  its   summary  judgment   order  and\r\n\nsufficiently  raises  the  question  of a  genuine  issue  of\r\n\nmaterial fact.  Thus,  we cannot view the  flawed proceedings\r\n\nbelow as involving harmless error.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  by  the  Union's own  reasoning,  its\r\n\ncontention that  Delgado-Biaggi fails to state  a claim under\r\n\nthe  LMRDA  depends  on  the Executive  Board's  powers  and,\r\n\nultimately, the  disputed question  whether the Board  met to\r\n\nexercise its  discretion.   The Union's other  arguments also\r\n\nraise significant issues neither fully presented nor squarely\r\n\naddressed below.8  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Without deciding the issue, we note  that the language of\r\nArticle  VII(a)  appears  to  contemplate  the  uninterrupted\r\nservice of  a shop  steward who changes  shifts, absent  some\r\naction by the Executive Board.\r\n\n8.  For example, the Union  argues that Delgado-Biaggi failed\r\n\"to exhaust reasonable hearing  procedures (but not to exceed\r\na four-month lapse of time) within [the union]\" before filing\r\nhis  action.     29   U.S.C.    411(a)(4).     This  argument\r\npotentially requires factbound  determinations regarding  the\r\n\"reasonableness\" of  the hearing  procedures and  the precise\r\nevent that  triggered the  four month period.   The  district\r\ncourt  never reached  this issue  and, given  the undeveloped\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nLitigation, 45 F.3d  564, 567, 568  (1st Cir. 1995)  (finding\r                      \r\n\nharmful  error  where  appellate  court  was not  \"completely\r\n\ncertain that  the merits  of the  summary judgment  issue had\r\n\nbeen fully  presented to  the  district court\"  and where  \"a\r\n\nsignificant  legal  issue,  not  squarely  addressed  by  the\r\n\ndistrict   court\"   remained   unresolved  due   to   court's\r\n\nabbreviated summary  judgment proceedings).

One  year later, Delgado-Biaggi was elected\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Delgado-Biaggi's wife, Nilda  Fernandez-Zayas, and  their\r\nconjugal partnership are also plaintiffs.  For simplicity, we\r\nrefer only to Eric Delgado-Biaggi and his claims.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nto a union  shop-steward position  for the  bag room,  second\r\n\nshift.2   In September  1993, Delgado-Biaggi bid  for a first\r\n\nshift position, which he obtained because of his seniority.\r\n\n          In  October  1993,  shortly   after  Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\nchanged work shifts, the  chairman of Local 501 handed  him a\r\n\nletter  from Local  501's  Executive Vice-President,  William\r\n\nTlasek,  which  purported  to   acknowledge  Delgado-Biaggi's\r\n\n\"resignation\" of  his shop  steward's position.   In November\r\n\n1993, Delgado-Biaggi responded to Tlasek by letter, asserting\r\n\nthat he  had not resigned as  shop steward and that  he had a\r\n\nright to remain in office unless he was duly removed pursuant\r\n\nto  Local 501's  bylaws.   Tlasek,  in  turn, responded  that\r\n\nDelgado-Biaggi's  shift-change   automatically  effected  his\r\n\nresignation under  Article VII(a) of the  union bylaws, which\r\n\nprovides: \"A Shop Steward who leaves the unit or shift he was\r\n\nelected by, will continue  to serve at the discretion  of the\r\n\nExecutive Board.\"\r\n\n          Dissatisfied  with  that  response,  Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\ncomplained again to Tlasek by letter  dated January 14, 1994,\r\n\nalso to  no avail.  Not willing to concede the issue, he then\r\n\nretained  an attorney who, in  March 1994, wrote  a letter to\r\n\nLocal  501 claiming denial of  due process in  the removal of\r\n\nDelgado-Biaggi  as  steward.   The  leadership  of Local  501\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Shop  stewards are  union representatives  who personally\r\nhandle problems that their fellow employees raise  concerning\r\nmanagement.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nremained unmoved.   In April  1994, Delgado-Biaggi's  counsel\r\n\nattempted   to  appeal  by   letter  to  TWU's  International\r\n\nExecutive Council.  The Council's stated reason for rejecting\r\n\nthe  appeal was  Delgado-Biaggi's failure to  personally file\r\n\nthe letter.  Delgado-Biaggi did  not resubmit his appeal, but\r\n\ninstead commenced this litigation in June 1994.\r\n\n          On June  13, 1996,  after a desultory  beginning to\r\n\nthe  prosecution of this case, the district court set a trial\r\n\ndate of July 1, 1996.  On June 17, the Union responded to the\r\n\nsetting  of the  trial date  by filing  a motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment.3   On  Friday, June  28, the  parties met  with the\r\n\ndistrict  court  judge  in   chambers  for  a   non-scheduled\r\n\nconference.   During  this meeting,  Delgado-Biaggi announced\r\n\nhis  intention  to  oppose  the Union's  motion  for  summary\r\n\njudgment with oral and  documentary evidence on the following\r\n\nMonday, July 1, the scheduled first day of trial.\r\n\n          The following Monday morning, before Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\nhad  an opportunity  to  present his  opposing evidence,  the\r\n\nparties were handed an opinion and order granting the Union's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We note  that  the  Union submitted  the  June  17,  1996\r\nsummary judgment motion well  after the court's November 1995\r\ndeadline for the filing of the dispositive motion.  The court\r\nallowed the untimely motion although, as the record reflects,\r\nthe Union did  not first  seek and obtain  leave to file  the\r\nmotion out  of time.

The declaration\r\n\nstated  that  union  stewardships are  \"never\"  withdrawn  or\r\n\ndeemed resigned as a result of a shift change, and that\r\n\n          [i]t  has  never  been  the  practice  in\r\n          Puerto Rico to consider a change of shift\r\n          as an automatic  resignation . . . .  The\r\n          only  case  where such  an interpretation\r\n          has  been  attempted  is  when  Mr.  Eric\r\n          Delgado was unilaterally  removed by  the\r\n          then Chairman Mr. Rafael Perez.\r\n\nDelgado-Biaggi   further  submitted   an  excerpt   from  the\r\n\ndeposition of  Jose Rodriguez, a Board  member, who testified\r\n\nthat  the Executive  Board had  never removed  Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\nfrom his shop  steward position.   The district court  denied\r\n\nthe motion to reconsider.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          On  appeal, Delgado-Biaggi argues that the district\r\n\ncourt  prematurely granted summary  judgment and  that, given\r\n\nthe proper opportunity  to respond to the  Union's motion, he\r\n\nwould have produced  evidence sufficient to  preclude summary\r\n\njudgment.  The Union offers a  host of arguments in favor  of\r\n\nupholding the  court's disposition of the  action and insists\r\n\nthat \"the district court handled the case properly.\"\r\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that\r\n\na summary judgment motion  \"shall be served at least  10 days\r\n\nbefore  the time  fixed for  the hearing.\"   Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n56(c).   We have interpreted  Rule 56(c) to  allow an adverse\r\n\nparty at  least ten days  to respond to a  motion for summary\r\n\njudgment.   See  Stella v.

We note that, while  Rule 56(c) refers to a  \"hearing\" in\r\nrelation  to the ten day  proviso, the rule  does not require\r\noral argument  in  connection  with  the motion.    See  Cia.\r                                                                         \r\nPetrolera Caribe, 754 F.2d at 411 (explaining that the motion\r                            \r\nmay be \"heard\" on the papers).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          The Union filed its  motion for summary judgment on\r\n\nMonday, June 17, 1996.  Excluding the day on which the motion\r\n\nwas filed as well as the intervening Saturday and Sunday, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  6(a), the  ten-day  requirement  afforded\r\n\nDelgado-Biaggi until the end of the business day Monday, July\r\n\n1, to submit  his opposition.   By ruling  on the morning  of\r\n\nJuly  1, before  Delgado-Biaggi  could  present his  opposing\r\n\nevidence,  the  district  court  denied   him  the  requisite\r\n\nopportunity  to contest  the motion.   As we  previously have\r\n\nadmonished, the  \"[ten day] notice requirement  is not merely\r\n\nwindow   dressing\"  and  the  \"proper  province\"  of  summary\r\n\njudgment is \"to  weed out  claims that do  not warrant  trial\r\n\nrather than simply  to clear  a court's docket.\"   Stella,  4\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  at 55.   We find that  the court erred  when it granted\r\n\nsummary   judgment   before   Delgado-Biaggi  exhausted   his\r\n\nopportunity to challenge the Union's motion.5\r\n\n          The   Union   overlooks   the    procedural   flaws\r\n\naccompanying the  entry of summary judgment  and endeavors to\r\n\npersuade  us  that,  in any  event,  the  record reflects  no\r\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.  In Stella, we \"decline[d] to\r                                                      \r\n\ndelve into  the substantive  aspects of plaintiffs'  cause of\r\n\naction\"  because  \"leapfrogging to  the merits  would display\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The error  is somewhat  amplified by the  undisputed fact\r\nthat, during the June  28 chambers conference, Delgado-Biaggi\r\nnotified the district court that he would submit his opposing\r\nevidence the following Monday, July 1.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nmuch the same disregard  for established protocol that marred\r\n\nthe district court's performance.\"   4 F.3d at 55.   Assuming\r\n\nharmless error jurisprudence applied  in such cases, we noted\r\n\nthat  the  peculiar  procedural  regime  the  district  court\r\n\nemployed in that case thwarted any such analysis.  See id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n56 n.4.\r\n\n          We acknowledge that this  case does not present the\r\n\nextreme procedural shortcomings involved  in Stella.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 54  (reversing summary  judgment where,  on  first day  of\r\n\ntrial, judge directed defendants to move for summary judgment\r\n\nand   afforded  plaintiffs  thirty  minutes  to  prepare  for\r\n\nargument).6  The district court's failure to comply with Rule\r\n\n56(c),  however, necessitates  that we  afford Delgado-Biaggi\r\n\n\"every  latitude to show that [the Union] was not entitled to\r\n\nsummary  judgment.\"   Melanson,  667 F.2d  at 214.   Assuming\r                                          \r\n\narguendo that  harmless error analysis applies  to Rule 56(c)\r                    \r\n\ninfirmities,  we cannot  say  that the  court's noncompliance\r\n\nwith the ten-day notice requirement was harmless.\r\n\n          The  sworn  statements   submitted  with   Delgado-\r\n\nBiaggi's motion  to reconsider  comprise evidence  that Local\r\n\n501 never  previously considered a shift-change  an automatic\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Although we construed the district court's proceedings in\r\nStella as involving  a sua sponte grant  of summary judgment,\r                                             \r\nour  observations concerning  Rule 56(c)'s  requirements were\r\nnot limited  to that summary judgment subset.   See 4 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n55;  see also Berkovitz v.

Indeed, the  Union conceded  at oral\r\n\nargument before us that  there was no evidence in  the record\r\n\nto  establish  that  the  Board  had  met  to   exercise  its\r\n\ndiscretion.7   This  undisputed fact  undermines the  court's\r\n\ncrucial   findings   in  its   summary  judgment   order  and\r\n\nsufficiently  raises  the  question  of a  genuine  issue  of\r\n\nmaterial fact.  Thus,  we cannot view the  flawed proceedings\r\n\nbelow as involving harmless error.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  by  the  Union's own  reasoning,  its\r\n\ncontention that  Delgado-Biaggi fails to state  a claim under\r\n\nthe  LMRDA  depends  on  the Executive  Board's  powers  and,\r\n\nultimately, the  disputed question  whether the Board  met to\r\n\nexercise its  discretion.   The Union's other  arguments also\r\n\nraise significant issues neither fully presented nor squarely\r\n\naddressed below.8  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Without deciding the issue, we note  that the language of\r\nArticle  VII(a)  appears  to  contemplate  the  uninterrupted\r\nservice of  a shop  steward who changes  shifts, absent  some\r\naction by the Executive Board.\r\n\n8.  For example, the Union  argues that Delgado-Biaggi failed\r\n\"to exhaust reasonable hearing  procedures (but not to exceed\r\na four-month lapse of time) within [the union]\" before filing\r\nhis  action.     29   U.S.C.    411(a)(4).     This  argument\r\npotentially requires factbound  determinations regarding  the\r\n\"reasonableness\" of  the hearing  procedures and  the precise\r\nevent that  triggered the  four month period.   The  district\r\ncourt  never reached  this issue  and, given  the undeveloped\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nLitigation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195867\"><a href=\"/opinion/195867/in-re-san-juan-v-american-internation/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567, 568  (1st Cir. 1995)  (finding\r                      \r\n\nharmful  error  where  appellate  court  was not  \"completely\r\n\ncertain that  the merits  of the  summary judgment  issue had\r\n\nbeen fully  presented to  the  district court\"  and where  \"a\r\n\nsignificant  legal  issue,  not  squarely  addressed  by  the\r\n\ndistrict   court\"   remained   unresolved  due   to   court's\r\n\nabbreviated summary  judgment proceedings).
