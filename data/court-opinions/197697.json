Petitioners Bi Song Huang and Liu Ming\r                                 \r\n\nAo, a  married couple in  their twenties who are  citizens of\r\n\nthe  People's Republic  of  China,  seek  review of  a  final\r\n\ndeportation  order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).\r\n\nHuang and  Ao  have  conceded  excludability,  but  requested\r\n\nasylum  and withholding of deportation.  An Immigration Judge\r\n\non  December  13,  1995 found  them  excludable  because they\r\n\npossessed neither valid visas nor travel documents and denied\r\n\nthe application for  asylum and  withholding of  deportation.\r\n\nThe  Board of  Immigration Appeals  on  April 8,  1997, in  a\r\n\ncareful decision,  disagreed  with  the  Immigration  Judge's\r\n\ndetermination  that petitioners  were not credible  but found\r\n\nthat Huang had not established his claim (under which Ao also\r\n\nsought protection) for asylum and withholding of deportation.\r\n\n          Under  Section  208(b)  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1158(a),  the  Attorney   General,  in  her  discretion,   is\r\n\nauthorized to  grant asylum to refugees.  Refugees are aliens\r\n\nwho are unable or unwilling to return to their native country\r\n\n\"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution\r\n\non  account of race,  religion, nationality, membership  in a\r\n\nparticular social  group, or political opinion.\"   8 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1101(a)(42)(A).   These two  grounds --  past persecution  or\r\n\nwell  founded fear  of persecution  --  do not  apply to  all\r\n\npersecutions  or  fears,  but  only  to  those  in  the  five\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nenumerated categories.  See Tokarska  v. INS, 978 F.2d 1 (1st\r                                                        \r\n\nCir. 1992).\r\n\n          If  the determinations by  the BIA, whose decisions\r\n\nwe review,  are supported  by substantial  evidence, we  must\r\n\ndeny the petition.  See  INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478,\r                                                          \r\n\n481 (1992).   Here, Huang  argues that he suffered  from past\r\n\npersecution when  he was beaten  and lost his job  because he\r\n\nprotested  the activities of his employer, a local government\r\n\nofficial.  But,  as the BIA  found, the protest was  over his\r\n\nemployer's illegal activities (using prison labor  to produce\r\n\ngoods), his employer was most likely corrupt, and \"it appears\r\n\nmore  likely  that  this  corruption  is  the  basis  for the\r\n\npunishment of  applicant, not applicant's  presumed political\r\n\nbeliefs.\"   Accordingly, the  BIA determined,  Huang had  not\r\n\nshown  a  nexus  between his  political  beliefs,  the ground\r\n\nasserted  for asylum  based  on  past  persecution,  and  the\r\n\nactions taken by his employer.\r\n\n          As to Huang's  argument that he had  a well-founded\r\n\nfear of persecution,  the BIA found that Huang  had again not\r\n\nshown a  nexus between his  fear of persecution,  which might\r\n\nwell be genuine, and his  political beliefs, nor had he shown\r\n\nthat the  threat of  persecution was  country-wide.   The BIA\r\n\nconcluded that Huang had not  met his burden of showing \"that\r\n\na reasonable  person in  his circumstances .  . .  would fear\r\n\npersecution  on  account   of  race,  religion,  nationality,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nmembership  in  a  particular   social  group,  or  political\r\n\nopinion.\"  Because Huang failed to meet the lower standard of\r\n\nproof  for asylum,  he also  did  not meet  the higher  clear\r\n\nprobability standard of  eligibility required for withholding\r\n\nof deportation.  See INS v.  Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 413 (1984)\r                                               \r\n\n(alien must establish a \"clear probability\" of persecution to\r\n\navoid deportation under 8 U.S.C.   1253(h)).\r\n\n          The evidence of record unquestionably supports  the\r\n\nBIA's   findings.    Congress  has  chosen  to  restrict  the\r\n\ndefinition of asylum.  Not all who will face hardship if they\r\n\nreturn   to  their   native   countries  are   eligible   for\r\n\nconsideration of asylum.  \r\n\n          The  decision  of  the Board  is  affirmed  and the\r\n\npetition is dismissed.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n",
