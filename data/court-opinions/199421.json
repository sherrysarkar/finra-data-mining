Defendant-appellant         Daniel\n\nPaniagua-Ramos      (Paniagua)      beseeches           us   to    set    aside    his\n\nconviction for conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute,\n\nmulti-kilogram      quantities      of       cocaine.        See    21    U.S.C.   §§\n\n841(a)(1),   846.        Paniagua   rests         his   entreaty    on    claims    of\n\ninstructional error and jury taint.1                     Finding neither claim\n\npersuasive, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n                                         I\n\n          The details of the alleged conspiracy are of relatively\n\nlittle   import     to   the   issues        on    appeal,    and    it    would    be\n\npleonastic to rehearse them here.                 It suffices to say that the\n\ngovernment adduced evidence that Paniagua, acting in concert\n\nwith Juan Cubilette-Baez and Rafael del Rosario-Sánchez (del\n\nRosario), orchestrated a scheme to transport large amounts of\n\n\n\n    1In his opening brief, Paniagua also mounted a challenge\nunder the banner of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348,\n2062-63 (2000) (establishing, as a constitutional matter, that\n\"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond\na reasonable doubt\"). Following our explication of Apprendi in\nUnited States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2001),\nPaniagua withdrew this claim.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fcocaine from San Juan to New York City.                   According to the\n\ngovernment's   proof,    the     scheme     had   mixed    results.        The\n\nconspirators' first shipment (100 kilograms) went astray.              Their\n\nsecond shipment (200 kilograms) was successful and Cubilette-\n\nBaez received the contraband in New York.                 Before the third\n\nshipment (scheduled to comprise 200 kilograms) left San Juan,\n\nthe authorities intervened.\n\n           Paniagua soon was arrested, indicted, and tried.                 His\n\nquondam accomplice, del Rosario, became a key witness against\n\nhim — a witness whose testimony constituted the cornerstone of\n\nthe government's case.\n\n           The matter was tried twice.        On the first occasion, the\n\njury found Paniagua guilty on the conspiracy count but acquitted\n\nhim on a related charge.       The trial judge voided the conviction,\n\nhowever,   based   on   what     he     retrospectively      found    to    be\n\nprejudicial error in the jury instructions.                 The government\n\nunsuccessfully appealed the order granting a new trial.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Paniagua-Ramos, 135 F.3d 193 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           Upon retrial, the jury returned a verdict on August 25,\n\n1998.   It again found Paniagua guilty of conspiracy.\n\n           On March 10, 1999, the court sentenced Paniagua to\n\nserve a 235-month incarcerative term.             Paniagua appealed.         He\n\nlater moved for a new trial on the ground of jury taint.                   When\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe district court rebuffed this effort, a second appeal ensued.2\n\nBy order dated June 15, 2000, we consolidated the two appeals\n\nfor briefing, argument, and adjudication.\n\n                                 II\n\n           Paniagua's first claim of error involves the lower\n\ncourt's jury instructions.     He calumnizes the testimony of the\n\nturncoat witness, del Rosario, and argues that the court erred\n\nin failing sufficiently to emphasize that the jurors should have\n\nreceived this testimony with caution and scrutinized it with\n\ncare.    He adds that the court compounded this error by failing\n\nto instruct the jurors that they should not convict on the\n\nunsupported testimony of an accomplice absent a belief \"beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that the accomplice is telling the truth.\"\n\nUnited States v. Dailey, 759 F.2d 192, 200 n.8 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\nThis claim lacks force.\n\n           We do not gainsay the obvious:         courts long have\n\nrecognized   the   special   pitfalls   that   accompany   accomplice\n\ntestimony.    In an appropriate case, a criminal defendant is\n\n\n\n     2\n     In United States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 150-51 (1st Cir.\n2000), we left open the question of whether a defendant in a\ncriminal case needs to file a separate notice of appeal from an\norder denying a post-sentence motion for new trial (or,\nconversely, whether the original notice of appeal from the\njudgment of conviction suffices to bring that order before the\nappellate court). This case does not require us to answer that\nquestion.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fentitled, upon timely request, to an instruction that calls the\n\njury's attention to these dangers.                   E.g., United States v.\n\nPelletier, 845 F.2d 1126, 1129 (1st Cir. 1988).                         There are,\n\nhowever, no magic words that must be spoken in this regard.\n\n            This is as it should be.            The primary function of a\n\ntrial   court's    instructions     is    to   create      a    roadmap    for   the\n\njurors, limning those legal rules that they must follow in\n\nfinding the facts and determining the issues in a given case.\n\nFor   the   most   part,    the   law    provides     no       set   formulae    for\n\nconverting these legal rules into lay language — and the choice\n\nof what words are to be spoken belongs, within wide margins, to\n\nthe trial judge.         See United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271,\n\n1299 n.31 (1st Cir. 1996) (remarking the trial court's \"broad\n\ndiscretion to formulate jury instructions as it sees fit\");\n\nUnited States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1124 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(noting     that   the    trial   judge       need   not       parrot     proffered\n\ninstructions).\n\n            It also bears mention that the formulation of jury\n\ninstructions in a criminal case is an interactive process.                       The\n\ntrial judge must, of course, pull the laboring oar — but the\n\nparties have a corollary responsibility seasonably to apprise\n\nthe judge about what they think the jury should or should not be\n\ntold.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 30 (requiring parties to object to\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fjury instructions before the jury retires, stating specifically\n\nthe portion of the instructions to which each objection is\n\naddressed     and   the   ground   for   the   objection).    Paniagua\n\ninterposed no contemporaneous objection to the district court's\n\njury instructions, and it is settled beyond peradventure that a\n\nparty's failure to object to the charge in strict conformity\n\nwith the prerequisites of Rule 30 forfeits most instructional\n\nerrors.     See United States v. Richardson, 14 F.3d 666, 670-71\n\n(1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Weston, 960 F.2d 212, 216 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).\n\n            We say \"most,\" rather than \"all,\" because there is a\n\ncarefully circumscribed exception for plain errors.            But the\n\nplain error hurdle, high in all events, nowhere looms larger\n\nthan in the context of alleged instructional errors.         See United\n\nStates v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 17 (1st Cir. 1991);            see also\n\nUnited States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 976 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"If\n\nno timely objection has been advanced . . . even an improper\n\ninstruction rarely will justify the reversal of a criminal\n\nconviction.\") (citation omitted).          To vault this hurdle, a\n\ndefendant must make four showings.        First, he must show that an\n\nerror occurred.     Second, he must show that the error was clear\n\nor obvious.     Third, he must show that the error affected his\n\nsubstantial rights.       Fourth, he must show that the error so\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\n\nof the proceedings as to threaten a miscarriage of justice.\n\nJohnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997); United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993);              United States v.\n\nBrown, 235 F.3d 2, 4 (1st Cir. 2000).           Paniagua's claim of error\n\ncannot surmount these barriers.\n\n         We agree with Paniagua that, despite the height of the\n\nhurdle, plain error is theoretically possible with respect to an\n\nomitted jury instruction.          If, say, a trial court fails to\n\ninstruct a criminal jury on a basic point like the government's\n\nburden of proof or the presumption of the defendant's innocence,\n\nthe lack of a contemporaneous objection would not foreclose\n\nsearching appellate review.        E.g., United States v. Howard, 506\n\nF.2d 1131, 1132-34 (2d Cir. 1974) (finding plain error where the\n\njury was not instructed as to the elements of the offense of\n\nconviction).   Here, however, there is no such glaring omission.\n\nThe district court correctly (and emphatically) instructed the\n\njury about the government's burden of proof.              The court also\n\ninstructed   the    jurors    at   considerable     length     about   their\n\ncollective responsibility for evaluating the credibility of\n\nwitnesses.     To    cap     matters,     the   court   gave   a   specific\n\ninstruction about accomplice testimony, viz:\n\n                You have heard testimony of the\n         codefendant Rafael del Rosario.    This\n\n                                    -7-\n\f             witness has a cooperation agreement with the\n             government.   The testimony of Rafael del\n             Rosario was given in order for him to\n             hopefully receive a reduction in sentence on\n             act of his cooperation.\n\n                    In . . . evaluating testimony of a\n             cooperating witness, you should consider\n             whether   that   testimony   may   have  been\n             influenced by the government's promises and\n             you should consider that testimony with\n             greater caution than that of ordinary\n             witnesses.      Cooperation agreements are\n             lawful.    The law only requires that you\n             consider    testimony   given    under  those\n             circumstances with greater caution than that\n             of ordinary witnesses.\n\nWe do not suggest that this instruction is either letter perfect\n\nor insusceptible to any improvement.        But reading it against the\n\nbackdrop of the charge as a whole, see United States v. Cintolo,\n\n818   F.2d    980,   1003   (1st   Cir.   1987),   we    think    that     the\n\ninstruction constitutes a fair statement of the applicable law\n\nconcerning     accomplice    testimony.       In   the    absence     of     a\n\ncontemporaneous objection, no more was exigible.                 See United\n\nStates v. Fernandez, 145 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir. 1998) (finding no\n\nplain error even though district court neglected \"to give an\n\nunrequested cautionary instruction [and] the government's case\n\nlargely depend[ed] on uncorroborated informant or accomplice\n\ntestimony\"); United States v. Martin, 815 F.2d 818, 824 (1st\n\nCir. 1987) (finding no plain error when district court failed to\n\ngive an explicit accomplice instruction, but defendant did not\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fregister a contemporaneous objection); see also Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n52(b) (directing courts, in substance, to ignore unpreserved\n\nerrors      not      adversely          \"affecting         substantial        rights\"      of\n\ndefendants).\n\n                 Notwithstanding these authorities, Paniagua posits that\n\nmore   is    required          here    because       del    Rosario's    testimony      was\n\ninternally inconsistent and largely incredible.                          See Fernandez,\n\n145 F.3d at 62-63 (leaving open this possibility); United States\n\nv. House, 471 F.2d 886, 888 (1st Cir. 1973) (similar).                              We need\n\nnot probe this point too deeply for Paniagua's premise is woven\n\nout of whole cloth.                   He has identified no portion of del\n\nRosario's testimony about the drug-trafficking operation that is\n\neither       demonstrably             false,     internally          inconsistent,         or\n\ninherently          incredible.              Perhaps        more     importantly,       our\n\nindependent examination of the record reveals no flaw of this\n\nmagnitude.         The Fernandez exception is, therefore, inapposite.\n\n                 By like token, the Fifth Circuit's decision in United\n\nStates      v.    Jones,       673    F.2d   115     (5th    Cir.    1982),    hawked      by\n\nPaniagua in his brief and at oral argument, does not assist his\n\ncause.       There,       as     here,    the   appellant          contended    \"that   the\n\ndistrict         court    committed      plain       error    by    failing    to   give    a\n\ncautionary instruction (although not requested to do so) against\n\nconviction         upon    the       uncorroborated        testimony    of     an   alleged\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\faccomplice, who was a cooperating government witness.\"          Id. at\n\n117.   Jones argued, as does Paniagua, that whenever a conviction\n\nis based upon an accomplice's testimony and that testimony is\n\nuncorroborated or the evidence as to guilt is debatable, plain\n\nerror \"invariably results, unless the trial court (even in the\n\nabsence of request) specially instructs the jury to receive such\n\naccomplice testimony with caution and to require corroboration\n\nof it.\"   Id. at 118.   The court of appeals rejected this strait-\n\njacketed reading of the law, remarking that \"in the ordinary\n\ncourse of criminal trial, one would expect experienced counsel\n\nto request such an [accomplice] instruction should it be thought\n\ndesirable to have this express instruction to alert the jury to\n\nthe potential unreliability of the accomplice . . . testimony.\"\n\nId.    Placing the burden elsewhere, the court stated, would\n\n\"permit counsel, by knowing inaction, to trap a trial court into\n\nreversible omission of instruction.\"      Id. at 119.    As a result,\n\n\"the failure to give an instruction in the absence of request\n\nfor it may amount to plain error only in egregious instances.\"\n\nId.    Since the circumstances here hardly are egregious, Jones\n\nprovides no support for Paniagua's plaint.\n\n           Paniagua's   rejoinder   of   last   resort   is   that   the\n\nbelatedly challenged instruction denied him a fair trial because\n\nit ignored what he terms an \"established safeguard,\" namely, a\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fdirection to the jurors that they could not convict unless they\n\n\"believe    beyond      a    reasonable        doubt   that   [the   testifying]\n\naccomplice is telling the truth.\"                 Paniagua draws the quoted\n\nlanguage verbatim from a footnote in our opinion in Dailey, 759\n\nF.2d at 200 n.8.        Although the quotation is accurate, casting\n\nthe direction as an immutable obligation wrests the words from\n\ntheir    contextual     moorings         and   distorts   the    Dailey    court's\n\nmeaning.\n\n            In Dailey, the government appealed a pretrial order\n\nbarring it from using accomplice testimony at Dailey's trial.\n\n759 F.2d at 193.             The district court issued the bar order\n\nbecause it believed that the accomplices' plea agreements were\n\nso likely to incite perjurious testimony that allowing the\n\naccomplices to appear as witnesses would violate Dailey's right\n\nto a fair trial.        Id. at 194.        We reversed this order, holding\n\nthat    Dailey's    accomplices          should   be   permitted     to   testify,\n\nsubject to \"standard procedural safeguards.\"                    Id. at 200.    We\n\nrecounted   certain         of   those    safeguards    (e.g.,    \"[t]he    [plea]\n\nagreements should be read to the jury and made available during\n\nits deliberations; defense counsel [should be allowed to] cross-\n\nexamine the accomplices at length about the agreements; and the\n\njury    should     be   given     the     standard     cautionary    instruction\n\nconcerning the testimony of accomplices and a special cautionary\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\finstruction      concerning           the     nature     of   each      accomplice's\n\ncontingent agreement and the risk that it creates, particularly\n\nin   instances     where        the    accomplice's         testimony        cannot     be\n\ncorroborated\").         Id.    Along the way, we quoted extensively from\n\njury instructions actually used by a different district judge in\n\na    companion     case       and     concluded      that     those     instructions\n\n\"adequately admonishe[d] the jury to weigh [the accomplices']\n\ntestimony with the greatest of care.\"                     Id. at 200 n.8.             The\n\nphraseology      upon        which    Paniagua      relies     is     part     of     this\n\nrendition.\n\n            Read in context,            Dailey makes clear that the court\n\nconsidered the quoted instructions to be adequate.                           The court\n\ndid not, however, intimate that those precise instructions were\n\nobligatory.      Indeed, in many cases, the Dailey language will not\n\nbe appropriate.         It is bedrock principle that, in the ordinary\n\ncase, a jury need not believe every government witness beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt in order to conclude that the defendant is\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt — and Dailey did not venture to\n\nalter that principle.3              Nor did Dailey purport to constrain the\n\nusual     rule   that    a    trial    judge       has   considerable        leeway     in\n\n\n\n      3\n     Even so, where the accomplice's uncorroborated testimony is\nthe only evidence of guilt, an admonition that the testimony\nmust be believed beyond a reasonable doubt, if requested, would\nbe advisable to guide the jury's deliberations.\n\n                                            -12-\n\fchoosing the language that will best enable him or her to\n\nenlighten the jury as to a particular point.           Houlihan, 92 F.3d\n\nat 1299 n.31; Nivica, 887 F.2d at 1124.            Accordingly, we reject\n\nPaniagua's effort to convert an example into a mandate.\n\n            To sum up, the court's charge in this case adequately\n\ncovered the subject of accomplice testimony.                 Although there\n\nwere differences between the language used by the court and the\n\nlanguage that Paniagua now says he would have preferred, we fail\n\nto see how those differences depart            in a material way from\n\nstandards    established    in   our     precedents.          We    conclude,\n\ntherefore, that the absence of a contemporaneous objection dooms\n\nPaniagua's argument.       After all, the challenged instructions\n\ncontained no clear or obvious error and inflicted no blow to\n\nPaniagua's    substantial    rights.          In   these     circumstances,\n\npermitting    the   conviction   to   stand    does   not    come   close   to\n\nconstituting a miscarriage of justice.\n\n                                  III\n\n            Paniagua's remaining assignment of error focuses on the\n\ndenial of his motion for new trial.        He maintains that he raised\n\na colorable claim of jury taint; that the lower court's inquiry\n\ninto the issue was superficial; and that he was entitled, at the\n\nvery least, to a more rigorous investigation.               We do not agree.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f            The relevant facts are as follows.           On August 4, 1999\n\n— nearly a year after the jury verdict and nearly five months\n\nafter the imposition of sentence — Paniagua moved for a new\n\ntrial.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.        His motion incorporated, and\n\nrelied upon, a sworn statement from Paniagua's sister, Maria\n\nAntonina Paniagua-Ramos.          The statement, signed on July 30,\n\n1999,     related    that   the   affiant    had   attended    the      trial\n\nthroughout; that she had testified for the defense; and that she\n\nhad   become    thoroughly    familiar      with   the   jurors   and    the\n\nprosecutors.        The affiant went on to allege that, near the end\n\nof the trial, she observed two female jurors chatting with\n\nformer Assistant United States Attorney José A. Quiles in the\n\ncafeteria area of the courthouse; that the trio separated, but\n\none of the women soon returned and handed Quiles a document\n\n(perhaps a notebook); and that Quiles pocketed the document.\n\nBased on this alleged ex parte communication, Paniagua requested\n\na new trial.4\n\n            The United States objected to the motion and denied the\n\nfactual averments on which the motion was predicated.                    The\n\ndistrict court ordered both sides to file memoranda explicating\n\nwhat, if anything, Quiles may have said or done, and how (if at\n\n\n      4\n     Paniagua nowhere credibly explains why the affiant's\nobservations, allegedly made on August 24, 1998, were not\nreported to the court until almost a year later.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fall) his actions may have tainted the jury.   In responding, the\n\ngovernment filed, inter alia, a declaration in which Quiles (who\n\nhad served as the lead prosecutor during the first trial and the\n\nensuing appeal) stated, under the penalties of perjury, that he\n\nhad no role in the second trial and no contact with either the\n\ncase agent or the prosecutor.   He \"categorically den[ied] the\n\nstatements made by Mrs. Maria Antonina Paniagua-Ramos.\"       He\n\nconcluded his declaration by professing ignorance as to the\n\nidentity of the persons who served as jurors in the second trial\n\nand affirming that he had \"never delivered or received any\n\ndocuments from any jurors.\"\n\n           After reviewing the parties' submissions, the court\n\nreassembled the discharged jury and convened an evidentiary\n\nhearing.   The judge questioned each former juror individually,\n\nunder oath, and in the presence of both counsel.       The judge\n\nasked each one, in substance, whether he or she had had any\n\ncontact with Quiles, and whether he or she knew of any dealings\n\nbetween Quiles and any other member of the venire. 5     Without\n\n\n    5 A few examples illustrate the tenor of the inquiry. The\ncourt queried one juror as to whether she \"remember[ed] whether\nany juror ever talked to a prosecutor, a male prosecutor?\" The\ncourt asked another, \"Do you remember whether ever, at any point\nin time during that trial when you were not actually in the\ncourtroom, that anybody — . . . could have been an assistant\nU.S. attorney by the name of José Quiles — ever approached you\nor any other member of the jury to discuss anything about the\ncase?\"\n\n                              -15-\n\fexception, the former jurors answered these inquiries in the\n\nnegative.      After hearing arguments of counsel, the district\n\ncourt took the matter under advisement and, in due course,\n\ndenied Paniagua's motion.\n\n             We review a district court's denial of a motion for new\n\ntrial for abuse of discretion.         United States v. Huddleston, 194\n\nF.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir. 1999).        Similarly, we review claims that\n\na trial court failed to conduct an appropriate inquiry into\n\nallegations of jury taint for abuse of discretion.                     United\n\nStates v.     Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 258 (1st Cir. 1990).                 The\n\ntouchstone is reasonableness:         did the trial court fashion, and\n\nthen even-handedly implement, a sensible procedure reasonably\n\ncalculated to determine whether something untoward had occurred?\n\nSee   id.     We   measure    Paniagua's      asseveration   against     this\n\nbenchmark.\n\n             We begin with first principles:\n\n             The right to trial by jury in a criminal\n             case is an important feature of the justice\n             system.   In turn, the value of the right\n             consists principally in the neutrality of\n             the venire.     All would agree that an\n             impartial jury is an integral component of a\n             fair trial.   To preserve the integrity of\n             the process, trial courts must jealously\n             safeguard jurors' impartiality.\n\nNeron   v.   Tierney,   841   F.2d    1197,    1200-01   (1st   Cir.    1988)\n\n(citation omitted).     A principal purpose for such safeguards is\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fto    insulate     jurors   from   improper         ex   parte   contacts.        The\n\nproposition       that   private      communications        between     jurors    and\n\nprosecutors during the course of a criminal trial are absolutely\n\nforbidden     is    so   elementary      as    to    require     no    citation    of\n\nauthority.       This does not mean, however, that every assertion of\n\nforbidden     contact    must    be    accepted      as    gospel.      Experience\n\nteaches that such assertions are more easily made than proven.\n\nConsequently, any such assertion must be tested.\n\n             Trial courts have considerable latitude in determining\n\nhow   best   to    evaluate     such   assertions         and   thus   assure    jury\n\nimpartiality in particular cases.               See id. at 1201 (explaining\n\nthat \"within a given situation, a broad range of alternatives,\n\neach different from the others, may suffice to alleviate due\n\nprocess concerns\" in respect to claims of jury taint).                    In other\n\nwords, while a trial court has an unflagging duty adequately to\n\nprobe a nonfrivolous claim of jury taint, see Smith v. Phillips,\n\n455 U.S. 209, 215 (1982); Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227,\n\n229-30 (1954), the court has wide discretion to determine the\n\nscope of the resulting inquiry and the mode and manner in which\n\nit will be conducted.\n\n             Here, the measures taken by the district court in\n\naddressing Paniagua's claim of jury taint assured that the\n\npossibility of spoliation was satisfactorily explored and the\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\frecord    adequately   developed.          Despite   the     tardiness   of\n\nPaniagua's proffer, see supra note 4, the district court took\n\nhis allegations seriously.         The court ordered both sides to\n\nsubmit explanatory memoranda.       After receiving these responses,\n\nthe court took further steps:             it reassembled the jury and\n\nconducted an individualized voir dire, permitting counsel for\n\nboth sides to audit the jury interviews and make suggestions.\n\nThe court then found, based on the developed facts, that the\n\nevents described by Paniagua's sister had not occurred.\n\n           This balanced, well-thought-out process easily passes\n\nmuster.   While the court perhaps could have devised some other\n\nor different plan to test the credibility of the charge (say,\n\nordering Quiles and Paniagua's sister to testify in person and\n\nto undergo cross-examination), our case law makes clear that\n\nclaims of jury taint are almost always case-specific.            Thus, the\n\ntrial court — which is likely to have a superior \"feel\" for the\n\nnuances   of   the   case   —   ought   to   be   accorded    considerable\n\ndeference in fashioning procedures to deal with such matters.\n\nNeron, 841 F.2d at 1201.         Accordingly, we decline Paniagua's\n\ninvitation to second-guess the lower court's judgment as to what\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fmethodology was best calculated to get at the truth in this\n\ninstance.6\n\n          Paniagua has a fallback position. Leaving the district\n\ncourt's methodology to one side, he says that the court clearly\n\nerred in rejecting Maria Antonina Paniagua-Ramos's specific and\n\nunambiguous affidavit.     But a judge is not required to accept a\n\nfact as true simply because a witness swears to it.    See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Tipton, 3 F.3d 1119, 1122 (7th Cir. 1993).     In\n\nthis instance, the affiant's statement was rendered suspect both\n\nby her evident partiality and by the timing of the submission.\n\nIt was flatly contradicted by Quiles's declaration.      To cinch\n\nmatters, the juror interviews belied the affiant's accusations.\n\nConsequently, the court's finding that no compromising incident\n\noccurred is fully supportable.\n\n          The short of it is that Paniagua failed, despite having\n\nbeen given a fair opportunity, to establish the bona fides of\n\nhis claim of jury taint.    We hold, therefore, that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion either in developing a format\n\n\n\n     6\n     We reject Paniagua's contention that the trial court's\ninquiry was insufficient in light of Remmer, 347 U.S. 227.\nRemmer involved a situation in which the district court relied\non the Federal Bureau of Investigation to check out an instance\nof possible jury taint, determined that no taint existed based\nsolely on the results of that investigation, and excluded the\ndefendant from any role in the inquiry. See id. at 228. That\nis a far cry from what transpired here.\n\n                                -19-\n\ffor testing that claim or in denying Paniagua's second motion\n\nfor a new trial.\n\n                                       IV\n\n            We    need   go   no   further.   For   aught   that   appears,\n\nPaniagua was tried and convicted by a properly instructed jury,\n\nunspoiled    by    prosecutorial     misconduct.     His    conviction   and\n\nsentence must, therefore, be\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f",

The\n\ntrial judge must, of course, pull the laboring oar — but the\n\nparties have a corollary responsibility seasonably to apprise\n\nthe judge about what they think the jury should or should not be\n\ntold.

If, say, a trial court fails to\n\ninstruct a criminal jury on a basic point like the government's\n\nburden of proof or the presumption of the defendant's innocence,\n\nthe lack of a contemporaneous objection would not foreclose\n\nsearching appellate review.

Here, however, there is no such glaring omission.\n\nThe district court correctly (and emphatically) instructed the\n\njury about the government's burden of proof.              The court also\n\ninstructed   the    jurors    at   considerable     length     about   their\n\ncollective responsibility for evaluating the credibility of\n\nwitnesses.     To    cap     matters,     the   court   gave   a   specific\n\ninstruction about accomplice testimony, viz:\n\n                You have heard testimony of the\n         codefendant Rafael del Rosario.    This\n\n                                    -7-\n\f             witness has a cooperation agreement with the\n             government.   The testimony of Rafael del\n             Rosario was given in order for him to\n             hopefully receive a reduction in sentence on\n             act of his cooperation.\n\n                    In . . . evaluating testimony of a\n             cooperating witness, you should consider\n             whether   that   testimony   may   have  been\n             influenced by the government's promises and\n             you should consider that testimony with\n             greater caution than that of ordinary\n             witnesses.      Cooperation agreements are\n             lawful.    The law only requires that you\n             consider    testimony   given    under  those\n             circumstances with greater caution than that\n             of ordinary witnesses.\n\nWe do not suggest that this instruction is either letter perfect\n\nor insusceptible to any improvement.

There,       as     here,    the   appellant          contended    \"that   the\n\ndistrict         court    committed      plain       error    by    failing    to   give    a\n\ncautionary instruction (although not requested to do so) against\n\nconviction         upon    the       uncorroborated        testimony    of     an   alleged\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\faccomplice, who was a cooperating government witness.\"          Id. at\n\n117.   Jones argued, as does Paniagua, that whenever a conviction\n\nis based upon an accomplice's testimony and that testimony is\n\nuncorroborated or the evidence as to guilt is debatable, plain\n\nerror \"invariably results, unless the trial court (even in the\n\nabsence of request) specially instructs the jury to receive such\n\naccomplice testimony with caution and to require corroboration\n\nof it.\"   Id. at 118.   The court of appeals rejected this strait-\n\njacketed reading of the law, remarking that \"in the ordinary\n\ncourse of criminal trial, one would expect experienced counsel\n\nto request such an [accomplice] instruction should it be thought\n\ndesirable to have this express instruction to alert the jury to\n\nthe potential unreliability of the accomplice . . . testimony.\"\n\nId.    Placing the burden elsewhere, the court stated, would\n\n\"permit counsel, by knowing inaction, to trap a trial court into\n\nreversible omission of instruction.\"      Id. at 119.    As a result,\n\n\"the failure to give an instruction in the absence of request\n\nfor it may amount to plain error only in egregious instances.\"\n\nId.    Since the circumstances here hardly are egregious, Jones\n\nprovides no support for Paniagua's plaint.\n\n           Paniagua's   rejoinder   of   last   resort   is   that   the\n\nbelatedly challenged instruction denied him a fair trial because\n\nit ignored what he terms an \"established safeguard,\" namely, a\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fdirection to the jurors that they could not convict unless they\n\n\"believe    beyond      a    reasonable        doubt   that   [the   testifying]\n\naccomplice is telling the truth.\"                 Paniagua draws the quoted\n\nlanguage verbatim from a footnote in our opinion in Dailey, 759\n\nF.2d at 200 n.8.        Although the quotation is accurate, casting\n\nthe direction as an immutable obligation wrests the words from\n\ntheir    contextual     moorings         and   distorts   the    Dailey    court's\n\nmeaning.\n\n            In Dailey, the government appealed a pretrial order\n\nbarring it from using accomplice testimony at Dailey's trial.\n\n759 F.2d at 193.             The district court issued the bar order\n\nbecause it believed that the accomplices' plea agreements were\n\nso likely to incite perjurious testimony that allowing the\n\naccomplices to appear as witnesses would violate Dailey's right\n\nto a fair trial.        Id. at 194.        We reversed this order, holding\n\nthat    Dailey's    accomplices          should   be   permitted     to   testify,\n\nsubject to \"standard procedural safeguards.\"                    Id. at 200.    We\n\nrecounted   certain         of   those    safeguards    (e.g.,    \"[t]he    [plea]\n\nagreements should be read to the jury and made available during\n\nits deliberations; defense counsel [should be allowed to] cross-\n\nexamine the accomplices at length about the agreements; and the\n\njury    should     be   given     the     standard     cautionary    instruction\n\nconcerning the testimony of accomplices and a special cautionary\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\finstruction      concerning           the     nature     of   each      accomplice's\n\ncontingent agreement and the risk that it creates, particularly\n\nin   instances     where        the    accomplice's         testimony        cannot     be\n\ncorroborated\").         Id.    Along the way, we quoted extensively from\n\njury instructions actually used by a different district judge in\n\na    companion     case       and     concluded      that     those     instructions\n\n\"adequately admonishe[d] the jury to weigh [the accomplices']\n\ntestimony with the greatest of care.\"                     Id. at 200 n.8.             The\n\nphraseology      upon        which    Paniagua      relies     is     part     of     this\n\nrendition.\n\n            Read in context,            Dailey makes clear that the court\n\nconsidered the quoted instructions to be adequate.                           The court\n\ndid not, however, intimate that those precise instructions were\n\nobligatory.      Indeed, in many cases, the Dailey language will not\n\nbe appropriate.         It is bedrock principle that, in the ordinary\n\ncase, a jury need not believe every government witness beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt in order to conclude that the defendant is\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt — and Dailey did not venture to\n\nalter that principle.3              Nor did Dailey purport to constrain the\n\nusual     rule   that    a    trial    judge       has   considerable        leeway     in\n\n\n\n      3\n     Even so, where the accomplice's uncorroborated testimony is\nthe only evidence of guilt, an admonition that the testimony\nmust be believed beyond a reasonable doubt, if requested, would\nbe advisable to guide the jury's deliberations.\n\n                                            -12-\n\fchoosing the language that will best enable him or her to\n\nenlighten the jury as to a particular point.           Houlihan, 92 F.3d\n\nat 1299 n.31; Nivica, 887 F.2d at 1124.            Accordingly, we reject\n\nPaniagua's effort to convert an example into a mandate.\n\n            To sum up, the court's charge in this case adequately\n\ncovered the subject of accomplice testimony.                 Although there\n\nwere differences between the language used by the court and the\n\nlanguage that Paniagua now says he would have preferred, we fail\n\nto see how those differences depart            in a material way from\n\nstandards    established    in   our     precedents.          We    conclude,\n\ntherefore, that the absence of a contemporaneous objection dooms\n\nPaniagua's argument.       After all, the challenged instructions\n\ncontained no clear or obvious error and inflicted no blow to\n\nPaniagua's    substantial    rights.          In   these     circumstances,\n\npermitting    the   conviction   to   stand    does   not    come   close   to\n\nconstituting a miscarriage of justice.\n\n                                  III\n\n            Paniagua's remaining assignment of error focuses on the\n\ndenial of his motion for new trial.        He maintains that he raised\n\na colorable claim of jury taint; that the lower court's inquiry\n\ninto the issue was superficial; and that he was entitled, at the\n\nvery least, to a more rigorous investigation.               We do not agree.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f            The relevant facts are as follows.           On August 4, 1999\n\n— nearly a year after the jury verdict and nearly five months\n\nafter the imposition of sentence — Paniagua moved for a new\n\ntrial.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.        His motion incorporated, and\n\nrelied upon, a sworn statement from Paniagua's sister, Maria\n\nAntonina Paniagua-Ramos.          The statement, signed on July 30,\n\n1999,     related    that   the   affiant    had   attended    the      trial\n\nthroughout; that she had testified for the defense; and that she\n\nhad   become    thoroughly    familiar      with   the   jurors   and    the\n\nprosecutors.        The affiant went on to allege that, near the end\n\nof the trial, she observed two female jurors chatting with\n\nformer Assistant United States Attorney José A. Quiles in the\n\ncafeteria area of the courthouse; that the trio separated, but\n\none of the women soon returned and handed Quiles a document\n\n(perhaps a notebook); and that Quiles pocketed the document.\n\nBased on this alleged ex parte communication, Paniagua requested\n\na new trial.4\n\n            The United States objected to the motion and denied the\n\nfactual averments on which the motion was predicated.                    The\n\ndistrict court ordered both sides to file memoranda explicating\n\nwhat, if anything, Quiles may have said or done, and how (if at\n\n\n      4\n     Paniagua nowhere credibly explains why the affiant's\nobservations, allegedly made on August 24, 1998, were not\nreported to the court until almost a year later.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fall) his actions may have tainted the jury.   In responding, the\n\ngovernment filed, inter alia, a declaration in which Quiles (who\n\nhad served as the lead prosecutor during the first trial and the\n\nensuing appeal) stated, under the penalties of perjury, that he\n\nhad no role in the second trial and no contact with either the\n\ncase agent or the prosecutor.   He \"categorically den[ied] the\n\nstatements made by Mrs. Maria Antonina Paniagua-Ramos.\"       He\n\nconcluded his declaration by professing ignorance as to the\n\nidentity of the persons who served as jurors in the second trial\n\nand affirming that he had \"never delivered or received any\n\ndocuments from any jurors.\"\n\n           After reviewing the parties' submissions, the court\n\nreassembled the discharged jury and convened an evidentiary\n\nhearing.   The judge questioned each former juror individually,\n\nunder oath, and in the presence of both counsel.       The judge\n\nasked each one, in substance, whether he or she had had any\n\ncontact with Quiles, and whether he or she knew of any dealings\n\nbetween Quiles and any other member of the venire. 5     Without\n\n\n    5 A few examples illustrate the tenor of the inquiry. The\ncourt queried one juror as to whether she \"remember[ed] whether\nany juror ever talked to a prosecutor, a male prosecutor?\" The\ncourt asked another, \"Do you remember whether ever, at any point\nin time during that trial when you were not actually in the\ncourtroom, that anybody — . . . could have been an assistant\nU.S. attorney by the name of José Quiles — ever approached you\nor any other member of the jury to discuss anything about the\ncase?\"\n\n                              -15-\n\fexception, the former jurors answered these inquiries in the\n\nnegative.      After hearing arguments of counsel, the district\n\ncourt took the matter under advisement and, in due course,\n\ndenied Paniagua's motion.\n\n             We review a district court's denial of a motion for new\n\ntrial for abuse of discretion.         United States v. Huddleston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766478\"><a href=\"/opinion/766478/united-states-v-mark-e-huddleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (1st Cir. 1999).        Similarly, we review claims that\n\na trial court failed to conduct an appropriate inquiry into\n\nallegations of jury taint for abuse of discretion.                     United\n\nStates v.     Boylan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (1st Cir. 1990).                 The\n\ntouchstone is reasonableness:         did the trial court fashion, and\n\nthen even-handedly implement, a sensible procedure reasonably\n\ncalculated to determine whether something untoward had occurred?\n\nSee   id.     We   measure    Paniagua's      asseveration   against     this\n\nbenchmark.\n\n             We begin with first principles:\n\n             The right to trial by jury in a criminal\n             case is an important feature of the justice\n             system.   In turn, the value of the right\n             consists principally in the neutrality of\n             the venire.     All would agree that an\n             impartial jury is an integral component of a\n             fair trial.   To preserve the integrity of\n             the process, trial courts must jealously\n             safeguard jurors' impartiality.\n\nNeron   v.   Tierney,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503069\"><a href=\"/opinion/503069/louis-neron-v-james-e-tierney-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>    <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    1200-01   (1st   Cir.    1988)\n\n(citation omitted).     A principal purpose for such safeguards is\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fto    insulate     jurors   from   improper         ex   parte   contacts.        The\n\nproposition       that   private      communications        between     jurors    and\n\nprosecutors during the course of a criminal trial are absolutely\n\nforbidden     is    so   elementary      as    to    require     no    citation    of\n\nauthority.       This does not mean, however, that every assertion of\n\nforbidden     contact    must    be    accepted      as    gospel.      Experience\n\nteaches that such assertions are more easily made than proven.\n\nConsequently, any such assertion must be tested.\n\n             Trial courts have considerable latitude in determining\n\nhow   best   to    evaluate     such   assertions         and   thus   assure    jury\n\nimpartiality in particular cases.               See id. at 1201 (explaining\n\nthat \"within a given situation, a broad range of alternatives,\n\neach different from the others, may suffice to alleviate due\n\nprocess concerns\" in respect to claims of jury taint).                    In other\n\nwords, while a trial court has an unflagging duty adequately to\n\nprobe a nonfrivolous claim of jury taint, see Smith v. Phillips,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110645\"><a href=\"/opinion/110645/smith-v-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (1982); Remmer v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105202\"><a href=\"/opinion/105202/remmer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n229-30 (1954), the court has wide discretion to determine the\n\nscope of the resulting inquiry and the mode and manner in which\n\nit will be conducted.\n\n             Here, the measures taken by the district court in\n\naddressing Paniagua's claim of jury taint assured that the\n\npossibility of spoliation was satisfactorily explored and the\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\frecord    adequately   developed.          Despite   the     tardiness   of\n\nPaniagua's proffer, see supra note 4, the district court took\n\nhis allegations seriously.         The court ordered both sides to\n\nsubmit explanatory memoranda.       After receiving these responses,\n\nthe court took further steps:             it reassembled the jury and\n\nconducted an individualized voir dire, permitting counsel for\n\nboth sides to audit the jury interviews and make suggestions.\n\nThe court then found, based on the developed facts, that the\n\nevents described by Paniagua's sister had not occurred.\n\n           This balanced, well-thought-out process easily passes\n\nmuster.   While the court perhaps could have devised some other\n\nor different plan to test the credibility of the charge (say,\n\nordering Quiles and Paniagua's sister to testify in person and\n\nto undergo cross-examination), our case law makes clear that\n\nclaims of jury taint are almost always case-specific.            Thus, the\n\ntrial court — which is likely to have a superior \"feel\" for the\n\nnuances   of   the   case   —   ought   to   be   accorded    considerable\n\ndeference in fashioning procedures to deal with such matters.\n\nNeron, 841 F.2d at 1201.         Accordingly, we decline Paniagua's\n\ninvitation to second-guess the lower court's judgment as to what\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fmethodology was best calculated to get at the truth in this\n\ninstance.6\n\n          Paniagua has a fallback position. Leaving the district\n\ncourt's methodology to one side, he says that the court clearly\n\nerred in rejecting Maria Antonina Paniagua-Ramos's specific and\n\nunambiguous affidavit.     But a judge is not required to accept a\n\nfact as true simply because a witness swears to it.    See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Tipton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629033\"><a href=\"/opinion/629033/united-states-v-willie-j-tipton/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1122 (7th Cir. 1993).     In\n\nthis instance, the affiant's statement was rendered suspect both\n\nby her evident partiality and by the timing of the submission.\n\nIt was flatly contradicted by Quiles's declaration.      To cinch\n\nmatters, the juror interviews belied the affiant's accusations.\n\nConsequently, the court's finding that no compromising incident\n\noccurred is fully supportable.\n\n          The short of it is that Paniagua failed, despite having\n\nbeen given a fair opportunity, to establish the bona fides of\n\nhis claim of jury taint.    We hold, therefore, that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion either in developing a format\n\n\n\n     6\n     We reject Paniagua's contention that the trial court's\ninquiry was insufficient in light of Remmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105202\"><a href=\"/opinion/105202/remmer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nRemmer involved a situation in which the district court relied\non the Federal Bureau of Investigation to check out an instance\nof possible jury taint, determined that no taint existed based\nsolely on the results of that investigation, and excluded the\ndefendant from any role in the inquiry. See id. at 228. That\nis a far cry from what transpired here.\n\n                                -19-\n\ffor testing that claim or in denying Paniagua's second motion\n\nfor a new trial.\n\n                                       IV\n\n            We    need   go   no   further.   For   aught   that   appears,\n\nPaniagua was tried and convicted by a properly instructed jury,\n\nunspoiled    by    prosecutorial     misconduct.     His    conviction   and\n\nsentence must, therefore, be\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f</pre>",
