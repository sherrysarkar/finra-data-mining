Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Thomas F.\nKlumper, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\f                             November 20, 2001\n\n\n\n\n             Per Curiam. Alberto D. Sanchez-Alvarez appeals from\n\nthe   five-year       mandatory    minimum     sentence   he   received\n\nfollowing his guilty plea to one count of possession with\n\nintent to distribute heroin.           He claims that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying him the benefit of the safety valve\n\nprovision of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. See\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 5C1.2 and 2D1.1(b)(6).             Specifically, Alberto\n\nSanchez challenges the sentencing court’s finding that he\n\nfailed   to    meet    the    safety   valve    requirement    that    he\n\ntruthfully provide the government with all information and\n\nevidence he has concerning the offense. U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2.\n\nThe sentencing court found that Alberto Sanchez had not been\n\ncandid in his debriefing interview with U.S. Customs agents\n\nand   that    his    testimony    at   the   sentencing   hearing     was\n\nuntruthful.\n\n             “We review for clear error the factual findings\n\nunderlying     the    district    court’s    determination     that   the\n\nsafety valve was unavailable.” United States v. Woods, 210\n\nF.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir. 2000). The record indicates that\n\nfollowing an evidentiary hearing at which defense counsel\n\ncross-examined the government’s two witnesses and argued\n\fvigorously in favor of the application of the safety valve\n\nprovision, the district court, after carefully considering\n\nall the evidence, determined that the provision did not\n\napply because Alberto Sanchez had not been truthful.            That\n\nfinding is amply supported by the record evidence.          Under\n\nthese circumstances, the sentencing court did not err in\n\ndenying Alberto Sanchez the benefit of the safety valve\n\nprovision. See United States v. White, 119 F.3d 70, 74 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n             Alberto Sanchez objects that the district court\n\nshould not have permitted U.S. Customs Agent Richard Roark\n\nto testify at the sentencing hearing about the meaning of\n\nencoded language used in a recorded telephone conversation\n\nbetween Alberto Sanchez and a co-defendant because Agent\n\nRoark was not qualified as an expert. Appellant’s reliance\n\nupon Fed.R.Evid. 702 is misplaced.         “The Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence do not pertain during the sentencing phase of a\n\ncriminal trial.” United States v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104,\n\n108 (1st Cir. 1998).    Moreover, “[e]ven in a trial setting,\n\nwe   often   have   permitted   law   enforcement   officers,   not\n\nformally trained as ‘experts,’ to furnish opinions based on\n\ntheir real-world experience.” Id.        Agent Roark’s testimony\n\neasily satisfied the Sentencing Guidelines’ requirement that\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fit possess “sufficient indicia of reliability to support its\n\nprobable accuracy.” U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3(a).     Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in considering his testimony in\n\nsentencing Alberto Sanchez.\n\n         Alberto Sanchez’ sentence is affirmed. See Loc. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f",
