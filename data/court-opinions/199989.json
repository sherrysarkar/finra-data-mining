Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Sylvain Nicolas on brief pro se.\n     Sheldon Whitehouse, Attorney General, and Richard B. Woolley,\nDeputy Chief, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            May 3, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam.     Sylvain   Nicolas   appeals   from the\n\ndistrict court’s order granting the defendants’ motion to\n\ndismiss his civil rights complaint for failure to state a\nclaim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).    Nicolas alleged that the State\n\nof Rhode Island and Lisa Holley, in her official capacity as\n\nChairperson of the Board of Parole, and individually, violated\nhis due process and equal protection rights when, at his parole\nhearing, Holley asked Nicolas if he practiced a lot of voodoo\n\nand black magic.\n\n            We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P.\n12(b)(6).   Chute v. Walker, 281 F.3d 314, 318 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nWe must accept the well pled facts of the complaint as true and\nindulge every reasonable inference in favor of allowing the\nlawsuit to proceed.       See North Bridge Associates, Inc. v.\n\nBoldt, 274 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2001).         \"Bald assertions,\nunsupportable conclusions, periphrastic circumlocution, and the\nlike,\" on the other hand can safely be ignored.     See Aulson v.\n\nBlanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Having conducted this review, we conclude that the\ndistrict court’s finding that claims for damages against the\nState of Rhode Island and against Lisa Holley in her official\ncapacity and individual capacity should be dismissed is correct\n\nfor essentially the reasons stated in the magistrate judge's\nreport and recommendation.\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f            We add that Nicolas' claims for declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief were also properly dismissed.                       Though the\n\ndistrict    court   and    the       magistrate      judge     did   not   address\nNicolas’ request for a declaratory judgment, Nicolas did not\n\nraise this omission in his objection to the magistrate’s report\n\nor raise this issue in his initial brief on appeal.                          In his\nreply brief, he makes a single reference to the request for a\n\ndeclaratory     judgment        in    his       summary   of     relief    sought.\n\nAccordingly, he has not adequately preserved this request for\n\nrelief,    as   failure    to    raise      a     particular     objection      to   a\n\nmagistrate’s report waives that claim, Park Motor Mart, Inc. v.\n\nFord Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603, 604-05 (1st Cir. 1980), and\n\narguments may not be raised for the first time in a reply\nbrief, North American Specialty Ins. Co. v. Lapalme, 258 F.3d\n\n35, 45 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            The district court also did not address Nicolas’\nrequest for \"relief\" from the correctional institution so he\n\ncould be \"deported.\" Because Nicolas cannot obtain relief that\nwould shorten his term of imprisonment through a § 1983 action\n\nbut must seek such relief through a habeas petition, this claim\n\nwas also properly dismissed.             Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477,\n\n480 (1994) (explaining Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475\n\n(1973)).\n\n            Finally,      accepting         the    well   pled    facts    of    the\n\ncomplaint as true and indulging every reasonable inference in\n\nfavor of allowing the lawsuit to proceed, we conclude that\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fNicolas has not stated a claim of the denial of his rights to\n\ndue process or equal protection.\n\n          Accordingly, the district court’s order dismissing\nthe complaint for failure to state a claim is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -4-\n\f",
