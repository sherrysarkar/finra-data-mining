Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Jose M. Ramirez on brief pro se.\r\n   Michael C. Donahue, M. Christine Breslin and Gelerman, Cashman\r\n&amp; Donahue on brief for appellees.\r\n\nAugust 31, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Pro se plaintiff Jose Ramirez, a federal\r\nprisoner, appeals a district court judgment that dismissed his\r\n42 U.S.C.  1983 complaint against Cornell Corrections, Inc.\r\nand its employee, officer Dino Giorgio, for the failure to\r\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.  See Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).  Plaintiff has neither alleged nor argued\r\nthat he lacks an adequate state law remedy; thus he may not\r\nmaintain an action for the violation of his right to due\r\nprocess under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See, e.g.,\r\nRomero-Barcelo v. Hernandez-Agosto, 75 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); Watson v. Caton, 984 F.2d 537, 540-41 (1st Cir. 1993). \r\nHis allegations also fall well short of stating a claim under\r\nthe Eighth Amendment.  See, e.g., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.\r\n825, 834 (1994); Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298-303\r\n(1991). Plaintiff has waived any Fourth Amendment claim by\r\nfailing to argue same on appeal.\r\n          The remaining arguments that appellant asserts on\r\nappeal are patently meritless.  Accordingly, the judgment of\r\nthe district court is affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\n",
