Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Frank A. Rubino on brief for appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Camille Velez-Rive,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Jose A. Quiles-Espinosa,\r\nSenior Litigation Counsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nAugust 11, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in considering, inter alia, the polygraph test\r\nresults in determining whether defendant met the requirements\r\nof U.S.S.G.  5C1.2(5).  See U.S.S.G.  6A1.3(a); see alsoUnited States v. Santiago-Gonzalez, 66 F.3d 3, 7 n.1 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  In any event, defendant did not raise before the\r\ndistrict court the broad claim that polygraph results are per\r\nse inadmissible, and so that claim is forfeited and may not be\r\nraised on appeal.  Further, in light of all the evidence about\r\ndefendant's debriefings, the district court did not clearly err\r\nin denying defendant safety valve relief.  See United States v.\r\nMontanez, 82 F.3d 520, 523 (1st Cir. 1996).  And we perceive no\r\nbasis whatsoever for defendant's claim that the government\r\nbreached the plea agreement.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
