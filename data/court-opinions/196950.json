Appellant-defendant  Kofi  Dodi (\"Dodi\")\r                    Per  Curiam.\r\n\nappeals   the  district  court's   decision  granting  defendant-\r\n\nappellant The Putnam Companies (\"Putnam\") summary judgment.  Dodi\r\n\nhad  filed suit under Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    2000e-3(a),  and Mass.  Gen.  L. ch.  151B  alleging\r\n\ndiscrimination on  account of his race and national origin and/or\r\n\nretaliation for filing a charge with the Massachusetts Commission\r\n\nAgainst  Discrimination (\"MCAD\").   The two issues  before us are\r\n\nwhether the court below abused  its discretion in striking Dodi's\r\n\ntwo  affidavits  and  portions   of  his  Opposition  to  Summary\r\n\nJudgment; and whether it erred  in granting the summary judgment.\r\n\nFor the reasons stated herein, we affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We recite the following  facts, drawn from the district\r\n\ncourt  Memorandum and Order, in  the light most  favorable to the\r\n\nnonmovant.  Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Green, 76 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n19, 21 (1st Cir. 1996).  Dodi is  a United States citizen who was\r\n\nborn in Ghana and is black.  He began working for Putnam in 1984,\r\n\nand by 1987 was part of the Tax and Compliance unit.  In December\r\n\n1989  or January 1990, the  department was reorganized.   A white\r\n\nfemale, Michelle Whalen (\"Whalen\"),  was appointed Manager of the\r\n\nTax and Compliance unit, a position Dodi desired, and which title\r\n\nhe  maintains was his  prior to  the reorganization  and Whalen's\r\n\nappointment.  Dodi  complained to several individuals,  including\r\n\nRobert Lucey, President  of Putnam Investor  Services.  After  he\r\n\ncomplained, Dodi was made the IRS Technical Manager:  he contends\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nthat  his appointment  was  an effective  demotion, while  Putnam\r\n\nlabels it a lateral move.  \r\n\n          In May  1990, Dodi filed  a charge  with MCAD  alleging\r\n\nthat he was demoted  and denied promotion on account  of his race\r\n\nand national  origin.  After he  filed the charge, his  rating in\r\n\nhis  performance  reviews  declined  --  his  rating  dropped  to\r\n\n\"unsatisfactory\" -- and the reviews suggested increased hostility\r\n\nbetween  Dodi and  his supervisors.   Dodi  contends that  he was\r\n\nexcluded from  meetings and isolated from  the department because\r\n\nof the complaint.  Putnam fired  Dodi in March 1991, roughly  ten\r\n\nmonths after the filing of the MCAD complaint.  He filed a second\r\n\ncomplaint  in June 1991, alleging that  he was terminated because\r\n\nof his race and national origin, or in retaliation for filing the\r\n\n1990 complaint, or both.  \r\n\n          MCAD dismissed the two complaints in December 1992, for\r\n\nlack  of probable  cause, a  decision it  affirmed in  January of\r\n\n1993.  Dodi filed a civil action in Massachusetts Superior Court,\r\n\nwhich  Putnam removed to the Federal District Court.  The parties\r\n\nmade  discovery requests  and took depositions.   Putnam  filed a\r\n\nmotion  for summary judgment, which Dodi opposed.  In  June 1995,\r\n\nPutnam  moved to strike portions of  Dodi's Opposition to Summary\r\n\nJudgment (the \"Opposition\").   Dodi's opposition to the motion to\r\n\nstrike  contained  an  affidavit  (the  \"first  affidavit\")  with\r\n\nattachments.    At a  hearing in  July  1995, the  district court\r\n\ngranted Putnam's motion to  strike portions of Dodi's Opposition,\r\n\nand struck the first affidavit on its own initiative.  It granted\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nDodi's request for permission  to submit supplemental information\r\n\nin support of the stricken statements in the Opposition.  In late\r\n\nJuly  Dodi  filed  a  supplemental submission  in  opposition  to\r\n\nPutnam's  motion  to  strike,  including  another affidavit  (the\r\n\n\"second affidavit\").    In August,  Putnam  moved to  strike  the\r\n\nsecond affidavit, and in October 1995, the district court granted\r\n\nPutnam's motion for summary judgment and its motion to strike the\r\n\nsecond affidavit.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                       STRICKEN SUBMISSIONS\r                                 STRICKEN SUBMISSIONS\r\n\n          We begin  with Dodi's argument that  the district court\r\n\nerred in  striking the  affidavits and  his Opposition  since, if\r\n\nthey were admissible, they would form part of the record on which\r\n\nthe summary judgment  would be  evaluated.  See  Fed. R. Civ.  P.\r                                                         \r\n\n56(c).  We  review the  district court's decision  to strike  for\r\n\nabuse of  discretion.  See  Green, 76 F.3d  at 23 (\"The  district\r                                           \r\n\ncourt has broad authority  to prescribe the evidentiary materials\r\n\nit  will consider in  deciding a motion  for summary judgment.\");\r\n\nsee also Ramsdell v. Brooks, 64  F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1995), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied sub nom. Ramsdell v. Machias Savings Bank,    U.S.   , 116\r                                                          \r\n\nS.  Ct. 913  (1996); New  England Anti-Vivisection  Soc. v.  U.S.\r                                                                           \r\n\nSurgical Corp., 889 F.2d 1198, 1204 (1st Cir. 1989).  \r                        \r\n\n          Under the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure, affidavits\r\n\n\"shall be made  on personal  knowledge, set forth  such facts  as\r\n\nwould  be admissible  in evidence,  and shall  show affirmatively\r\n\nthat  the affiant is competent  to testify to  the matters stated\r\n\ntherein.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  Accordingly, if the affidavits\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nand Opposition Dodi  submitted did not  meet these criteria,  the\r\n\ndistrict court can hardly have  abused its discretion in striking\r\n\nthem.  Cf.  Posadas de Puerto Rico, Inc. v.  Radin, 856 F.2d 399,\r                                                            \r\n\n401 (1st Cir. 1988) (affirming that affidavit which does not meet\r\n\nthe Rule 56 specificity  requirement is insufficient to establish\r\n\na genuine  issue for trial);  FDIC v. Rold n  Fonseca,   795 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1102, 1110 (1st Cir. 1986) (holding that where receipts submitted\r\n\nto   support   opposition   to   summary   judgment   constituted\r\n\ninadmissible hearsay, party failed to comply with Rule 56(e)).  \r\n\n          Having briefly  set out our standard of  review and the\r\n\nrelevant legal  framework, we turn  to the particulars  of Dodi's\r\n\nargument.   As the parties have  addressed the stricken documents\r\n\naccording to subject, we follow suit.1\r\n\n          Imitation of Dodi's Accent:   The district court struck\r                                              \r\n\nDodi's statement  in his Opposition that  William McGue, Putnam's\r\n\nManaging Director, and Robert Frazer, a  white manager, \"made fun\r\n\nof  Dodi's accent, and imitated him at meetings and during casual\r\n\nconversations.\"    Dodi seeks  to rely  on  a paragraph  from his\r\n\nsecond affidavit  in support of  his assertion.   We do  not find\r\n\nthat the district court abused  its discretion in striking either\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  In the course of his argument, Dodi several times invites this\r\ncourt  to review his affidavits  as a whole  to determine whether\r\nthey  should have  been struck  and whether  there is  admissible\r\nevidence included in them.  He does not, however, attempt to cull\r\nout  the admissible  portions or  cite any  authority.   We find,\r\ntherefore,  that  except   for  the   portions  he   specifically\r\ndiscusses,  he has waived his  argument that the  affidavits as a\r\nwhole are  admissible, as arguments made  perfunctorily on appeal\r\nwith no developed  argument or  support are deemed  waived.   See\r                                                                           \r\nUnited  States v.  Zannino,  895 F.2d  1,  17 (1st  Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                           \r\ndenied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990).  \r                \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nthe  statement from the Opposition or the paragraph in the second\r\n\naffidavit.   The statements in  the paragraph are  conclusory and\r\n\nlack specificity.  Moreover, even if it were error to exclude the\r\n\nevidence, it  would  be  harmless, for  the  imitation  does  not\r\n\nsupport Dodi's claim of retaliation, and as discussed below, that\r\n\nis the only cause of action remaining on appeal.\r\n\n          Merit  Raises:     The  district  court  struck  Dodi's\r                                 \r\n\nstatement in  the Opposition  that he \"received  raises based  on\r\n\nmerit,\"  on the basis that there  was nothing in the record as to\r\n\nwhat \"merit\"  meant, or  how and on  what basis such  raises were\r\n\ngiven.   Dodi  claims that  statements from  the stricken  second\r\n\naffidavit provide such verified information.  He also points to a\r\n\ncomputer   printout  entitled  \"Salary,  Increase  &amp;  Performance\r\n\nHistory  Screen\" which the district  court struck as  part of the\r\n\nfirst affidavit, as well  as a memorandum sent to  him from James\r\n\nSwinney, a Senior Vice President, dated January 2, 1990.  We find\r\n\nthat  the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking\r\n\nthese documents.\r\n\n          Dodi claims that all three meet the requirements to  be\r\n\na  business   record  exception  to   the  hearsay  rule.     The\r\n\nrequirements for the exception are clear:  a \"memorandum, report,\r\n\nrecord or data compilation, in any form\" is admissible so long as\r\n\nit is\r\n\n            made  at or  near  the time  by, or  from\r\n            information transmitted by, a person with\r\n            knowledge, if  kept  in the  course of  a\r\n            regularly  conducted  business  activity,\r\n            and  if it  was  the regular  practice of\r\n            that  business  activity   to  make   the\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n            memorandum,   report,  record,   or  data\r\n            compilation,   all   as   shown  by   the\r\n            testimony  of  the  custodian   or  other\r\n            qualified witness . . . .\r\n\nFed.  R. Evid.  803(6); see,  e.g.,  E.E.O.C. v.  Alton Packaging\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp., 901 F.2d 920, 926 (11th Cir. 1990).  Dodi has not provided\r               \r\n\nthe required  foundation for these three documents.   First, Dodi\r\n\nmisunderstands  the application  of  the rule,  which applies  to\r\n\nmemoranda,  reports, and  record  or data  compilation, not  oral\r\n\nstatements, in claiming  that it covers  oral statements made  to\r\n\nhim  and mentioned in the  second affidavit.   Second, as for the\r\n\ncomputer printout, Dodi's statement that in his experience, \"such\r\n\ndocuments are  routinely generated  by Defendant in  the ordinary\r\n\ncourse  of  its  business\" falls  far  short  of  laying out  the\r\n\nfoundation Rule 803(6) requires.  That it was provided to Dodi in\r\n\ndiscovery  does not save it.  Third,  Dodi has also failed to lay\r\n\nout  the foundation for the memorandum from Swinney:  although he\r\n\nsays he received it  in the normal course of business  on January\r\n\n2, 1990, and that it was generated and maintained in the ordinary\r\n\ncourse of business, we agree with Putnam that there is no support\r\n\nfor these claims.\r\n\n          Dodi faces similar  foundational issues with his  claim\r\n\nthat  the documents are also admissible as party admissions under\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).  He has, to put it briefly, failed to\r\n\nshow that the statements he cites to were made by Putnam's \"agent\r\n\nor servant concerning a matter within  the scope of the agency or\r\n\nemployment, made during the existence of the relationship.\"  Fed.\r\n\nR. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).   Mere  assertion that they  were so  made\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ndoes not suffice.\r\n\n          Even if  some of these statements  had been admissible,\r\n\nhowever, the  court still would  not have  abused its  discretion\r\n\nsince, as Dodi notes  in his brief, the court  based its decision\r\n\nin part on the fact that there  was no basis in the record as  to\r\n\nwhat  \"merit\"  meant.    In  the  cited  portion  of  his  second\r\n\naffidavit, Dodi  notes that instructors from  the human resources\r\n\ntraining  department told him that \"the Putnam policy was to give\r\n\nmerit  raises  as  a   reward  for  satisfactory  performance  by\r\n\nemployees.\"   This statement is clearly not  admissible under the\r\n\nbusiness record exception,  as he  claims, since it  was an  oral\r\n\nstatement.  Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) (applicable to  \"[a] memorandum,\r\n\nreport,  record,  or  data compilation\").    Nor  is  it a  party\r\n\nadmission,   since  he   has  not   addressed   the  foundational\r\n\nrequirements laid out in the rule itself. \r\n\n          EEO-1 Report:  Next Dodi argues that the district court\r                                \r\n\nerred  in striking  a  1993  EEO-1  report  of  Putnam,  and  the\r\n\ncorresponding  portion of  the first  affidavit, which  he claims\r\n\nevidences that  he reasonably believed  that race  discrimination\r\n\nexisted.  In his support he notes that the report was provided in\r\n\ndiscovery, that Putnam is required by law to produce such reports\r\n\n(Dodi  does not  specify what  law), and  that it  is a  true and\r\n\naccurate copy of  the document Putnam provided Dodi.   We fail to\r\n\nsee  how  the fact  that a  document  was presented  in discovery\r\n\nsuffices  to authenticate  the document  or lay  the foundational\r\n\nrequirements of Rule 803(6)  or Rule 801(d)(2)(D).  At  any rate,\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\neven if the  district court  erred, it would  have been  harmless\r\n\nerror,  since, as Dodi notes, this evidence goes to his prejudice\r\n\nclaim, not his  retaliation cause  of action, which  is his  sole\r\n\nremaining cause of action.\r\n\n          Swinney  Memorandum:   Dodi  submitted a  memorandum he\r                                       \r\n\nwrote to  Swinney, dated December  26, 1989, to show  that he had\r\n\ncomplained  about  his treatment,  in  connection  with his  race\r\n\ndiscrimination claim.   The district court  struck the memorandum\r\n\non hearsay  grounds; we agree  that the necessary  foundation was\r\n\nmissing.  Dodi's  citation of the fact that Putnam is required to\r\n\ngenerate  and maintain a personnel file on its employees does not\r\n\nsubstitute  for   the  witness   testimony  required  to   lay  a\r\n\nfoundation.  Fed. R. Evid. 803(6).  However, Dodi also notes that\r\n\nthe memorandum  is being used, in part, not to prove the truth of\r\n\nthe matters  asserted, but to demonstrate that Dodi complained of\r\n\nthe subjectivity  of his performance evaluations,  in the context\r\n\nof  opposition to perceived race  discrimination.  But  this is a\r\n\ndistinction without a difference, since  there is no dispute that\r\n\nDodi protested against perceived  racism at Putnam.  Nonetheless,\r\n\nbecause  Swinney  was involved  in  Dodi's  termination and  thus\r\n\nDodi's retaliation  claim, we  shall consider the  memorandum for\r\n\nthis  limited purpose in our review of the district court's grant\r\n\nof summary judgment.\r\n\n          $10,000 Pay Disparity:  Dodi next contests the district\r                                         \r\n\ncourt's decision to strike  a series of statements  which alleged\r\n\nthat for  several years Dodi was paid a salary well below that of\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nwhite  individuals, until  he complained.   The court  struck the\r\n\nstatements as  conclusory.  Having reviewed  the cited deposition\r\n\npages  and statements from the second affidavit, we find no abuse\r\n\nof discretion in the  ruling.  Indeed, we agree  with Putnam that\r\n\nDodi's deposition does not support the premise  that he perceived\r\n\nit  as  a  race-based  discrepancy  in  wages,  but  rather  that\r\n\nallegation  seems  to arise  only  after the  motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment has appeared on the horizon.   See Colantuoni  v. Alfred\r                                                                           \r\n\nCalcagni &amp;  Sons, Inc., 44 F.3d  1, 45 (1st Cir.  1994) (\"When an\r                                \r\n\ninterested  witness  has  given  clear   answers  to  unambiguous\r\n\nquestions,  he  cannot  create  a  conflict  and  resist  summary\r\n\njudgment  with an  affidavit that  is clearly  contradictory, but\r\n\ndoes not give a satisfactory explanation of why the testimony has\r\n\nchanged.\").    Further,  any  error  would  be harmless,  as  the\r\n\nevidence  of a pay disparity  does not tend  to prove retaliatory\r\n\naction, but rather  goes to  the discrimination  claim waived  on\r\n\nappeal.  \r\n\n          Qualifications  of Michelle Whalen:   Dodi contests the\r                                                      \r\n\ndistrict  court's  decision  to  strike  portions  of  statements\r\n\nalleging that  although Whalen was  given a higher  position than\r\n\nDodi, she  was less  qualified for the  position than Dodi.   The\r\n\ncited deposition pages offer no evidence other than it was Dodi's\r\n\nbelief that  Whalen was less qualified,  and inadmissible hearsay\r\n\nthat  she was management's choice.   Dodi now  points to excerpts\r\n\nfrom Whalen's personnel file and the  job description, which have\r\n\nnot been stricken, to support his position; Putnam in turn points\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nout  that the  promotion was based  on managerial  abilities, not\r\n\njust  narrow technical expertise, and that Dodi fell far short of\r\n\nWhalen  in the former  category, even if he  surpassed her in the\r\n\nlatter.  \r\n\n          We  need  not  address  this debate,  for  even  if the\r\n\ndistrict court  erred in striking  the statements, the  error was\r\n\nharmless.  First, the evidence of whether Whalen was more or less\r\n\nqualified  than Dodi goes to the waived discrimination claim, and\r\n\nnot  to the retaliation claim discussed below.  Second, we remind\r\n\nDodi of our  repeated holding that \"[c]ourts may not sit as super\r\n\npersonnel  departments,  assessing  the  merits --  or  even  the\r\n\nrationality   --   of   employers'   nondiscriminatory   business\r\n\ndecisions.\"  Mesnick v.

However, once again,\r\n\nthe fact that Putnam  provided the document to Dodi  in discovery\r\n\ndoes  not establish its authenticity, and the fact that Putnam is\r\n\nrequired  to generate  and maintain  a personnel  file, providing\r\n\nemployees   a  copy  of  it  on  demand,  does  not  fulfill  the\r\n\nfoundational  requirements of  either Rule  801(d)(2)(D) or  Rule\r\n\n803(6), as simply set out in those rules.  The district court did\r\n\nnot abuse its discretion in striking the memorandum.\r\n\n          Pattern of  Isolation:  In his  Opposition, Dodi claims\r                                         \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthat after he complained about the reorganization, Jeff Levering,\r\n\nto  whom  Dodi was  supposed  to  report, \"altered  his  behavior\r\n\ntowards Dodi, . . .  no longer said positive things about  Dodi's\r\n\njob  performance, and . . . avoided  talking with Dodi.\"  He also\r\n\nalleges  that he was ostracized,  kept out of  meetings, and that\r\n\nhis co-workers \"ceased interacting\" with him.  The district court\r\n\nstruck the opinions as opinion and characterizations.  Our review\r\n\nof the  cited  pages  from  Dodi's  depositions  and  the  second\r\n\naffidavit yields no grounds to find the district court abused its\r\n\ndiscretion  in striking  the  statements.    Dodi does  not  give\r\n\nspecific  incidents, place them in  time, or give  a yardstick by\r\n\nwhich  to measure either the  timeliness of his  reviews or their\r\n\ncontent  -- indeed,  while he  repeatedly discusses  the supposed\r\n\ncontent of  Levering's weekly  status reports, he  never actually\r\n\nrefers to one.\r\n\n          Failure to Provide Staff:  Dodi challenges the district\r                                            \r\n\ncourt's decision to strike from the Opposition the statement that\r\n\nPutnam \"failed  to give Dodi  the permanent staff  he requested.\"\r\n\nWe find no abuse of discretion here, as Dodi cited no support for\r\n\nthe statement in his Opposition.  See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n895 F.2d  46, 49 (1st Cir.  1990).  Indeed, we  agree with Putnam\r\n\nthat, even if  admitted as within Dodi's personal knowledge, Fed.\r\n\nR. Civ.  P. 56(e), at best this statement can show only that Dodi\r\n\ndid not  get all the resources  he requested:  Dodi  points to no\r\n\nevidence  regarding Putnam's treatment  of analogous request made\r\n\nby  non-minority employees, or  employees who had  not filed MCAD\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ncomplaints,  besides his  own assertion  that \"other  departments\r\n\nunder McGue\" were fully staffed.\r\n\n          Other stricken statements:  The district court properly\r                                             \r\n\nstruck  the  statement that  McGue  \"failed to  provide  Dodi the\r\n\nsupplies and  materials necessary\" to become  more visible within\r\n\nthe  organization, as  instructed.   The  cited deposition  pages\r\n\noffer no admissible support for the  proposition, and the passage\r\n\nhe  cites  from the  second  affidavit  constitutes argument  and\r\n\nhearsay.   Again,  however, we  note that  even if  admitted, the\r\n\nstatement would at most have shown that Dodi did not  get all the\r\n\nsupplies he requested, since he does not point to evidence of the\r\n\ntreatment  of other,  non-minority or  non-complaining employees.\r\n\nMerely pointing  out that other departments  received printers or\r\n\nthe like tells us very little.  \r\n\n          Finally,  Dodi   objects  to   the  striking   of  four\r\n\nstatements to the  effect that  after he made  his complaint  his\r\n\nwork was reviewed in  a less timely manner, he  stopped receiving\r\n\npositive  feedback or necessary  information, and other employees\r\n\nreceived  instructions to  keep  tabs  on  his actions  and  note\r\n\neverything he  did.  After review of  the cited passages from his\r\n\ndeposition and  the second affidavit,  we find that  the district\r\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in striking the passages.\r\n\n                         SUMMARY JUDGMENT\r                                   SUMMARY JUDGMENT\r\n\n          Dodi references his cause of action for termination due\r\n\nto race or national origin in his statement  of issues, but makes\r\n\nno more than the most  cursory reference to it in his  brief, and\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nmakes  no attempt at a developed argument that the district court\r\n\nerred in granting summary judgment on the claim.  Accordingly, we\r\n\ndeem  it waived, Zannino,  895 F.2d at 17,  and only consider his\r                                  \r\n\nargument  that  the  district  court erred  in  granting  summary\r\n\njudgment on his claim  that he was retaliated against  because of\r\n\nhis opposition to discrimination.\r\n\n          \"We  review a grant of summary judgment de novo and are\r\n\nguided by  the same criteria  as the  district court; a  grant of\r\n\nsummary  judgment  cannot  stand  on appeal  'unless  the  record\r\n\ndiscloses no trialworthy  issue of material  fact and the  moving\r\n\nparty is  entitled to judgment as  a matter of law.'\"   Green, 76\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at  23, quoting Alexis  v.

Our case law offers no doubt that in retaliation\r\nclaims,  the McDonnell  Douglas  analysis requires  a showing  of\r                                         \r\npretext.  See, e.g., Grant, 55 F.3d at 7; Greenberg v.

Thus the court  moved to the third step of  the analysis,\r\n\nwhere  it found that Dodi  could not show  that Putnam's asserted\r\n\nreason was pretextual.\r\n\n          We  also doubt that Dodi  can make a  prima facie case.\r\n\nHowever,  even assuming  that  Dodi could  meet  the prima  facie\r\n\nrequirement,  and  acknowledging that  Putnam  has  articulated a\r\n\nreason for the dismissal, we find that Dodi cannot meet the third\r\n\nrequirement of the McDonnell Douglas analysis.  Put  simply, even\r                                              \r\n\ngiven  the benefit  of  all inferences,  he  has not  shown  that\r\n\nPutnam's asserted  reason  was false,  much  less that  its  real\r\n\nmotivation was retaliation.   Like the district court before  us,\r\n\nwe have found no evidence on this record which supports a finding\r\n\nthat  his evaluations were inaccurate, or which reveals that Dodi\r\n\nwas treated differently than his non-minority  or non-complaining\r\n\ncounterparts.

Dodi had filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a), and Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  151B alleging discrimination on account of his race and national origin and/or retaliation for filing a charge with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\").  The two issues before us are whether the court below abused its discretion in striking Dodi's two affidavits and portions of his Opposition to Summary Judgment;  and whether it erred in granting the summary judgment.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the following facts, drawn from the district court Memorandum and Order, in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.   Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Green, 76 F.3d 19, 21 (1st Cir.1996).  Dodi is a United States citizen who was born in Ghana and is black.  He began working for Putnam in 1984, and by 1987 was part of the Tax and Compliance unit.  In December 1989 or January 1990, the department was reorganized.  A white female, Michelle Whalen (\"Whalen\"), was appointed Manager of the Tax and Compliance unit, a position Dodi desired, and which title he maintains was his prior to the reorganization and Whalen's appointment.  Dodi complained to several individuals, including Robert Lucey, President of Putnam Investor Services.  After he complained, Dodi was made the IRS Technical Manager:  he contends that his appointment was an effective demotion, while Putnam labels it a lateral move.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1990, Dodi filed a charge with MCAD alleging that he was demoted and denied promotion on account of his race and national origin.  After he filed the charge, his rating in his performance reviews declined--his rating dropped to \"unsatisfactory\"--and the reviews suggested increased hostility between Dodi and his supervisors.  Dodi contends that he was excluded from meetings and isolated from the department because of the complaint.  Putnam fired Dodi in March 1991, roughly ten months after the filing of the MCAD complaint.  He filed a second complaint in June 1991, alleging that he was terminated because of his race and national origin, or in retaliation for filing the 1990 complaint, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCAD dismissed the two complaints in December 1992, for lack of probable cause, a decision it affirmed in January of 1993.  Dodi filed a civil action in Massachusetts Superior Court, which Putnam removed to the Federal District Court.  The parties made discovery requests and took depositions.  Putnam filed a motion for summary judgment, which Dodi opposed.  In June 1995, Putnam moved to strike portions of Dodi's Opposition to Summary Judgment (the \"Opposition\").  Dodi's opposition to the motion to strike contained an affidavit (the \"first affidavit\") with attachments.  At a hearing in July 1995, the district court granted Putnam's motion to strike portions of Dodi's Opposition, and struck the first affidavit on its own initiative.  It granted Dodi's request for permission to submit supplemental information in support of the stricken statements in the Opposition.  In late July Dodi filed a supplemental submission in opposition to Putnam's motion to strike, including another affidavit (the \"second affidavit\").  In August, Putnam moved to strike the second affidavit, and in October 1995, the district court granted Putnam's motion for summary judgment and its motion to strike the second affidavit.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STRICKEN SUBMISSIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Dodi's argument that the district court erred in striking the affidavits and his Opposition since, if they were admissible, they would form part of the record on which the summary judgment would be evaluated.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  We review the district court's decision to strike for abuse of discretion.   See Green, 76 F.3d at 23 (\"The district court has broad authority to prescribe the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion for summary judgment.\");   see also Ramsdell v. Brooks, 64 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied sub nom.  Ramsdell v. Machias Savings Bank, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 913 (1996);   New England Anti-Vivisection Soc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., 889 F.2d 1198, 1204 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, affidavits \"shall be made on personal knowledge, set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).  Accordingly, if the affidavits and Opposition Dodi submitted did not meet these criteria, the district court can hardly have abused its discretion in striking them.   Cf. Posadas de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Radin, 856 F.2d 399, 401 (1st Cir.1988) (affirming that affidavit which does not meet the Rule 56 specificity requirement is insufficient to establish a genuine issue for trial);   FDIC v. Roldan Fonseca, 795 F.2d 1102, 1110 (1st Cir.1986) (holding that where receipts submitted to support opposition to summary judgment constituted inadmissible hearsay, party failed to comply with Rule 56(e)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having briefly set out our standard of review and the relevant legal framework, we turn to the particulars of Dodi's argument.  As the parties have addressed the stricken documents according to subject, we follow suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Imitation of Dodi's Accent:  The district court struck Dodi's statement in his Opposition that William McGue, Putnam's Managing Director, and Robert Frazer, a white manager, \"made fun of Dodi's accent, and imitated him at meetings and during casual conversations.\"   Dodi seeks to rely on a paragraph from his second affidavit in support of his assertion.  We do not find that the district court abused its discretion in striking either the statement from the Opposition or the paragraph in the second affidavit.  The statements in the paragraph are conclusory and lack specificity.  Moreover, even if it were error to exclude the evidence, it would be harmless, for the imitation does not support Dodi's claim of retaliation, and as discussed below, that is the only cause of action remaining on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merit Raises:  The district court struck Dodi's statement in the Opposition that he \"received raises based on merit,\" on the basis that there was nothing in the record as to what \"merit\" meant, or how and on what basis such raises were given.  Dodi claims that statements from the stricken second affidavit provide such verified information.  He also points to a computer printout entitled \"Salary, Increase &amp; Performance History Screen\" which the district court struck as part of the first affidavit, as well as a memorandum sent to him from James Swinney, a Senior Vice President, dated January 2, 1990.  We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking these documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dodi claims that all three meet the requirements to be a business record exception to the hearsay rule.  The requirements for the exception are clear:  a \"memorandum, report, record or data compilation, in any form\" is admissible so long as it is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 803(6);   see, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Alton Packaging Corp., 901 F.2d 920, 926 (11th Cir.1990).  Dodi has not provided the required foundation for these three documents.  First, Dodi misunderstands the application of the rule, which applies to memoranda, reports, and record or data compilation, not oral statements, in claiming that it covers oral statements made to him and mentioned in the second affidavit.  Second, as for the computer printout, Dodi's statement that in his experience, \"such documents are routinely generated by Defendant in the ordinary course of its business\" falls far short of laying out the foundation Rule 803(6) requires.  That it was provided to Dodi in discovery does not save it.  Third, Dodi has also failed to lay out the foundation for the memorandum from Swinney:  although he says he received it in the normal course of business on January 2, 1990, and that it was generated and maintained in the ordinary course of business, we agree with Putnam that there is no support for these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dodi faces similar foundational issues with his claim that the documents are also admissible as party admissions under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).  He has, to put it briefly, failed to show that the statements he cites to were made by Putnam's \"agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).  Mere assertion that they were so made does not suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if some of these statements had been admissible, however, the court still would not have abused its discretion since, as Dodi notes in his brief, the court based its decision in part on the fact that there was no basis in the record as to what \"merit\" meant.  In the cited portion of his second affidavit, Dodi notes that instructors from the human resources training department told him that \"the Putnam policy was to give merit raises as a reward for satisfactory performance by employees.\"   This statement is clearly not admissible under the business record exception, as he claims, since it was an oral statement.  Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) (applicable to \"[a] memorandum, report, record, or data compilation\").  Nor is it a party admission, since he has not addressed the foundational requirements laid out in the rule itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EEO-1 Report:  Next Dodi argues that the district court erred in striking a 1993 EEO-1 report of Putnam, and the corresponding portion of the first affidavit, which he claims evidences that he reasonably believed that race discrimination existed.  In his support he notes that the report was provided in discovery, that Putnam is required by law to produce such reports (Dodi does not specify what law), and that it is a true and accurate copy of the document Putnam provided Dodi.  We fail to see how the fact that a document was presented in discovery suffices to authenticate the document or lay the foundational requirements of Rule 803(6) or Rule 801(d)(2)(D).  At any rate, even if the district court erred, it would have been harmless error, since, as Dodi notes, this evidence goes to his prejudice claim, not his retaliation cause of action, which is his sole remaining cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swinney Memorandum:  Dodi submitted a memorandum he wrote to Swinney, dated December 26, 1989, to show that he had complained about his treatment, in connection with his race discrimination claim.  The district court struck the memorandum on hearsay grounds;  we agree that the necessary foundation was missing.  Dodi's citation of the fact that Putnam is required to generate and maintain a personnel file on its employees does not substitute for the witness testimony required to lay a foundation.  Fed.R.Evid. 803(6).  However, Dodi also notes that the memorandum is being used, in part, not to prove the truth of the matters asserted, but to demonstrate that Dodi complained of the subjectivity of his performance evaluations, in the context of opposition to perceived race discrimination.  But this is a distinction without a difference, since there is no dispute that Dodi protested against perceived racism at Putnam.  Nonetheless, because Swinney was involved in Dodi's termination and thus Dodi's retaliation claim, we shall consider the memorandum for this limited purpose in our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">$10,000 Pay Disparity:  Dodi next contests the district court's decision to strike a series of statements which alleged that for several years Dodi was paid a salary well below that of white individuals, until he complained.  The court struck the statements as conclusory.  Having reviewed the cited deposition pages and statements from the second affidavit, we find no abuse of discretion in the ruling.  Indeed, we agree with Putnam that Dodi's deposition does not support the premise that he perceived it as a race-based discrepancy in wages, but rather that allegation seems to arise only after the motion for summary judgment has appeared on the horizon.   See Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 45 (1st Cir.1994) (\"When an interested witness has given clear answers to unambiguous questions, he cannot create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory, but does not give a satisfactory explanation of why the testimony has changed.\").  Further, any error would be harmless, as the evidence of a pay disparity does not tend to prove retaliatory action, but rather goes to the discrimination claim waived on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualifications of Michelle Whalen:  Dodi contests the district court's decision to strike portions of statements alleging that although Whalen was given a higher position than Dodi, she was less qualified for the position than Dodi.  The cited deposition pages offer no evidence other than it was Dodi's belief that Whalen was less qualified, and inadmissible hearsay that she was management's choice.  Dodi now points to excerpts from Whalen's personnel file and the job description, which have not been stricken, to support his position;  Putnam in turn points out that the promotion was based on managerial abilities, not just narrow technical expertise, and that Dodi fell far short of Whalen in the former category, even if he surpassed her in the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address this debate, for even if the district court erred in striking the statements, the error was harmless.  First, the evidence of whether Whalen was more or less qualified than Dodi goes to the waived discrimination claim, and not to the retaliation claim discussed below.  Second, we remind Dodi of our repeated holding that \"[c]ourts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits--or even the rationality--of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\"   Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 835 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992);   see also Hoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Ctr., 31 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bresnahan Memorandum:  Dodi seeks to admit a memorandum sent from Leslee Bresnahan to Ray Lambert.  However, once again, the fact that Putnam provided the document to Dodi in discovery does not establish its authenticity, and the fact that Putnam is required to generate and maintain a personnel file, providing employees a copy of it on demand, does not fulfill the foundational requirements of either Rule 801(d)(2)(D) or Rule 803(6), as simply set out in those rules.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in striking the memorandum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pattern of Isolation:  In his Opposition, Dodi claims that after he complained about the reorganization, Jeff Levering, to whom Dodi was supposed to report, \"altered his behavior towards Dodi, ... no longer said positive things about Dodi's job performance, and ... avoided talking with Dodi.\"  He also alleges that he was ostracized, kept out of meetings, and that his co-workers \"ceased interacting\" with him.  The district court struck the opinions as opinion and characterizations.  Our review of the cited pages from Dodi's depositions and the second affidavit yields no grounds to find the district court abused its discretion in striking the statements.  Dodi does not give specific incidents, place them in time, or give a yardstick by which to measure either the timeliness of his reviews or their content--indeed, while he repeatedly discusses the supposed content of Levering's weekly status reports, he never actually refers to one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to Provide Staff:  Dodi challenges the district court's decision to strike from the Opposition the statement that Putnam \"failed to give Dodi the permanent staff he requested.\"   We find no abuse of discretion here, as Dodi cited no support for the statement in his Opposition.   See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir.1990).  Indeed, we agree with Putnam that, even if admitted as within Dodi's personal knowledge, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e), at best this statement can show only that Dodi did not get all the resources he requested:  Dodi points to no evidence regarding Putnam's treatment of analogous request made by non-minority employees, or employees who had not filed MCAD complaints, besides his own assertion that \"other departments under McGue\" were fully staffed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other stricken statements:  The district court properly struck the statement that McGue \"failed to provide Dodi the supplies and materials necessary\" to become more visible within the organization, as instructed.  The cited deposition pages offer no admissible support for the proposition, and the passage he cites from the second affidavit constitutes argument and hearsay.  Again, however, we note that even if admitted, the statement would at most have shown that Dodi did not get all the supplies he requested, since he does not point to evidence of the treatment of other, non-minority or non-complaining employees.  Merely pointing out that other departments received printers or the like tells us very little.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Dodi objects to the striking of four statements to the effect that after he made his complaint his work was reviewed in a less timely manner, he stopped receiving positive feedback or necessary information, and other employees received instructions to keep tabs on his actions and note everything he did.  After review of the cited passages from his deposition and the second affidavit, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking the passages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dodi references his cause of action for termination due to race or national origin in his statement of issues, but makes no more than the most cursory reference to it in his brief, and makes no attempt at a developed argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the claim.  Accordingly, we deem it waived,  Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17, and only consider his argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim that he was retaliated against because of his opposition to discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review a grant of summary judgment de novo and are guided by the same criteria as the district court;  a grant of summary judgment cannot stand on appeal 'unless the record discloses no trialworthy issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"   Green, 76 F.3d at 23,  quoting Alexis v. McDonald's Restaurants of Mass., Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 346 (1st Cir.1995).  We note that \"our review will be most searching in cases, such as this, that turn upon the issue of motivation or intent.\"   Rossy v.

First, Dodi must establish a prima facie case by showing that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>(1) [he] engaged in a protected activity as an employee, (2)[he] was subsequently discharged from employment, and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hoeppner, 31 F.3d at 14.

If it does so, \"in order to escape summary judgment under federal and [Massachusetts] law, [Dodi] must at least introduce sufficient evidence to permit the factfinder to infer that [Putnam's] stated reason for the termination was pretextual.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   Grant v.

Assuming nonetheless that Dodi could establish a prima facie case, it found that Putnam easily cleared the hurdle of articulating a reason for the dismissal--that Dodi's work was viewed as sub-standard and that he received poor performance reviews, suggesting missed deadlines and poor communication between Dodi and his supervisors and his staff.  Thus the court moved to the third step of the analysis, where it found that Dodi could not show that Putnam's asserted reason was pretextual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also doubt that Dodi can make a prima facie case.  However, even assuming that Dodi could meet the prima facie requirement, and acknowledging that Putnam has articulated a reason for the dismissal, we find that Dodi cannot meet the third requirement of the McDonnell Douglas analysis.  Put simply, even given the benefit of all inferences, he has not shown that Putnam's asserted reason was false, much less that its real motivation was retaliation.  Like the district court before us, we have found no evidence on this record which supports a finding that his evaluations were inaccurate, or which reveals that Dodi was treated differently than his non-minority or non-complaining counterparts.   See Wynne v. Tufts Univ.  Sch. of Medicine, 976 F.2d 791, 796 (1st Cir.1992) (\"When pretext is at issue in a discrimination case, it is a plaintiff's duty to produce specific facts which, reasonably viewed, tend logically to undercut the defendant's position.\"), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1030 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dodi makes much of the fact that McGue learned of Dodi's MCAD complaint on the day he decided to terminate Dodi, at a meeting in which McGue and Swinney--who testified at his deposition that he was very angry about the claim--discussed Dodi's termination.  We do not doubt that the timing of when the relevant decision maker learned that a complaint was filed and when the dismissal occurred can be demonstrative of retaliation.   See Oliver, 846 F.2d at 110.   Indeed, the timing of the discussion here weighs in favor of Dodi having made a prima facie case.   See Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1994) (finding that timing of employer's knowledge of protected activity and dismissal helps establish a prima facie case);   Rowlett v.

He does not, however, attempt to cull out the admissible portions or cite any authority.  We find, therefore, that except for the portions he specifically discusses, he has waived his argument that the affidavits as a whole are admissible, as arguments made perfunctorily on appeal with no developed argument or support are deemed waived.

However, his reliance on  Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 187 (1989), for that proposition is misplaced, since the cited passage notes that a petitioner can present a variety of types of evidence to establish pretext, not that it need not be established.  Our case law offers no doubt that in retaliation claims, the McDonnell Douglas analysis requires a showing of pretext.   See, e.g., Grant, 55 F.3d at 7;   Greenberg v.

Dodi had filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a), and Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  151B alleging discrimination on account of his race and national origin and/or retaliation for filing a charge with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\").  The two issues before us are whether the court below abused its discretion in striking Dodi's two affidavits and portions of his Opposition to Summary Judgment;  and whether it erred in granting the summary judgment.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the following facts, drawn from the district court Memorandum and Order, in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.   Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712246\"><a href=\"/opinion/712246/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-88-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43900-equal/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1996).  Dodi is a United States citizen who was born in Ghana and is black.  He began working for Putnam in 1984, and by 1987 was part of the Tax and Compliance unit.  In December 1989 or January 1990, the department was reorganized.  A white female, Michelle Whalen (\"Whalen\"), was appointed Manager of the Tax and Compliance unit, a position Dodi desired, and which title he maintains was his prior to the reorganization and Whalen's appointment.  Dodi complained to several individuals, including Robert Lucey, President of Putnam Investor Services.  After he complained, Dodi was made the IRS Technical Manager:  he contends that his appointment was an effective demotion, while Putnam labels it a lateral move.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1990, Dodi filed a charge with MCAD alleging that he was demoted and denied promotion on account of his race and national origin.  After he filed the charge, his rating in his performance reviews declined--his rating dropped to \"unsatisfactory\"--and the reviews suggested increased hostility between Dodi and his supervisors.  Dodi contends that he was excluded from meetings and isolated from the department because of the complaint.  Putnam fired Dodi in March 1991, roughly ten months after the filing of the MCAD complaint.  He filed a second complaint in June 1991, alleging that he was terminated because of his race and national origin, or in retaliation for filing the 1990 complaint, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCAD dismissed the two complaints in December 1992, for lack of probable cause, a decision it affirmed in January of 1993.  Dodi filed a civil action in Massachusetts Superior Court, which Putnam removed to the Federal District Court.  The parties made discovery requests and took depositions.  Putnam filed a motion for summary judgment, which Dodi opposed.  In June 1995, Putnam moved to strike portions of Dodi's Opposition to Summary Judgment (the \"Opposition\").  Dodi's opposition to the motion to strike contained an affidavit (the \"first affidavit\") with attachments.  At a hearing in July 1995, the district court granted Putnam's motion to strike portions of Dodi's Opposition, and struck the first affidavit on its own initiative.  It granted Dodi's request for permission to submit supplemental information in support of the stricken statements in the Opposition.  In late July Dodi filed a supplemental submission in opposition to Putnam's motion to strike, including another affidavit (the \"second affidavit\").  In August, Putnam moved to strike the second affidavit, and in October 1995, the district court granted Putnam's motion for summary judgment and its motion to strike the second affidavit.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STRICKEN SUBMISSIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Dodi's argument that the district court erred in striking the affidavits and his Opposition since, if they were admissible, they would form part of the record on which the summary judgment would be evaluated.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  We review the district court's decision to strike for abuse of discretion.   See Green, 76 F.3d at 23 (\"The district court has broad authority to prescribe the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion for summary judgment.\");   see also Ramsdell v.

Accordingly, if the affidavits and Opposition Dodi submitted did not meet these criteria, the district court can hardly have abused its discretion in striking them.   Cf. Posadas de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Radin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511564\"><a href=\"/opinion/511564/posadas-de-puerto-rico-inc-dba-condado-plaza-hotel-v-allen-radin/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 401 (1st Cir.1988) (affirming that affidavit which does not meet the Rule 56 specificity requirement is insufficient to establish a genuine issue for trial);   FDIC v.

As the parties have addressed the stricken documents according to subject, we follow suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Imitation of Dodi's Accent:  The district court struck Dodi's statement in his Opposition that William McGue, Putnam's Managing Director, and Robert Frazer, a white manager, \"made fun of Dodi's accent, and imitated him at meetings and during casual conversations.\"   Dodi seeks to rely on a paragraph from his second affidavit in support of his assertion.  We do not find that the district court abused its discretion in striking either the statement from the Opposition or the paragraph in the second affidavit.  The statements in the paragraph are conclusory and lack specificity.  Moreover, even if it were error to exclude the evidence, it would be harmless, for the imitation does not support Dodi's claim of retaliation, and as discussed below, that is the only cause of action remaining on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merit Raises:  The district court struck Dodi's statement in the Opposition that he \"received raises based on merit,\" on the basis that there was nothing in the record as to what \"merit\" meant, or how and on what basis such raises were given.  Dodi claims that statements from the stricken second affidavit provide such verified information.  He also points to a computer printout entitled \"Salary, Increase &amp; Performance History Screen\" which the district court struck as part of the first affidavit, as well as a memorandum sent to him from James Swinney, a Senior Vice President, dated January 2, 1990.  We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking these documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dodi claims that all three meet the requirements to be a business record exception to the hearsay rule.  The requirements for the exception are clear:  a \"memorandum, report, record or data compilation, in any form\" is admissible so long as it is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 803(6);   see, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Alton Packaging Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540135\"><a href=\"/opinion/540135/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-alton-packaging-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 926 (11th Cir.1990).  Dodi has not provided the required foundation for these three documents.  First, Dodi misunderstands the application of the rule, which applies to memoranda, reports, and record or data compilation, not oral statements, in claiming that it covers oral statements made to him and mentioned in the second affidavit.  Second, as for the computer printout, Dodi's statement that in his experience, \"such documents are routinely generated by Defendant in the ordinary course of its business\" falls far short of laying out the foundation Rule 803(6) requires.  That it was provided to Dodi in discovery does not save it.  Third, Dodi has also failed to lay out the foundation for the memorandum from Swinney:  although he says he received it in the normal course of business on January 2, 1990, and that it was generated and maintained in the ordinary course of business, we agree with Putnam that there is no support for these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dodi faces similar foundational issues with his claim that the documents are also admissible as party admissions under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).  He has, to put it briefly, failed to show that the statements he cites to were made by Putnam's \"agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).  Mere assertion that they were so made does not suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if some of these statements had been admissible, however, the court still would not have abused its discretion since, as Dodi notes in his brief, the court based its decision in part on the fact that there was no basis in the record as to what \"merit\" meant.  In the cited portion of his second affidavit, Dodi notes that instructors from the human resources training department told him that \"the Putnam policy was to give merit raises as a reward for satisfactory performance by employees.\"   This statement is clearly not admissible under the business record exception, as he claims, since it was an oral statement.  Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) (applicable to \"[a] memorandum, report, record, or data compilation\").  Nor is it a party admission, since he has not addressed the foundational requirements laid out in the rule itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EEO-1 Report:  Next Dodi argues that the district court erred in striking a 1993 EEO-1 report of Putnam, and the corresponding portion of the first affidavit, which he claims evidences that he reasonably believed that race discrimination existed.  In his support he notes that the report was provided in discovery, that Putnam is required by law to produce such reports (Dodi does not specify what law), and that it is a true and accurate copy of the document Putnam provided Dodi.  We fail to see how the fact that a document was presented in discovery suffices to authenticate the document or lay the foundational requirements of Rule 803(6) or Rule 801(d)(2)(D).  At any rate, even if the district court erred, it would have been harmless error, since, as Dodi notes, this evidence goes to his prejudice claim, not his retaliation cause of action, which is his sole remaining cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Swinney Memorandum:  Dodi submitted a memorandum he wrote to Swinney, dated December 26, 1989, to show that he had complained about his treatment, in connection with his race discrimination claim.  The district court struck the memorandum on hearsay grounds;  we agree that the necessary foundation was missing.  Dodi's citation of the fact that Putnam is required to generate and maintain a personnel file on its employees does not substitute for the witness testimony required to lay a foundation.  Fed.R.Evid. 803(6).  However, Dodi also notes that the memorandum is being used, in part, not to prove the truth of the matters asserted, but to demonstrate that Dodi complained of the subjectivity of his performance evaluations, in the context of opposition to perceived race discrimination.  But this is a distinction without a difference, since there is no dispute that Dodi protested against perceived racism at Putnam.  Nonetheless, because Swinney was involved in Dodi's termination and thus Dodi's retaliation claim, we shall consider the memorandum for this limited purpose in our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">$10,000 Pay Disparity:  Dodi next contests the district court's decision to strike a series of statements which alleged that for several years Dodi was paid a salary well below that of white individuals, until he complained.  The court struck the statements as conclusory.  Having reviewed the cited deposition pages and statements from the second affidavit, we find no abuse of discretion in the ruling.  Indeed, we agree with Putnam that Dodi's deposition does not support the premise that he perceived it as a race-based discrepancy in wages, but rather that allegation seems to arise only after the motion for summary judgment has appeared on the horizon.   See Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 45 (1st Cir.1994) (\"When an interested witness has given clear answers to unambiguous questions, he cannot create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory, but does not give a satisfactory explanation of why the testimony has changed.\").

The cited deposition pages offer no evidence other than it was Dodi's belief that Whalen was less qualified, and inadmissible hearsay that she was management's choice.  Dodi now points to excerpts from Whalen's personnel file and the job description, which have not been stricken, to support his position;  Putnam in turn points out that the promotion was based on managerial abilities, not just narrow technical expertise, and that Dodi fell far short of Whalen in the former category, even if he surpassed her in the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address this debate, for even if the district court erred in striking the statements, the error was harmless.  First, the evidence of whether Whalen was more or less qualified than Dodi goes to the waived discrimination claim, and not to the retaliation claim discussed below.

However, once again, the fact that Putnam provided the document to Dodi in discovery does not establish its authenticity, and the fact that Putnam is required to generate and maintain a personnel file, providing employees a copy of it on demand, does not fulfill the foundational requirements of either Rule 801(d)(2)(D) or Rule 803(6), as simply set out in those rules.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in striking the memorandum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pattern of Isolation:  In his Opposition, Dodi claims that after he complained about the reorganization, Jeff Levering, to whom Dodi was supposed to report, \"altered his behavior towards Dodi, ... no longer said positive things about Dodi's job performance, and ... avoided talking with Dodi.\"  He also alleges that he was ostracized, kept out of meetings, and that his co-workers \"ceased interacting\" with him.  The district court struck the opinions as opinion and characterizations.  Our review of the cited pages from Dodi's depositions and the second affidavit yields no grounds to find the district court abused its discretion in striking the statements.  Dodi does not give specific incidents, place them in time, or give a yardstick by which to measure either the timeliness of his reviews or their content--indeed, while he repeatedly discusses the supposed content of Levering's weekly status reports, he never actually refers to one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to Provide Staff:  Dodi challenges the district court's decision to strike from the Opposition the statement that Putnam \"failed to give Dodi the permanent staff he requested.\"   We find no abuse of discretion here, as Dodi cited no support for the statement in his Opposition.

Osco Drug, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1990).  Indeed, we agree with Putnam that, even if admitted as within Dodi's personal knowledge, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e), at best this statement can show only that Dodi did not get all the resources he requested:  Dodi points to no evidence regarding Putnam's treatment of analogous request made by non-minority employees, or employees who had not filed MCAD complaints, besides his own assertion that \"other departments under McGue\" were fully staffed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other stricken statements:  The district court properly struck the statement that McGue \"failed to provide Dodi the supplies and materials necessary\" to become more visible within the organization, as instructed.  The cited deposition pages offer no admissible support for the proposition, and the passage he cites from the second affidavit constitutes argument and hearsay.  Again, however, we note that even if admitted, the statement would at most have shown that Dodi did not get all the supplies he requested, since he does not point to evidence of the treatment of other, non-minority or non-complaining employees.  Merely pointing out that other departments received printers or the like tells us very little.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Dodi objects to the striking of four statements to the effect that after he made his complaint his work was reviewed in a less timely manner, he stopped receiving positive feedback or necessary information, and other employees received instructions to keep tabs on his actions and note everything he did.  After review of the cited passages from his deposition and the second affidavit, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking the passages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dodi references his cause of action for termination due to race or national origin in his statement of issues, but makes no more than the most cursory reference to it in his brief, and makes no attempt at a developed argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the claim.  Accordingly, we deem it waived,  Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17, and only consider his argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim that he was retaliated against because of his opposition to discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review a grant of summary judgment de novo and are guided by the same criteria as the district court;  a grant of summary judgment cannot stand on appeal 'unless the record discloses no trialworthy issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"   Green, 76 F.3d at 23,  quoting Alexis v.

Assuming nonetheless that Dodi could establish a prima facie case, it found that Putnam easily cleared the hurdle of articulating a reason for the dismissal--that Dodi's work was viewed as sub-standard and that he received poor performance reviews, suggesting missed deadlines and poor communication between Dodi and his supervisors and his staff.  Thus the court moved to the third step of the analysis, where it found that Dodi could not show that Putnam's asserted reason was pretextual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also doubt that Dodi can make a prima facie case.  However, even assuming that Dodi could meet the prima facie requirement, and acknowledging that Putnam has articulated a reason for the dismissal, we find that Dodi cannot meet the third requirement of the McDonnell Douglas analysis.  Put simply, even given the benefit of all inferences, he has not shown that Putnam's asserted reason was false, much less that its real motivation was retaliation.  Like the district court before us, we have found no evidence on this record which supports a finding that his evaluations were inaccurate, or which reveals that Dodi was treated differently than his non-minority or non-complaining counterparts.

We do not doubt that the timing of when the relevant decision maker learned that a complaint was filed and when the dismissal occurred can be demonstrative of retaliation.   See Oliver, 846 F.2d at 110.   Indeed, the timing of the discussion here weighs in favor of Dodi having made a prima facie case.   See Wyatt v.

Dodi himself notes that the reference to his MCAD claim was made \"in passing.\"   We fail to see how a passing reference can suffice to show that Putnam's asserted reason for firing Dodi was a pretext,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> especially as Dodi points to nothing else of real substance in his support:  the \"history\" of retaliation he argues existed, as well as the alleged inconsistencies in who claimed authority to fire him, and why, do little, if anything, to further his cause.  \"In this circuit, we have always required not only 'minimally sufficient evidence of pretext,' but evidence that overall reasonably supports a finding of [retaliation],\" and Dodi has not met that mark.

He does not, however, attempt to cull out the admissible portions or cite any authority.  We find, therefore, that except for the portions he specifically discusses, he has waived his argument that the affidavits as a whole are admissible, as arguments made perfunctorily on appeal with no developed argument or support are deemed waived.

Our case law offers no doubt that in retaliation claims, the McDonnell Douglas analysis requires a showing of pretext.   See, e.g., Grant, 55 F.3d at 7;   Greenberg v.
