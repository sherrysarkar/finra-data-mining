Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Neil M. Nameroff for appellant.\n     Michelle Morales, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                        April 26, 2001\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.        The district court denied the\n\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial on the ground that his claim of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel did not meet the standard for \"newly\n\ndiscovered evidence\" under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. The\n\ndefendant appeals that ruling. In the alternative, he asks us to\n\ndecide his ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal, contending\n\nthat the record is sufficiently developed for us to do so. We affirm\n\nthe denial of the motion for a new trial and do not decide the\n\ndefendant’s ineffective assistance claim.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          In the early hours of August 1, 1997, Puerto Rican police\n\nexecuted a search warrant at the home of Edwin Osorio-Peña. They found\n\ndrug paraphernalia and drug ledgers. Based on this evidence, Osorio-\n\nPeña was indicted on August 6 and charged with three separate counts\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1): possession with intent to distribute\n\nheroin, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and possession\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine. Osorio-Peña pled not guilty and\n\nwent to trial. On November 26, 1997, a jury found him guilty of all\n\nthree counts. Osorio-Peña was later sentenced to 78 months in prison\n\nand four years supervised release.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           Three months after his conviction, the defendant retained\n\nnew counsel who continues to represent him on this appeal. On October\n\n1, 1998, ten months after his conviction, the defendant filed a motion\n\nfor a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. Rule 33\n\nprovides that a motion for a new trial must be made within seven days\n\nafter a guilty finding unless \"based on the ground of newly discovered\n\nevidence,\" in which case the motion may be made within two years after\n\nthe verdict. Fed. R. Crim. P. 33. The defendant claimed that his\n\nmotion fell under the \"newly discovered evidence\" exception to the\n\nseven-day time limit.    He argued that his trial lawyer provided\n\nineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file a motion to\n\nsuppress the warrant used to search his house, and by failing to file\n\na motion for a new trial within Rule 33's seven-day deadline. Osorio-\n\nPeña said that the warrant gave a wrong address and wrong description\n\nof the house, thus violating the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that\n\nwarrants must \"particularly describ[e] the place to be searched.\" U.S.\n\nConst. amend. IV. He argued that his ineffective assistance claim\n\nbased on his lawyer's failure to challenge the warrant came within Rule\n\n33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision because he himself did not\n\nbecome aware of the warrant’s errors or their legal significance until\n\nafter trial.\n\n           The warrant at issue describes the property to be searched\n\nas: \"A white two story concrete structure located at: Urbanizacion\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fMariolga, Calle 26, T#2, Caguas, Puerto Rico.\" A police affidavit\n\nsworn out to obtain the warrant said that according to a confidential\n\ninformant, a large quantity of heroin had been delivered to this\n\naddress, and that its recipients were a woman with the last name of Fnu\n\nLnu and her husband, a.k.a. \"Brunly.\" The defendant said that the\n\naddress in the warrant was incorrect because he lives in the\n\nurbanizacion, or neighborhood, of Villas del Rio Verde rather than\n\nMariolga, and that the description was incorrect because his house is\n\na one-story building painted (at the time of the search) light green\n\nwith pink trim. He also contended that he has no relationship with the\n\npeople to whom the warrant referred.\n\n           The same magistrate judge who issued the warrant held an\n\nevidentiary hearing on the defendant’s motion for a new trial on\n\nDecember 18, 1998. The magistrate judge asked for and received an\n\naffidavit from Osorio-Peña’s trial counsel, Benito I. Rodríguez-Massó,\n\nin which he explained that he did not file a motion to suppress the\n\nwarrant because \"[t]he defendant at all times stated that his address\n\nwas indistinctively referred to as 'Urbanicazion Mariolga' or 'Villas\n\ndel Rio Verde.'\" The magistrate judge also heard testimony from a\n\nPuerto Rican police officer about the steps taken to obtain the search\n\nwarrant. The officer said that a confidential informant provided the\n\naddress that appears in the search warrant to another officer, and that\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fhe and this officer conducted surveillance at the defendant's house for\n\ntwo or three hours before executing the search.\n\n           In a report and recommendation, the magistrate judge found\n\nthat the defendant’s ineffective assistance claim met the standard for\n\n\"newly discovered evidence\" under Rule 33 because the \"defendant was\n\nnot aware of the search warrant's physical description of the residence\n\nto be searched until after trial.\" She based this conclusion on the\n\nabsence of any mention in the trial transcript of the warrant’s\n\ndescription of the house, and on Rodríguez-Massó's statement that he\n\nonly discussed the wrong address with the defendant. The magistrate\n\njudge recognized our holding that\n\n           [a] motion for new trial on the basis of newly\n           discovered evidence will ordinarily not be\n           granted unless the moving party can demonstrate\n           that: (1) the evidence was unknown or\n           unavailable to the defendant at the time of\n           trial; (2) failure to learn of the evidence was\n           not due to lack of diligence by the defendant;\n           (3) the evidence is material, and not merely\n           cumulative or impeaching; and (4) it will\n           probably result in an acquittal upon retrial of\n           the defendant.\n\nUnited States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980). The\n\nmagistrate judge said that Osorio-Peña met the four elements of this\n\nstandard. His lawyer’s failure to discuss the warrant's descriptive\n\nerrors with him meant that the defendant \"did not know, nor did he have\n\nany reason to know, either (1) that the search warrant contained a\n\nphysical description of the residence to be searched or (2) that the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fphysical description did not match his residence.\" The evidence was\n\nmaterial because it \"goes to the legality of the execution warrant,\"\n\nand was likely to result in acquittal because it was \"questionable\"\n\nwhether the defendant would have been tried without the fruits of the\n\nsearch of his home.\n\n          Finding that the defendant’s motion for a new trial was not\n\ntime-barred, the magistrate judge considered the merits of his\n\nineffective assistance claim. She concluded that the warrant used to\n\nsearch Osorio-Peña’s home included several errors,1 and that his trial\n\nlawyer did not provide effective assistance of counsel because he\n\nfailed to challenge the warrant.       The government filed a written\n\nobjection to the magistrate judge's factual findings with the district\n\ncourt and argued that she should not have addressed the ineffective\n\nassistance claim because it did not meet the \"newly discovered\n\nevidence\" standard.     The district court did not rule on the\n\ngovernment’s objections to the magistrate judge's factual findings,\n\n\n\n     1The magistrate judge found that while the defendant's street\naddress is Calle 26, T#2 in the city of Caguas, he lives in the\nurbanizacion, or neighborhood, of Villas del Rio Verde rather than\nMariolga. However, she also found that the two neighborhoods are close\ntogether and often referred to interchangeably. In addition, the\nmagistrate said that the defendant’s house is a one-story building\npainted (at the time of the search) light green with pink trim rather\nthan the two-story white structure described in the warrant. The\nmagistrate also said that it was \"still unknown\" why the warrant\nincluded no reference to Osorio-Peña, given the tip from the\nconfidential informant and the surveillance conducted by the police.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\finstead holding that Rule 33 did not entitle the defendant to a new\n\ntrial because his ineffective assistance claim was not based on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence. We review the district court’s denial of a motion\n\nfor a new trial for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Winter,\n\n663 F.2d 1120, 1155 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n                                 II.\n\n           On appeal, Osorio-Peña repeats his argument that his\n\nineffective assistance claim, based on his lawyer's failure to\n\nchallenge the warrant, came within Rule 33's \"newly discovered\n\nevidence\" provision. Osorio-Peña does not dispute that the warrant was\n\navailable to his lawyer, Rodríguez-Massó (or indeed that he and his\n\nlawyer briefly discussed the warrant). Instead, he argues that he is\n\nentitled to Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" extension because the\n\ninformation in the warrant was unavailable to him personally at trial\n\nin two ways: (1) Rodríguez-Massó did not tell him about the warrant’s\n\ninaccurate physical description of his house, other than the wrong\n\naddress; and (2) even if he had known those facts, he would not have\n\nappreciated their legal significance without a lawyer's help because\n\nhe is a Spanish-speaking layperson.\n\n           Osorio-Peña relies primarily on our own precedent, United\n\nStates v. Lema, 909 F.2d 561 (1st Cir. 1990). Lema argued that his\n\nineffective assistance claim met Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\"\n\nstandard because it was based on his lawyer's failure to investigate\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe existence of audiotapes made by the government which would\n\ncontradict the testimony of government witnesses. Id. at 564-65. Lema\n\ncontended that he was unaware of the tapes until he looked at his\n\nlawyer's file after trial and found transcripts of them. Id. at 565.\n\nOn appeal, we said that \"Lema may bypass Rule 33's seven-day time limit\n\nonly if his claim that his counsel failed to discover and/or review the\n\ntapes was based on information unavailable to the defendant at the time\n\nof trial.\"   Id. at 566.\n\n           Reading this statement as referring to information that is\n\nunavailable to the defendant himself, Osorio-Peña argues that any\n\ninformation available to his lawyer cannot be attributed to him. If\n\nhe discovered facts after the trial known only to his lawyer at the\n\ntime of trial, he argues, his personal discovery meets the definition\n\nof \"newly discovered evidence.\" The magistrate judge agreed with this\n\npremise in finding that Osorio-Peña's claim came within Rule 33's\n\n\"newly discovered evidence\" provision because the defendant did not\n\nknow of the warrant's descriptive errors, and because his failure to\n\nlearn of this evidence was not due to his own lack of diligence. The\n\npremise for these findings is erroneous.\n\n           It is true that Lema sometimes discusses \"information\n\nunavailable to the defendant\" in terms of Lema’s own awareness of the\n\nexistence of the tapes.     The court says that \"passages from the\n\ntestimony make abundantly clear [that] Lema was aware at the time of\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\ftrial that there were tape recordings.\" Id. at 567. The court also\n\nsays: \"There is no doubt that Lema was aware at the time of trial of\n\nthe existence of tapes and transcripts of the conversations to which\n\ngovernment witnesses were testifying.\"       Id. at 568.\n\n           Despite these references to the defendant’s own knowledge,\n\nthe dispositive facts in Lema were defense counsel’s access to the\n\ntapes before trial, references to the tapes in the docket record, and\n\na pre-trial letter from the government to Lema's lawyer discussing\n\nthem.    Id. at 568 and n. 9.   These facts go to defense counsel’s\n\nknowledge of the tapes, not Lema’s personal knowledge of them. In\n\naddition, Lema stated this general proposition: \"An interpretation that\n\nwould consider facts known at the time of trial to be 'newly\n\ndiscovered,' if cloaked in the garb of a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, flies in the face of the plain meaning of the\n\nrule and the traditional understanding of the narrowness of the time\n\nexception.\" Id. at 566. Properly read, Lema precludes defendants from\n\nprevailing under Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision when\n\ntheir lawyers knew at trial about the evidence that defendants now\n\nclaim is newly discovered.2\n\n\n     2 Of course, if Osorio-Peña wanted to argue that even his lawyer\ndid not know about the content of the warrant, he would have to\ndemonstrate that his lawyer’s failure to learn of this evidence was not\ndue to lack of diligence to come within Rule 33's \"newly discovered\nevidence\" provision. See Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019. Again, in the\ncircumstances presented here, it is the diligence of the defendant\nthrough his lawyer that is at issue, not the diligence of the defendant\n\n                                - 9 -\n\f           Osorio-Peña alternately argues that the warrant’s errors are\n\nnewly discovered because his lawyer did not explain their legal\n\nsignificance to him. Lema precludes this argument as well by holding\n\nthat Rule 33 puts the burden on the defendant to raise concerns about\n\nhis lawyer’s investigation of evidence within seven days. Id. at 568\n\n(\"If [Lema] believed that these tapes contained exculpatory evidence\n\nand that more discovery should have been done or that his attorney\n\ninadequately represented him in this regard, he was able to raise the\n\nissue within the seven-day period governing motions for new trial.\").\n\nThe majority of circuits similarly have held that facts giving rise to\n\nineffective assistance claims are not newly discovered evidence under\n\nRule 33 if the facts were available to the defendant at trial but he\n\nor she did not appreciate their legal significance. See United States\n\nv. Seago, 930 F.2d 482, 488-90 (6th Cir. 1991); United States v.\n\nUgalde, 861 F.2d 802, 805-06 (5th Cir. 1988); United States v. Dukes,\n\n727 F.2d 34, 39 (2d Cir. 1984); United States v. Lara-Hernandez, 588\n\nF.2d 272, 275 (9th Cir. 1978); United States v. Ellison, 557 F.2d 128,\n\n132-34 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 965 (1977). But see\n\nUnited States v. Brown, 476 F.2d 933, 935 n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1973); United\n\nStates v. Smallwood, 473 F.2d 98, 104 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (Bazelon, C. J.,\n\nconcurring).\n\n\n\n\nhimself.\n\n                                - 10 -\n\f           In sum, \"courts have given a narrow meaning to the phrase\n\n'newly discovered.'\"       Lema, 909 F.2d at 566.        This narrow\n\ninterpretation reflects Rule 33's emphasis on finality. As the Seventh\n\nCircuit has said: \"The practical difficulties faced by defendants\n\nseeking to raise ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims by way of\n\nmotions for a new trial . . . do not give us cause to corrupt the clear\n\nlanguage of Rule 33.     Newly discovered evidence must be newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.\"     Ellison, 557 F.2d at 133.\n\n           As an alternative to his Rule 33 motion, Osorio-Peña asks\n\nus to make the ineffective assistance determination on direct appeal.\n\n\"The rule in this circuit is that a fact-specific claim of ineffective\n\nlegal assistance cannot be raised initially on direct review of a\n\ncriminal conviction, but must originally be presented to the district\n\ncourt.\" United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nThis practice exists largely to allow for full development of the\n\nrecord needed to \"place the adequacy of a defendant's representation\n\ninto proper perspective.\" United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309\n\n(1st Cir. 1991). On occasion, when the trial record has included all\n\nthe relevant facts, we have departed from this rule and decided\n\nineffective assistance claims on direct appeal. See, e.g., id.; United\n\nStates v. Caggiano, 899 F.2d 99, 100 (1st Cir. 1990). Osorio-Peña\n\nargues that the evidentiary hearing before the magistrate judge\n\nproduced a full record of the facts relating to his ineffective\n\n\n                                - 11 -\n\fassistance claim. His counsel said at oral argument that requiring him\n\nto file a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 22553 would be \"pointless.\"\n\nWe disagree.\n\n           A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel \"must\n\nshow that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness.\" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984).\n\nBecause of the difference between this standard and the standard for\n\n\"newly discovered evidence,\" the record relevant to Osorio-Peña's\n\nineffective assistance claim is not fully developed. While some of the\n\nevidence at the Rule 33 hearing before the magistrate judge related to\n\nthe ineffective assistance claim, the defendant's motion for a new\n\ntrial, and the post-trial proceedings that followed, focused primarily\n\non whether the basis for the claim was newly discovered.           The\n\nmagistrate judge reached the merits of the ineffective assistance\n\nclaim, but the district court did not. Osorio-Peña's brief on appeal\n\nalso is primarily devoted to the Rule 33 issue rather than the\n\nunderlying ineffective assistance claim. At oral argument, several\n\nfactual disputes emerged that go to the merits of the ineffective\n\n\n\n\n     3 The statute allows a defendant convicted in federal court to\nmove the sentencing court to vacate, set aside or correct his or her\nsentence on the ground that it \"was imposed in violation of the\nConstitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was\nwithout jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was\nin excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to\ncollateral attack.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n                                - 12 -\n\fassistance claim.4     Osorio-Peña's brief does not set forth the\n\ndefendant's position on several of these contested issues.5\n\n           Given these factors, we think the most prudent course is to\n\ndecline to decide the defendant's ineffective assistance claim.\n\nRaising that claim in a habeas petition will allow Osorio-Peña to focus\n\nsquarely on why his lawyer’s performance may have fallen below an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness when the lawyer decided not to\n\nfile a motion to suppress the search warrant.    We express no view as\n\nto the merits of this claim, see Lema, 909 F.2d at 568, or as to the\n\nmagistrate judge's factual findings and the government's objection to\n\nthem.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4 For example, the government said that the confidential informant\nbrought the police to Osorio-Peña's address, and provided the\ninformation about an incoming drug delivery that supports the probable\ncause basis for the warrant. Osorio-Peña said that the confidential\ninformant's tip had nothing to do with the defendant, and that there\nwas no probable cause for the search because the police, in conducting\nsurveillance of Osorio-Peña's house, observed no suspicious activity.\nThis dispute may matter because to meet the standard for ineffective\nassistance, the defendant must show that his lawyer's failure to\nchallenge the warrant prejudiced him. See Strickland, 466. U.S. at\n687.\n     5 Citing the record's incompleteness, the government withdrew at\noral argument its agreement in its brief to direct review of the\nineffective assistance claim. See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309 (reviewing\nan ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal partly because\n\"[n]either side suggests that there is any need for further\nfactfinding\").\n\n                                - 13 -\n\f",

Based on this evidence, Osorio-Pena was indicted on August 6 and charged with three separate counts under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1): possession with intent to distribute heroin, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine.

Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980). The magistrate judge said that Osorio-Pena met the four elements of this standard. His lawyer's failure to discuss the warrant's descriptive errors with him meant that the defendant \"did not know, nor did he have any reason to know, either (1) that the search warrant contained a physical description of the residence to be searched or (2) that the physical description did not match his residence.\" The evidence was material because it \"goes to the legality of the execution warrant,\" and was likely to result in acquittal because it was \"questionable\" whether the defendant would have been tried without the fruits of the search of his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the defendant's motion for a new trial was not time-barred, the magistrate judge considered the merits of his ineffective assistance claim.

The government filed a written objection to the magistrate judge's factual findings with the district court and argued that she should not have addressed the ineffective assistance claim because it did not meet the \"newly discovered evidence\" standard. The district court did not rule on the government's objections to the magistrate judge's factual findings, instead holding that Rule 33 did not entitle the defendant to a new trial because his ineffective assistance claim was not based on newly discovered evidence. We review the district court's denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1155 (1st Cir. 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Osorio-Pena repeats his argument that his ineffective assistance claim, based on his lawyer's failure to challenge the warrant, came within Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision. Osorio-Pena does not dispute that the warrant was available to his lawyer, Rodrguez-Masso (or indeed that he and his lawyer briefly discussed the warrant). Instead, he argues that he is entitled to Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" extension because the information in the warrant was unavailable to him personally at trial in two ways: (1) Rodrguez-Masso did not tell him about the warrant's inaccurate physical description of his house, other than the wrong address; and (2) even if he had known those facts, he would not have appreciated their legal significance without a lawyer's help because he is a Spanish-speaking layperson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Osorio-Pena relies primarily on our own precedent, United States v. Lema, 909 F.2d 561 (1st Cir. 1990). Lema argued that his ineffective assistance claim met Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" standard because it was based on his lawyer's failure to investigate the existence of audiotapes made by the government which would contradict the testimony of government witnesses. Id. at 564-65. Lema contended that he was unaware of the tapes until he looked at his lawyer's file after trial and found transcripts of them. Id. at 565. On appeal, we said that \"Lema may bypass Rule 33's seven-day time limit only if his claim that his counsel failed to discover and/or review the tapes was based on information unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial.\" Id. at 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reading this statement as referring to information that is unavailable to the defendant himself, Osorio-Pena argues that any information available to his lawyer cannot be attributed to him. If he discovered facts after the trial known only to his lawyer at the time of trial, he argues, his personal discovery meets the definition of \"newly discovered evidence.\" The magistrate judge agreed with this premise in finding that Osorio-Pena's claim came within Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision because the defendant did not know of the warrant's descriptive errors, and because his failure to learn of this evidence was not due to his own lack of diligence. The premise for these findings is erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Lema sometimes discusses \"information unavailable to the defendant\" in terms of Lema's own awareness of the existence of the tapes. The court says that \"passages from the testimony make abundantly clear [that] Lema was aware at the time of trial that there were tape recordings.\" Id. at 567. The court also says: \"There is no doubt that Lema was aware at the time of trial of the existence of tapes and transcripts of the conversations to which government witnesses were testifying.\" Id. at 568.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these references to the defendant's own knowledge, the dispositive facts in Lema were defense counsel's access to the tapes before trial, references to the tapes in the docket record, and a pre-trial letter from the government to Lema's lawyer discussing them. Id. at 568 and n. 9. These facts go to defense counsel's knowledge of the tapes, not Lema's personal knowledge of them. In addition, Lema stated this general proposition: \"An interpretation that would consider facts known at the time of trial to be 'newly discovered,' if cloaked in the garb of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, flies in the face of the plain meaning of the rule and the traditional understanding of the narrowness of the time exception.\" Id. at 566. Properly read, Lema precludes defendants from prevailing under Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision when their lawyers knew at trial about the evidence that defendants now claim is newly discovered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Osorio-Pena alternately argues that the warrant's errors are newly discovered because his lawyer did not explain their legal significance to him. Lema precludes this argument as well by holding that Rule 33 puts the burden on the defendant to raise concerns about his lawyer's investigation of evidence within seven days. Id. at 568 (\"If [Lema] believed that these tapes contained exculpatory evidence and that more discovery should have been done or that his attorney inadequately represented him in this regard, he was able to raise the issue within the seven-day period governing motions for new trial.\"). The majority of circuits similarly have held that facts giving rise to ineffective assistance claims are not newly discovered evidence under Rule 33 if the facts were available to the defendant at trial but he or she did not appreciate their legal significance. See United States v. Seago, 930 F.2d 482, 488-90 (6th Cir. 1991); United States v. Ugalde, 861 F.2d 802, 805-06 (5th Cir. 1988); United States v. Dukes, 727 F.2d 34, 39 (2d Cir. 1984); United States v. Lara-Hernandez, 588 F.2d 272, 275 (9th Cir. 1978); United States v. Ellison, 557 F.2d 128, 132-34 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 965 (1977). But see United States v. Brown, 476 F.2d 933, 935 n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1973); United States v. Smallwood, 473 F.2d 98, 104 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (Bazelon, C. J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, \"courts have given a narrow meaning to the phrase 'newly discovered.'\" Lema, 909 F.2d at 566. This narrow interpretation reflects Rule 33's emphasis on finality. As the Seventh Circuit has said: \"The practical difficulties faced by defendants seeking to raise ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims by way of motions for a new trial . . . do not give us cause to corrupt the clear language of Rule 33. Newly discovered evidence must be newly discovered evidence.\" Ellison, 557 F.2d at 133.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to his Rule 33 motion, Osorio-Pena asks us to make the ineffective assistance determination on direct appeal. \"The rule in this circuit is that a fact-specific claim of ineffective legal assistance cannot be raised initially on direct review of a criminal conviction, but must originally be presented to the district court.\" United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir. 1989). This practice exists largely to allow for full development of the record needed to \"place the adequacy of a defendant's representation into proper perspective.\" United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991). On occasion, when the trial record has included all the relevant facts, we have departed from this rule and decided ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal. See, e.g., id.; United States v. Caggiano, 899 F.2d 99, 100 (1st Cir. 1990). Osorio-Pena argues that the evidentiary hearing before the magistrate judge produced a full record of the facts relating to his ineffective assistance claim. His counsel said at oral argument that requiring him to file a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> would be \"pointless.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel \"must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). Because of the difference between this standard and the standard for \"newly discovered evidence,\" the record relevant to Osorio-Pena's ineffective assistance claim is not fully developed. While some of the evidence at the Rule 33 hearing before the magistrate judge related to the ineffective assistance claim, the defendant's motion for a new trial, and the post-trial proceedings that followed, focused primarily on whether the basis for the claim was newly discovered. The magistrate judge reached the merits of the ineffective assistance claim, but the district court did not. Osorio-Pena's brief on appeal also is primarily devoted to the Rule 33 issue rather than the underlying ineffective assistance claim. At oral argument, several factual disputes emerged that go to the merits of the ineffective assistance claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Osorio-Pena's brief does not set forth the defendant's position on several of these contested issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these factors, we think the most prudent course is to decline to decide the defendant's ineffective assistance claim. Raising that claim in a habeas petition will allow Osorio-Pena to focus squarely on why his lawyer's performance may have fallen below an objective standard of reasonableness when the lawyer decided not to file a motion to suppress the search warrant. We express no view as to the merits of this claim, see Lema, 909 F.2d at 568, or as to the magistrate judge's factual findings and the government's objection to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The magistrate judge found that while the defendant's street address is Calle 26, T#2 in the city of Caguas, he lives in the urbanizacion, or neighborhood, of Villas del Rio Verde rather than Mariolga. However, she also found that the two neighborhoods are close together and often referred to interchangeably. In addition, the magistrate said that the defendant's house is a one-story building painted (at the time of the search) light green with pink trim rather than the two-story white structure described in the warrant. The magistrate also said that it was \"still unknown\" why the warrant included no reference to Osorio-Pena, given the tip from the confidential informant and the surveillance conducted by the police.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Of course, if Osorio-Pena wanted to argue that even his lawyer did not know about the content of the warrant, he would have to demonstrate that his lawyer's failure to learn of this evidence was not due to lack of diligence to come within Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision. See Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019. Again, in the circumstances presented here, it is the diligence of the defendant through his lawyer that is at issue, not the diligence of the defendant himself.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute allows a defendant convicted in federal court to move the sentencing court to vacate, set aside or correct his or her sentence on the ground that it \"was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For example, the government said that the confidential informant brought the police to Osorio-Pena's address, and provided the information about an incoming drug delivery that supports the probable cause basis for the warrant. Osorio-Pena said that the confidential informant's tip had nothing to do with the defendant, and that there was no probable cause for the search because the police, in conducting surveillance of Osorio-Pena's house, observed no suspicious activity. This dispute may matter because to meet the standard for ineffective assistance, the defendant must show that his lawyer's failure to challenge the warrant prejudiced him. See Strickland, 466. U.S. at 687.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Citing the record's incompleteness, the government withdrew at oral argument its agreement in its brief to direct review of the ineffective assistance claim. See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309 (reviewing an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal partly because \"[n]either side suggests that there is any need for further fact-finding\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

They found drug paraphernalia and drug ledgers. Based on this evidence, Osorio-Pena was indicted on August 6 and charged with three separate counts under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1): possession with intent to distribute heroin, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Osorio-Pena pled not guilty and went to trial. On November 26, 1997, a jury found him guilty of all three counts.

On October 1, 1998, ten months after his conviction, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. Rule 33 provides that a motion for a new trial must be made within seven days after a guilty finding unless \"based on the ground of newly discovered evidence,\" in which case the motion may be made within two years after the verdict.

Osorio-Pena does not dispute that the warrant was available to his lawyer, Rodrguez-Masso (or indeed that he and his lawyer briefly discussed the warrant). Instead, he argues that he is entitled to Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" extension because the information in the warrant was unavailable to him personally at trial in two ways: (1) Rodrguez-Masso did not tell him about the warrant's inaccurate physical description of his house, other than the wrong address; and (2) even if he had known those facts, he would not have appreciated their legal significance without a lawyer's help because he is a Spanish-speaking layperson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Osorio-Pena relies primarily on our own precedent, United States v. Lema, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545476\"><a href=\"/opinion/545476/united-states-v-charles-donald-lema/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1990). Lema argued that his ineffective assistance claim met Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" standard because it was based on his lawyer's failure to investigate the existence of audiotapes made by the government which would contradict the testimony of government witnesses. Id. at 564-65. Lema contended that he was unaware of the tapes until he looked at his lawyer's file after trial and found transcripts of them. Id. at 565. On appeal, we said that \"Lema may bypass Rule 33's seven-day time limit only if his claim that his counsel failed to discover and/or review the tapes was based on information unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial.\" Id. at 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reading this statement as referring to information that is unavailable to the defendant himself, Osorio-Pena argues that any information available to his lawyer cannot be attributed to him. If he discovered facts after the trial known only to his lawyer at the time of trial, he argues, his personal discovery meets the definition of \"newly discovered evidence.\" The magistrate judge agreed with this premise in finding that Osorio-Pena's claim came within Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision because the defendant did not know of the warrant's descriptive errors, and because his failure to learn of this evidence was not due to his own lack of diligence. The premise for these findings is erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Lema sometimes discusses \"information unavailable to the defendant\" in terms of Lema's own awareness of the existence of the tapes. The court says that \"passages from the testimony make abundantly clear [that] Lema was aware at the time of trial that there were tape recordings.\" Id. at 567. The court also says: \"There is no doubt that Lema was aware at the time of trial of the existence of tapes and transcripts of the conversations to which government witnesses were testifying.\" Id. at 568.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these references to the defendant's own knowledge, the dispositive facts in Lema were defense counsel's access to the tapes before trial, references to the tapes in the docket record, and a pre-trial letter from the government to Lema's lawyer discussing them. Id. at 568 and n. 9. These facts go to defense counsel's knowledge of the tapes, not Lema's personal knowledge of them. In addition, Lema stated this general proposition: \"An interpretation that would consider facts known at the time of trial to be 'newly discovered,' if cloaked in the garb of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, flies in the face of the plain meaning of the rule and the traditional understanding of the narrowness of the time exception.\" Id. at 566. Properly read, Lema precludes defendants from prevailing under Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision when their lawyers knew at trial about the evidence that defendants now claim is newly discovered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Osorio-Pena alternately argues that the warrant's errors are newly discovered because his lawyer did not explain their legal significance to him. Lema precludes this argument as well by holding that Rule 33 puts the burden on the defendant to raise concerns about his lawyer's investigation of evidence within seven days. Id. at 568 (\"If [Lema] believed that these tapes contained exculpatory evidence and that more discovery should have been done or that his attorney inadequately represented him in this regard, he was able to raise the issue within the seven-day period governing motions for new trial.\"). The majority of circuits similarly have held that facts giving rise to ineffective assistance claims are not newly discovered evidence under Rule 33 if the facts were available to the defendant at trial but he or she did not appreciate their legal significance.

J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, \"courts have given a narrow meaning to the phrase 'newly discovered.'\" Lema, 909 F.2d at 566. This narrow interpretation reflects Rule 33's emphasis on finality. As the Seventh Circuit has said: \"The practical difficulties faced by defendants seeking to raise ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims by way of motions for a new trial . . . do not give us cause to corrupt the clear language of Rule 33. Newly discovered evidence must be newly discovered evidence.\" Ellison, 557 F.2d at 133.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to his Rule 33 motion, Osorio-Pena asks us to make the ineffective assistance determination on direct appeal. \"The rule in this circuit is that a fact-specific claim of ineffective legal assistance cannot be raised initially on direct review of a criminal conviction, but must originally be presented to the district court.\" United States v. Hunnewell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533778\"><a href=\"/opinion/533778/united-states-v-dale-scott-hunnewell/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 956 (1st Cir. 1989). This practice exists largely to allow for full development of the record needed to \"place the adequacy of a defendant's representation into proper perspective.\" United States v. Natanel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir. 1991). On occasion, when the trial record has included all the relevant facts, we have departed from this rule and decided ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal. See, e.g., id.; United States v. Caggiano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538794\"><a href=\"/opinion/538794/united-states-v-allen-j-caggiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 100 (1st Cir. 1990). Osorio-Pena argues that the evidentiary hearing before the magistrate judge produced a full record of the facts relating to his ineffective assistance claim. His counsel said at oral argument that requiring him to file a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> would be \"pointless.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel \"must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\" Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 688 (1984). Because of the difference between this standard and the standard for \"newly discovered evidence,\" the record relevant to Osorio-Pena's ineffective assistance claim is not fully developed. While some of the evidence at the Rule 33 hearing before the magistrate judge related to the ineffective assistance claim, the defendant's motion for a new trial, and the post-trial proceedings that followed, focused primarily on whether the basis for the claim was newly discovered. The magistrate judge reached the merits of the ineffective assistance claim, but the district court did not. Osorio-Pena's brief on appeal also is primarily devoted to the Rule 33 issue rather than the underlying ineffective assistance claim. At oral argument, several factual disputes emerged that go to the merits of the ineffective assistance claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Osorio-Pena's brief does not set forth the defendant's position on several of these contested issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these factors, we think the most prudent course is to decline to decide the defendant's ineffective assistance claim. Raising that claim in a habeas petition will allow Osorio-Pena to focus squarely on why his lawyer's performance may have fallen below an objective standard of reasonableness when the lawyer decided not to file a motion to suppress the search warrant. We express no view as to the merits of this claim, see Lema, 909 F.2d at 568, or as to the magistrate judge's factual findings and the government's objection to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The magistrate judge found that while the defendant's street address is Calle 26, T#2 in the city of Caguas, he lives in the urbanizacion, or neighborhood, of Villas del Rio Verde rather than Mariolga. However, she also found that the two neighborhoods are close together and often referred to interchangeably. In addition, the magistrate said that the defendant's house is a one-story building painted (at the time of the search) light green with pink trim rather than the two-story white structure described in the warrant. The magistrate also said that it was \"still unknown\" why the warrant included no reference to Osorio-Pena, given the tip from the confidential informant and the surveillance conducted by the police.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Of course, if Osorio-Pena wanted to argue that even his lawyer did not know about the content of the warrant, he would have to demonstrate that his lawyer's failure to learn of this evidence was not due to lack of diligence to come within Rule 33's \"newly discovered evidence\" provision. See Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019. Again, in the circumstances presented here, it is the diligence of the defendant through his lawyer that is at issue, not the diligence of the defendant himself.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute allows a defendant convicted in federal court to move the sentencing court to vacate, set aside or correct his or her sentence on the ground that it \"was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For example, the government said that the confidential informant brought the police to Osorio-Pena's address, and provided the information about an incoming drug delivery that supports the probable cause basis for the warrant. Osorio-Pena said that the confidential informant's tip had nothing to do with the defendant, and that there was no probable cause for the search because the police, in conducting surveillance of Osorio-Pena's house, observed no suspicious activity. This dispute may matter because to meet the standard for ineffective assistance, the defendant must show that his lawyer's failure to challenge the warrant prejudiced him. See Strickland, 466. U.S. at 687.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Citing the record's incompleteness, the government withdrew at oral argument its agreement in its brief to direct review of the ineffective assistance claim. See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309 (reviewing an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal partly because \"[n]either side suggests that there is any need for further fact-finding\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
