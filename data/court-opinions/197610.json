For the reasons elucidated  below, we\r\n\ndecline the invitation.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          A grand jury  sitting in  the District  of Puerto  Rico\r\n\nreturned a two-count  indictment against the appellant.   Count 1\r\n\ncharged  that Cabrera,  a  convicted  felon,  knowingly  received\r\n\nand/or possessed  a number of firearms that  had been transported\r\n\nin  commerce in  violation  of  18 U.S.C.      922(g) and  924(e)\r\n\n(1994).  Count 2 charged him with obliterating the manufacturer's\r\n\nserial numbers on two of these weapons   both Cobray machine guns\r\n\n  in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(k) &amp; (o) (1994).\r\n\n          The  appellant originally pleaded  not guilty.   On May\r\n\n28,  1996, he  changed course  and  signed a  so-called Plea  and\r\n\nCooperation  Agreement (the Agreement)  that set forth  the terms\r\n\nand conditions  appertaining to a  nonbinding plea bargain.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B).\r\n\n          The Agreement    each page  of which was  initialled by\r\n\nthe appellant  and his attorney    provided, inter alia,  that if\r\n\nCabrera cooperated  fully and  truthfully,  the government  would\r\n\nstipulate  to a particular set of guideline calculations designed\r\n\nto yield  a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 188 to 235 months\r\n\n(adjusted offense level  31; criminal history  category VI).   It\r\n\nclearly indicated  Cabrera's awareness that,  notwithstanding the\r\n\nstipulation,  \"the  defendant's  sentence  is  within  the  sound\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ndiscretion of the sentencing judge,\" Agreement,   6; and that, if\r\n\nthe court were to impose a sentence in excess of 235 months, \"the\r\n\ndefendant  [could] not,  for that  reason  alone, withdraw  [his]\r\n\nguilty  plea,\"  id.    The   Agreement  also  implied  that   the\r                             \r\n\ngovernment, unless  it moved for  a downward departure,  see USSG\r                                                                      \r\n\n 5K1.1  (1995)    a matter  left wholly  within its  discretion  \r\n\nwould recommend  that the  court impose a  sentence within  those\r\n\nparameters.\r\n\n          Cabrera thereupon completed a 13-page Petition to Enter\r\n\na Plea  of Guilty (the  Petition) that reinforced  the sentencing\r\n\nmessage contained  in the Agreement.   The  Petition included  an\r\n\nextensive questionnaire.  In addition to answering the questions,\r\n\nCabrera initialled each of the 13 pages, as did his attorney.\r\n\n          A change-of-plea hearing  ensued.  Judge  Casellas told\r\n\nthe appellant the purpose of the  proceeding and interrogated him\r\n\nat some length.   The appellant stated unequivocally, in response\r\n\nto direct  questions, that he  had read and  completed truthfully\r\n\nall  13  pages;  that  he  had  conferred  sufficiently  with his\r\n\ncounsel;  and  that  he  understood  that  his  guilty  plea,  if\r\n\naccepted, would effectively  waive a long list  of constitutional\r\n\nrights.     Judge  Casellas  then  requested  the  prosecutor  to\r\n\nsummarize the terms of the Agreement.1  The court made it crystal\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  prosecutor's summary was  accurate for the  most part,\r\nbut he misstated  the projected GSR, describing it as  188 to 208\r\nmonths.  Given  the express provisions of both  the Agreement and\r\nthe  Petition, and  the fact  that the  appellant and  his lawyer\r\nvouchsafed the prosecutor's  summary of the Agreement,  we attach\r\nno  decretory significance  to  this lapsus  linguae.   We  note,\r                                                              \r\nmoreover, that  the presentence investigation report,  which both\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nclear  that  the sentence  to  be  imposed  was within  its  sole\r\n\ndiscretion,  subject only  to  the  limits set  by  law, and  the\r\n\nappellant acknowledged that he understood as much.\r\n\n          Judge Casellas then reviewed the allegations of count 1\r\n\nwith  the appellant  and  informed him  of  the maximum  possible\r\n\npenalty.  However, the judge failed to mention that the appellant\r\n\ncould not withdraw his  guilty plea if the  court decided not  to\r\n\nfollow the sentencing recommendation contained in the Agreement.\r\n\n          The district court convened  the disposition hearing on\r\n\nDecember  3,  1996.    At the  outset,  the  appellant's  counsel\r\n\nconfirmed  that both he and his  client had read and reviewed the\r\n\npresentence investigation report, that the report  was \"accurate\"\r\n\nand  \"fair-minded,\"  and  that  they  had  no  objection  to  its\r\n\ncontents.   In  his  allocution,  the  appellant  importuned  the\r\n\ncourt's forgiveness.   For its  part, the  government did  little\r\n\nmore  than stand by the Agreement and the sentencing calculations\r\n\ncontained therein.\r\n\n          In  pronouncing  sentence,  Judge  Casellas  in  effect\r\n\naccepted  the parties' earlier  stipulation, determining that the\r\n\napplicable GSR was 188 to 235 months.  He sentenced the appellant\r\n\nat the apex of the range, but within it.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          The  appellant's central thesis is that his guilty plea\r\n\nwas involuntary because  he was unaware of its  consequences.  He\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthe appellant and  his attorney read and pronounced \"accurate\" in\r\nadvance of sentencing, tracked the  Agreement and the Petition in\r\ndescribing the GSR as 188 to 235 months.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsupports this  thesis in  two ways.   First, he  claims that  the\r\n\npresiding judge failed to warn him that he could not withdraw his\r\n\nguilty plea  if the judge  decided not to adopt  the government's\r\n\nsentencing  recommendation.    Second,  he asseverates  that  the\r\n\ngovernment breached the Agreement.  We turn first to the question\r\n\nof appealability and then consider the appellant's arguments.\r\n\n                        A.  Appealability.\r                                  A.  Appealability.\r                                                   \r\n\n          Rule 11 exists as a means of safeguarding the fairness,\r\n\nintegrity,  and public reputation  of judicial proceedings.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d 588, 593 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                       \r\n\nAmong  other  things, the  rule  is  intended  to ensure  that  a\r\n\ndefendant who pleads guilty does so with an \"understanding of the\r\n\nnature of the charge and the consequences of his plea.\"  McCarthy\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. United  States, 394  U.S.  459, 467  (1969).   Because of  the\r                           \r\n\nimportance of the interests  that Rule 11 protects,  we sometimes\r\n\nwill entertain on  direct appeal a Rule 11  challenge even though\r\n\nthe  essence of the  challenge was not  raised in the  nisi prius\r\n\ncourt.  See, e.g., United States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 10 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir. 1997); Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d at 593.  This is such a case.\r                                  \r\n\n                      B.  The Plea Colloquy.\r                                B.  The Plea Colloquy.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Fed. R. Crim.  P. 11(e)(2) specifically  provides, with\r\n\nrespect to  nonbinding plea  agreements,2 that  \"the court  shall\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The plea agreement at issue here is of this stripe, drawing\r\nits essence  from  Fed. R.  Crim.  P. 11(e)(1)(B).   In  it,  the\r\nprosecutor  effectively  agreed  to  take  a  position  vis- -vis\r\nsentencing (i.e., not  opposing a sentence within  the stipulated\r\nGSR), with the understanding that this \"recommendation\" would not\r\nbind the court.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nadvise  the defendant  that  if  the court  does  not accept  the\r\n\n[sentencing] recommendation or request the defendant nevertheless\r\n\nhas  no  right to  withdraw  the plea.\"    In this  instance, the\r\n\ndistrict judge conducted a painstaking Rule 11  colloquy in which\r\n\nhe inquired about the  Agreement and reminded the appellant  that\r\n\nthe government's sentencing recommendation was not binding on the\r\n\ncourt.   There was,  however, a flaw:   the judge  never told the\r\n\nappellant explicitly that he would be unable to withdraw his plea\r\n\nshould  the court  fail  to  act in  accordance  with the  agreed\r\n\ndisposition.\r\n\n          Notwithstanding the importance of the prophylaxis  that\r\n\nRule   11  prescribes,  the  detection   of  an  error  does  not\r\n\nnecessarily require vacation of a defendant's plea.  The drafters\r\n\nof  Rule  11  made  it  pellucid  that  \"any  variance  from  the\r\n\nprocedures   required  by  this   rule  which  does   not  affect\r\n\nsubstantial rights  shall  be disregarded.\"    Fed. R.  Crim.  P.\r\n\n11(h).  Under this proviso,  \"even an error implicating Rule 11's\r\n\ncore  concerns will  not require  vacating a  guilty plea  if the\r\n\nerror,  in context,  is harmless.\"    McDonald, 121  F.3d at  11.\r                                                        \r\n\nThus, the question before us  reduces to the harmlessness vel non\r                                                                           \r\n\nof the judge's omission.3\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3When a defendant moves in the district court to withdraw an\r\nearlier guilty  plea, we  customarily test  the district  court's\r\nresolution of  that motion through  a multi-faceted format.   See\r                                                                           \r\nUnited States v.  Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d  19, 22-23 (1st  Cir.\r                                            \r\n1994); United  States v. Parrilla-Tirado,  22 F.3d 368,  371 (1st\r                                                  \r\nCir. 1994).   We occasionally  have utilized this same  method of\r\nanalysis in cases in which a defendant alleges for the first time\r\non appeal that the sentencing court violated Rule 11.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\nUnited States v. Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.3d 693, 696 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          To  be sure,  due  process  demands that  a  plea in  a\r\n\ncriminal case \"be made voluntarily, knowingly, intelligently, and\r\n\nwith  an  awareness  of the  overall  circumstances  and probable\r\n\nconsequences.\"  Id. (citing Boykin  v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 243\r                                                        \r\n\nn.5 (1969)).  In failing to  apprise the appellant of one of  the\r\n\nconsequences that would flow from the  court's disapproval of the\r\n\nprosecutor's  sentencing   recommendation,  the   district  court\r\n\nblemished an  otherwise impeccable  plea colloquy, violated  Rule\r\n\n11, and precipitated  a due process  challenge.  Nonetheless,  in\r\n\nthe idiosyncratic circumstances  of this case, the  court's error\r\n\ndid not  impair the appellant's  substantial rights.   We explain\r\n\nbriefly.\r\n\n          In  evaluating  incipient  Rule 11  violations,  courts\r\n\nshould focus on the reality of events as reflected by  the record\r\n\nand take  care not  to elevate form  over substance.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Noriega-Mill n, 110 F.3d 162, 167 (1st Cir. 1997).  For\r                                  \r\n\npurposes of this appeal, the pivotal datum is that the court  did\r\n\nnot abandon the prosecutor's recommendation, but, rather, imposed\r\n\na sentence of 235 months.  This sentence fell at the apex of, but\r\n\nwithin,  the agreed sentencing range.   The omitted warning would\r\n\nhave served  to inform the  appellant of the consequences  of his\r\n\nplea should the court impose a sentence outside the agreed range;\r                                                         \r\n\nthat warning  would not  have added to  the appellant's  store of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\ndenied,  116  S.  Ct.  259 (1995).    The  multi-part  test  is a\r                \r\ndiagnostic aid, not an obligatory ritual.  See McDonald, 121 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\nat  10  n.2.    Here,  both  the  trial  court's  error  and  the\r\nharmlessness of that  error are manifest; consequently,  there is\r\nno need to resort to the multi-part test.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nknowledge if  the court imposed a  sentence within the  GSR.

It follows  inexorably that,  since the contingency  of\r\n\nwhich the court failed to  apprise the appellant never arose, the\r\n\ncourt's error was benign.   See, e.g., McDonald, 121 F.3d  at 11;\r                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

The record  offers every indication that, despite the\r\n\ncourt's lapse, the appellant had actual knowledge of the  omitted\r\n\nfact.   Indeed,  he acknowledged  as much  in the  Agreement, the\r\n\nPetition, and the  questionnaire that  accompanied the  Petition.\r\n\nSince there is no reasonable likelihood that the court's omission\r\n\naffected the appellant's  willingness to plead guilty,  a finding\r\n\nof  harmlessness is  appropriate.   See, e.g.,  Chan, 97  F.3d at\r                                                              \r\n\n1584; United States v.

He  also asserts that  the government, in  exchange\r\n\nfor his  guilty plea, agreed  to drop count 2  of the indictment,\r\n\nyet failed  to mention that count to the judge at the disposition\r\n\nhearing.  These assertions are not persuasive.\r\n\n          Passing  the  very   real  question   of  whether   the\r\n\nappellant's  assertions are procedurally defaulted   a claim that\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\na prosecutor breached  a plea agreement ordinarily  must make its\r\n\ndebut in the district court, see  United States v.

Without an explicit  commitment to that  effect in\r\n\nthe  agreement itself,  there is  no breach.   See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

This is especially\r                  \r\n\ntrue where, as here, the Agreement contains an integration clause\r\n\nthat   expressly  disavows  commitments  not  set  forth  in  the\r\n\nAgreement's text.4\r\n\n          Insofar as count  2 is concerned,  the short answer  is\r\n\nthat the district court docket  shows that the prosecutor filed a\r\n\nwritten motion to dismiss that count on the day of sentencing and\r\n\nthe court granted the motion.  That ends the matter:  despite the\r\n\nfact that the prosecutor did not mention count  2 during his oral\r\n\npresentation  at the disposition hearing, the  count is no longer\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Paragraph 23 of the Agreement reads as follows:\r\n\n          This   written   agreement   constitutes  the\r\n          complete  Plea Agreement  between the  United\r\n          States,  the defendant,  and the  defendant's\r\n          counsel.   The  United  States  has  made  no\r\n          promises  or  representations except  as  set\r\n          forth in writing in  this plea agreement  and\r\n          deny  [sic] the existence  of any  other term\r\n          and conditions not stated herein.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nzoetic and, therefore, the appellant received the full benefit of\r\n\nhis bargain.\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go  no further.  The purpose  of insisting that\r\n\nthe judge inform a defendant that  he will not have the right  to\r\n\nwithdraw his guilty  plea if the  court eschews the  prosecutor's\r\n\nsentencing  recommendation is to ensure that the defendant is not\r\n\ninduced  to change  his plea  without being  aware of  a relevant\r\n\ncontingency.  That purpose  was not in any way  frustrated by the\r\n\nomission  that   occurred  here   since  the   contingency  never\r\n\nmaterialized.   Thus, because the district  court's bevue did not\r\n\nharm  or  prejudice  the appellant,  and  because  the government\r\n\nabided by its Agreement, the appeal implodes.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n",

For the reasons elucidated  below, we\r\n\ndecline the invitation.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          A grand jury  sitting in  the District  of Puerto  Rico\r\n\nreturned a two-count  indictment against the appellant.   Count 1\r\n\ncharged  that Cabrera,  a  convicted  felon,  knowingly  received\r\n\nand/or possessed  a number of firearms that  had been transported\r\n\nin  commerce in  violation  of  18 U.S.C.      922(g) and  924(e)\r\n\n(1994).  Count 2 charged him with obliterating the manufacturer's\r\n\nserial numbers on two of these weapons   both Cobray machine guns\r\n\n  in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(k) &amp; (o) (1994).\r\n\n          The  appellant originally pleaded  not guilty.   On May\r\n\n28,  1996, he  changed course  and  signed a  so-called Plea  and\r\n\nCooperation  Agreement (the Agreement)  that set forth  the terms\r\n\nand conditions  appertaining to a  nonbinding plea bargain.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B).\r\n\n          The Agreement    each page  of which was  initialled by\r\n\nthe appellant  and his attorney    provided, inter alia,  that if\r\n\nCabrera cooperated  fully and  truthfully,  the government  would\r\n\nstipulate  to a particular set of guideline calculations designed\r\n\nto yield  a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 188 to 235 months\r\n\n(adjusted offense level  31; criminal history  category VI).   It\r\n\nclearly indicated  Cabrera's awareness that,  notwithstanding the\r\n\nstipulation,  \"the  defendant's  sentence  is  within  the  sound\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ndiscretion of the sentencing judge,\" Agreement,   6; and that, if\r\n\nthe court were to impose a sentence in excess of 235 months, \"the\r\n\ndefendant  [could] not,  for that  reason  alone, withdraw  [his]\r\n\nguilty  plea,\"  id.    The   Agreement  also  implied  that   the\r                             \r\n\ngovernment, unless  it moved for  a downward departure,  see USSG\r                                                                      \r\n\n 5K1.1  (1995)    a matter  left wholly  within its  discretion  \r\n\nwould recommend  that the  court impose a  sentence within  those\r\n\nparameters.\r\n\n          Cabrera thereupon completed a 13-page Petition to Enter\r\n\na Plea  of Guilty (the  Petition) that reinforced  the sentencing\r\n\nmessage contained  in the Agreement.   The  Petition included  an\r\n\nextensive questionnaire.  In addition to answering the questions,\r\n\nCabrera initialled each of the 13 pages, as did his attorney.\r\n\n          A change-of-plea hearing  ensued.  Judge  Casellas told\r\n\nthe appellant the purpose of the  proceeding and interrogated him\r\n\nat some length.   The appellant stated unequivocally, in response\r\n\nto direct  questions, that he  had read and  completed truthfully\r\n\nall  13  pages;  that  he  had  conferred  sufficiently  with his\r\n\ncounsel;  and  that  he  understood  that  his  guilty  plea,  if\r\n\naccepted, would effectively  waive a long list  of constitutional\r\n\nrights.     Judge  Casellas  then  requested  the  prosecutor  to\r\n\nsummarize the terms of the Agreement.1  The court made it crystal\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  prosecutor's summary was  accurate for the  most part,\r\nbut he misstated  the projected GSR, describing it as  188 to 208\r\nmonths.  Given  the express provisions of both  the Agreement and\r\nthe  Petition, and  the fact  that the  appellant and  his lawyer\r\nvouchsafed the prosecutor's  summary of the Agreement,  we attach\r\nno  decretory significance  to  this lapsus  linguae.   We  note,\r                                                              \r\nmoreover, that  the presentence investigation report,  which both\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nclear  that  the sentence  to  be  imposed  was within  its  sole\r\n\ndiscretion,  subject only  to  the  limits set  by  law, and  the\r\n\nappellant acknowledged that he understood as much.\r\n\n          Judge Casellas then reviewed the allegations of count 1\r\n\nwith  the appellant  and  informed him  of  the maximum  possible\r\n\npenalty.  However, the judge failed to mention that the appellant\r\n\ncould not withdraw his  guilty plea if the  court decided not  to\r\n\nfollow the sentencing recommendation contained in the Agreement.\r\n\n          The district court convened  the disposition hearing on\r\n\nDecember  3,  1996.    At the  outset,  the  appellant's  counsel\r\n\nconfirmed  that both he and his  client had read and reviewed the\r\n\npresentence investigation report, that the report  was \"accurate\"\r\n\nand  \"fair-minded,\"  and  that  they  had  no  objection  to  its\r\n\ncontents.   In  his  allocution,  the  appellant  importuned  the\r\n\ncourt's forgiveness.   For its  part, the  government did  little\r\n\nmore  than stand by the Agreement and the sentencing calculations\r\n\ncontained therein.\r\n\n          In  pronouncing  sentence,  Judge  Casellas  in  effect\r\n\naccepted  the parties' earlier  stipulation, determining that the\r\n\napplicable GSR was 188 to 235 months.  He sentenced the appellant\r\n\nat the apex of the range, but within it.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          The  appellant's central thesis is that his guilty plea\r\n\nwas involuntary because  he was unaware of its  consequences.  He\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthe appellant and  his attorney read and pronounced \"accurate\" in\r\nadvance of sentencing, tracked the  Agreement and the Petition in\r\ndescribing the GSR as 188 to 235 months.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsupports this  thesis in  two ways.   First, he  claims that  the\r\n\npresiding judge failed to warn him that he could not withdraw his\r\n\nguilty plea  if the judge  decided not to adopt  the government's\r\n\nsentencing  recommendation.    Second,  he asseverates  that  the\r\n\ngovernment breached the Agreement.  We turn first to the question\r\n\nof appealability and then consider the appellant's arguments.\r\n\n                        A.  Appealability.\r                                  A.

In  it,  the\r\nprosecutor  effectively  agreed  to  take  a  position  vis- -vis\r\nsentencing (i.e., not  opposing a sentence within  the stipulated\r\nGSR), with the understanding that this \"recommendation\" would not\r\nbind the court.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nadvise  the defendant  that  if  the court  does  not accept  the\r\n\n[sentencing] recommendation or request the defendant nevertheless\r\n\nhas  no  right to  withdraw  the plea.\"    In this  instance, the\r\n\ndistrict judge conducted a painstaking Rule 11  colloquy in which\r\n\nhe inquired about the  Agreement and reminded the appellant  that\r\n\nthe government's sentencing recommendation was not binding on the\r\n\ncourt.   There was,  however, a flaw:   the judge  never told the\r\n\nappellant explicitly that he would be unable to withdraw his plea\r\n\nshould  the court  fail  to  act in  accordance  with the  agreed\r\n\ndisposition.\r\n\n          Notwithstanding the importance of the prophylaxis  that\r\n\nRule   11  prescribes,  the  detection   of  an  error  does  not\r\n\nnecessarily require vacation of a defendant's plea.  The drafters\r\n\nof  Rule  11  made  it  pellucid  that  \"any  variance  from  the\r\n\nprocedures   required  by  this   rule  which  does   not  affect\r\n\nsubstantial rights  shall  be disregarded.\"    Fed. R.  Crim.  P.\r\n\n11(h).  Under this proviso,  \"even an error implicating Rule 11's\r\n\ncore  concerns will  not require  vacating a  guilty plea  if the\r\n\nerror,  in context,  is harmless.\"    McDonald, 121  F.3d at  11.\r                                                        \r\n\nThus, the question before us  reduces to the harmlessness vel non\r                                                                           \r\n\nof the judge's omission.3\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3When a defendant moves in the district court to withdraw an\r\nearlier guilty  plea, we  customarily test  the district  court's\r\nresolution of  that motion through  a multi-faceted format.

In failing to  apprise the appellant of one of  the\r\n\nconsequences that would flow from the  court's disapproval of the\r\n\nprosecutor's  sentencing   recommendation,  the   district  court\r\n\nblemished an  otherwise impeccable  plea colloquy, violated  Rule\r\n\n11, and precipitated  a due process  challenge.  Nonetheless,  in\r\n\nthe idiosyncratic circumstances  of this case, the  court's error\r\n\ndid not  impair the appellant's  substantial rights.

For\r                                  \r\n\npurposes of this appeal, the pivotal datum is that the court  did\r\n\nnot abandon the prosecutor's recommendation, but, rather, imposed\r\n\na sentence of 235 months.  This sentence fell at the apex of, but\r\n\nwithin,  the agreed sentencing range.   The omitted warning would\r\n\nhave served  to inform the  appellant of the consequences  of his\r\n\nplea should the court impose a sentence outside the agreed range;\r                                                         \r\n\nthat warning  would not  have added to  the appellant's  store of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\ndenied,  116  S.  Ct.  259 (1995).    The  multi-part  test  is a\r                \r\ndiagnostic aid, not an obligatory ritual.  See McDonald, 121 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\nat  10  n.2.    Here,  both  the  trial  court's  error  and  the\r\nharmlessness of that  error are manifest; consequently,  there is\r\nno need to resort to the multi-part test.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nknowledge if  the court imposed a  sentence within the  GSR.

It follows  inexorably that,  since the contingency  of\r\n\nwhich the court failed to  apprise the appellant never arose, the\r\n\ncourt's error was benign.   See, e.g., McDonald, 121 F.3d  at 11;\r                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

The record  offers every indication that, despite the\r\n\ncourt's lapse, the appellant had actual knowledge of the  omitted\r\n\nfact.   Indeed,  he acknowledged  as much  in the  Agreement, the\r\n\nPetition, and the  questionnaire that  accompanied the  Petition.\r\n\nSince there is no reasonable likelihood that the court's omission\r\n\naffected the appellant's  willingness to plead guilty,  a finding\r\n\nof  harmlessness is  appropriate.

This is especially\r                  \r\n\ntrue where, as here, the Agreement contains an integration clause\r\n\nthat   expressly  disavows  commitments  not  set  forth  in  the\r\n\nAgreement's text.4\r\n\n          Insofar as count  2 is concerned,  the short answer  is\r\n\nthat the district court docket  shows that the prosecutor filed a\r\n\nwritten motion to dismiss that count on the day of sentencing and\r\n\nthe court granted the motion.  That ends the matter:  despite the\r\n\nfact that the prosecutor did not mention count  2 during his oral\r\n\npresentation  at the disposition hearing, the  count is no longer\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Paragraph 23 of the Agreement reads as follows:\r\n\n          This   written   agreement   constitutes  the\r\n          complete  Plea Agreement  between the  United\r\n          States,  the defendant,  and the  defendant's\r\n          counsel.

The purpose  of insisting that\r\n\nthe judge inform a defendant that  he will not have the right  to\r\n\nwithdraw his guilty  plea if the  court eschews the  prosecutor's\r\n\nsentencing  recommendation is to ensure that the defendant is not\r\n\ninduced  to change  his plea  without being  aware of  a relevant\r\n\ncontingency.  That purpose  was not in any way  frustrated by the\r\n\nomission  that   occurred  here   since  the   contingency  never\r\n\nmaterialized.   Thus, because the district  court's bevue did not\r\n\nharm  or  prejudice  the appellant,  and  because  the government\r\n\nabided by its Agreement, the appeal implodes.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n</pre>",
