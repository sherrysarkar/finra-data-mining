BRENNAN,\r\n\n                 Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n          GTE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS CORPORATION,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n    [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n      Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nPaul M. Stein with whom Thomas O. Moriarty was on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nArthur G. Telegen with whom Michael L. Rosen and Tracey E.\r\nSpruce were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 16, 1998\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  Daniel Brennan's twenty-year-\r\nlong employment with GTE Government Systems Corporation (\"GTE\")\r\nended in March 1993 when he was terminated as part of a reduction\r\nin force.  Brennan, who was fifty years old at the time of his\r\ntermination, brought suit claiming that he was discharged as a\r\nresult of age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination\r\nin Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.  621-634 (\"ADEA\"), and Mass. Gen.\r\nLaws ch. 151B,  4 (\"ch. 151B\").  He also alleged a state law\r\nmisrepresentation claim, asserting that GTE fraudulently and\r\nnegligently misrepresented its policies and procedures for laying\r\noff employees.  The district court dismissed the state claim upon\r\nsummary judgment and granted judgment as a matter of law at the\r\nclose of evidence.  Brennan challenges the rulings, and contests\r\nthe court's exclusion of certain evidence.  We find error in one of\r\nthe evidentiary rulings relevant to establishment of a prima facie\r\ncase.  We also conclude that there was sufficient evidence to\r\ncreate jury issues on pretext and age discrimination.  We therefore\r\nreverse the directed verdicts for GTE on the federal and state age\r\ndiscrimination claims but affirm the dismissal of the\r\nmisrepresentation claim.\r\nI.  Factual Background\r\nBrennan began working at GTE in 1973 as a senior technician\r\nand later held a series of different engineering positions.  In\r\n1986, he accepted a position as an integration and test engineer in\r\nthe Mobile Subscriber Equipment System (\"MSE\") division.  Created\r\nin 1986, the MSE division developed in response to a contract\r\nbetween GTE and the United States Army for a comprehensive\r\ncommunications system.  In mid 1992, the division was reorganized\r\nand Brennan was assigned to work in the Circuit Switching and\r\nSystems Control department, headed by John Van Dolman.  His job as\r\nan integration and test engineer involved designing and overseeing\r\nthe MSE testing process.  \r\nThe record contains performance appraisals extending from 1976\r\nto June 1992 consistently describing Brennan as meeting job\r\nexpectations.  In late 1992, GTE assigned Brennan to fill in for\r\nCarl Bredberg, a systems engineer whose job was to troubleshoot MSE\r\nfield problems, after Bredberg suffered a heart attack.     \r\nIn September 1992, MSE engineering department managers Van\r\nDolman and Kevin Flynn each prepared \"Work Force Analysis Forms\" in\r\nanticipation of a reduction in force planned for November 2, 1992. \r\nThese forms set forth positions to be eliminated, employees\r\nperforming those functions, and the names of individuals\r\nrecommended for termination.  Van Dolman identified \"System\r\nIntegration and Test Procedure Writer\" as the function to be\r\neliminated and Brennan as the only employee for termination,\r\nstating that Brennan lacked the skill mix to do the remaining work. \r\nThe function eliminated by Flynn was \"Senior System Engineer.\"  Two\r\npersons, each sixty-three years old, out of nine employees in that\r\nposition were identified for layoff. \r\nGTE, however, did not go forward with the planned reduction in\r\nforce.  Instead, in December 1992, it notified employees of its\r\nneed to reduce staff as a result of general downsizing in the\r\ndefense industry, and offered a voluntary separation incentive\r\nprogram and an enhanced early retirement program as \"first step[s]\r\nin realigning [GTE] staffing levels.\"  GTE announced that the\r\nprograms were entirely voluntary, but would be offered only from\r\nJanuary 11, 1993 until February 5, 1993.  Under the early\r\nretirement program, available to all employees fifty and older,\r\nBrennan could retire with pension and medical benefits that would\r\notherwise not be available to him until January 1, 1996.  Brennan,\r\nhowever, declined the offered program, believing that his seniority\r\nwould prevent him from being selected for layoff.\r\nOn December 7, 1992, Allen Sherwood, manager of the MSE\r\ndivision at that time, developed a \"rating and ranking\" of\r\nemployees in the engineering division in anticipation of a layoff. \r\nBrennan was listed as the lowest ranking of thirty-three employees\r\nat grade levels six and seven.  The rating and ranking included\r\nthree categories of grades (3-5, 6-7, 8-11), and then listed the\r\nemployees who, out of a total of ninety-six, ranked among the\r\nbottom thirty percent of all employees.  On this list, Brennan\r\nranked ninety-third, or fourth from the lowest.  Other terminated\r\nemployees had similar, although not quite as low, rankings as\r\nBrennan.  The ages of employees listed in the rating and ranking\r\nwere admitted as evidence.  A high number of fifty and older\r\nemployees were ranked in the bottom thirty percent.\r\nOn February 26, 1993, Van Dolman prepared another Work\r\nAnalysis Form, identifying \"System Integration Testing and Test\r\nProcedure Writing\" as the function to be eliminated.  He listed\r\nfourteen persons in this position prior to the reduction in force,\r\nout of which five were proposed for separation.  Brennan, who was\r\nthen fifty, along with four others (aged thirty-one, thirty-four,\r\nfifty-seven and fifty-nine) were identified as \"not possess[ing]\r\nthe skills to perform the remaining work available.\"  The form also\r\nset forth the specific skills these workers lacked, namely,\r\n\"detailed knowledge as required to troubleshoot and resolve System\r\nlevel problems.\"  Brennan, John Hartgrove (fifty-seven), and John\r\nHurley (thirty-seven), were also described as unable to perform\r\n\"design related Systems work.\"  The listed reasons for termination\r\nwere \"wrong skill mix to do work remaining\" and \"lowest performance\r\nrating.\"  Under \"additional comments\" was written, \"rating and\r\nranking verifies above decisions.\"\r\nTwo days later, Van Dolman completed a Work Force Analysis\r\nForm to reduce another section of the MSE division, System Design\r\nActivities.  Of the four persons he listed as working in that\r\nsection, he selected the only over fifty employee, Al Ricard, for\r\ntermination.  The remaining three employees, all retained, were in\r\ntheir late twenties or early thirties.  Van Dolman described Ricard\r\nas unable to \"perform complex system engineering level design\r\ntasks.\"  Reasons for termination and additional comments\r\nreferencing the rating and ranking were the same as those listed\r\nfor Brennan.  \r\nIn late March 1993, Brennan was informed that he would be\r\nterminated on April 2, 1993.  Brennan testified that when he\r\napproached Van Dolman about the decision, Van Dolman stated, \"I was\r\ntold it wouldn't matter to you guys.\"  Brennan believed \"you guys\"\r\nreferred to the fifty and older employees, and \"wouldn't matter\"\r\nreferred to the retirement packages Van Dolman believed to be\r\navailable to employees aged fifty and older.  Van Dolman testified\r\nthat he could have made the statement, but did not recall doing so. \r\nBrennan also testified that during his employment with GTE, he and\r\nother older employees were not given new computers or new\r\nassignments, which were instead designated for younger employees.\r\nThe fifty and older employees discharged as a result of the\r\nWork Force Analysis Forms, including Brennan, were the only fifty\r\nand older employees remaining in the two MSE departments subject to\r\nlayoff.  Other persons in this age group who had worked in these\r\ndepartments chose voluntary separation or early retirement before\r\nthe layoffs.               II.  The Age Discrimination Claims\r\nThe central aspect of our review involves Brennan's appeal\r\nfrom directed verdict on his age discrimination claims.  The\r\ndistrict court found that Brennan had not established the required\r\nprima facie case, had not shown that GTE's reason for discharging\r\nhim was pretextual, and did not present sufficient evidence to\r\nsupport a finding of discriminatory animus.  We review the grant of\r\na motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo, taking the facts\r\nmost favorable to Brennan.  See Russo v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,\r\n1998 WL 125022, at *1 (1st Cir. March 25, 1998).  Brennan must\r\nprovide \"'more than a scintilla of evidence and may not rely on\r\nconjecture or speculation' to justify the submission of an issue to\r\nthe jury.\"  Id. (quoting Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 28\r\n(1st Cir. 1996)).  \"The court, however, must 'not consider the\r\ncredibility of the witnesses, resolve the conflicts in testimony,\r\nor evaluate the weight of the evidence.'\"  Andrade v. Jamestown\r\nHousing Authority, 82 F.3d 1179, 1186 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing\r\nWagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir. 1987)).  A verdict\r\nmay be directed only if, applying these standards, the evidence\r\ndoes not permit a reasonable jury to find in favor of Brennan.  Seeid.   \r\nAs part of his age discrimination case, Brennan alleged\r\nevidentiary errors, which we review for abuse of discretion.  SeeKelley v. Airborne Freight Corp., 1998 WL 150958, at *8 (1st Cir.\r\nApril 7, 1998).  We will not upset a verdict for \"any error or\r\ndefect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial\r\nrights of the parties.\"  Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 61).\r\nTo review the court's determinations, we begin by setting\r\nforth the burden shifting framework of the controlling\r\ndiscrimination law.  We note that until the last step in the\r\nframework, discussed infra, Massachusetts law parallels federal\r\nlaw.  See Kelley, 1998 WL 150958, at *11. \r\nA.   The burden shifting framework \r\nThe plaintiff's initial burden to establish a prima facie case\r\nof discrimination is \"not onerous.\"  Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil\r\nCo., 37 F.3d 712, 719 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Texas Dep't of\r\nCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981)).  \"All that\r\nis needed is the production of admissible evidence which, if\r\nuncontradicted, would justify a legal conclusion of\r\ndiscrimination.\"  Id.  In a reduction in force case like this one,\r\na plaintiff must demonstrate:  (1) he was at least forty years of\r\nage; (2) he met the employer's legitimate job performance\r\nexpectations; (3) he experienced adverse employment action; and (4)\r\nhis employer did not treat age neutrally or younger persons were\r\nretained in the same position.  See Hidalgo v. Overseas Condado\r\nIns. Agencies, Inc., 120 F.3d 328, 333 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting\r\nGoldman v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st\r\nCir. 1993)).  Once the plaintiff establishes the prima facie\r\nrequirements, a rebuttable presumption that the employer engaged in\r\nintentional age based discrimination attaches.  See Woodman v.\r\nHaemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1091 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nThe burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a\r\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the decision.  See Thomasv. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 1998 WL 219793, at *1 (1st Cir. May 8,\r\n1998).  If the employer meets its burden, the presumption of\r\ndiscrimination vanishes.  See Woodman, 51 F.3d at 1091.  \r\nAt this point, although the burden returns to the plaintiff in\r\nboth instances, state and federal law no longer parallel each\r\nother.  Under the ADEA, we inquire whether the evidence as a whole\r\nwould permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the proffered\r\nreason was pretextual and the true reason was an age-based animus. \r\nSee Hidalgo, 120 F.3d at 335 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 515 (1993)).  Under ch. 151B plaintiff's\r\nburden may be limited to demonstrating pretext, without a required\r\nshowing of discriminatory animus.  See Kelley, 1998 WL 150958, at\r\n*11; McMillan v. Massachusetts Soc'y for the Prevention of Cruelty\r\nto Animals, 140 F.3d 288, 298 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir. 1998); Blare v.\r\nHusky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., 419 Mass. 437, 444-45,\r\n646 N.E.2d 111 (1995).  The distinction does not matter in this\r\ncase, however, as we find that plaintiff's evidence rises to the\r\nlevel required by the ADEA to overcome a directed verdict. \r\nB.   The prima facie case\r\nIt is undisputed that, as a fifty-year-old man who was\r\nterminated by GTE, Brennan meets the first and third prongs of his\r\nprima facie case.  As to the second, Brennan has submitted\r\nperformance reviews dating back to 1976 and running through June\r\n1992.  He received acceptable rankings in virtually every\r\nappraisal, although he only occasionally received the highest\r\nranking.  For example, in the most recent ranking, covering the\r\nperiod of January to June 1992, he was rated \"met expectations\" for\r\nall categories of work, except in the area of \"control/follow-up\"\r\nin which he was rated \"exceeded expectations.\"  Out of five\r\npossible overall performance ratings, he was given a three, which\r\nis described as \"Employee meets all individual objectives as\r\nestablished in the performance plan, performs all job\r\nresponsibilities to meet the requirements of the job and displays\r\na satisfactory degree of competence in the skills required of the\r\njob.\"  And, under \"comments,\" the review  stated, \"Dan has the\r\nability to quickly become technically competent in tasks assigned\r\nto him and accomplish the task in a timely manner to meet\r\nschedules\" and \"Dan is very supportive to the changing priorities\r\nrequired to support the overall mission.\"\r\nGTE strives to characterize the \"legitimate job expectations\"\r\nstandard as covering what it maintains to be the new, downsized\r\nrequirements expected of the future MSE division.  Such an\r\ninterpretation would render irrelevant the remaining burden\r\nshifting requirements (the employer's articulation of a legitimate\r\nreason would be incorporated, de facto, into the job expectation\r\nstandard, and the employee's obligation to demonstrate pretext\r\nwould have to be fought at the prima facie stage), and would be an\r\n\"onerous\" endeavor, beyond the confines of a prima facie case.  We\r\nthink the gauge therefore should be whether the employee has a\r\nrecord of performing acceptably and meeting the demands of his job. \r\nBrennan's evidence is more than sufficient to meet the second prong\r\nof the prima facie case.  \r\nIt was the fourth prong, lack of age-neutral decisionmaking,\r\nwhere the district court found Brennan's evidence inadequate.  Our\r\nanalysis demands that we consider whether the district court\r\nproperly excluded evidence as to other employees.  \"[L]ack of\r\nneutrality may be manifested either by a facially discriminatory\r\npolicy or by a policy which, though age-neutral on its face, has\r\nthe effect of discriminating against older persons, say, by leading\r\ninexorably to the retention of younger employees while similarly\r\nsituated older employees are given their walking papers.\"  Vega v.\r\nKodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nA judge should not exclude relevant evidence, unless its\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice.  See McMillan, 140 F.3d at 300 (citing Fed. R. Evid.\r\n403).  Evidence that other terminated fifty and older employees had\r\ngood employment records, skills in certain areas of the job, and\r\nsuperior experience to retained employees is relevant to\r\ndetermining whether a policy has the effect of discriminating\r\nagainst older persons.  Among the evidence offered by Brennan but\r\nexcluded by the district court was a comparison between work\r\nperformed by Tessmer, who was fifty-nine, and a thirty-year-old\r\nemployee who was retained.  Brennan also proffered evidence\r\ncomparing the work record of Ricard, who was fifty-seven, rated at\r\na level of three, and discharged, with that of Craig Poole, who was\r\ntwenty-eight, given the same rating, trained by Ricard, and\r\nretained.  This evidence was also excluded.  \r\nWhile \"proof of a general atmosphere of discrimination is not\r\nthe equivalent of proof of discrimination against an individual,\"\r\nit \"may add 'color' to an employer's decisionmaking process.\"  Ruizv. Posadas de San Juan Assoc., 124 F.3d 243, 249 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nCertainly comparative evidence in combination with data showing a\r\ndisproportionate number of terminated older employees is probative\r\nof age discrimination.  See Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1119 (excluding\r\nnumerical evidence because no comparative evidence was introduced). \r\nWe are not faced here with determining whether this evidence proves\r\nage discriminatory animus, but rather are concerned only with\r\nwhether this evidence indicates lack of neutrality.  As we have\r\nrepeatedly emphasized, this is not a burdensome standard.  SeeWoodman, 51 F.3d at 1091.  \r\nCombined with the raw data indicating the ages of the persons\r\nlisted in the rating and ranking and terminated in the reduction in\r\nforce, the evidence regarding other employees and testimony by\r\nBrennan indicating that the company gave preference to younger\r\nemployees in distributing computers demonstrate \"lack of\r\nneutrality\" sufficient to meet Brennan's burden of establishing a\r\nprima facie case.\r\nC.   Establishing pretext and discriminatory animus\r\nIt is undisputed that GTE has met its burden of production in\r\nmaintaining that it fired Brennan because MSE testing work was\r\ndiminishing and Brennan was among the lowest ranked employees\r\nperforming that type of work.  Van Dolman testified that the MSE\r\nworkload, and specifically the number of plans and procedures\r\nwritten and tests conducted, was diminishing.  No longer a new\r\nsystem, the MSE required less testing.  David Orlando and David\r\nLoomis, both GTE engineering supervisors, confirmed this.  And\r\nvarious GTE personnel testified that while Brennan was a good test\r\nwriter, he lacked the troubleshooting skills and technical\r\nknowledge about the system that GTE most needed given the\r\ndownsizing of new MSE projects.\r\nBrennan, in turn, must satisfy his burden of showing pretext,\r\nand under federal law, discriminatory animus.  He may rely on the\r\nsame evidence to prove both pretext and discrimination, as long as\r\nthe evidence rises to the level of meeting both requirements.  See \r\nUdo v. Tomes, 54 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1995).  He may also rely on\r\nthe evidence pertaining to his prima facie.  See Burdine, 450 U.S.\r\nat 255 n.10.  Brennan offers the following evidence to meet the\r\nfinal hurdle:  (1) his experience and performance reviews; (2)\r\nGTE's failure to use standard procedure in creating the Work Force\r\nAnalysis Forms; (3) absence of a projected work analysis by GTE at\r\nthe time the Work Force Analysis Forms were prepared; (4) MSE\r\nengineering work available after the layoff; (5) disproportionately\r\nage-weighted layoffs; (6) favoritism by GTE toward younger\r\nengineers; and (7) evidence showing that older qualified employees\r\nwere discharged and younger, less or equally qualified engineers\r\nwere retained.  We now review these.\r\nThe performance reviews tell us that Brennan was a competent\r\nemployee who consistently performed within the expected job range,\r\nbut did not excel.  Again, we note that in June 1992 his review\r\ndescribed him as having \"the ability to become technically\r\ncompetent in tasks assigned to him.\"  A reasonable jury could find\r\nthat this belies GTE's claim that he lacked the technical\r\ncompetence to troubleshoot problems arising in the MSE division,\r\nor, at least, that in June 1992 GTE believed that Brennan was\r\ncapable of rapidly gaining the technical knowledge required by the\r\ncompany.  Support for this view can also be found in GTE's asking\r\nBrennan in late 1992 to fill in for Bredberg, whose work primarily\r\ninvolved troubleshooting system problems.  \r\nWe add to this the evidence presented by Brennan that GTE did\r\nnot use standard procedure in completing the Work Force Analysis\r\nForms.  Deviation from established policy or practice may be \r\nevidence of pretext.  See Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., 99 F.3d 456,\r\n466-67 (1st Cir. 1996).  Robert Hetzel, Director of Human Services\r\nat GTE in 1993, testified to the order in which the forms should be\r\ncompleted: identify the function to be eliminated within a\r\nparticular department and the reason, list the employees performing\r\nthe function and evaluate them, identify the person or persons who\r\ndo not have the skills necessary to do the remaining work, and then\r\nidentify individuals for layoff, using the criteria, \"wrong skill\r\nmix,\" \"poor performance,\" \"lowest performance rating,\" and \"lowest\r\nseniority.\"  GTE's seniority policy requires that, \"where ability\r\nis comparable, the senior employee will be retained.\"  \r\nVan Dolman's testimony revealed that, instead of following\r\nthis procedure, he completed the March 1993 Work Force Analysis\r\nForms by simply filling in names of persons to be laid off that\r\nwere provided to him by Sherwood from the rating and ranking list\r\ncreated in December 1992.  As to the rating and ranking, Van Dolman\r\nfirst provided Sherwood with a list, not in the record, ranking\r\npersons in his department.  From this list and those put together\r\nby other engineering department heads, Sherwood compiled a rating\r\nand ranking of all engineering employees.  Sherwood explained that\r\nhe arrived at this list by consulting with department heads.  He\r\ndescribed the \"factors [that] came up in the discussions leading to\r\nthe merging of the three grades into the [lowest thirty percent]\r\ncolumn\" as \"principally value, in terms of doing the residual MSE,\r\nand a lot of work that was coming.\"  It is clear that seniority was\r\nnot considered in this ranking.  Although thin, this evidence that\r\nstandard procedure was not followed is directly relevant to\r\nBrennan's burden of demonstrating pretext. \r\nThe record also raises questions about whether the layoffs\r\nwere needed.  Brennan points to the two Work Force Analysis Forms\r\ncompleted in September 1992 by Van Dolman and Flynn, in which he\r\nwas the only person slated for layoff in his group and two persons\r\nwere slated for layoff in Flynn's group.  Of the nine senior system\r\nengineers in Flynn's group in 1992, only four remained in 1993. \r\nThis reduction, in combination with the number of fifty or older\r\nemployees who took early retirement, significantly reduced GTE's\r\nwork force -- by a greater number, in fact, than targeted in the\r\nSeptember 1992 Work Force Analysis Forms.  \r\nAs to Brennan's contention that the company lacked knowledge\r\nof the projected work load, Sherwood testified that at the time he\r\ncreated the rating and ranking he did not know how many test\r\nwriting positions remained for the future MSE work, and Flynn\r\ntestified that he did not remember any discussion during the\r\ndevelopment of the rating and ranking concerning the specific work\r\nremaining in the MSE.  Brennan suggests from this that the\r\ncompany's subsequent contention, that it needed to terminate test\r\nwriters, was not true, and simply a cover for its intention to lay\r\nhim and other older employees off through a constructive device of\r\na rating and ranking.  While certainly limited, we cannot say that,\r\nin combination with the remaining evidence, this testimony could\r\nnot have helped to lead a reasonable jury to suspect that the\r\nreasons articulated by GTE for downsizing its workforce were not\r\ntrue. \r\nBrennan also introduced evidence that GTE hired persons for\r\nengineering positions and that MSE work was available after his\r\nlayoff.  Such evidence, in undercutting the employer's proffered\r\nreason for reducing the workforce, is probative of pretext.  SeeMartin v. Envelope Division of Westvaco Corp., 850 F. Supp. 83, 91\r\n(D. Mass. 1994).  While GTE presented plentiful testimony that MSE\r\ntesting work was on the decline, we think that a factfinder could\r\nreasonably conclude, looking at the advertisements for new\r\nengineers and the number of persons hired, together with other\r\nevidence, that the reductions were not in fact needed.\r\nFinally, Brennan points to evidence of discriminatory animus\r\nbased on age: younger engineers received preference in the\r\ndistribution of new computers and new assignments, a high\r\nproportion of older persons were discharged and ranked low in the\r\nrating and ranking, and Van Dolman's statement, \"I was told it\r\nwouldn't matter to you guys.\"  After examining all the evidence,\r\nthe jury might have concluded, as did Hetzel, that the\r\ndisproportionately high number of older persons ranked low and\r\ndischarged was not indicative of discrimination.  But this\r\ndetermination is rightly within the jury's province, not the\r\ncourt's.  And although Van Dolman testified that he could not\r\nrecall making the statement, supra, neither did he deny making it. \r\nIn context, his testimony could leave a reasonable jury to conclude\r\nthat Van Dolman expected Brennan to receive full benefits and went\r\nalong with the layoffs with that assurance in mind.\r\nWe find therefore that Brennan has demonstrated sufficient\r\nevidence of pretext and discriminatory age animus to withstand a\r\ndirected verdict.  His age discrimination claims should proceed\r\nbefore a jury.\r\n          III.  The Misrepresentation Claim\r\nOur review is de novo to determine whether the jury, drawing\r\nall inferences in Brennan's favor, could reasonably have rendered\r\na verdict for him on this issue.  See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico,\r\nInc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 196 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\r\nBrennan argues that he was misled by fraudulent and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation -- specifically, GTE's seniority policy -- to\r\ndecline participation in the Early Retirement Program.  He alleges\r\nthat GTE had a duty to disclose to him that it would use a ranking\r\nsystem rather than performance reviews to determine who would be\r\nterminated, and that he suffered economic loss because he relied on\r\nthe performance reviews to gauge the likelihood that he would be\r\nlaid off from his job.\r\nWe can dispose of this issue quickly.  Under Massachusetts\r\nlaw, claims of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation require\r\na false representation of material fact, knowledge of falsity or\r\ncarelessness on the part of the defendant, and a reasonable\r\nreliance by the plaintiff.  See Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe\r\nMfg. Corp., 72 F.3d 190, 199-200 (1st Cir. 1995); see also Fox v.\r\nF &amp; J Gattozzi Corp., 41 Mass. App. Ct. 581, 587, 672 N.E.2d 547,\r\n551 (1996) (requiring \"justifiable\" reliance by the plaintiff). \r\nBrennan offers no evidence that GTE represented to him that it\r\nwould only use the performance evaluations in ranking employees and\r\ndetermining whether they were \"comparable\" for the purpose of\r\ninvoking the company's seniority policy.  Even if a jury could\r\nconclude that GTE made such a representation, Brennan's reliance on\r\nthat fact as security that he would not be laid off is not\r\nreasonable or justifiable.  Brennan was fairly consistently ranked\r\na three out of five.  He presents no evidence that he knew the\r\nnumber of persons the company would terminate (he offers the\r\nopposite in support of his pretext argument), the levels at which\r\nother persons were ranked, or the seniority other employees had in\r\ncomparison to him.  It may be that GTE's layoff would require that\r\nit terminate all level three employees and some level two\r\nemployees.  In that case, Brennan's seniority would not have\r\nimpacted his retention.  We therefore affirm the district court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment on this claim.\r\n                   IV.  Conclusion\r\nOn the record before us, we find that Brennan has introduced\r\nsufficient evidence to submit his age discrimination claims to the\r\njury, but insufficient evidence on his misrepresentation claim.  We\r\nemphasize again that we make no credibility judgments and do not\r\nweigh the evidence; our analysis has been restricted to determining\r\nwhether Brennan presented enough evidence to proceed before the\r\njury.  We remand the age discrimination claims to the district\r\ncourt.\r\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.  Costs to appellant.\n",

Daniel Brennan's twenty-year-\r\nlong employment with GTE Government Systems Corporation (\"GTE\")\r\nended in March 1993 when he was terminated as part of a reduction\r\nin force.  Brennan, who was fifty years old at the time of his\r\ntermination, brought suit claiming that he was discharged as a\r\nresult of age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination\r\nin Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.  621-634 (\"ADEA\"), and Mass. Gen.\r\nLaws ch. 151B,  4 (\"ch. 151B\").  He also alleged a state law\r\nmisrepresentation claim, asserting that GTE fraudulently and\r\nnegligently misrepresented its policies and procedures for laying\r\noff employees.  The district court dismissed the state claim upon\r\nsummary judgment and granted judgment as a matter of law at the\r\nclose of evidence.  Brennan challenges the rulings, and contests\r\nthe court's exclusion of certain evidence.  We find error in one of\r\nthe evidentiary rulings relevant to establishment of a prima facie\r\ncase.  We also conclude that there was sufficient evidence to\r\ncreate jury issues on pretext and age discrimination.  We therefore\r\nreverse the directed verdicts for GTE on the federal and state age\r\ndiscrimination claims but affirm the dismissal of the\r\nmisrepresentation claim.\r\nI.  Factual Background\r\nBrennan began working at GTE in 1973 as a senior technician\r\nand later held a series of different engineering positions.  In\r\n1986, he accepted a position as an integration and test engineer in\r\nthe Mobile Subscriber Equipment System (\"MSE\") division.  Created\r\nin 1986, the MSE division developed in response to a contract\r\nbetween GTE and the United States Army for a comprehensive\r\ncommunications system.  In mid 1992, the division was reorganized\r\nand Brennan was assigned to work in the Circuit Switching and\r\nSystems Control department, headed by John Van Dolman.  His job as\r\nan integration and test engineer involved designing and overseeing\r\nthe MSE testing process.  \r\nThe record contains performance appraisals extending from 1976\r\nto June 1992 consistently describing Brennan as meeting job\r\nexpectations.  In late 1992, GTE assigned Brennan to fill in for\r\nCarl Bredberg, a systems engineer whose job was to troubleshoot MSE\r\nfield problems, after Bredberg suffered a heart attack.     \r\nIn September 1992, MSE engineering department managers Van\r\nDolman and Kevin Flynn each prepared \"Work Force Analysis Forms\" in\r\nanticipation of a reduction in force planned for November 2, 1992. \r\nThese forms set forth positions to be eliminated, employees\r\nperforming those functions, and the names of individuals\r\nrecommended for termination.  Van Dolman identified \"System\r\nIntegration and Test Procedure Writer\" as the function to be\r\neliminated and Brennan as the only employee for termination,\r\nstating that Brennan lacked the skill mix to do the remaining work. \r\nThe function eliminated by Flynn was \"Senior System Engineer.\"  Two\r\npersons, each sixty-three years old, out of nine employees in that\r\nposition were identified for layoff. \r\nGTE, however, did not go forward with the planned reduction in\r\nforce.  Instead, in December 1992, it notified employees of its\r\nneed to reduce staff as a result of general downsizing in the\r\ndefense industry, and offered a voluntary separation incentive\r\nprogram and an enhanced early retirement program as \"first step[s]\r\nin realigning [GTE] staffing levels.\"  GTE announced that the\r\nprograms were entirely voluntary, but would be offered only from\r\nJanuary 11, 1993 until February 5, 1993.  Under the early\r\nretirement program, available to all employees fifty and older,\r\nBrennan could retire with pension and medical benefits that would\r\notherwise not be available to him until January 1, 1996.  Brennan,\r\nhowever, declined the offered program, believing that his seniority\r\nwould prevent him from being selected for layoff.\r\nOn December 7, 1992, Allen Sherwood, manager of the MSE\r\ndivision at that time, developed a \"rating and ranking\" of\r\nemployees in the engineering division in anticipation of a layoff. \r\nBrennan was listed as the lowest ranking of thirty-three employees\r\nat grade levels six and seven.  The rating and ranking included\r\nthree categories of grades (3-5, 6-7, 8-11), and then listed the\r\nemployees who, out of a total of ninety-six, ranked among the\r\nbottom thirty percent of all employees.  On this list, Brennan\r\nranked ninety-third, or fourth from the lowest.  Other terminated\r\nemployees had similar, although not quite as low, rankings as\r\nBrennan.  The ages of employees listed in the rating and ranking\r\nwere admitted as evidence.  A high number of fifty and older\r\nemployees were ranked in the bottom thirty percent.\r\nOn February 26, 1993, Van Dolman prepared another Work\r\nAnalysis Form, identifying \"System Integration Testing and Test\r\nProcedure Writing\" as the function to be eliminated.  He listed\r\nfourteen persons in this position prior to the reduction in force,\r\nout of which five were proposed for separation.  Brennan, who was\r\nthen fifty, along with four others (aged thirty-one, thirty-four,\r\nfifty-seven and fifty-nine) were identified as \"not possess[ing]\r\nthe skills to perform the remaining work available.\"  The form also\r\nset forth the specific skills these workers lacked, namely,\r\n\"detailed knowledge as required to troubleshoot and resolve System\r\nlevel problems.\"  Brennan, John Hartgrove (fifty-seven), and John\r\nHurley (thirty-seven), were also described as unable to perform\r\n\"design related Systems work.\"  The listed reasons for termination\r\nwere \"wrong skill mix to do work remaining\" and \"lowest performance\r\nrating.\"  Under \"additional comments\" was written, \"rating and\r\nranking verifies above decisions.\"\r\nTwo days later, Van Dolman completed a Work Force Analysis\r\nForm to reduce another section of the MSE division, System Design\r\nActivities.  Of the four persons he listed as working in that\r\nsection, he selected the only over fifty employee, Al Ricard, for\r\ntermination.  The remaining three employees, all retained, were in\r\ntheir late twenties or early thirties.  Van Dolman described Ricard\r\nas unable to \"perform complex system engineering level design\r\ntasks.\"  Reasons for termination and additional comments\r\nreferencing the rating and ranking were the same as those listed\r\nfor Brennan.  \r\nIn late March 1993, Brennan was informed that he would be\r\nterminated on April 2, 1993.  Brennan testified that when he\r\napproached Van Dolman about the decision, Van Dolman stated, \"I was\r\ntold it wouldn't matter to you guys.\"  Brennan believed \"you guys\"\r\nreferred to the fifty and older employees, and \"wouldn't matter\"\r\nreferred to the retirement packages Van Dolman believed to be\r\navailable to employees aged fifty and older.  Van Dolman testified\r\nthat he could have made the statement, but did not recall doing so. \r\nBrennan also testified that during his employment with GTE, he and\r\nother older employees were not given new computers or new\r\nassignments, which were instead designated for younger employees.\r\nThe fifty and older employees discharged as a result of the\r\nWork Force Analysis Forms, including Brennan, were the only fifty\r\nand older employees remaining in the two MSE departments subject to\r\nlayoff.  Other persons in this age group who had worked in these\r\ndepartments chose voluntary separation or early retirement before\r\nthe layoffs.               II.  The Age Discrimination Claims\r\nThe central aspect of our review involves Brennan's appeal\r\nfrom directed verdict on his age discrimination claims.  The\r\ndistrict court found that Brennan had not established the required\r\nprima facie case, had not shown that GTE's reason for discharging\r\nhim was pretextual, and did not present sufficient evidence to\r\nsupport a finding of discriminatory animus.  We review the grant of\r\na motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo, taking the facts\r\nmost favorable to Brennan.  See Russo v.

See Woodman, 51 F.3d at 1091.  \r\nAt this point, although the burden returns to the plaintiff in\r\nboth instances, state and federal law no longer parallel each\r\nother.  Under the ADEA, we inquire whether the evidence as a whole\r\nwould permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the proffered\r\nreason was pretextual and the true reason was an age-based animus. \r\nSee Hidalgo, 120 F.3d at 335 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515 (1993)).

The distinction does not matter in this\r\ncase, however, as we find that plaintiff's evidence rises to the\r\nlevel required by the ADEA to overcome a directed verdict. \r\nB.   The prima facie case\r\nIt is undisputed that, as a fifty-year-old man who was\r\nterminated by GTE, Brennan meets the first and third prongs of his\r\nprima facie case.  As to the second, Brennan has submitted\r\nperformance reviews dating back to 1976 and running through June\r\n1992.  He received acceptable rankings in virtually every\r\nappraisal, although he only occasionally received the highest\r\nranking.  For example, in the most recent ranking, covering the\r\nperiod of January to June 1992, he was rated \"met expectations\" for\r\nall categories of work, except in the area of \"control/follow-up\"\r\nin which he was rated \"exceeded expectations.\"  Out of five\r\npossible overall performance ratings, he was given a three, which\r\nis described as \"Employee meets all individual objectives as\r\nestablished in the performance plan, performs all job\r\nresponsibilities to meet the requirements of the job and displays\r\na satisfactory degree of competence in the skills required of the\r\njob.\"  And, under \"comments,\" the review  stated, \"Dan has the\r\nability to quickly become technically competent in tasks assigned\r\nto him and accomplish the task in a timely manner to meet\r\nschedules\" and \"Dan is very supportive to the changing priorities\r\nrequired to support the overall mission.\"\r\nGTE strives to characterize the \"legitimate job expectations\"\r\nstandard as covering what it maintains to be the new, downsized\r\nrequirements expected of the future MSE division.  Such an\r\ninterpretation would render irrelevant the remaining burden\r\nshifting requirements (the employer's articulation of a legitimate\r\nreason would be incorporated, de facto, into the job expectation\r\nstandard, and the employee's obligation to demonstrate pretext\r\nwould have to be fought at the prima facie stage), and would be an\r\n\"onerous\" endeavor, beyond the confines of a prima facie case.  We\r\nthink the gauge therefore should be whether the employee has a\r\nrecord of performing acceptably and meeting the demands of his job. \r\nBrennan's evidence is more than sufficient to meet the second prong\r\nof the prima facie case.  \r\nIt was the fourth prong, lack of age-neutral decisionmaking,\r\nwhere the district court found Brennan's evidence inadequate.  Our\r\nanalysis demands that we consider whether the district court\r\nproperly excluded evidence as to other employees.  \"[L]ack of\r\nneutrality may be manifested either by a facially discriminatory\r\npolicy or by a policy which, though age-neutral on its face, has\r\nthe effect of discriminating against older persons, say, by leading\r\ninexorably to the retention of younger employees while similarly\r\nsituated older employees are given their walking papers.\"  Vega v.\r\nKodak Caribbean, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628958\"><a href=\"/opinion/628958/62-fair-emplpraccas-1198-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42530-17-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 479 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nA judge should not exclude relevant evidence, unless its\r\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice.  See McMillan, 140 F.3d at 300 (citing Fed. R. Evid.\r\n403).  Evidence that other terminated fifty and older employees had\r\ngood employment records, skills in certain areas of the job, and\r\nsuperior experience to retained employees is relevant to\r\ndetermining whether a policy has the effect of discriminating\r\nagainst older persons.  Among the evidence offered by Brennan but\r\nexcluded by the district court was a comparison between work\r\nperformed by Tessmer, who was fifty-nine, and a thirty-year-old\r\nemployee who was retained.  Brennan also proffered evidence\r\ncomparing the work record of Ricard, who was fifty-seven, rated at\r\na level of three, and discharged, with that of Craig Poole, who was\r\ntwenty-eight, given the same rating, trained by Ricard, and\r\nretained.  This evidence was also excluded.  \r\nWhile \"proof of a general atmosphere of discrimination is not\r\nthe equivalent of proof of discrimination against an individual,\"\r\nit \"may add 'color' to an employer's decisionmaking process.\"  Ruizv.

See Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1119 (excluding\r\nnumerical evidence because no comparative evidence was introduced). \r\nWe are not faced here with determining whether this evidence proves\r\nage discriminatory animus, but rather are concerned only with\r\nwhether this evidence indicates lack of neutrality.  As we have\r\nrepeatedly emphasized, this is not a burdensome standard.  SeeWoodman, 51 F.3d at 1091.  \r\nCombined with the raw data indicating the ages of the persons\r\nlisted in the rating and ranking and terminated in the reduction in\r\nforce, the evidence regarding other employees and testimony by\r\nBrennan indicating that the company gave preference to younger\r\nemployees in distributing computers demonstrate \"lack of\r\nneutrality\" sufficient to meet Brennan's burden of establishing a\r\nprima facie case.\r\nC.   Establishing pretext and discriminatory animus\r\nIt is undisputed that GTE has met its burden of production in\r\nmaintaining that it fired Brennan because MSE testing work was\r\ndiminishing and Brennan was among the lowest ranked employees\r\nperforming that type of work.  Van Dolman testified that the MSE\r\nworkload, and specifically the number of plans and procedures\r\nwritten and tests conducted, was diminishing.  No longer a new\r\nsystem, the MSE required less testing.  David Orlando and David\r\nLoomis, both GTE engineering supervisors, confirmed this.  And\r\nvarious GTE personnel testified that while Brennan was a good test\r\nwriter, he lacked the troubleshooting skills and technical\r\nknowledge about the system that GTE most needed given the\r\ndownsizing of new MSE projects.\r\nBrennan, in turn, must satisfy his burden of showing pretext,\r\nand under federal law, discriminatory animus.  He may rely on the\r\nsame evidence to prove both pretext and discrimination, as long as\r\nthe evidence rises to the level of meeting both requirements.  See \r\nUdo v.

He may also rely on\r\nthe evidence pertaining to his prima facie.  See Burdine, 450 U.S.\r\nat 255 n.10.  Brennan offers the following evidence to meet the\r\nfinal hurdle:  (1) his experience and performance reviews; (2)\r\nGTE's failure to use standard procedure in creating the Work Force\r\nAnalysis Forms; (3) absence of a projected work analysis by GTE at\r\nthe time the Work Force Analysis Forms were prepared; (4) MSE\r\nengineering work available after the layoff; (5) disproportionately\r\nage-weighted layoffs; (6) favoritism by GTE toward younger\r\nengineers; and (7) evidence showing that older qualified employees\r\nwere discharged and younger, less or equally qualified engineers\r\nwere retained.  We now review these.\r\nThe performance reviews tell us that Brennan was a competent\r\nemployee who consistently performed within the expected job range,\r\nbut did not excel.  Again, we note that in June 1992 his review\r\ndescribed him as having \"the ability to become technically\r\ncompetent in tasks assigned to him.\"  A reasonable jury could find\r\nthat this belies GTE's claim that he lacked the technical\r\ncompetence to troubleshoot problems arising in the MSE division,\r\nor, at least, that in June 1992 GTE believed that Brennan was\r\ncapable of rapidly gaining the technical knowledge required by the\r\ncompany.  Support for this view can also be found in GTE's asking\r\nBrennan in late 1992 to fill in for Bredberg, whose work primarily\r\ninvolved troubleshooting system problems.  \r\nWe add to this the evidence presented by Brennan that GTE did\r\nnot use standard procedure in completing the Work Force Analysis\r\nForms.  Deviation from established policy or practice may be \r\nevidence of pretext.  See Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728907\"><a href=\"/opinion/728907/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-397-36-fedrserv3d-569-ollie-lattimore-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n466-67 (1st Cir. 1996).  Robert Hetzel, Director of Human Services\r\nat GTE in 1993, testified to the order in which the forms should be\r\ncompleted: identify the function to be eliminated within a\r\nparticular department and the reason, list the employees performing\r\nthe function and evaluate them, identify the person or persons who\r\ndo not have the skills necessary to do the remaining work, and then\r\nidentify individuals for layoff, using the criteria, \"wrong skill\r\nmix,\" \"poor performance,\" \"lowest performance rating,\" and \"lowest\r\nseniority.\"  GTE's seniority policy requires that, \"where ability\r\nis comparable, the senior employee will be retained.\"  \r\nVan Dolman's testimony revealed that, instead of following\r\nthis procedure, he completed the March 1993 Work Force Analysis\r\nForms by simply filling in names of persons to be laid off that\r\nwere provided to him by Sherwood from the rating and ranking list\r\ncreated in December 1992.  As to the rating and ranking, Van Dolman\r\nfirst provided Sherwood with a list, not in the record, ranking\r\npersons in his department.  From this list and those put together\r\nby other engineering department heads, Sherwood compiled a rating\r\nand ranking of all engineering employees.  Sherwood explained that\r\nhe arrived at this list by consulting with department heads.  He\r\ndescribed the \"factors [that] came up in the discussions leading to\r\nthe merging of the three grades into the [lowest thirty percent]\r\ncolumn\" as \"principally value, in terms of doing the residual MSE,\r\nand a lot of work that was coming.\"  It is clear that seniority was\r\nnot considered in this ranking.  Although thin, this evidence that\r\nstandard procedure was not followed is directly relevant to\r\nBrennan's burden of demonstrating pretext. \r\nThe record also raises questions about whether the layoffs\r\nwere needed.  Brennan points to the two Work Force Analysis Forms\r\ncompleted in September 1992 by Van Dolman and Flynn, in which he\r\nwas the only person slated for layoff in his group and two persons\r\nwere slated for layoff in Flynn's group.  Of the nine senior system\r\nengineers in Flynn's group in 1992, only four remained in 1993. \r\nThis reduction, in combination with the number of fifty or older\r\nemployees who took early retirement, significantly reduced GTE's\r\nwork force -- by a greater number, in fact, than targeted in the\r\nSeptember 1992 Work Force Analysis Forms.  \r\nAs to Brennan's contention that the company lacked knowledge\r\nof the projected work load, Sherwood testified that at the time he\r\ncreated the rating and ranking he did not know how many test\r\nwriting positions remained for the future MSE work, and Flynn\r\ntestified that he did not remember any discussion during the\r\ndevelopment of the rating and ranking concerning the specific work\r\nremaining in the MSE.  Brennan suggests from this that the\r\ncompany's subsequent contention, that it needed to terminate test\r\nwriters, was not true, and simply a cover for its intention to lay\r\nhim and other older employees off through a constructive device of\r\na rating and ranking.  While certainly limited, we cannot say that,\r\nin combination with the remaining evidence, this testimony could\r\nnot have helped to lead a reasonable jury to suspect that the\r\nreasons articulated by GTE for downsizing its workforce were not\r\ntrue. \r\nBrennan also introduced evidence that GTE hired persons for\r\nengineering positions and that MSE work was available after his\r\nlayoff.  Such evidence, in undercutting the employer's proffered\r\nreason for reducing the workforce, is probative of pretext.  SeeMartin v. Envelope Division of Westvaco Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2132206\"><a href=\"/opinion/2132206/martin-v-envelope-div-of-westvaco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91\r\n(D. Mass. 1994).  While GTE presented plentiful testimony that MSE\r\ntesting work was on the decline, we think that a factfinder could\r\nreasonably conclude, looking at the advertisements for new\r\nengineers and the number of persons hired, together with other\r\nevidence, that the reductions were not in fact needed.\r\nFinally, Brennan points to evidence of discriminatory animus\r\nbased on age: younger engineers received preference in the\r\ndistribution of new computers and new assignments, a high\r\nproportion of older persons were discharged and ranked low in the\r\nrating and ranking, and Van Dolman's statement, \"I was told it\r\nwouldn't matter to you guys.\"  After examining all the evidence,\r\nthe jury might have concluded, as did Hetzel, that the\r\ndisproportionately high number of older persons ranked low and\r\ndischarged was not indicative of discrimination.  But this\r\ndetermination is rightly within the jury's province, not the\r\ncourt's.  And although Van Dolman testified that he could not\r\nrecall making the statement, supra, neither did he deny making it. \r\nIn context, his testimony could leave a reasonable jury to conclude\r\nthat Van Dolman expected Brennan to receive full benefits and went\r\nalong with the layoffs with that assurance in mind.\r\nWe find therefore that Brennan has demonstrated sufficient\r\nevidence of pretext and discriminatory age animus to withstand a\r\ndirected verdict.  His age discrimination claims should proceed\r\nbefore a jury.\r\n          III.  The Misrepresentation Claim\r\nOur review is de novo to determine whether the jury, drawing\r\nall inferences in Brennan's favor, could reasonably have rendered\r\na verdict for him on this issue.  See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico,\r\nInc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196628\"><a href=\"/opinion/196628/coastal-fuels-of-pr-v-caribbean-petroleum/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\r\nBrennan argues that he was misled by fraudulent and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation -- specifically, GTE's seniority policy -- to\r\ndecline participation in the Early Retirement Program.  He alleges\r\nthat GTE had a duty to disclose to him that it would use a ranking\r\nsystem rather than performance reviews to determine who would be\r\nterminated, and that he suffered economic loss because he relied on\r\nthe performance reviews to gauge the likelihood that he would be\r\nlaid off from his job.\r\nWe can dispose of this issue quickly.  Under Massachusetts\r\nlaw, claims of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation require\r\na false representation of material fact, knowledge of falsity or\r\ncarelessness on the part of the defendant, and a reasonable\r\nreliance by the plaintiff.  See Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe\r\nMfg. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196480\"><a href=\"/opinion/196480/knapp-shoes-inc-v-sylvania-shoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199-200 (1st Cir. 1995); see also Fox v.\r\nF &amp; J Gattozzi Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass. App. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n551 (1996) (requiring \"justifiable\" reliance by the plaintiff). \r\nBrennan offers no evidence that GTE represented to him that it\r\nwould only use the performance evaluations in ranking employees and\r\ndetermining whether they were \"comparable\" for the purpose of\r\ninvoking the company's seniority policy.  Even if a jury could\r\nconclude that GTE made such a representation, Brennan's reliance on\r\nthat fact as security that he would not be laid off is not\r\nreasonable or justifiable.  Brennan was fairly consistently ranked\r\na three out of five.  He presents no evidence that he knew the\r\nnumber of persons the company would terminate (he offers the\r\nopposite in support of his pretext argument), the levels at which\r\nother persons were ranked, or the seniority other employees had in\r\ncomparison to him.  It may be that GTE's layoff would require that\r\nit terminate all level three employees and some level two\r\nemployees.  In that case, Brennan's seniority would not have\r\nimpacted his retention.  We therefore affirm the district court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment on this claim.\r\n                   IV.  Conclusion\r\nOn the record before us, we find that Brennan has introduced\r\nsufficient evidence to submit his age discrimination claims to the\r\njury, but insufficient evidence on his misrepresentation claim.  We\r\nemphasize again that we make no credibility judgments and do not\r\nweigh the evidence; our analysis has been restricted to determining\r\nwhether Brennan presented enough evidence to proceed before the\r\njury.  We remand the age discrimination claims to the district\r\ncourt.\r\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.  Costs to appellant.\n</pre>",
