George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n       Selya, Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nAnthony Tarricone and Camille F. Sarrouf, with whom Joseph P.\r\nMusacchio  and Melick &amp; Porter, LLP were on brief, for appellant.\r\nLuke B. Marsh, Attorney, Civil Division, United States\r\nDepartment of Justice, with whom Frank W. Hunger, Assistant\r\nAttorney General, was on brief, for appellee.\r\n\nSeptember 16, 1998\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff-appellant Barbara A.\r\nJackson, acting in her capacity as administratrix of her husband's\r\nestate, sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act\r\n(FTCA), 28 U.S.C.  1346(b), 2671-2680 (1994), alleging that the\r\nnegligence of three Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees\r\nin failing to furnish appropriate weather advisories proximately\r\ncaused an aircraft flown by her late husband to crash.  Following\r\na bench trial, the district court wrote a thoughtful rescript\r\nexplaining why the plaintiff should take nothing.  See Jackson v.\r\nUnited States, 983 F. Supp. 273 (D. Mass. 1997).  The plaintiff\r\nappeals on various grounds.\r\nThe facts surrounding the tragic incident that took the\r\nlife of Cephas W. Jackson, Jr., a respected physician and\r\nrecreational pilot, are chronicled in the district court's opinion,\r\nsee id. at 276-79, and it would be pleonastic to rehearse them\r\nhere.  Thus, we offer only a thumbnail sketch, referring the reader\r\nwho thirsts for further detail to the opinion below.\r\nOn March 26, 1992, Jackson, desirous of flying from\r\nLittle Rock, Arkansas, to Charleston, West Virginia, and then on to\r\nMassachusetts, requested and received meteorological information,\r\nincluding a so-called \"outlook briefing,\" from the FAA's Jonesboro,\r\nArkansas, Automated Flight Service Station.  The next day, he again\r\ncalled Jonesboro and requested a pre-flight weather briefing. \r\nFlight Services Specialist Robert Eldridge obliged.  See id. at\r\n276-77 (describing contents of the pre-flight briefing).  After\r\nreceiving this briefing, Jackson filed a flight plan and departed\r\nfrom Little Rock, bound for Charleston, in his single-engine\r\naircraft (a Mooney M-20M).  He had radio contacts with a number of\r\nair traffic control facilities as he flew over Tennessee and\r\nKentucky.  See id. at 277 (describing same).  As he approached\r\nCharleston, he engaged in an extensive dialogue with a Charleston-\r\nbased air traffic controller, Mark Ulanch.  See id. at 278-79\r\n(describing that colloquy).  The fatal crash occurred in the course\r\nof this approach.\r\nWe have often preached, but perhaps too seldom practiced,\r\nthe philosophy that \"when a lower court produces a comprehensive,\r\nwell-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from\r\nwriting at length to no other end than to hear its own words\r\nresonate.\"  Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co. of Am., 101 F.3d\r\n218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996).  This case fits the Lawton model. \r\nAccordingly, we resist the temptation to repastinate ground that is\r\nalready well-ploughed and affirm principally on the basis of the\r\ndistrict court's opinion.  We add only four sets of comments.\r\nFirst:  Where, as here, the district court conducts a\r\nbench trial and serves as the factfinder, its determinations of\r\nnegligence, proximate cause, and similar issues are entitled to\r\nconsiderable deference.  \"[W]e consistently have reviewed\r\nadjudications of negligence arising in the course of bench trials\r\nby reference to the clearly erroneous test.\"  Sierra Fria Corp. v.\r\nEvans, 127 F.3d 175, 181 (1st Cir. 1997).  This deferential\r\nstandard acknowledges that, unlike an appellate tribunal, the trial\r\ncourt \"sees and hears the witnesses at first hand and comes to\r\nappreciate the nuances of the litigation in a way which appellate\r\ncourts cannot hope to replicate.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander\r\nP.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).  Thus, a trial court's\r\nfactual determinations will be set aside only if, \"after careful\r\nevaluation of the evidence, we are left with an abiding conviction\r\nthat those determinations and findings are simply wrong.\"  State\r\nPolice Ass'n v. Commissioner, 125 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nThis standard is critically important here.  At many\r\njunctures, more than one plausible inference can be drawn from the\r\nunderlying facts.  On clear-error review, we cannot second-guess\r\nthe trier's choices among those competing inferences even if, had\r\nwe been sitting as triers of the facts, we might have arrived at a\r\ndifferent set of judgments.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,\r\n470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985).\r\nSecond:  The appellant argued below that Eldridge, the\r\nFAA employee who provided the decedent's pre-flight briefing, was\r\nguilty of negligence because he failed to incorporate specific\r\nweather advisories from the National Weather Service into that\r\nbriefing.  The trial court concluded that, although Eldridge's\r\npre-flight briefing did not specifically mention the advisories by\r\nname, it comprehensively summarized the weather conditions that\r\nJackson could expect to encounter during his flight.  See Jackson,\r\n983 F. Supp. at 280.  Accordingly, the court determined that\r\nEldridge was not negligent.  See id.\r\nIn this venue, the appellant attempts an end-run around\r\nthe strictures of clear-error review by positing the existence of\r\nan error of law.  To that end, she argues that Eldridge's failure\r\nto mention the AIRMETs constituted negligence per se.  In mounting\r\nthis argument, she points to paragraphs 3-10(a) &amp; (b) of the Flight\r\nServices Handbook (the Handbook), a procedural guide issued by the\r\nFAA in the interests of ensuring flight safety.  These paragraphs\r\nlimn the information a flight services specialist should gather\r\npreparatory to delivering a pre-flight briefing and the procedures\r\nto be followed in transmitting this data to pilots.  Many of these\r\nsteps are couched in mandatory terms.  The appellant now contends,\r\nfor the first time, that the court had no option but to find\r\nEldridge guilty of negligence because he violated the obligatory\r\nHandbook provisions.\r\nIt is an abecedarian rule that litigants ordinarily\r\ncannot shift legal theories in mid-stream: \"If  any principle is\r\nsettled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary\r\ncircumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower\r\ncourt cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters,\r\nChauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v.\r\nSuperline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992).  Inasmuch\r\nas the appellant never advanced a negligence per se theory below,\r\nthis principle has obvious applicability here.\r\nThe appellant offers two intertwined reasons why we\r\nshould excuse her procedural default.  First, she suggests that, in\r\na bench trial at which the district court does not require the\r\nparties to submit written requests for conclusions of law, a\r\nlitigant should not be penalized for failing spontaneously to\r\narticulate her position on the relevant legal issues.  Second, she\r\ncontends that, regardless of her default, the district court had an\r\nunflagging duty to divine, interpret, and apply the governing legal\r\nstandards correctly.  Neither reason is persuasive.\r\nA trial court, sitting jury-waived, may   but need not  \r\nask for suggested findings and conclusions.  Either way, the rule\r\nis straightforward: with few exceptions (none applicable here), a\r\nparty who, having adequate opportunity, fails to alert the trial\r\ncourt to a particular legal theory cannot thereafter be heard to\r\ncomplain that the court overlooked that theory.  See, e.g.,\r\nMartinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 987 (1st Cir. 1995); Teamsters, 953\r\nF.2d at 21; McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22\r\n(1st Cir. 1991).  This is as it should be.  Trial judges are not\r\nmind-readers, and they should not be expected to do counsel's\r\nhomework.  \r\nHere, moreover, the appellant had a second opportunity to\r\nbring her theory to the trial judge's attention.  Under Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 52(a), when an action is tried upon the facts without a\r\njury, \"the court shall find the facts specially and state\r\nseparately its conclusions of law.\"  A litigant who believes that\r\nthose findings or conclusions are erroneous in any respect may file\r\na motion to alter or amend the judgment no later than ten days\r\nafter its entry.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(b).  Thus, if the\r\nappellant believed that the district court erred in failing to\r\napply the doctrine of negligence per se, she could have brought the\r\nmatter to the court's attention by way of Rule 52(b).  See, e.g.,\r\nNational Metal Finishing Co. v. Barclays American/Commercial, Inc.,\r\n899 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir. 1990).  She did not do so.  We see no\r\nreason to excuse her twice-repeated procedural default.\r\nWe add that, in this case, all roads lead to Rome. \r\nBecause the FTCA incorporates the substantive law of the place of\r\nthe harm, see 28 U.S.C.  1346(b), and the fatal crash occurred in\r\nWest Virginia, we look to the law of that jurisdiction for the rule\r\nof decision.  See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 478 (1994); Reillyv. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 161 (1st Cir. 1988).  Under West\r\nVirginia law, an individual's noncompliance with a safety\r\nregulation is not negligence per se, but, rather, as the district\r\ncourt found in this case, it is at most some evidence of\r\nnegligence.  See Waugh v. Traxler, 412 S.E.2d 756, 759-60 (W. Va.\r\n1991) (holding that a violation of a safety statute is prima facie\r\nnegligence and not negligence per se); Miller v. Warren, 390 S.E.2d\r\n207, 208-09 (W. Va. 1990) (explaining that noncompliance with a\r\nfire code or similar regulation constitutes no more than prima\r\nfacie negligence).  The appellant's hypothesis that a failure to\r\ncomply strictly with the Handbook provisions constitutes negligence\r\nper se under West Virginia law is, therefore, legally incorrect.\r\nThird:  The appellant's fallback position is no more\r\nfruitful.  She claims that, even if the district court applied an\r\nappropriate legal standard, it committed clear error in failing to\r\nfind Eldridge negligent.  This claim, although couched in the idiom\r\nof clear-error review, is no more than a thinly-veiled invitation\r\nto have us substitute our collective judgment for that of the\r\ndistrict court.  We decline the invitation.\r\nJudge O'Toole heard fifteen days of testimony, much of it\r\npointing in different directions.  Having carefully combed the\r\nrecord, we are satisfied that he had before him competent evidence\r\nthat Eldridge substantially complied with the obligations imposed\r\nby the Handbook.  The evidence supports (though admittedly it does\r\nnot compel) findings to the effect that Eldridge exercised due\r\ndiligence in obtaining relevant information concerning aeronautical\r\nand weather conditions and that he provided a reasonably complete\r\npre-flight briefing to Jackson on the morning of take-off.  SeeJackson, 983 F. Supp. at 280; see also Davis v. United States, 824\r\nF.2d 549, 552 (7th Cir. 1987) (describing the information that must\r\nbe assembled for a pre-flight briefing).  This data included\r\ncurrent and future weather trends and unusual weather activity in\r\nthe areas along Jackson's anticipated path of flight.  See Jackson,\r\n983 F. Supp. at 280-81.  Contrary to the appellant's claim that a\r\nflight services specialist must issue specific weather advisories\r\nto a pilot in haec verba, the law only requires a weather briefer\r\nto interpret, translate, and convey in summarized form relevant\r\nweather information.  See Moorhead v. Mitsubishi Aircraft Int'l,\r\nInc., 828 F.2d 278, 282 (5th Cir. 1987); see also Jackson, 983 F.\r\nSupp. at 280 n.10 (reprinting Handbook instruction:  \"Do not read\r\nindividual weather reports or forecasts unless, in your judgment,\r\nit is necessary to emphasize an important point or unless\r\nspecifically requested to do so by the pilot.\").\r\nIn short, the law allows a weather briefer a certain\r\ndegree of latitude in transmitting weather information to a pilot. \r\nThe evidence of record here adequately supports the district\r\ncourt's conclusion that Eldridge used this latitude in a\r\npermissible fashion by giving Jackson a comprehensive forecast and\r\naccurately summarizing all pertinent weather advisories.  In\r\nparticular, Eldridge informed Jackson that he could expect icing\r\nconditions at his planned altitude from the eastern half of\r\nKentucky to West Virginia, see Jackson, 983 F. Supp. at 280, and\r\nwarned of \"patchy precipitation,\" \"light snow showers\" (which,\r\ncoupled with gusting winds, would make it appear as if it were\r\n\"snowing sideways\"), and near-freezing conditions at the Charleston\r\nairport, see id. at 281.  This constituted, at the very least,\r\nsubstantial compliance with the  regimen specified by the Handbook. \r\nNo more was exigible.  See Davis, 824 F.2d  at 554-55; Barbosa v.\r\nUnited States, 811 F.2d 1444, 1447 (11th Cir. 1987); cf. Delta\r\nAirlines, Inc. v. United States, 561 F.2d 381, 390 (1st Cir. 1977)\r\n(holding that \"a substantial and unjustified failure\" to follow FAA\r\nsafety provisions is a persuasive indication of a lack of due\r\ncare).\r\nFourth:  Under West Virginia law, a plaintiff is not\r\nentitled to recover in a wrongful death suit if her decedent's\r\nnegligence equals or exceeds the defendant's.  See Bradley v.\r\nAppalachian Power Co., 256 S.E.2d 879, 885 (W. Va. 1979)\r\n(elucidating comparative negligence doctrine); see also W. Va. Code\r\n55-7-5 (1994) (stipulating that a wrongful death action may\r\nsucceed only if the party injured would have been entitled to\r\nrecover damages had death not ensued). The appellant asseverates\r\nthat the trial court clearly erred in ranking Jackson's negligence\r\nas greater than the combined negligence of the three main\r\ngovernment actors.  Because the district court supportably found\r\nthat neither Eldridge nor Christine Garcia was negligent, this\r\nasseveration reduces to a naked claim that the negligence of\r\nUlanch, the Charleston-based air traffic controller, was more a\r\nfactor in the crash than the negligence of the decedent.\r\nJudge O'Toole found both men negligent:  Ulanch for\r\nneglecting to transmit no fewer than six weather advisories that\r\nwarned of icing conditions as Jackson approached the Charleston\r\nAirport, see Jackson, 983 F. Supp. at 282; and Jackson both for\r\nfailing sufficiently to inquire whether dangerous conditions near\r\nCharleston persisted and for braving weather conditions that he\r\nknew his aircraft could not withstand, see id. at 282-83.  In the\r\ncourt's estimation, Jackson's discerned negligence outweighed\r\nUlanch's discerned negligence.  See id. at 283.  Consequently, the\r\ncourt entered judgment for the United States.  See id. at 284.\r\nWe cannot say that the trial court's comparative\r\nnegligence analysis was \"simply wrong.\"  State Police Ass'n, 125\r\nF.3d at 5.  As a pilot, Jackson had the primary responsibility for\r\nthe safety of his aircraft.  See Cappello v. Duncan Aircraft Sales,\r\n79 F.3d 1465, 1469 (6th Cir. 1996); Davis, 824 F.2d at 552; seealso 14 C.F.R.  91.3 (1998).  Awareness of facts and circumstances\r\nthat pertain to the safe operation of the aircraft is paramount,\r\nand a pilot, exercising due care for his own safety, must endeavor\r\nconstantly to update weather information.  See Davis, 824 F.2d at\r\n551.  Eldridge's initial briefing, which mentioned icing conditions\r\nnear Charleston, should have served as a red flag to a wary pilot. \r\nAt a bare minimum, this initial briefing put Jackson on inquiry\r\nnotice and triggered an affirmative duty to inquire about whether\r\nthe hazardous conditions persisted.  See Somlo v. United States,\r\n416 F.2d 640, 645 (7th Cir. 1969) (holding that it was a pilot's\r\nduty \"to inquire whether icing was still a factor\" once forewarned\r\nof icing conditions).  Nothing in the record suggests that Jackson\r\nfulfilled this duty.\r\nRelatedly, the record bears out the district court's\r\ndetermination that Jackson failed to take reasonable steps to avoid\r\nweather conditions that he knew his single-engine Mooney M-20M\r\nairplane could not withstand.  Jackson was an experienced pilot who\r\nhad owned the aircraft for some time.  The Mooney flight manual\r\nexplicitly warned that the M-20M was not equipped for flight in\r\nicing conditions.  The lower court supportably could have found  \r\nas, indeed, it did   that Jackson's disregard of this warning not\r\nonly transgressed an applicable FAA regulation, see 14 C.F.R. \r\n91.9 (1998) (requiring that an aircraft be operated in compliance\r\nwith limitations specified in its flight manual), but also ran\r\ncounter to common sense.  Flying an airplane contrary to the safety\r\nprovisions stipulated in the applicable flight manual is itself a\r\nsufficient predicate for a finding of negligence.  See Hoban v.\r\nGrumman Corp., 717 F. Supp. 1129, 1136-37 (E.D. Va. 1989).\r\nIn determining the relative negligence of Jackson and\r\nUlanch, the trial court also properly considered the degree to\r\nwhich Jackson had been forewarned of the continued presence of\r\nicing conditions in the Charleston area.  While approaching the\r\nCharleston airport, Jackson radioed Air Traffic Control and\r\nacknowledged that he had received weather information from\r\nCharleston's Automatic Terminal Information System, a continuous\r\ntwenty-four hour source of current weather information.  Equally as\r\nimportant, several pilots in the Charleston area had transmitted\r\nreports warning of icing conditions, and at least one of these\r\nreports was transmitted on the same radio frequency Jackson earlier\r\nused to contact Charleston Air Traffic Control.  See Jackson, 983\r\nF. Supp. at 278.  The court inferred that Jackson heard the weather\r\nreports from other pilots warning of icing conditions in ample time\r\nto take corrective action.  See id.  Under the circumstances, the\r\ninference was reasonable, particularly given the regulatory\r\nrequirement that pilots must maintain a continuous watch on an\r\n\"appropriate radio frequency\" during flight.  14 C.F.R.  91.183\r\n(1998).\r\nIt is both good law and sound logic that a pilot bears a\r\nresponsibility to circumvent dangerous weather conditions that are\r\nperceptible through his own senses.  See Spaulding v. United\r\nStates, 455 F.2d 222, 226-27 (9th Cir. 1972).  This includes the\r\nduty to interpret weather conditions that are confronted en route,\r\nevaluate their significance based on past experiences, and avoid\r\ninappropriate courses of action.  See Moorhead, 828 F.2d at 283. \r\nThe lower court concluded that Jackson did not fulfill this\r\nobligation.  See Jackson, 983 F. Supp. at 282-83.  This conclusion,\r\ntoo, is supportable.  Jackson was a very experienced pilot who had\r\nlogged nearly 500 hours of flight time and was familiar with the\r\nwarning signs for icing conditions.  See id. at 275. Indications of\r\nicing conditions unsuitable for flight in a single-engine Mooney M-\r\n20M surrounded Jackson as he neared Charleston, including near-\r\nfreezing temperatures and variable amounts of precipitation.  \r\nStill, Jackson took no affirmative action to avoid the looming\r\nperil.  These, and other, facts fully supported a finding that a\r\npilot of Jackson's experience should have recognized the danger of\r\nproceeding single-mindedly through perilous prospects.\r\nTo be sure, Ulanch's negligence also was starkly\r\napparent.  We do not minimize his failings.  Comparing the relative\r\nfault of two negligent actors, however, is an exercise better\r\ncommitted to a trial judge, who has an opportunity to see and hear\r\nthe witnesses, than to the court of appeals.  Only rarely   and in\r\nextremely compelling circumstances   will an appellate panel, from\r\nthe more restrained perspective afforded by a cold record, tinker\r\nwith the trier's weighing of relative fault.  We have no occasion\r\nto essay so unusual a step today.  Taking into account the totality\r\nof the evidence, we cannot say that the trial court clearly erred\r\nin determining that Jackson's negligence equaled or exceeded that\r\nof Ulanch.\r\nWe need go no further.  The other arguments raised by\r\nthe appellant are plainly insufficient, adequately answered in the\r\ndistrict court's memorandum opinion, or both.  Hence, we uphold the\r\ndistrict court's determination that the appellant is not entitled\r\nto recover damages under the FTCA.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

Evans, 127 F.3d 175, 181 (1st Cir.1997).  This deferential standard acknowledges that, unlike an appellate tribunal, the trial court \"sees and hears the witnesses at first hand and comes to appreciate the nuances of the litigation in a way which appellate courts cannot hope to replicate.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990).  Thus, a trial court's factual determinations will be set aside only if, \"after careful evaluation of the evidence, we are left with an abiding conviction that those determinations and findings are simply wrong.\"  State Police Ass'n v. Commissioner, 125 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard is critically important here.  At many junctures, more than one plausible inference can be drawn from the underlying facts.  On clear-error review, we cannot second-guess the trier's choices among those competing inferences even if, had we been sitting as triers of the facts, we might have arrived at a different set of judgments.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  The appellant argued below that Eldridge, the FAA employee who provided the decedent's pre-flight briefing, was guilty of negligence because he failed to incorporate specific weather advisories from the National Weather Service into that briefing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The trial court concluded that, although Eldridge's pre-flight briefing did not specifically mention the advisories by name, it comprehensively summarized the weather conditions that Jackson could expect to encounter during his flight.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280.   Accordingly, the court determined that Eldridge was not negligent.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant attempts an end-run around the strictures of clear-error review by positing the existence of an error of law.  To that end, she argues that Eldridge's failure to mention the AIRMETs constituted negligence per se.  In mounting this argument, she points to paragraphs 3-10(a) &amp; (b) of the Flight Services Handbook (the Handbook), a procedural guide issued by the FAA in the interests of ensuring flight safety.  These paragraphs limn the information a flight services specialist should gather preparatory to delivering a pre-flight briefing and the procedures to be followed in transmitting this data to pilots.  Many of these steps are couched in mandatory terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The appellant now contends, for the first time, that the court had no option but to find Eldridge guilty of negligence because he violated the obligatory Handbook provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is an abecedarian rule that litigants ordinarily cannot shift legal theories in mid-stream:  \"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992).  Inasmuch as the appellant never advanced a negligence per se theory below, this principle has obvious applicability here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant offers two intertwined reasons why we should excuse her procedural default.  First, she suggests that, in a bench trial at which the district court does not require the parties to submit written requests for conclusions of law, a litigant should not be penalized for failing spontaneously to articulate her position on the relevant legal issues.  Second, she contends that, regardless of her default, the district court had an unflagging duty to divine, interpret, and apply the governing legal standards correctly.  Neither reason is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court, sitting jury-waived, may--but need not--ask for suggested findings and conclusions.  Either way, the rule is straightforward:  with few exceptions (none applicable here), a party who, having adequate opportunity, fails to alert the trial court to a particular legal theory cannot thereafter be heard to complain that the court overlooked that theory.  See, e.g., Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 987 (1st Cir.1995);  Teamsters, 953 F.2d at 21;  McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1991).  This is as it should be.  Trial judges are not mind-readers, and they should not be expected to do counsel's homework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the appellant had a second opportunity to bring her theory to the trial judge's attention.  Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), when an action is tried upon the facts without a jury, \"the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law.\"   A litigant who believes that those findings or conclusions are erroneous in any respect may file a motion to alter or amend the judgment no later than ten days after its entry.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b).  Thus, if the appellant believed that the district court erred in failing to apply the doctrine of negligence per se, she could have brought the matter to the court's attention by way of Rule 52(b).  See, e.g., National Metal Finishing Co. v. Barclays American/Commercial, Inc., 899 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir.1990).  She did not do so.  We see no reason to excuse her twice-repeated procedural default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that, in this case, all roads lead to Rome.  Because the FTCA incorporates the substantive law of the place of the harm, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b), and the fatal crash occurred in West Virginia, we look to the law of that jurisdiction for the rule of decision.  See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 478, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994);  Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 161 (1st Cir.1988).  Under West Virginia law, an individual's noncompliance with a safety regulation is not negligence per se, but, rather, as the district court found in this case, it is at most some evidence of negligence.  See Waugh v. Traxler, 186 W.Va. 355, 412 S.E.2d 756, 759-60 (1991) (holding that a violation of a safety statute is prima facie negligence and not negligence per se);  Miller v. Warren, 182 W.Va. 560, 390 S.E.2d 207, 208-09 (1990) (explaining that noncompliance with a fire code or similar regulation constitutes no more than prima facie negligence).  The appellant's hypothesis that a failure to comply strictly with the Handbook provisions constitutes negligence per se under West Virginia law is, therefore, legally incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  The appellant's fallback position is no more fruitful.  She claims that, even if the district court applied an appropriate legal standard, it committed clear error in failing to find Eldridge negligent.  This claim, although couched in the idiom of clear-error review, is no more than a thinly-veiled invitation to have us substitute our collective judgment for that of the district court.  We decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge O'Toole heard fifteen days of testimony, much of it pointing in different directions.  Having carefully combed the record, we are satisfied that he had before him competent evidence that Eldridge substantially complied with the obligations imposed by the Handbook.  The evidence supports (though admittedly it does not compel) findings to the effect that Eldridge exercised due diligence in obtaining relevant information concerning aeronautical and weather conditions and that he provided a reasonably complete pre-flight briefing to Jackson on the morning of take-off.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280;  see also Davis v. United States, 824 F.2d 549, 552 (7th Cir.1987) (describing the information that must be assembled for a pre-flight briefing).  This data included current and future weather trends and unusual weather activity in the areas along Jackson's anticipated path of flight.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280-81.   Contrary to the appellant's claim that a flight services specialist must issue specific weather advisories to a pilot in haec verba, the law only requires a weather briefer to interpret, translate, and convey in summarized form relevant weather information.  See Moorhead v. Mitsubishi Aircraft Int'l, Inc., 828 F.2d 278, 282 (5th Cir.1987);  see also Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280 n. 10 (reprinting Handbook instruction:  \"Do not read individual weather reports or forecasts unless, in your judgment, it is necessary to emphasize an important point or unless specifically requested to do so by the pilot.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the law allows a weather briefer a certain degree of latitude in transmitting weather information to a pilot.  The evidence of record here adequately supports the district court's conclusion that Eldridge used this latitude in a permissible fashion by giving Jackson a comprehensive forecast and accurately summarizing all pertinent weather advisories.  In particular, Eldridge informed Jackson that he could expect icing conditions at his planned altitude from the eastern half of Kentucky to West Virginia, see Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280, and warned of \"patchy precipitation,\" \"light snow showers\" (which, coupled with gusting winds, would make it appear as if it were \"snowing sideways\"), and near-freezing conditions at the Charleston airport, see id. at 281.   This constituted, at the very least, substantial compliance with the regimen specified by the Handbook.  No more was exigible.  See Davis, 824 F.2d at 554-55;  Barbosa v. United States, 811 F.2d 1444, 1447 (11th Cir.1987);  cf.  Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. United States, 561 F.2d 381, 390 (1st Cir.1977) (holding that \"a substantial and unjustified failure\" to follow FAA safety provisions is a persuasive indication of a lack of due care).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  Under West Virginia law, a plaintiff is not entitled to recover in a wrongful death suit if her decedent's negligence equals or exceeds the defendant's.  See Bradley v. Appalachian Power Co., 163 W.Va. 332, 256 S.E.2d 879, 885 (1979) (elucidating comparative negligence doctrine);  see also W. Va.Code &#167; 55-7-5 (1994) (stipulating that a wrongful death action may succeed only if the party injured would have been entitled to recover damages had death not ensued).  The appellant asseverates that the trial court clearly erred in ranking Jackson's negligence as greater than the combined negligence of the three main government actors.  Because the district court supportably found that neither Eldridge nor Christine Garcia was negligent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> this asseveration reduces to a naked claim that the negligence of Ulanch, the Charleston-based air traffic controller, was more a factor in the crash than the negligence of the decedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge O'Toole found both men negligent:  Ulanch for neglecting to transmit no fewer than six weather advisories that warned of icing conditions as Jackson approached the Charleston Airport,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> see Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 282;  and Jackson both for failing sufficiently to inquire whether dangerous conditions near Charleston persisted and for braving weather conditions that he knew his aircraft could not withstand, see id. at 282-83.   In the court's estimation, Jackson's discerned negligence outweighed Ulanch's discerned negligence.  See id. at 283.   Consequently, the court entered judgment for the United States.  See id. at 284.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot say that the trial court's comparative negligence analysis was \"simply wrong.\"  State Police Ass'n, 125 F.3d at 5. As a pilot, Jackson had the primary responsibility for the safety of his aircraft.  See Cappello v. Duncan Aircraft Sales, 79 F.3d 1465, 1469 (6th Cir.1996);  Davis, 824 F.2d at 552;  see also 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.3 (1998).  Awareness of facts and circumstances that pertain to the safe operation of the aircraft is paramount, and a pilot, exercising due care for his own safety, must endeavor constantly to update weather information.  See Davis, 824 F.2d at 551.   Eldridge's initial briefing, which mentioned icing conditions near Charleston, should have served as a red flag to a wary pilot.  At a bare minimum, this initial briefing put Jackson on inquiry notice and triggered an affirmative duty to inquire about whether the hazardous conditions persisted.  See Somlo v. United States, 416 F.2d 640, 645 (7th Cir.1969) (holding that it was a pilot's duty \"to inquire whether icing was still a factor\" once forewarned of icing conditions). Nothing in the record suggests that Jackson fulfilled this duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, the record bears out the district court's determination that Jackson failed to take reasonable steps to avoid weather conditions that he knew his single-engine Mooney M-20M airplane could not withstand.  Jackson was an experienced pilot who had owned the aircraft for some time.  The Mooney flight manual explicitly warned that the M-20M was not equipped for flight in icing conditions.  The lower court supportably could have found--as, indeed, it did--that Jackson's disregard of this warning not only transgressed an applicable FAA regulation, see 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.9 (1998) (requiring that an aircraft be operated in compliance with limitations specified in its flight manual), but also ran counter to common sense.  Flying an airplane contrary to the safety provisions stipulated in the applicable flight manual is itself a sufficient predicate for a finding of negligence.  See Hoban v. Grumman Corp., 717 F.Supp. 1129, 1136-37 (E.D.Va.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the relative negligence of Jackson and Ulanch, the trial court also properly considered the degree to which Jackson had been forewarned of the continued presence of icing conditions in the Charleston area.  While approaching the Charleston airport, Jackson radioed Air Traffic Control and acknowledged that he had received weather information from Charleston's Automatic Terminal Information System, a continuous twenty-four hour source of current weather information.  Equally as important, several pilots in the Charleston area had transmitted reports warning of icing conditions, and at least one of these reports was transmitted on the same radio frequency Jackson earlier used to contact Charleston Air Traffic Control.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 278.   The court inferred that Jackson heard the weather reports from other pilots warning of icing conditions in ample time to take corrective action.  See id.   Under the circumstances, the inference was reasonable, particularly given the regulatory requirement that pilots must maintain a continuous watch on an \"appropriate radio frequency\" during flight.  14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.183 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is both good law and sound logic that a pilot bears a responsibility to circumvent dangerous weather conditions that are perceptible through his own senses.  See Spaulding v. United States, 455 F.2d 222, 226-27 (9th Cir.1972).  This includes the duty to interpret weather conditions that are confronted en route, evaluate their significance based on past experiences, and avoid inappropriate courses of action.  See Moorhead, 828 F.2d at 283.   The lower court concluded that Jackson did not fulfill this obligation.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 282-83.   This conclusion, too, is supportable.  Jackson was a very experienced pilot who had logged nearly 500 hours of flight time and was familiar with the warning signs for icing conditions.  See id. at 275.   Indications of icing conditions unsuitable for flight in a single-engine Mooney M-20M surrounded Jackson as he neared Charleston, including near-freezing temperatures and variable amounts of precipitation.  Still, Jackson took no affirmative action to avoid the looming peril.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  These, and other, facts fully supported a finding that a pilot of Jackson's experience should have recognized the danger of proceeding single-mindedly through perilous prospects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Ulanch's negligence also was starkly apparent.  We do not minimize his failings.  Comparing the relative fault of two negligent actors, however, is an exercise better committed to a trial judge, who has an opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, than to the court of appeals.  Only rarely--and in extremely compelling circumstances--will an appellate panel, from the more restrained perspective afforded by a cold record, tinker with the trier's weighing of relative fault.  We have no occasion to essay so unusual a step today.  Taking into account the totality of the evidence, we cannot say that the trial court clearly erred in determining that Jackson's negligence equaled or exceeded that of Ulanch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The other arguments raised by the appellant are plainly insufficient, adequately answered in the district court's memorandum opinion, or both.  Hence, we uphold the district court's determination that the appellant is not entitled to recover damages under the FTCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Two types of weather advisories, each of which is known by an acronym, are pertinent here:  AIRMETs (advisories concerning weather conditions potentially hazardous to aircraft having limited capability) and SIGMETs (advisories to all aircraft about severe weather).

In the court's view, this oversight was \"too isolated an error to support a conclusion of negligence\" on Garcia's part, and in all events, had no causal relationship to the accident.  Id. Despite the appellant's all-out assault on this conclusion, we discern no mistake of fact or of law.

The next day, he again called Jonesboro and requested a pre-flight weather briefing.  Flight Services Specialist Robert Eldridge obliged.  See id. at 276-77 (describing contents of the pre-flight briefing).  After receiving this briefing, Jackson filed a flight plan and departed from Little Rock, bound for Charleston, in his single-engine aircraft (a Mooney M-20M).  He had radio contacts with a number of air traffic control facilities as he flew over Tennessee and Kentucky.  See id. at 277 (describing same).  As he approached Charleston, he engaged in an extensive dialogue with a Charleston-based air traffic controller, Mark Ulanch.  See id. at 278-79 (describing that colloquy).  The fatal crash occurred in the course of this approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have often preached, but perhaps too seldom practiced, the philosophy that \"when a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\"  Lawton v.

This deferential standard acknowledges that, unlike an appellate tribunal, the trial court \"sees and hears the witnesses at first hand and comes to appreciate the nuances of the litigation in a way which appellate courts cannot hope to replicate.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir.1990).  Thus, a trial court's factual determinations will be set aside only if, \"after careful evaluation of the evidence, we are left with an abiding conviction that those determinations and findings are simply wrong.\"  State Police Ass'n v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746421\"><a href=\"/opinion/746421/state-police-association-of-massachusetts-v-commissioner-of-internal/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard is critically important here.  At many junctures, more than one plausible inference can be drawn from the underlying facts.  On clear-error review, we cannot second-guess the trier's choices among those competing inferences even if, had we been sitting as triers of the facts, we might have arrived at a different set of judgments.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 573, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280.   Accordingly, the court determined that Eldridge was not negligent.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant attempts an end-run around the strictures of clear-error review by positing the existence of an error of law.  To that end, she argues that Eldridge's failure to mention the AIRMETs constituted negligence per se.  In mounting this argument, she points to paragraphs 3-10(a) &amp; (b) of the Flight Services Handbook (the Handbook), a procedural guide issued by the FAA in the interests of ensuring flight safety.  These paragraphs limn the information a flight services specialist should gather preparatory to delivering a pre-flight briefing and the procedures to be followed in transmitting this data to pilots.  Many of these steps are couched in mandatory terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The appellant now contends, for the first time, that the court had no option but to find Eldridge guilty of negligence because he violated the obligatory Handbook provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is an abecedarian rule that litigants ordinarily cannot shift legal theories in mid-stream:  \"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1992).  Inasmuch as the appellant never advanced a negligence per se theory below, this principle has obvious applicability here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant offers two intertwined reasons why we should excuse her procedural default.  First, she suggests that, in a bench trial at which the district court does not require the parties to submit written requests for conclusions of law, a litigant should not be penalized for failing spontaneously to articulate her position on the relevant legal issues.  Second, she contends that, regardless of her default, the district court had an unflagging duty to divine, interpret, and apply the governing legal standards correctly.  Neither reason is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court, sitting jury-waived, may--but need not--ask for suggested findings and conclusions.  Either way, the rule is straightforward:  with few exceptions (none applicable here), a party who, having adequate opportunity, fails to alert the trial court to a particular legal theory cannot thereafter be heard to complain that the court overlooked that theory.  See, e.g., Martinez v. Colon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696203\"><a href=\"/opinion/696203/wilfredo-martinez-aka-wilfredo-martinez-rodriguez-v-rafael-colon-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 987 (1st Cir.1995);  Teamsters, 953 F.2d at 21;  McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Tech., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991).  This is as it should be.  Trial judges are not mind-readers, and they should not be expected to do counsel's homework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the appellant had a second opportunity to bring her theory to the trial judge's attention.  Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), when an action is tried upon the facts without a jury, \"the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law.\"   A litigant who believes that those findings or conclusions are erroneous in any respect may file a motion to alter or amend the judgment no later than ten days after its entry.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b).  Thus, if the appellant believed that the district court erred in failing to apply the doctrine of negligence per se, she could have brought the matter to the court's attention by way of Rule 52(b).  See, e.g., National Metal Finishing Co. v. Barclays American/Commercial, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538798\"><a href=\"/opinion/538798/national-metal-finishing-company-inc-v-barclaysamericancommercial-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.1990).  She did not do so.  We see no reason to excuse her twice-repeated procedural default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that, in this case, all roads lead to Rome.  Because the FTCA incorporates the substantive law of the place of the harm, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b), and the fatal crash occurred in West Virginia, we look to the law of that jurisdiction for the rule of decision.  See FDIC v. Meyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 478, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under West Virginia law, an individual's noncompliance with a safety regulation is not negligence per se, but, rather, as the district court found in this case, it is at most some evidence of negligence.  See Waugh v. Traxler, 186 W.Va. 355, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1410206\"><a href=\"/opinion/1410206/waugh-v-traxler/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span>, 759-60 (1991) (holding that a violation of a safety statute is prima facie negligence and not negligence per se);  Miller v. Warren, 182 W.Va. 560, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1336577\"><a href=\"/opinion/1336577/miller-v-warren/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 208-09 (1990) (explaining that noncompliance with a fire code or similar regulation constitutes no more than prima facie negligence).  The appellant's hypothesis that a failure to comply strictly with the Handbook provisions constitutes negligence per se under West Virginia law is, therefore, legally incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  The appellant's fallback position is no more fruitful.  She claims that, even if the district court applied an appropriate legal standard, it committed clear error in failing to find Eldridge negligent.  This claim, although couched in the idiom of clear-error review, is no more than a thinly-veiled invitation to have us substitute our collective judgment for that of the district court.  We decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge O'Toole heard fifteen days of testimony, much of it pointing in different directions.  Having carefully combed the record, we are satisfied that he had before him competent evidence that Eldridge substantially complied with the obligations imposed by the Handbook.  The evidence supports (though admittedly it does not compel) findings to the effect that Eldridge exercised due diligence in obtaining relevant information concerning aeronautical and weather conditions and that he provided a reasonably complete pre-flight briefing to Jackson on the morning of take-off.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280;  see also Davis v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491713\"><a href=\"/opinion/491713/pearl-davis-of-the-estate-of-raymond-e-davis-deceased-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 552 (7th Cir.1987) (describing the information that must be assembled for a pre-flight briefing).  This data included current and future weather trends and unusual weather activity in the areas along Jackson's anticipated path of flight.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280-81.   Contrary to the appellant's claim that a flight services specialist must issue specific weather advisories to a pilot in haec verba, the law only requires a weather briefer to interpret, translate, and convey in summarized form relevant weather information.  See Moorhead v. Mitsubishi Aircraft Int'l, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493919\"><a href=\"/opinion/493919/ruth-henderson-moorhead-v-mitsubishi-aircraft-international-inc-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 282 (5th Cir.1987);  see also Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280 n. 10 (reprinting Handbook instruction:  \"Do not read individual weather reports or forecasts unless, in your judgment, it is necessary to emphasize an important point or unless specifically requested to do so by the pilot.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the law allows a weather briefer a certain degree of latitude in transmitting weather information to a pilot.  The evidence of record here adequately supports the district court's conclusion that Eldridge used this latitude in a permissible fashion by giving Jackson a comprehensive forecast and accurately summarizing all pertinent weather advisories.  In particular, Eldridge informed Jackson that he could expect icing conditions at his planned altitude from the eastern half of Kentucky to West Virginia, see Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 280, and warned of \"patchy precipitation,\" \"light snow showers\" (which, coupled with gusting winds, would make it appear as if it were \"snowing sideways\"), and near-freezing conditions at the Charleston airport, see id. at 281.   This constituted, at the very least, substantial compliance with the regimen specified by the Handbook.  No more was exigible.  See Davis, 824 F.2d at 554-55;  Barbosa v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483370\"><a href=\"/opinion/483370/rita-barbosa-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate-of-james-barbosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1444</span></a></span>, 1447 (11th Cir.1987);  cf.  Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348615\"><a href=\"/opinion/348615/delta-air-lines-inc-v-united-states-of-america-karen-haelsig-mcmaster/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 390 (1st Cir.1977) (holding that \"a substantial and unjustified failure\" to follow FAA safety provisions is a persuasive indication of a lack of due care).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  Under West Virginia law, a plaintiff is not entitled to recover in a wrongful death suit if her decedent's negligence equals or exceeds the defendant's.  See Bradley v. Appalachian Power Co., 163 W.Va. 332, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1397438\"><a href=\"/opinion/1397438/bradley-v-appalachian-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></a></span>, 885 (1979) (elucidating comparative negligence doctrine);  see also W. Va.Code &#167; 55-7-5 (1994) (stipulating that a wrongful death action may succeed only if the party injured would have been entitled to recover damages had death not ensued).  The appellant asseverates that the trial court clearly erred in ranking Jackson's negligence as greater than the combined negligence of the three main government actors.  Because the district court supportably found that neither Eldridge nor Christine Garcia was negligent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> this asseveration reduces to a naked claim that the negligence of Ulanch, the Charleston-based air traffic controller, was more a factor in the crash than the negligence of the decedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge O'Toole found both men negligent:  Ulanch for neglecting to transmit no fewer than six weather advisories that warned of icing conditions as Jackson approached the Charleston Airport,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> see Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 282;  and Jackson both for failing sufficiently to inquire whether dangerous conditions near Charleston persisted and for braving weather conditions that he knew his aircraft could not withstand, see id. at 282-83.   In the court's estimation, Jackson's discerned negligence outweighed Ulanch's discerned negligence.  See id. at 283.   Consequently, the court entered judgment for the United States.  See id. at 284.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot say that the trial court's comparative negligence analysis was \"simply wrong.\"  State Police Ass'n, 125 F.3d at 5. As a pilot, Jackson had the primary responsibility for the safety of his aircraft.  See Cappello v. Duncan Aircraft Sales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715652\"><a href=\"/opinion/715652/phillip-r-and-edna-cappello-individually-and-phillip-r-cappello-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1465</span></a></span>, 1469 (6th Cir.1996);  Davis, 824 F.2d at 552;  see also 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.3 (1998).  Awareness of facts and circumstances that pertain to the safe operation of the aircraft is paramount, and a pilot, exercising due care for his own safety, must endeavor constantly to update weather information.  See Davis, 824 F.2d at 551.   Eldridge's initial briefing, which mentioned icing conditions near Charleston, should have served as a red flag to a wary pilot.  At a bare minimum, this initial briefing put Jackson on inquiry notice and triggered an affirmative duty to inquire about whether the hazardous conditions persisted.  See Somlo v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"286681\"><a href=\"/opinion/286681/thomas-g-somlo-and-progress-for-vending-inc-a-corporation-and-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 645 (7th Cir.1969) (holding that it was a pilot's duty \"to inquire whether icing was still a factor\" once forewarned of icing conditions). Nothing in the record suggests that Jackson fulfilled this duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, the record bears out the district court's determination that Jackson failed to take reasonable steps to avoid weather conditions that he knew his single-engine Mooney M-20M airplane could not withstand.  Jackson was an experienced pilot who had owned the aircraft for some time.  The Mooney flight manual explicitly warned that the M-20M was not equipped for flight in icing conditions.  The lower court supportably could have found--as, indeed, it did--that Jackson's disregard of this warning not only transgressed an applicable FAA regulation, see 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.9 (1998) (requiring that an aircraft be operated in compliance with limitations specified in its flight manual), but also ran counter to common sense.  Flying an airplane contrary to the safety provisions stipulated in the applicable flight manual is itself a sufficient predicate for a finding of negligence.  See Hoban v. Grumman Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></span>, 1136-37 (E.D.Va.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the relative negligence of Jackson and Ulanch, the trial court also properly considered the degree to which Jackson had been forewarned of the continued presence of icing conditions in the Charleston area.  While approaching the Charleston airport, Jackson radioed Air Traffic Control and acknowledged that he had received weather information from Charleston's Automatic Terminal Information System, a continuous twenty-four hour source of current weather information.  Equally as important, several pilots in the Charleston area had transmitted reports warning of icing conditions, and at least one of these reports was transmitted on the same radio frequency Jackson earlier used to contact Charleston Air Traffic Control.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 278.   The court inferred that Jackson heard the weather reports from other pilots warning of icing conditions in ample time to take corrective action.  See id.   Under the circumstances, the inference was reasonable, particularly given the regulatory requirement that pilots must maintain a continuous watch on an \"appropriate radio frequency\" during flight.  14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.183 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is both good law and sound logic that a pilot bears a responsibility to circumvent dangerous weather conditions that are perceptible through his own senses.  See Spaulding v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"301391\"><a href=\"/opinion/301391/joan-m-spaulding-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span>, 226-27 (9th Cir.1972).  This includes the duty to interpret weather conditions that are confronted en route, evaluate their significance based on past experiences, and avoid inappropriate courses of action.  See Moorhead, 828 F.2d at 283.   The lower court concluded that Jackson did not fulfill this obligation.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 282-83.   This conclusion, too, is supportable.  Jackson was a very experienced pilot who had logged nearly 500 hours of flight time and was familiar with the warning signs for icing conditions.  See id. at 275.   Indications of icing conditions unsuitable for flight in a single-engine Mooney M-20M surrounded Jackson as he neared Charleston, including near-freezing temperatures and variable amounts of precipitation.  Still, Jackson took no affirmative action to avoid the looming peril.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  These, and other, facts fully supported a finding that a pilot of Jackson's experience should have recognized the danger of proceeding single-mindedly through perilous prospects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Ulanch's negligence also was starkly apparent.  We do not minimize his failings.  Comparing the relative fault of two negligent actors, however, is an exercise better committed to a trial judge, who has an opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, than to the court of appeals.  Only rarely--and in extremely compelling circumstances--will an appellate panel, from the more restrained perspective afforded by a cold record, tinker with the trier's weighing of relative fault.  We have no occasion to essay so unusual a step today.  Taking into account the totality of the evidence, we cannot say that the trial court clearly erred in determining that Jackson's negligence equaled or exceeded that of Ulanch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The other arguments raised by the appellant are plainly insufficient, adequately answered in the district court's memorandum opinion, or both.

In the court's view, this oversight was \"too isolated an error to support a conclusion of negligence\" on Garcia's part, and in all events, had no causal relationship to the accident.  Id. Despite the appellant's all-out assault on this conclusion, we discern no mistake of fact or of law.  See, e.g., Davis, 824 F.2d at 555 (holding that a weather briefer did not act negligently despite failing to furnish one updated weather advisory to a pilot)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The warnings, known as PIREPs (pilot weather reports), had in turn been transmitted to Ulanch from other pilots flying in the vicinity of Charleston</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> By contrast, the court heard testimony that, during an earlier flight in similar conditions, Jackson averted icing conditions by changing altitudes</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The court below offered an alternative rationale for its decision.  See Jackson, 983 F.Supp. at 283 (finding a lack of proof regarding causation).  Because we conclude that the court's decision can stand based on its primary rationale, we take no view of this alternative holding</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
