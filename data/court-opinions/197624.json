Alberto Nazario  appeals  from  the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict  court's  judgment  upholding  the   denial  of  his\r\n\napplication  for Social Security  disability benefits  by the\r\n\nCommissioner of Social  Security.  After a  careful review of\r\n\nthe record, we affirm.  In  this opinion, we address only the\r\n\nspecific claims of error raised by Nazario on appeal.  \r\n\n          Nazario  contends,  first,  that  the  Commissioner\r\n\nshould have found  him to be disabled on the  ground that his\r\n\nmedical findings were \"equal to\" to the findings described in\r\n\nListings  4.02B   and  6.02C.     We   find  his   contention\r\n\nunpersuasive,  however, because he  does not describe  -- and\r\n\nthe record does  not disclose --  findings pertinent to  each\r\n\ncriterion of  those Listings.   See Marciniak v.  Shalala, 49\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  1350, 1353  (8th Cir.  1995)  (a disability  claimant's\r\n\nfailure to  show medical  findings equivalent  to all of  the\r                                                                 \r\n\nListings  criteria  defeats a  claim of  medical equivalence)\r\n\n(citing Sullivan v.

In particular, he  claims that the\r\n\nfunctional assessments relied on by the Commissioner were not\r\n\nsubstantial evidence in support of that determination because\r\n\nthey did  not take into  account the results of  a subsequent\r\n\nkidney  biopsy report and because  some of them were rendered\r\n\nby  nonexamining physicians.    He  also  suggests  that  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nCommissioner could not determine  how serious his impairments\r\n\nwere because  certain  medical  records  contained  illegible\r\n\nentries.  We conclude that these claims lack merit.  \r\n\n          It  is true  that  a residual  functional  capacity\r\n\nassessment  which does not  consider the full  medical record\r\n\nmay  not  constitute  substantial evidence.    See  Frankl v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nShalala, 47 F.3d 935, 938 (8th Cir. 1995) (an agency residual\r                   \r\n\nfunctional capacity  form which  was not  based  on the  full\r\n\nmedical record was not substantial evidence).  Here, however,\r\n\nthe biopsy  report itself  stated that  the preoperative  and\r\n\npostoperative  diagnoses  were  the  \"same,\"  and  subsequent\r\n\nprogress  notes   showed  no   change   in  Nazario's   renal\r\n\ninsufficiency, which  was characterized  as \"stable.\"   Given\r\n\nthe lack of change in Nazario's diagnosis and  overall kidney\r\n\ncondition, the functional assessments  in the record retained\r\n\nvalidity and so  constituted substantial evidence in  support\r\n\nof the Commissioner's decision that Nazario was not disabled.\r\n\nSee Gordils v.  Secretary of Health  and Human Services,  921\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 327, 330  (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam)  (taken together,\r\n\nthe results of  a physical examination of the  claimant and a\r\n\nfunctional assessment made four months before the examination\r                                                         \r\n\nconstituted  substantial evidence in support of the denial of\r\n\ndisability benefits since the examination showed no objective\r\n\nevidence of a disabling medical impairment).  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Moreover, we have declined  to rule absolutely that\r\n\nthe  opinions of  nonexamining  physicians cannot  constitute\r\n\nsubstantial evidence.   See Rose  v. Shalala, 34 F.3d  13, 18\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1994).   Together with  the supporting  functional\r\n\nassessment   by  a   consulting,   examining  physician   and\r\n\nsupporting medical evidence in  the record, the  nonexamining\r\n\nphysicians'  opinions in  this  case constituted  substantial\r\n\nevidence in support of the Commissioner's determination.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nGordils,  supra.  Furthermore, the medical record overall was\r                           \r\n\nlegible and  adequately  disclosed the  status  of  Nazario's\r\n\nvarious physical impairments,  and so there is no  need for a\r\n\nremand.   Compare Manso-Pizarro  v. Secretary  of Health  and\r                                                                         \r\n\nHuman Services, 76  F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir.  1996) (per curiam)\r                          \r\n\n(remanding a case in which \"non-trivial\" parts of the medical\r\n\nrecord were illegible).  \r\n\n          Finally,  given his  nonexertional limitations  (in\r\n\nparticular, an  anxiety  disorder), Nazario  objects  to  the\r\n\nCommissioner's reliance on  the Grid to  show that there  was\r\n\nwork  in  the economy  which  he  could  perform despite  his\r\n\nexertional  limitations.     Because  there   is  substantial\r\n\nevidence  in the  record that  his nonexertional  limitations\r\n\nwould not  significantly affect  his ability  to perform  the\r\n\nfull  range of light work, we  conclude that the Commissioner\r\n\ncould  rely on  the Grid  to support  her  determination that\r\n\nNazario was not disabled.  See Heggarty v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n990, 996 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (the Grid may be relied\r\n\non  if  the  claimant's  nonexertional  impairment  does  not\r\n\n\"significantly\" affect his or her ability to perform the full\r\n\nrange  of jobs at the appropriate exertional level) (citation\r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

Furthermore, the medical record overall was\r                           \r\n\nlegible and  adequately  disclosed the  status  of  Nazario's\r\n\nvarious physical impairments,  and so there is no  need for a\r\n\nremand.   Compare Manso-Pizarro  v. Secretary  of Health  and\r                                                                         \r\n\nHuman Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712245\"><a href=\"/opinion/712245/50-socsecrepser-112-unemplinsrep-cch-p-15101b-victoria/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir.  1996) (per curiam)\r                          \r\n\n(remanding a case in which \"non-trivial\" parts of the medical\r\n\nrecord were illegible).  \r\n\n          Finally,  given his  nonexertional limitations  (in\r\n\nparticular, an  anxiety  disorder), Nazario  objects  to  the\r\n\nCommissioner's reliance on  the Grid to  show that there  was\r\n\nwork  in  the economy  which  he  could  perform despite  his\r\n\nexertional  limitations.     Because  there   is  substantial\r\n\nevidence  in the  record that  his nonexertional  limitations\r\n\nwould not  significantly affect  his ability  to perform  the\r\n\nfull  range of light work, we  conclude that the Commissioner\r\n\ncould  rely on  the Grid  to support  her  determination that\r\n\nNazario was not disabled.
