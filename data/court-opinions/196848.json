Bierwirth,  Jr. and Morrison, Mahoney  &amp;\r                                                                              \r\nMiller, on brief for appellee Burton Levine, M.D.\r              \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Having carefully reviewed the parties'\r                                \r\r\n\nbriefs and the appellate record, we conclude that this appeal\r\n\ndoes not  present  a substantial  question.   We  affirm  the\r\n\nsummary judgment  in favor  of the  defendants, for  the same\r\n\nreasons  stated by  the district  court.   We add  only these\r\n\ncomments. \r\n\n          Plaintiff   contends   that   the  district   court\r\n\nimproperly ignored  his affidavit.   However,  that affidavit\r\n\nbroadly  contradicts  plaintiff's  own   specific  deposition\r\n\ntestimony and  the letters he  wrote, and no  explanation was\r\n\ngiven  for  the contradiction.    In  that circumstance,  the\r\n\naffidavit  was insufficient to  withstand defendants' motions\r\n\nfor summary  judgment.  See  Colantuoni v. Alfred  Calcagni &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nSons Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                     \r\n\n          Because we  agree with the district  court that the\r\n\noverwhelming evidence, notwithstanding plaintiff's affidavit,\r\n\nshowed that medical  care was not withheld by defendants, but\r\n\nrather  was  refused  by  plaintiff,  we  reject  plaintiff's\r\n\ncontention  that  material  issues  of fact  remained  as  to\r\n\ndefendants'  states  of  mind.    Put   another  way,  as  no\r\n\nindifference  was shown,  no material  issue of  \"deliberate\"\r\n\nindifference  remained.    Further,   there  having  been  no\r\n\ndeprivation of medical  care within the  scope of the  Eighth\r\n\nAmendment, it would  have been futile to  amend the complaint\r\n\nto  add  another  Department  of  Correction  official  as  a\r\n\ndefendant.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                    \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
