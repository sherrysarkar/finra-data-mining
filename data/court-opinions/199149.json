Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\f                  and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Thomas V.

In appeal no. 99-2244, appellants Marc\n\nAdams, Charles Drenas and Darren Starr appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in appellees'\n\nfavor.    In their action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, appellants\n\ncomplained that, pursuant to a policy limiting bulk mail,\n\nappellees were denying them bulk rate catalogs which they\n\nhad   ordered   and   which    were    addressed   to   them   without\n\nproviding notice thereof.       They claimed that this violated\n\ntheir First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.            In appeal no.\n\n99-1304, appellant Thomas Dufield objects to the district\n\ncourt's denial of his motion to join the appellants' civil\n\nrights action.\n\n           After careful review of the parties' briefs and the\n\nrecord,    we   affirm   the   grant     of   summary   judgment    in\n\nappellees' favor on the First Amendment claim in appeal no.\n\n99-2244, essentially for the reasons given by the district\n\njudge in his Order dated September 30, 1999.            Although the\n\ndistrict court apparently believed (erroneously, as we read\n\nthe record) that appellants were given notice when bulk rate\n\ncatalogs were rejected, we nonetheless conclude that no\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f abridgment     of   appellants'   due    process   rights   occurred.\n\n Appellants' claim founders because they have not shown that\n\n they    have   a    liberty   interest    grounded   in     the     First\n\n Amendment.1    Even if appellants have a First Amendment right\n\n to receive catalogs which they have ordered and which are\n\n sent to them (a matter that we do not decide), appellees\n\n have not infringed that right.           They permit appellants to\n\n receive all catalogs that are sent by first-class mail.               For\n\n legitimate penological reasons, they reject only catalogs\n\n which are sent by bulk rate mail.          As the Supreme Court has\n\n said, the loss of \"cost advantages\" achieved by a particular\n\n method of mailing \"does not fundamentally implicate                  free\n\n speech values.\"        See Jones v.      North Carolina Prisoners'\n\n Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 130-31 (1977) (emphasis in\n\n original).\n\n            Our affirmance of the judgment in appeal no. 99-\n\n 2244    essentially      moots    appellant     Dufield's         claims.\n\n\n     1Because appellants cite Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396\n(1974), overruled in part on other grounds by Thornburgh v.\nAbbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989), and other First Amendment cases in\nsupport of their due process claim, we infer that they are\nasserting a due process claim based on the liberty component of\nthe Due Process Clause.     See id. at 418 (indicating that an\ninmate's interest in uncensored communication, \"grounded as it\nis in the First Amendment, is plainly a 'liberty interest[.]'\").\nTo cinch matters, appellants have not assigned error to the\ndistrict court's rulings denying their claims for deprivation of\nproperty without due process.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fMoreover, the record discloses no abuse of discretion by the\n\ndistrict   court   in   denying     his   motion   to   intervene.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment in appeal no. 99-1304.\n\n           The district court judgments underlying the above\n\nappeals are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f",
