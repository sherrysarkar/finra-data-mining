Connor Jr.), and\n\nthe    members    of   its     Board   of     Selectmen.     Metivier        served    as\n\nGrafton's Town Accountant for five consecutive three-year terms.\n\nConnor did not reappoint her after her last three-year term expired\n\non June 30, 2000.            Instead Metivier was kept on as a holdover\n\nemployee until another Town Accountant was qualified to take the\n\nposition.        Metivier claims that she had property and liberty\n\ninterests in her job pursuant to Massachusetts state law and the\nGrafton Town Charter.          Because the town did not give her notice or\n\na hearing to show good cause for the decision not to reappoint her,\nshe says the town violated her procedural due process rights under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.                       In a\n\nwell-reasoned opinion, the district court dismissed her claim and\ndenied her motion for a preliminary injunction.                    Metivier v. Town\n\nof Grafton, 148 F. Supp. 2d 98 (D. Mass. 2001).\n\n              We affirm the district court's judgment for the reasons\nstated by the district court in its June 20, 2001 opinion.                            1st\nCir.    R.   27(c).      Metivier's         position   as   Town    Accountant        was\n\nterminated after the end of a fixed three-year term, Mass. Gen.\nLaws ch. 41, ยง 55 (2000), therefore she had only holdover status.\nShe was neither a fixed term employee nor an employee for an\n\nindefinite term.         Thus, she had no property interest in her job\nunder the town charter or under state law.                   In addition, she has\n\nnot shown damage to her reputation sufficient to affect her liberty\n\n                                            -2-\n\finterests.
