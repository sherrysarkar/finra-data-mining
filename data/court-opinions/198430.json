The question raised is whether\r\nCongress intended to prohibit enforcement of pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements covering employment discrimination claims\r\nunder Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as a\r\nmatter of law in all cases or at least under certain facts said to\r\nbe present here.  Every circuit that has considered the issue save\r\none has upheld the use of such agreements.  The case here, in which\r\nthe district court refused to compel a plaintiff to arbitrate such\r\nclaims when the employer wished to arbitrate under a pre-dispute\r\nagreement, has also drawn much attention in the form of nine briefs\r\namici curiae.\r\nThe plaintiff, Susan Rosenberg, signed a standard\r\nsecurities industry form, the \"U-4 Form,\" agreeing to arbitrate\r\ncertain claims after being hired by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner\r\n&amp; Smith as a trainee financial consultant.  The form itself did not\r\nstate which claims were to be arbitrated, but rather referred to\r\nthe rules of various organizations with which Rosenberg was\r\nregistering.  When her employment was later terminated, Rosenberg\r\nfiled suit alleging age and gender discrimination and related\r\nclaims.  Merrill Lynch moved to enforce the agreement and compel\r\narbitration in the arbitration system of the New York Stock\r\nExchange.\r\nThe district court found no actual bias in the NYSE\r\narbitral forum.  Nonetheless, troubled by a perceived tension\r\nbetween the federal policies favoring vindication of civil rights\r\nand those favoring arbitration, the court denied the motion to\r\ncompel.  In a thoughtful opinion, the court based its reasoning on\r\ntwo grounds: first, that the 1991 Civil Rights Act (\"1991 CRA\")\r\namendments to Title VII preclude enforcement of pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements concerning discrimination claims, and\r\nsecond, that the arbitral forum involved, set up by the rules of\r\nthe NYSE, was not an adequate forum due to what the district court\r\ncalled \"structural bias.\"  Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\r\nFenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 995 F. Supp. 190, 203, 207 (D. Mass. 1998).\r\nIn the end we agree that the motion to compel was\r\nproperly denied on the facts of this particular case, but for\r\nreasons different than those advanced by the district court.  As to\r\nthe first ground relied on by the district court, we hold as a\r\nmatter of law that application of pre-dispute arbitration\r\nagreements to federal claims arising under Title VII and the ADEA\r\nis not precluded by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act\r\n(\"OWBPA\") amendments to the ADEA or by Title VII as amended by the\r\n1991 CRA.  As to the second ground, we disavow the district court's\r\nconclusion that the agreement is not enforceable due to \"structural\r\nbias\" in the NYSE arbitral forum, a conclusion that was based on\r\nerrors of law and fact.  We agree that there has been no showing of\r\nactual bias in the forum selected and that a refusal to grant a\r\nmotion to compel arbitration therefore may not be based on that\r\nground.  \r\nWe nonetheless conclude that there is an independent\r\nground requiring affirmance of the order denying the motion to\r\ncompel arbitration.  The parties have agreed that the essential\r\nmaterial facts are undisputed and that this court should, if\r\nnecessary, resolve an issue not resolved by the district court: \r\nwhether the parties' agreement met the standard set forth in the\r\n1991 CRA for enforcing arbitration clauses \"where appropriate and\r\nto the extent authorized by law.\"  We hold, on the facts presented,\r\nthat this standard was not met, and thus that the motion to compel\r\nwas properly denied.\r\n                           I\r\nRosenberg, whose prior experience had been in accounting\r\nand product engineering, was hired by Merrill Lynch on January 6,\r\n1992.  She was forty-five years old and held a Bachelor of Science\r\ndegree in accounting.  She had no experience in the securities\r\nindustry when she entered Merrill Lynch's twenty-four month\r\ntraining program for financial consultants.  \r\nRosenberg was required to fill out a standardized\r\nregistration form generally required of employees in the securities\r\nindustry.  That form, the Uniform Application for Securities\r\nIndustry Registration or Transfer, commonly referred to as the U-4\r\nForm, included the following language under the heading \"THE\r\nAPPLICANT MUST READ THE FOLLOWING VERY CAREFULLY\":\r\nI agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy\r\nthat may arise between me and my firm, or a customer, or\r\nany other person, that is required to be arbitrated under\r\nthe rules, constitutions, or by-laws of the organizations\r\nindicated in Item 10 as may be amended from time to time\r\nand that any arbitration award rendered against me may be\r\nentered as a judgement in any court of competent\r\njurisdiction.\r\nItem 10 included boxes for various securities organizations and\r\njurisdictions with which an applicant might be registered.  On\r\nRosenberg's form the boxes marked ASE, CBOE, NASD, NYSE, and MA\r\nwere checked -- signifying the American Stock Exchange, Chicago\r\nBoard of Exchange, National Association of Securities Dealers, New\r\nYork Stock Exchange, and Massachusetts.  The ASE, NASD, and NYSE\r\nboxes were apparently checked on or prior to January 10, 1992.  The\r\nCBOE and MA boxes were checked sometime between January 10 and\r\nJanuary 24.  Rosenberg's supervisor, John Wyllys, signed the form\r\non January 10, but Rosenberg did not sign the form until January 24\r\n-- although the form was back-dated to January 10.  Rosenberg has\r\nno memory of reading or signing the form, although she admits that\r\nthe signature is hers, and she says that she did not herself check\r\nany of the boxes.  Wyllys in turn certified that Rosenberg would be\r\nfamiliar with the applicable rules, including the NYSE rules, at\r\nthe time of approval of her U-4 Form.  That certification was\r\nuntrue.\r\nRosenberg says that she was not given a copy of the\r\nrules, or any amendments to the rules, of the NYSE, the NASD, or\r\nany of the other organizations referred to in Item 10 of the U-4. \r\nMerrill Lynch does not dispute this claim.  \r\nOn May 5, 1992, Rosenberg was given the title of\r\nFinancial Consultant, and she worked for Merrill Lynch until May 2,\r\n1994, when her employment was terminated by John Wyllys.  The\r\nreason given for the termination was inadequate performance.\r\nRosenberg alleges that she performed better than at least\r\nfour male consultants during her two-year tenure, but that she, and\r\nnot any of them, was terminated in mid-1994.  She also says that\r\namong those with two years of tenure in her office she was the only\r\nconsultant who was over age forty.  \r\nRosenberg also alleges that on March 9, 1994, a few\r\nmonths before her termination, John Wyllys sexually harassed her by\r\nactivating and handing to her a phallus-shaped vibrator when she\r\nwent into his office to obtain a document.  (Wyllys denies this and\r\nsays the only unusual electrical apparatus in his office was a\r\n\"stress buster.\")  Rosenberg did not file a harassment complaint\r\ninternally with Merrill Lynch.\r\nOn April 25, 1994 -- allegedly the next time Rosenberg\r\nand Wyllys spoke -- Rosenberg met with Wyllys to discuss her work\r\nperformance.  Wyllys suggested she tender her resignation, saying\r\nthat her work was not up to expected levels.  The next day\r\nRosenberg called Wyllys to invite him to have dinner with her to\r\ndiscuss his evaluation of her, and he accepted the invitation on\r\nApril 27.  At dinner, Rosenberg said she would not resign.  Her\r\nemployment was terminated within days.\r\n                           II\r\nIn July 1994, Rosenberg filed an administrative complaint\r\nwith the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\")\r\nalleging age and gender discrimination.  In October 1995, the MCAD\r\nfound no probable cause.  One year later, Rosenberg brought suit in\r\nstate court asserting discrimination and tort claims against\r\nMerrill Lynch and John Wyllys.  The defendants removed the case to\r\nfederal court.\r\nMerrill Lynch moved to compel arbitration and to stay the\r\nmatter pending arbitration.  Merrill Lynch originally moved to\r\ncompel arbitration in accordance with the rules of the NASD, which\r\nMerrill Lynch argued required arbitration \"of any dispute, claim,\r\nor controversy . . . arising out of the employment or termination\r\nof employment of associated person(s) with any member [of the\r\nNASD].\"  NASD Manual, Code of Arbitration Procedure Rule 10101\r\n(July 1996).  Rosenberg contended that this language was not in\r\nforce at the time she signed the U-4, and that the NASD rules in\r\neffect at that time did not apply to employment claims.  Merrill\r\nLynch disputed this, and argued that subsequent modifications of\r\nthe rules applied to Rosenberg, given the U-4's reference to rules\r\nthat \"may be amended from time to time.\"  Merrill Lynch also argued\r\nthat regardless of whether the NASD rules required the arbitration\r\nof employment disputes, the NYSE Rules clearly did require\r\narbitration of Rosenberg's claim.  The district court, however,\r\ndiscussed only the NYSE rules.  Merrill Lynch's arguments to this\r\ncourt have similarly focused on the NYSE rules.\r\nThe NYSE rules at the time Rosenberg brought her claim\r\nrequired arbitration of all employment disputes.  Rule 347 stated: \r\nAny controversy between a registered representative and\r\nany member or member organization arising out of the\r\nemployment or termination of employment of such\r\nregistered representative by and with such member or\r\nmember organization shall be settled by arbitration, at\r\nthe instance of any such party, in accordance with the\r\narbitration procedure prescribed elsewhere in these\r\nrules.\r\n\nNYSE R. 347.  No one explained to Rosenberg that the U-4 Form\r\nagreement to arbitrate that she had signed encompassed employment\r\ndisputes she might have with her employer.  She was given a copy of\r\nMerrill Lynch's \"voluminous\" employment handbook, but there is no\r\nargument that the handbook states that employment disputes are to\r\nbe arbitrated.\r\nRosenberg also said in an affidavit that if she had been\r\ninformed that her agreement to arbitrate certain claims included\r\nany potential employment discrimination claims she would have\r\nraised questions and might have sought outside advice.  Merrill\r\nLynch responded that the signing of these forms is an absolute\r\ncondition of employment, or at least was at that time.\r\nThe district court initially issued an opinion deferring\r\ndecision on the motion to stay and ordering \"additional briefing\r\nand discovery on certain legal issues -- the application of Gilmer[v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20 (1991)] to the\r\nparticular statutory schemes at issue here, gender discrimination\r\nand sexual harassment under Title VII, age discrimination under .\r\n. . [the ADEA], the adequacy of the arbitral scheme in the\r\nsecurities industry to enforce gender and age discrimination\r\nclaims, the legal standard for waiver of the right to an Article\r\nIII judge and representative jury, and finally, the particular\r\ncircumstances of waiver in this case.\"  Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch,\r\nPierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 965 F. Supp. 190, 192 (D. Mass.\r\n1997).\r\n Later, the district court denied the motion to compel. \r\nSee Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 212.  The court attempted to\r\ndistinguish the Supreme Court's decision in Gilmer, which had held\r\nvalid a pre-dispute arbitration clause in a U-4 Form signed by a\r\nsecurities industry employee and compelled arbitration of an ADEA\r\nclaim.  The district court reasoned first that in Title VII, in\r\ncontrast to the ADEA, Congress intended to preclude pre-dispute\r\narbitration clauses, and second, that as a factual matter the NYSE\r\nprovided an inadequate arbitral forum to vindicate Rosenberg's\r\nTitle VII and ADEA claims.  The forum was inadequate, the court\r\nconcluded, because of \"the extent to which the NYSE arbitration\r\nsystem is dominated by the securities industry, that is, by the\r\nemployment side of this dispute.\"  Id. at 207.  The heart of the\r\ncourt's analysis was its conclusion that there was a close identity\r\nbetween Merrill Lynch and the NYSE, that the NYSE dominated the\r\narbitral process, and that the process therefore favored Merrill\r\nLynch.  Specifically, the district court found that the Director of\r\nArbitration, an employee of the NYSE, appoints the panel of\r\narbitrators from various pools.  Those pools, including the pool of\r\n\"public arbitrators,\" are recommended and appointed by the Chairman\r\nof the NYSE Board.  The Director of Arbitration and his staff also\r\ndecide some pre-hearing procedural matters.  See id. at 210-11. \r\nThe court was concerned with such involvement by NYSE employees,\r\nbecause it found that \"Merrill Lynch . . . helps govern the NYSE.\" \r\nId. at 210.  The district court considered that these deficiencies\r\nwere not cured by a rule allowing each party to use one peremptory\r\nchallenge and unlimited challenges for cause to remove arbitrators\r\nfrom the panel.\r\nAfter the district court's decision, Merrill Lynch\r\nabandoned its policy of requiring employees to agree to arbitrate\r\nemployment discrimination claims; however, this change in policy\r\napplies only to claims filed after July 1, 1998, and thus not to\r\nRosenberg.  Pursuant to a class action settlement in Cremin v.\r\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., No. 96C 3773 (N.D.\r\nIll. Sept. 2, 1998), Merrill Lynch has agreed that, regardless of\r\nthe language of the U-4 Form, employees who file discrimination\r\nclaims after July 1, 1998 will be able to bring their claims in\r\ncourt.  Employees with discrimination claims filed before that date\r\nwill still be required to submit their claims to arbitration, but\r\nwill not be required to do so in the NYSE's arbitration system. \r\nInstead, arbitrations will be conducted by outside organizations,\r\nbefore arbitrators who are trained in employment law issues. \r\nRosenberg opted out of the settlement, instead choosing to pursue\r\nthe case that is before this court.  See id.\r\nThe NYSE has proposed a rule change that will exclude\r\nemployment discrimination claims from the scope of cases to be\r\narbitrated.  See Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of\r\nProposed Rule Changes by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating\r\nto Arbitration Rules, 63 Fed. Reg. 52,782 (1998).  The SEC has yet\r\nto approve the change, but it recently approved a similar change in\r\nthe NASD's rules.  See Self-Regulatory Organizations; National\r\nAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to\r\nProposed Rule Change Relating to the Arbitration of Employment\r\nDiscrimination Claims, 63 Fed. Reg. 35,299 (1998).\r\nRosenberg argues that the NYSE's proposed rule change\r\nmakes this case moot; the defendants say it is not now moot and\r\nwill not become moot.  Although the rule change may be approved,\r\nthe proposed rules are silent as to whether the rule change would\r\napply retroactively to existing claims.  The NASD rule change was\r\nnot retroactive.  Even if the NYSE rules are changed and those\r\nchanges made retroactive and thus Rosenberg cannot be compelled to\r\narbitrate her claims in the NYSE arbitral forum, Merrill Lynch may\r\nstill be able to compel arbitration in one of the other fora listed\r\non the U-4, including the NASD.  This is because the rule change\r\nwill alter NYSE Rules 347 and 600 to create an exception for\r\nemployment disputes; the rule change has no effect on the U-4 Form. \r\nThe issues in this case would apply with equal force to any attempt\r\nby Merrill Lynch to compel arbitration in the NASD.  Thus, the case\r\nis not moot.\r\n                          III\r\nA.  Congressional Intent In Title VII and the OWBPA\r\n1.  Title VII and Arbitration Agreements\r\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by\r\nthe 1991 CRA, does not, as a matter of law, prohibit pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements, contrary to the holding of the district\r\ncourt.  This is a legal issue which we review de novo. SeeBercovitch v. Baldwin School, Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 147 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).\r\nWhether pre-dispute agreements are prohibited by Title\r\nVII is a question of whether Congress intended to preclude their\r\nuse.  It is not a question of resolving the lively current public\r\npolicy debate about whether use of arbitration, rather than a\r\ncourt, to resolve claims of employment discrimination hinders or\r\nadvances the vindication of basic civil rights.  Good arguments\r\nhave been made on both sides of this policy debate.  The EEOC has\r\nissued a policy statement discouraging the use of pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements.  See EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 10,\r\n1997), reprinted in Excerpts from Text: EEOC Rejects Mandatory\r\nBinding Employment Arbitration, 52 Disp. Resol. J. 11 (1997).  Not\r\nsurprisingly, supporters of arbitration have criticized the EEOC\r\nstatement.  See, e.g., Oppenheimer &amp; Johnstone, Con: A Management\r\nPerspective: Mandatory Arbitration Agreements Are An Effective\r\nAlternative to Employment Litigation, 52 Disp. Resol. J. 19, 19-20\r\n(1997).\r\nIn Gilmer, the Supreme Court held that the Federal\r\nArbitration Act (\"FAA\") required the enforcement of the pre-dispute\r\nmandatory arbitration clause in a U-4 Form identical to the one\r\nsigned by Rosenberg.  Gilmer involved a claim of age discrimination\r\nbrought under the ADEA.  The Court, noting numerous other contexts\r\nin which it had held that statutory claims could be the subject of\r\narbitration agreements, ruled that pre-dispute arbitration clauses\r\nshould be enforced unless the plaintiff could show congressional\r\nintent to preclude arbitration.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 26.  To\r\ndetermine that intent, courts were directed to look to a statute's\r\ntext and legislative history and to ascertain whether there was a\r\nconflict between arbitration and the statute's goals.  See id.\r\n We find no conflict between the language or purposes of\r\nTitle VII, as amended, and arbitration.  The question of\r\ncongressional intent in this case is resolved primarily by looking\r\nat the language Congress chose to use in the 1991 CRA, which, at\r\nsection 118, provides: \r\n[w]here appropriate and to the extent authorized by law,\r\nthe use of alternative means of dispute resolution,\r\nincluding . . . arbitration, is encouraged to resolve\r\ndisputes arising under the Acts or provisions of Federal\r\nlaw amended by this title.\r\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166,  118, 105 Stat.\r\n1071, 1081 (1991).\r\nRelying on this language, the district court found that\r\nthe language and legislative history of section 118 \"unambiguously\r\nreject mandatory arbitration agreements.\"  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp.\r\nat 201.  The court focused on the language \"where appropriate and\r\nto the extent authorized by law.\"  The court acknowledged that\r\nCongress passed the 1991 amendments after the Supreme Court's\r\ndecision in Gilmer, but noted that the specific language was\r\ndrafted prior to the Gilmer decision.  The court concluded that the\r\nlegislative history of the amendments made clear that \"to the\r\nextent authorized by law\" referred to the law as it existed prior\r\nto Gilmer, and thus evidenced congressional \"intent to preclude\r\nmandatory arbitration.\"  Id.  In particular, the court ruled that\r\nCongress had intended the revisions to be consistent with Alexanderv. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36 (1974), in which the Supreme\r\nCourt held that an arbitration clause in a collective bargaining\r\nagreement did not preclude an employee from bringing a Title VII\r\nclaim in court.  See Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 201-04.\r\nIn reviewing the district court's legal determination, we\r\nhave the benefit of having construed identical language in the\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq.(1994).  See Bercovitch, 133 F.3d at 150.  Compare 42 U.S.C.\r\n12212 (ADA) with 105 Stat. at 1081 (1991 CRA).  The district\r\ncourt apparently did not consider this court's opinion in\r\nBercovitch, which was decided shortly before the district court\r\nissued its order refusing to compel Rosenberg to arbitrate her\r\nclaims.  Bercovitch held that a plaintiff could be compelled to\r\narbitrate claims brought under the ADA \"where the plaintiff had\r\nvoluntarily signed an agreement requiring arbitration.\" \r\nBercovitch, 133 F.3d at 143.  Examining the text of the ADA, we\r\nfound that the statute's language, \"far from evidencing an\r\nintention to preclude arbitration, can only be interpreted as\r\nfavoring it.\"  Id. at 150.  Additionally, language in the Committee\r\nReport accompanying the 1991 CRA, cited in Rosenberg's brief as\r\nevidence of congressional intent to preclude mandatory arbitration,\r\nis identical to language in the Committee Report accompanying the\r\nADA.  In Bercovitch, however, we found that the legislative\r\nhistory of the ADA did not \"rebut the presumption in favor of\r\narbitration\" made manifest by the clear language of the statute. \r\nId. at 150.  We reach the same conclusion here.\r\nRosenberg and her amici present additional argument that\r\nCongress intended to preclude pre-dispute arbitration agreements in\r\nthe Title VII context.  For example, Congress rejected a proposed\r\namendment to the 1991 CRA that would have explicitly permitted pre-\r\ndispute mandatory arbitration agreements, and the majority report\r\nrejecting the proposed amendment stated that \"under the [proposed\r\namendment] employers could refuse to hire workers unless they\r\nsigned a binding statement waiving all rights to file Title VII\r\ncomplaints\" in court and declared that \"American workers should not\r\nbe forced to choose between their jobs and their civil rights.\" \r\nH.R. Rep. No. 102-40(I), at 104 (1991), reprinted in 1991\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 549, 642.  In addition, Rosenberg and her amici point\r\nto a statement that section 118 \"contemplates the use of voluntary\r\narbitration to resolve specific disputes after they have arisen,\r\nnot coercive attempts to force employees in advance to forego\r\nstatutory rights.\"  137 Cong. Rec. H9505-01, H9530 (daily ed. Nov.\r\n7, 1991) (statement of Rep. Edwards).\r\nSuch statements are insufficient to overcome the\r\npresumption in favor of arbitration which Gilmer establishes.  As\r\nother amici note in support of Merrill Lynch, additional statements\r\nby members of Congress expressed the view that section 118 did not\r\npreclude binding arbitration.  See 137 Cong. Rec. S15,472-01,\r\nS15,478 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 1991) (statement of Sen. Dole) (\"This\r\nprovision encourages the use of alternative means of dispute\r\nresolution, including binding arbitration, where the parties\r\nknowingly and voluntarily elect to use these methods.  In light of\r\nthe litigation crisis facing this country and the increasing\r\nsophistication and reliability of alternatives to litigation, there\r\nis no reason to disfavor the use of such forums.\").  Congress has\r\nrepeatedly rejected legislation that would explicitly bar mandatory\r\nagreements to arbitrate employment discrimination claims.  SeeCivil Rights Procedures Protection Act of 1997, H.R. 983, S. 63,\r\n105th Cong. (proposing to revise Title VII and the ADEA to state\r\nthat \"[n]otwithstanding any Federal statute of general\r\napplicability that would modify any of the powers and procedures\r\nexpressly applicable to a claim arising under this title, such\r\npowers and procedures shall be the exclusive powers and procedures\r\napplicable to such claim unless after such claim arises the\r\nclaimant voluntarily enters into an agreement to resolve such claim\r\nthrough arbitration or another procedure\"); Civil Rights Procedures\r\nProtection Act of 1996, H.R. 3748, 104th Cong.; Civil Rights\r\nProcedures Protection Act of 1994, H.R. 4981, S. 2405, 103d Cong.\r\nNumerous circuit courts have held that the Supreme\r\nCourt's reasoning in Gilmer applies to Title VII claims and that\r\npre-dispute agreements to arbitrate Title VII claims are\r\npermissible.  See, e.g., Seus v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., 146 F.3d 175,\r\n179, 182-83 (3d Cir. 1998), petition for cert. filed, 67 U.S.L.W.\r\n3323 (U.S. Oct 19, 1998) (No. 98-719); Paladino v. Avnet Computer\r\nTechs., Inc., 134 F.3d 1054, 1062 (11th Cir. 1998); Gibson v.\r\nNeighborhood Health Clinics, Inc., 121 F.3d 1126, 1130 (7th Cir.\r\n1997); Patterson v. Tenet Healthcare, Inc., 113 F.3d 832, 837 (8th\r\nCir. 1997); Cole v. Burns Int'l Sec. Servs., 105 F.3d 1465, 1467-68\r\n(D.C. Cir. 1997); Austin v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc.,\r\n78 F.3d 875, 882 (4th Cir. 1996); Metz v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\r\nFenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 39 F.3d 1482, 1487 (10th Cir. 1994); Willisv. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 948 F.2d 305, 308, 312 (6th Cir.\r\n1991); Alford v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 939 F.2d 229, 230 (5th\r\nCir. 1991).  Only the Ninth Circuit has disagreed, as described\r\nbelow.  \r\nHowever, few appellate courts, it appears, have dealt\r\nwith the precise issue of whether the 1991 CRA demonstrates\r\ncongressional intent to ban pre-dispute agreements to arbitrate\r\nemployment discrimination claims.  In Duffield v. Robertson\r\nStephens &amp; Co., 144 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 67 U.S.L.W.\r\n3113, 67 U.S.L.W. 3177 (U.S. Nov. 9, 1998) (Nos. 98-237, 98-409)\r\nthe court refused to enforce the U-4 Form arbitration clause.  The\r\nDuffield court found section 118's statement that arbitration is\r\nencouraged \"[w]here appropriate and to the extent authorized by\r\nlaw\" to be ambiguous, and thus looked to the purposes of the 1991\r\nCRA and to legislative history to elucidate the phrase's meaning. \r\nSee id. at 1198.  The court concluded that the legislative history,\r\ncontext, and text of the 1991 CRA demonstrated \"that Congress\r\nintended to preclude compulsory arbitration of Title VII claims.\" \r\nId. at 1199.\r\nTwo courts have, without discussion, held that the 1991\r\nCRA supports enforcement of pre-dispute agreements to arbitrate\r\nTitle VII claims.  See Patterson, 113 F.3d at 837 (stating that\r\n\"the arbitrability of Title VII claims finds support in the Civil\r\nRights Act of 1991\"); Austin, 78 F.3d at 881 (\"The language of the\r\nstatutes could not be any more clear in showing Congressional favor\r\ntowards arbitration.\").\r\nThe Third Circuit has interpreted section 118's reference\r\nto \"the extent authorized by law\" to refer to the Federal\r\nArbitration Act, not to case law as it stood at the time Congress\r\ndrafted the 1991 CRA.  See Seus, 146 F.3d at 183 (disagreeing with\r\nDuffield, 144 F.3d at 1194-98).  Like this court in Bercovitch, the\r\nThird Circuit first looked to the plain meaning of section 118,\r\nstating that section 118's endorsement of arbitration \"simply\r\ncannot be 'interpreted' to mean that the FAA is impliedly repealed\r\nwith respect to agreements to arbitrate Title VII and ADEA claims\r\nthat will arise in the future.\"  See Seus, 146 F.3d at 182.  We\r\nagree.\r\nWe hold that neither the language of the statute nor the\r\nlegislative history demonstrates an intent in the 1991 CRA to\r\npreclude pre-dispute arbitration agreements.  Under Gilmer, the\r\nremaining question is whether \"compulsory arbitration of [Title\r\nVII] claims pursuant to arbitration agreements would be\r\ninconsistent with the statutory framework and purposes of\" Title\r\nVII.  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 27 (discussing the ADEA).  The district\r\ncourt found that mandatory arbitration would be at odds with the\r\n\"structure and purpose\" of the 1991 CRA and with the 1991 CRA's\r\ncreation of a right to a jury trial for Title VII plaintiffs. \r\nRosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 204-06. \r\nResolving this issue requires determining whether there\r\nis any meaningful distinction between Title VII, as amended, and\r\neither the ADEA, which was construed by the Supreme Court in\r\nGilmer, or the ADA, which was construed by this court in\r\nBercovitch.  Gilmer found no clash between arbitration and the\r\npurposes of the ADEA, noting instead that \"[s]o long as the\r\nprospective litigant effectively may vindicate [his or her]\r\nstatutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will\r\ncontinue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.\" \r\nGilmer, 500 U.S. at 28 (second alteration in original) (quoting\r\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S.\r\n614, 637 (1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Bercovitchheld that \"[t]here is no reason to think that the ADA presents a\r\nstronger policy case against arbitration than [the] ADEA.\" \r\nBercovitch, 133 F.3d at 150.  \r\nIt is difficult to see why the purposes of Title VII\r\npresent a stronger case for rejecting arbitration than do the\r\npurposes of either the ADEA or the ADA.  In finding that it was\r\n\"not plausible . . . that the . . . Act would have . . . undermined\r\n[a plaintiff's private attorney general] role by endorsing private\r\nmandatory pre-dispute arbitration agreements,\" Rosenberg, 995 F.\r\nSupp. at 205, the district court overlooked Gilmer's statement that\r\npublic rights may be enforced through arbitration.  The district\r\ncourt's comment that an endorsement of arbitration would be at odds\r\nwith the 1991 CRA's creation of a right to a jury trial, see id. at\r\n205-06, similarly ignores Gilmer's endorsement of arbitration under\r\nthe ADEA -- which also provides for jury trials.  It may also\r\nevince a distrust of arbitration that the Supreme Court has long\r\nsince disavowed.  While people may and do reasonably disagree about\r\nwhether pre-dispute arbitration agreements are a wise way of\r\nresolving discrimination claims, there is no \"inherent conflict\"\r\nbetween the goals of Title VII and the goals of the FAA, as Gilmerused that phrase.  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 26 (quoting\r\nShearson/American Express, Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 227\r\n(1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nThe Supreme Court's very recent decision in Wright v.Universal Maritime Service Corp., 119 S. Ct. 391 (1998), reinforces\r\nthis conclusion.  Wright addressed the issue of waiver of a\r\njudicial forum for ADA claims by virtue of general language in a\r\ncollective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\").  The Court did not reach\r\nthe issue of whether a \"clear and unmistakable\" waiver in a CBA\r\nwould be enforced: nor did it take a position on waivers \"in areas\r\noutside collective bargaining.\"  Id. at 396-97 &amp; n.2.  But nothing\r\nin the opinion suggests that Gilmer is not still good law; rather,\r\nthe contrary is true.\r\n2.  The OWBPA and Arbitration Agreements\r\nHaving found that Congress intended to preclude pre-\r\ndispute arbitration agreements in the 1991 CRA, the district court\r\ndid not consider Rosenberg's and amici's argument that the OWBPA\r\nindependently and explicitly makes pre-dispute arbitration\r\nagreements inapplicable to age discrimination claims.  The district\r\ncourt apparently felt that Gilmer controlled the issue, stating\r\nonly that \"Congress has not clearly expressed its intent to\r\npreclude enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements under\r\nthe ADEA.\"  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 206.  We agree with the\r\ndistrict court that ADEA claims may be the subject of pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements, although the issue cannot be resolved by\r\nreference to Gilmer alone. \r\nRosenberg and her amici argue that the OWBPA, which the\r\ndistrict court did not analyze, provides an alternative ground for\r\nupholding the denial of Merrill Lynch's motion to compel\r\narbitration.  Congress enacted the OWBPA in 1990.  Although the\r\nSupreme Court decided Gilmer after Congress's passage of the OWBPA,\r\nGilmer involved a contract signed prior to the OWBPA, and thus did\r\nnot consider the effect of the act.  Rosenberg signed her U-4 Form\r\nin 1992, well after the OWBPA became effective.\r\nAs modified by the OWBPA, the ADEA provides:\r\n(1) An individual may not waive any right or claim under\r\nthis chapter unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary. \r\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2), a waiver may not be\r\nconsidered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum --\r\n     . . . . \r\n     (C) the individual does not waive rights or\r\n     claims that may arise after the date the waiver\r\n     is executed[.]\r\n29 U.S.C.  626(f)(1).  Rosenberg and her amici argue that the\r\nreference to \"waiver\" should be interpreted to include the U-4\r\nForm's arbitration clause and that the reference to \"right[]\" should\r\nbe interpreted to include the right to a bench or jury trial on\r\nADEA claims.  Amici point to legislative history that suggests that\r\nCongress was particularly concerned about older workers losing the\r\nright to a jury trial for ADEA claims.  However, the cited language\r\nspeaks only of ensuring that older workers are able to obtain legal\r\nrelief and does not mention arbitration or waiver of a judicial\r\nforum.  See S. Rep. No. 101-263, at 31-36 (1990), reprinted in 1990\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1509, 1537-1541; H.R. Rep. No. 101-664 (1990),\r\navailable in 1990 WL 200383.  \r\nThe EEOC as amicus curiae argues that its views on the\r\nOWBPA are entitled to deference.  Yet the EEOC's recently issued\r\nrules on the \"Waiver of Rights and Claims Under the Age\r\nDiscrimination in Employment Act\" include no discussion of the\r\ndefinition of \"right\" or \"claim,\" see 29 C.F.R.  1625.22\r\n(effective July 6, 1998), and do not say that \"waivers\" mean\r\narbitration clauses.  We do not defer to views espoused only in the\r\ncontext of litigation.  See Massachusetts v. Blackstone Valley\r\nElec. Co., 67 F.3d 981, 991 (1st Cir. 1995).  This is particularly\r\ntrue where the agency has gone through rule making and has\r\nconspicuously ignored the topic in its rules.  See id. \r\nMost courts which have considered the issue have\r\ninterpreted OWBPA's reference to \"any right\" to apply to substantive\r\nrights, or, at any rate, not to the right to proceed in court\r\nrather than in arbitration.  See, e.g., Seus, 146 F.3d at 181-82;\r\nWilliams v. Cigna Fin. Advisors, Inc., 56 F.3d 656, 660-61 (5th\r\nCir. 1995).  Courts that have interpreted the OWBPA to apply to\r\nwaivers of substantive rights have relied in part on dicta in\r\nGilmer commenting that \"Congress . . . did not explicitly preclude\r\narbitration or other nonjudicial resolution of claims, even in its\r\nrecent amendments to the ADEA.\"  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 29; see Seus,\r\n146 F.3d at 181-82; Cigna Fin. Advisors, 56 F.3d at 660-61 (\"There\r\nis no indication that Congress intended the OWBPA to affect\r\nagreements to arbitrate employment disputes.\").  The recent Wrightdecision reaffirms what was said in Gilmer: that an employee's\r\nstatutory right to a judicial forum for claims of employment\r\ndiscrimination \"is not a substantive right.\"  Wright, 119 S. Ct. at\r\n396.\r\nRosenberg and her amici point to the Supreme Court's \r\ndecision in Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc., 118 S. Ct. 838\r\n(1998), in which the Court commented that \"[t]he OWBPA implements\r\nCongress' policy via a strict, unqualified statutory stricture on\r\nwaivers, and we are bound to take Congress at its word.\"  Id. at\r\n841.  These comments are not particularly relevant here because\r\nthey do not go to the issue of whether the term \"waiver\" was meant\r\nto apply to pre-dispute arbitration agreements.  Indeed, while\r\nOubre did not consider whether the OWBPA applies to waivers of\r\nprocedural as well as substantive rights, the Court did state that\r\nthe OWBPA \"is clear: An employee 'may not waive' any ADEA claim\"\r\nunless the requirements of  626(f) are satisfied.  Id. (emphasis\r\nadded).  To the degree that Oubre has any relevance here, the\r\nreference to \"claim\" suggests that the waiver provisions refer to\r\nsubstantive claims.  A substantive ADEA claim may be presented in\r\nan arbitral or a judicial forum.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 28.\r\nNeither Rosenberg nor amicus curiae the EEOC points to\r\nany court that has held that the OWBPA evinces congressional intent\r\nto preclude pre-dispute arbitration agreements.  The EEOC argues\r\nthat the Duffield court suggested that the OWBPA reference to\r\n\"right[s]\" applies to the right to a judicial forum.  However, the\r\nDuffield court did not consider the issue, merely commenting that\r\n\"current ADEA claims may require different treatment\" from those the\r\nSupreme Court considered in Gilmer.  See Duffield, 144 F.3d at 1190\r\nn.5.\r\nWe hold that Congress did not intend to preclude pre-\r\ndispute arbitration agreements when it enacted the OWBPA.  Other\r\ncircuits have noted that:\r\n[i]n enacting the OWBPA, Congress' primary concern was\r\nwith releases and voluntary separation agreements in\r\nwhich employees were forced to waive their rights. . . .\r\n[T]he OWBPA protects against the waiver of a right or\r\nclaim, not against the waiver of a judicial forum. . . .\r\n     We recognize that Congress, through the OWBPA, has\r\nprotected terminated employees who waive their\r\nsubstantive rights under ADEA in exchange for a more\r\nfavorable severance package; however, we find no clear\r\nindication that Congress was likewise concerned with\r\nprotecting employees who agree to arbitrate claims that\r\nmay arise during the course of their employment.\r\nSeus, 146 F.3d at 181 (alterations in original) (quoting Cigna Fin.\r\nAdvisors, Inc., 56 F.3d at 660-61) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).  Nothing in the language or history of the OWBPA shows an\r\nintent impliedly to repeal the FAA for such claims.  Congress\r\ncertainly may act to preclude arbitration, but its failure to do so\r\nclearly here means there was no such intent.  \r\nTo interpret the OWBPA's reference to \"right\" to include\r\nprocedural rights -- and the right to a judicial forum in\r\nparticular -- would be to ignore the Supreme Court's repeated\r\nstatements that arbitral and judicial fora are both able to give\r\neffect to the policies that underlie legislation.  A party who\r\nagrees to arbitrate \"does not forgo the substantive rights afforded\r\nby the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,\r\nrather than a judicial, forum.\"  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 26 (quoting\r\nMitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628) (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nInterpreting the OWBPA to preclude pre-dispute arbitration\r\nagreements would run afoul of the presumption that arbitration\r\nprovides a fair and adequate mechanism for enforcing statutory\r\nrights.  \r\nB.  The New York Stock Exchange's Arbitration System\r\nIn addition to finding that Congress, in enacting the\r\n1991 CRA, had clearly precluded pre-dispute agreements to\r\narbitrate, the district court found an additional ground for\r\nrefusing to compel arbitration: what it described as \"structural\r\nbias\" in the NYSE's arbitration procedures.  The court found that\r\nthe NYSE arbitration process was \"inadequate to vindicate\r\nRosenberg's ADEA and Title VII rights.\"  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at\r\n212.  In reaching this conclusion, the district court committed two\r\ntypes of errors.  \r\nFirst, the district court misinterpreted the window\r\navailable post-Gilmer for challenges to a specific arbitral forum. \r\nThe district court found no actual bias in the NYSE's arbitration\r\nsystem, but nevertheless refused to compel arbitration due to\r\nalleged structural infirmities.  Absent a showing of actual bias --\r\nand we agree with the district court that there was no such showing\r\nin this case -- Gilmer required the district court to compel\r\narbitration.  Second, the district court erred in its description\r\nof the NYSE's arbitration procedures. \r\nIn Gilmer, the Court noted that \"the NYSE arbitration\r\nrules . . . provide protections against biased panels,\" and held\r\nthat plaintiff Gilmer had not shown actual bias.  See Gilmer, 500\r\nU.S. at 30.  The Court rejected arguments that arbitration was\r\ninappropriate for ADEA claims due to limitations on discovery and\r\nthe lack of written opinions.  See id. at 31-32.  However, Gilmeralso noted that future plaintiffs might be able to demonstrate\r\n\"procedural inadequacies . . . in specific cases.\"  Gilmer, 500\r\nU.S. at 33.\r\nThe district court found that \"Rosenberg has risen to the\r\nSupreme Court's challenge\" to demonstrate that the NYSE arbitration\r\nprocedures were inadequate to ensure fair adjudication of her\r\nclaims.  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 206.  In reaching this\r\nconclusion, however, the district court engaged in a generalized\r\ninquiry of the sort that Gilmer precludes.  In particular, the\r\ncourt found that \"the NYSE arbitration system is dominated by the\r\nsecurities industry.\"  Id. at 207.  This conclusion was based on\r\ntwo findings.  First, the district court found that Merrill Lynch\r\nwas a member firm of the NYSE, and that the NYSE's member firms\r\n\"'govern' the [NYSE] as part of [its] self-regulating scheme.\"  Id. \r\nThe district court explicitly found that there was no\r\nconclusive evidence of bias, either in the manner in which NYSE\r\narbitrations are conducted or in the makeup of the arbitration\r\npanels.  Limited evidence presented in this case suggests that, if\r\nanything, women are more likely to win awards in discrimination\r\nclaims brought through arbitration than they are in claims brought\r\nin court.  Evidence submitted in this case also shows that in most\r\ndiscrimination cases brought under the NYSE's arbitration\r\nprocedures, at least one of the arbitrators is a woman.  The NYSE\r\nhas taken a number of steps since the decision in Gilmer --\r\nincluding training arbitrators in employment law and expanding its\r\npool of arbitrators -- to make the system fairer than that which\r\nthe Gilmer Court endorsed.\r\nSecond, the court found that \"[f]rom the rules that\r\ngovern arbitral procedure, through the selection of the\r\narbitrators, to the details of discovery practice, the system is\r\ndominated by the NYSE itself.\"  Id. at 210.  For instance, \"the\r\nChairman of the Board [of the NYSE] recommends and appoints the\r\narbitration pools from which individual arbitrators are chosen,\r\nincluding the pool of non-securities industry 'public'\r\narbitrators,\" and the NYSE's Director of Arbitration selects \"the\r\nentire initial panel and any replacements.\"  Id.  The district\r\ncourt concluded that \"[d]ominance of an arbitral system by one side\r\nin the dispute does not comport with any model of arbitral\r\nimpartiality,\" regardless of the \"competence or fairness of\r\nindividual arbitrators who participate [in] the NYSE system.\"  Id.at 211.\r\nThe district court misinterpreted certain facts regarding\r\nthe structure of the NYSE's arbitration system.  In particular, the\r\ncourt mischaracterized both Merrill Lynch's role in the NYSE and\r\nNYSE arbitration procedures.  The district court stated that the\r\nmajority of NYSE board members were \"industry representatives.\"  Id.at 207 n.22.  However, representatives of the securities industry\r\nactually occupy a minority of seats on the NYSE's board.  In\r\naddition, the NYSE is subject to regulation by the SEC, and such\r\nregulation includes the NYSE's arbitration procedures.  The Supreme\r\nCourt noted this in Shearson/American Express, Inc. when it\r\ncommented that the SEC possesses \"expansive power to ensure the\r\nadequacy of the arbitration procedures employed by\" self-regulating\r\norganizations such as the NYSE.  Shearson/American Express, Inc.,\r\n482 U.S. at 233.  Rather than being controlled by the securities\r\nindustry, the NYSE plays a significant role in monitoring and\r\ndisciplining exchange members for non-compliance with its rules.\r\nThe district court also erred in its description of\r\nspecific arbitration procedures, including its description of the\r\npool of potential arbitrators, and in equating the NYSE's\r\nappointment of arbitrators with appointment of arbitrators by a\r\ntrade association.  For example, arbitrators come from a range of\r\norganizations and backgrounds.  In disputes between NYSE members\r\nand non-members, including employment discrimination disputes, \"a\r\nmajority of [the arbitrators] shall not be from the securities\r\nindustry, unless the . . . non-member requests a panel consisting\r\nof at least a majority from the securities industry.\"  NYSE R. 607. \r\nAdditionally, NYSE Rules include a detailed provision prohibiting\r\npersons with industry links from serving as public arbitrators. \r\nSee Guidelines for Classification of Arbitrators, in New York Stock\r\nExchange Dep't of Arbitration, Arbitration Rules 33, 33 (Sept.\r\n1995).  Parties to NYSE arbitrations may exercise one peremptory\r\nchallenge or unlimited challenges for cause against arbitrators. \r\nAs Gilmer noted, the NYSE's own rules protect against biased\r\npanels.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 30.  Panel members are required to\r\ndisclose any possible conflicts of interest, and the system is\r\ndesigned to ensure that no Merrill Lynch employee could serve as an\r\narbitrator in an employment dispute brought against the company. \r\nSee NYSE R. 610. \r\nThe district court commented that the NYSE \"provision for\r\none peremptory challenge and unlimited challenges for cause . . .\r\ncannot correct the fundamental imbalance in a system in which the\r\nentire initial panel and any replacements are appointed by the\r\nDirector of Arbitration.\"  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 210. \r\nHowever, the Director of Arbitration serves the NYSE, not the\r\nsecurities industry.\r\nRosenberg's supporting amici argue that the NYSE's\r\narbitration procedures are inadequate for Title VII claims because\r\narbitrators often refuse to award statutory attorneys' fees and\r\nbecause plaintiffs are charged forum fees, which may be as high as\r\n$3,000 per day and tens of thousands of dollars per case.  Amici\r\nrely on Cole, in which the court held that arbitration agreements\r\nrequiring plaintiffs to pay forum fees in order to vindicate\r\nstatutory rights are impermissible.  See Cole, 105 F.3d at 1484-85. \r\nThere are three responses.  First, that arbitrators may\r\nsometimes do undesirable things in individual cases does not mean\r\nthe arbitral system is structurally inadequate.  Nothing in the\r\nchoice of arbitration mandates these outcomes, nor are such\r\noutcomes necessary concomitants of the NYSE arbitral system.  The\r\nNYSE rules do not limit available relief.  Rule 627 provides that\r\narbitrators may award \"damages and/or other relief.\"  NYSE R.\r\n627(e); see also Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 32.  \r\nThe second is that it does not appear to be the usual\r\nsituation that a plaintiff is asked to bear forum fees.  Amici in\r\nsupport of Rosenberg cite arbitration decisions in which plaintiffs\r\nhave been required to pay costs.  Merrill Lynch replies that the\r\nrecord does not support this claim: in the thirty-three arbitration\r\ncases Rosenberg placed in the record, only one plaintiff who\r\nprevailed on statutory grounds was denied fees and costs.  NYSE\r\narbitrators possess discretion to award costs and fees when they\r\ndecide a dispute.  Cf. Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 32 (stating that \"the\r\nNYSE rules applicable here do not restrict the types of relief an\r\narbitrator may award\"); Uniform Code of Arbitration  30, inSecurities Industry Conference on Arbitration Report #9, at 7, 22-\r\n24 (June 1996); Securities Indus. Conference on Arbitration, The\r\nArbitrator's Manual 29 (Oct. 1996) (stating that \"[g]enerally,\r\nparties to an arbitration are responsible for their personal costs\r\nassociated with bringing or defending an arbitration action,\" but\r\nnoting that exceptions exist, including where there is a statutory\r\nbasis for attorneys' fees); id. at 30 (stating that although forum\r\nfees are required, they may be waived); see also Kuehner v.\r\nDickinson &amp; Co., 84 F.3d 316, 320 (9th Cir. 1996) (stating that\r\nsecurities arbitrators \"have the full power to provide the legal\r\nand equitable remedies available\" under statutes).  Indeed, in Colethe D.C. Circuit enforced an arbitration agreement in part because\"under NYSE rules and NASD rules, it is standard practice in the\r\nsecurities industry for employers to pay all of the arbitrators'\r\nfees. . . . [I]n Gilmer, the Supreme Court endorsed a system of\r\narbitration in which employees are not required to pay for the\r\narbitrator assigned to hear their statutory claims.\"  Cole, 105\r\nF.3d at 1483-84.\r\nThird, if unreasonable fees were to be imposed on a\r\nparticular employee, the  argument that this was inconsistent with\r\nthe 1991 CRA could be presented by the employee to the reviewing\r\ncourt.  Cf. Cole, 105 F.3d at 1485.  That issue is not presented by\r\nthis case.  As Gilmer said, \"'although judicial scrutiny of\r\narbitration awards necessarily is limited, such review is\r\nsufficient to ensure that arbitrators comply with the requirements\r\nof the statute' at issue.\"  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 32 n.4 (quoting\r\nShearson/American Express, Inc., 482 U.S. at 232).\r\nContrary to Rosenberg's arguments, arbitration is often\r\nfar more affordable to plaintiffs and defendants alike than is\r\npursuing a claim in court.  Cf. Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 31 (noting that\r\nalthough arbitration discovery \"procedures might not be as\r\nextensive as in the federal courts, by agreeing to arbitrate, a\r\nparty 'trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the\r\ncourtroom for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of\r\narbitration'\" (quoting Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628)).\r\nGilmer does not mandate enforcement of all arbitration\r\nagreements.  Plaintiffs are not required to take their claims to\r\nbiased panels or through biased procedures.  But the evidence here\r\nestablishes no basis to invalidate the NYSE arbitral scheme. \r\n                           IV\r\nThe district court did not reach Rosenberg's arguments\r\nthat her particular U-4 Form arbitration clause was unenforceable\r\nbecause the contract was an unconscionable adhesion contract, or\r\nbecause her signing of the agreement was not knowing and voluntary\r\nor otherwise not within the scope of Congress's intention.  SeeRosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 212.  Rosenberg renews these arguments\r\non appeal.  The parties agree that all material facts are before\r\nthis court and that we should resolve the issue if we reach it. \r\nThis court possesses the discretion to resolve these issues, as the\r\nparties have had a full opportunity to present their arguments to\r\nthe district court.  See New Hampshire Motor Transp. Ass'n v.\r\nFlynn, 751 F.2d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 1984).  We reject Rosenberg's\r\nargument that the U-4 Form was an unconscionable contract of\r\nadhesion.  However, on the specific facts presented and under the\r\nlanguage of the 1991 CRA, we hold that Rosenberg cannot be\r\ncompelled to arbitrate her employment discrimination claims against\r\nMerrill Lynch.  Our resolution of this case has no bearing\r\nwhatsoever on the enforceability of agreements to arbitrate\r\nconsumer disputes.  In addition, nothing in this opinion concerns\r\nthe enforceability of provisions of the U-4 Form or the NYSE Rules\r\nnot related to the arbitration of employment discrimination\r\ndisputes.\r\nA.   Was Rosenberg's Agreement to Arbitrate Invalid\r\n     Because It Was An Unconscionable Contract of\r\n     Adhesion?\r\n\nRosenberg and amici argue that the arbitration agreement\r\nshould not be enforced because it is unconscionable and because it\r\nis the result of a gross disparity of bargaining power.  We reject\r\nthese arguments, which are not frivolous, because the law has long\r\nimposed a heavy burden on those who make such arguments and\r\nRosenberg has not met her burden of proof.\r\nThe district court found that signing the U-4 Form was a\r\nprerequisite for employment as a securities broker, and Merrill\r\nLynch has acknowledged that it would not \"employ or promote\r\nfinancial consultants who refuse to sign the Form U-4.\"  Securities\r\nindustry officials similarly confirmed that financial consultants\r\nwere not permitted to excise the arbitration clause from the U-4\r\nForm.  Rosenberg argues that the imposition of such a requirement\r\nrenders the U-4 Form arbitration clause invalid as an unenforceable\r\ncontract of adhesion. \r\nWe agree with the Third Circuit that the U-4 Form\r\narbitration clause is not unenforceable on these grounds.  SeeSeus, 146 F.3d at 184.  In Seus, the court found that even if the\r\nU-4 Form arbitration agreement were a contract of adhesion\r\nplaintiff would still need to show \"both a lack of meaningful\r\nchoice about whether to accept the provision in question, and that\r\nthe disputed provisions were so onesided as to be oppressive.\"  Id.(quoting Stebok v. American Gen. Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 715 F.\r\nSupp. 711, 714 (W.D. Pa.), aff'd, 888 F.2d 1382 (3d Cir. 1989))\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  And section 211 of the\r\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts states that a term in a\r\nstandardized agreement is enforceable unless one party \"has reason\r\nto believe that the party manifesting . . . assent would not do so\r\nif he knew that the writing contained a particular term.\" \r\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts  211 (1979); see also Waters v.\r\nMin Ltd., 587 N.E.2d 231, 233 (Mass. 1992) (\"Unconscionability must\r\nbe determined on a case-by-case basis, with particular attention to\r\nwhether the challenged provision could result in oppression and\r\nunfair surprise to the disadvantaged party and not to allocation of\r\nrisk because of 'superior bargaining power.'\"  (quoting Zapatha v.\r\nDairy Mart, Inc., 408 N.E.2d 1370, 1375 (Mass. 1980))).  Rosenberg\r\nhas made no such showing.\r\nIn addition, in Gilmer, the Court stated that inequality\r\nin bargaining power \"is not a sufficient reason to hold that\r\narbitration agreements are never enforceable in the employment\r\ncontext.\"  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 33.  Gilmer, after all, involved the\r\nsame U-4 Form arbitration clause at issue here.  Absent a showing\r\nof fraud or oppressive conduct -- which Rosenberg does not allege\r\noccurred -- the contract is not unenforceable on these grounds. \r\nB.   Was Rosenberg's Agreement to Arbitrate\r\n     Appropriate and Authorized By Law Within the\r\n     Meaning of the 1991 CRA?\r\nWe repeat what Rosenberg's U-4 Form said and did not say. \r\nThe U-4 Form stated that Rosenberg agreed to arbitrate \"any\r\ndispute, claim or controversy that may arise . . . that is required\r\nto be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of the\r\norganizations indicated in Item 10\" (emphasis added).  The\r\nagreement did not state that Rosenberg agreed to arbitrate alldisputes, or even any dispute.  The agreement only required\r\nRosenberg to arbitrate any dispute that the NYSE's rules,\r\nconstitution, or bylaws (or those of any of the organizations\r\nlisted in item 10) required to be arbitrated.  Cf. Prudential Ins.\r\nCo. of America v. Lai, 42 F.3d 1299, 1302 (9th Cir. 1994) (noting\r\nthat the U-4 Form arbitration provision \"does not in and of itself\r\nbind appellants to arbitrate any particular dispute\").  It is\r\nundisputed that Rosenberg's execution of this provision was a\r\ncondition of her employment with Merrill Lynch.\r\nThe NYSE Rules in turn required Rosenberg to arbitrate\r\n\"[a]ny controversy . . . arising out of [her] employment or\r\ntermination of [her] employment.\"  NYSE R. 347.  Merrill Lynch does\r\nnot dispute Rosenberg's statement that she never received a copy of\r\nthe NYSE rules and has provided no evidence that it gave her a copy\r\nor made one available to Rosenberg at the time of the employment,\r\nat the time of NYSE approval, or even later.  Nor has Merrill Lynch\r\nprovided evidence it even told Rosenberg that the clause required\r\nher to arbitrate any employment discrimination claims.  Had the U-4\r\nprovided for arbitration of all disputes, or given explicit notice\r\nthat employment disputes were subject to arbitration, we would have\r\nhad little difficulty in finding that Rosenberg had agreed to\r\narbitrate her employment discrimination claims within the meaning\r\nof the 1991 CRA.\r\nFor purposes of the 1991 CRA, the parties and the\r\ndistrict court have adopted the analytical rubric of whether the\r\nagreement was \"knowing and voluntary\" to examine the agreement. \r\nThis usage is common, see, e.g., Bercovitch, 133 F.3d at 151\r\n(dicta), and stems from a footnote in Gardner-Denver:\r\nIn determining the effectiveness of any such waiver, a\r\ncourt would have to determine at the outset that the\r\nemployee's consent . . . was voluntary and knowing.\r\n\nGardner-Denver, 415 U.S. at 52 n.15.\r\n\nThe \"knowing and voluntary\" language undoubtedly comes\r\nfrom thinking of arbitration as \"a waiver of judicial remedies.\"\r\nMitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628 (emphasis added).  It is commonplace\r\nthat waivers of certain rights, particularly substantive rights,\r\nare enforceable only if they are knowing and voluntary.  Whether a\r\nstandard similar to the one that applies to rights such as the\r\nright to counsel, cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 465 (1938),\r\nshould apply to waivers of a judicial forum is an open question.\r\nAs the Seventh Circuit has noted, if this \"knowing and\r\nvoluntary\" standard is meant to add another layer of protection for\r\nthe employee, then it is \"[l]ess clear . . . whether the right to\r\nhave one's federal claims determined judicially rather than in an\r\narbitration proceeding qualifies for this added protection.\" \r\nGibson, 121 F.3d at 1129.  On this issue of whether there is a\r\nheightened level of protection the circuits are split.  The Supreme\r\nCourt has not directly decided the issue.\r\nThe Ninth Circuit has expressly adopted a \"knowing\"\r\nstandard for such arbitration clauses and has described the\r\nstandard as being a heightened one.  See Renteria v. Prudential\r\nIns. Co. of America, 113 F.3d 1104, 1105-06 (9th Cir. 1997); Lai,\r\n42 F.3d at 1305.  The Third Circuit has rejected any heightened\r\nstandard.  See Seus, 146 F.3d at 183-84 &amp; n.2.  The Eighth Circuit\r\nappears to have done the same in Patterson.  See Patterson, 113\r\nF.3d at 838.  The Seventh Circuit recognized the issue in Gibson,\r\nbut found it unnecessary to resolve it.  Gibson, 121 F.3d at 1130. \r\nWe also find it unnecessary to resolve this general\r\nissue.  Rather, we focus on the language of the 1991 CRA, in which\r\nthe terms \"knowing and voluntary\" do not appear.  The operative\r\nlanguage is:\r\n[w]here appropriate and to the extent authorized by law,\r\n. . . arbitration . . . is encouraged to resolve disputes\r\narising under [these laws].\r\n\n1991 CRA  118, 105 Stat. at 1081.  There has been little case law\r\non the meaning of these terms.\r\nAt a minimum the words \"to the extent authorized by law\"\r\nmust mean that arbitration agreements that are unenforceable under\r\nthe FAA are also unenforceable when applied to claims under Title\r\nVII and the ADEA.  Under the FAA, arbitration agreements are\r\nenforceable \"save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity\r\nfor the revocation of any contract.\"  9 U.S.C.  2.  In Mitsubishi,\r\nthe Court gave an example of the sorts of agreements which are\r\nunenforceable under the FAA:\r\nOf course, courts should remain attuned to well-supported\r\nclaims that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from the\r\nsort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would\r\nprovide grounds \"for the revocation of any contract.\"\r\n\nMitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 627 (quoting 9 U.S.C.  2).  The question\r\nunder the FAA of whether an arbitration agreement is enforceable is\r\ngenerally determined by reference to common-law principles of\r\ngeneral applicability.  See Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.S. 483, 492 n.9\r\n(1987); Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1984).  When\r\ndeciding whether the parties agreed under the FAA to arbitrate a\r\ncertain matter, courts \"generally . . . should apply ordinary\r\nstate-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.\" \r\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944\r\n(1995).\r\nSimilarly, the question of the scope of an arbitration\r\nagreement under the FAA is a matter not just of state law, but of\r\ngeneral federal arbitration law.  See Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v.\r\nMercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983).  There is often, as\r\nhere, a predecessor question of whether there was an agreement at\r\nall to arbitrate.  See MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Exalon Indus., Inc.,\r\n138 F.3d 426, 428-29 (1st Cir. 1998).  Reference should be made to\r\nstandard principles of contract law in making such a determination. \r\nSee id. at 429-30.  We need not resolve here whether the \"to the\r\nextent authorized by law\" clause has a meaning greater than a\r\nreference to the FAA.\r\nWhile such principles provide background, the resolution\r\nof the case does not turn on them but on the language of the 1991\r\nCRA; that is, whether under these facts, the arbitration clause was\r\n\"appropriate.\"  Thus, this case does not implicate any broader\r\nquestions of enforceability of the arbitration clause when the 1991\r\nCRA or ADEA are not involved.\r\nWe set the context.  Rosenberg's and Merrill Lynch's\r\narbitration agreement did not by itself define the range of claims\r\nsubject to arbitration, even though Merrill Lynch expressly\r\nrepresented that she would be advised of the rules.  It referred\r\nonly to arbitration of such claims as were required to be\r\narbitrated by the NYSE rules.  But those rules were not given to\r\nRosenberg or described to her.  The question then becomes which\r\nparty should bear the risk of her ignorance.  Given Congress's\r\nconcern that agreements to arbitrate employment discrimination\r\nclaims should be enforced only where \"appropriate,\" a concern not\r\nexpressed in the FAA or at common law, Merrill Lynch should, we\r\nbelieve, bear that risk.\r\nAs part of its employment agreement with Rosenberg,\r\nMerrill Lynch required her to agree to the terms of the U-4 Form. \r\nThe U-4 Form, prepared under the NYSE Rules, requires that\r\nemployees being asked to execute the U-4 Form be given a copy of\r\nthe NYSE rules or information to the same effect, at least by the\r\ntime of approval.  The U-4 Form thus explicitly contemplated that\r\nMerrill Lynch would take the steps necessary to ensure that\r\nRosenberg was aware of the NYSE rules.  The same U-4 Form that\r\nRosenberg signed to register with the NYSE was also signed by John\r\nWyllys on behalf of Merrill Lynch.  Under the heading, \"THE FIRM\r\nMUST COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING,\" the U-4 Form stated:\r\nTo the best of my knowledge and belief, the applicant is\r\ncurrently bonded where required, and, at the time of\r\napproval, will be familiar with the statute(s),\r\nconstitutions(s), rules and by-laws of the agency,\r\njurisdiction or self-regulatory organization with which\r\nthis application is being filed, and the rules governing\r\nregistered persons, and will be fully qualified for the\r\nposition for which application is being made herein.\r\n\nWyllys' signature follows this statement.  But Wyllys'\r\ncertification was false: Merrill Lynch never provided Rosenberg\r\nwith a copy of the rules and Merrill Lynch has provided no\r\nevidence it made Rosenberg familiar with the rules as to\r\narbitration.  Merrill Lynch's failure runs afoul of the mutual\r\nunderstandings.  Since the arbitration requirement stems from the\r\nNYSE Rules and the U-4 Form requires that the employee be\r\n\"familiar with\" the rules and thus with the requirement for\r\narbitration of employment claims, we think that Merrill Lynch's\r\ninaction undercuts the imposition of an arbitration requirement. \r\nSee Dickstein v. duPont, 443 F.2d 783, 784 (1st Cir. 1971)\r\n(stating that the predecessor to the U-4 Form \"was an integral and\r\nmutually binding part of [the] employment arrangement\" between an\r\nemployee and a NYSE brokerage house).  The NYSE rules contemplated\r\nthat Merrill Lynch certify to it that, at least as of the time of\r\nNYSE approval of Rosenberg's application, Rosenberg be \"familiar\"\r\nwith the rules including the rules that all employment disputes\r\nbe arbitrated.  Merrill Lynch's failure, we believe, makes it\r\ninappropriate to enforce the provision.\r\nThis holding is in accordance with Ramirez-De-Arellanov. American Airlines, Inc., 133 F.3d 89 (1st Cir. 1997), an\r\nemployee handbook case in which this court suggested that an\r\nagreement to \"waive the right to a judicial forum for civil rights\r\nclaims, . . . in exchange for employment or continued employment,\r\nmust at least be express.\"  Id. at 91 n.2 (quoting Nelson v.\r\nCyprus Bagdad Copper Corp., 119 F.3d 756, 761-62 (9th Cir. 1997),\r\ncert. denied 118 S. Ct. 1511 (1998)) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted); see also Paladino, 134 F.3d at 1059, 1062 (refusing to\r\nenforce the arbitration of Title VII claims, one judge on the\r\nground that the language of the arbitration clause did not provide\r\nfair notice, and two judges on the ground that the clause\r\nforeclosed Title VII remedies and may have required the claimant\r\nto bear hefty arbitration fees).\r\nIn short, under these circumstances, compelling\r\narbitration would not be \"appropriate\" under the 1991 CRA.  Our\r\napproach is close to that taken by the Supreme Court in Wright. \r\nThere the court declined to mandate arbitration of an ADA claim\r\nwhere the waiver of a judicial forum set forth in a CBA was not\r\n\"clear and unmistakable.\"  Wright, 119 S. Ct. at 396-97.  To be\r\nsure, Wright carefully distinguished a private arbitration\r\nagreement from an agreement in the collective bargaining context. \r\nSee id. at 397 n.2.  There are sound reasons to recognize such a\r\ndistinction and a lesser standard than \"clear and unmistakable\"\r\napplies to private agreements.  See id. at 396.  But Wright also\r\nteaches that the \"appropriate\" language of the 1991 CRA, which\r\nparallels that of the ADA, has some teeth:\r\nOur conclusion that a union waiver of employee rights\r\nto a federal judicial forum for employment\r\ndiscrimination claims must be clear and unmistakable\r\nmeans that, absent a clear waiver, it is not\r\n'appropriate' . . . to find an agreement to arbitrate.\r\n\nId. at 397 n.2.  In recognizing that \"the right to a federal\r\njudicial forum is of sufficient importance to be protected,\" id.at 396, Wright leads to the conclusion, we think, that there be\r\nsome minimal level of notice to the employee that statutory claims\r\nare subject to arbitration.\r\n                           V\r\nThis case requires applying the Supreme Court's holding\r\nin Gilmer to Title VII as amended by the 1991 CRA and the ADEA as\r\namended by the OWBPA.  This case does not involve evaluation of\r\nthe policies in favor of and against litigation as opposed to\r\narbitration.  We hold that there was no congressional intent to\r\npreclude pre-dispute arbitration agreements manifested in the 1991\r\nCRA or the OWBPA.  We also hold that the evidence does not support\r\na finding that there is \"structural bias\" or that the NYSE arbitral\r\nrules create \"procedural inadequacies\" sufficient to be an\r\nexception to Gilmer.  Our holding here that Rosenberg cannot be\r\ncompelled to arbitrate her claims is limited.  As stated above,\r\nhad Merrill Lynch taken the modest effort required to make\r\nrelevant information regarding the arbitrability of employment\r\ndisputes available to Rosenberg as it committed itself to do, it\r\nwould have been able to compel Rosenberg to arbitration.  This\r\ncase does not concern the enforceability of Form U-4 arbitration\r\nagreements with customers.  Nor does it concern the enforceability\r\nof employment disputes where the claims involved are not\r\nemployment discrimination claims under the federal civil rights\r\nlaws.\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to Rosenberg.\r\n\n- Opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part follows -\r\n\nWELLFORD, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in part and\r\ndissenting in part.  I concur entirely with Judge Lynch's\r\nexcellent analysis of the issues in this case and in her opinion\r\non those issues set out in Parts I, II and III, which reverse the\r\ndecision of the district court.  Furthermore, I concur in Part IVA\r\nof Judge Lynch's analysis concerning whether the contract involved\r\nwas an unenforceable, \"unconscionable adhesion contract.\" \r\nRosenberg's agreement to arbitrate was not invalid, and this case\r\nis not moot.\r\nIn general, I concur with the conclusion that Gilmer v.\r\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20 (1991), is still good\r\nlaw and applies to the issues in this controversy.  The rationale\r\nof Bercovitch v. Baldwin School, Inc., 133 F.3d 141 (1st Cir.\r\n1998), is also persuasive on the claims presented by Rosenberg,\r\nas is Seus v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., 146 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. 1998).  Seealso Patterson v. Tenet Healthcare, Inc., 113 F.3d 832 (8th Cir.\r\n1997).  I also agree with the rejection of Duffield v. Robertson\r\nStephens &amp; Co., 144 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S.Ct.\r\n445 (Nov. 9, 1998), as unpersuasive.  I would, in short, like\r\nJudge Lynch, reject the reasoning of the district court in this\r\ncase.\r\nI write separately, however, in respectful disagreement\r\nwith the conclusions in Part IVB.  The analysis concerning non-\r\nenforcement of the parties' agreement, because not \"appropriate\r\nand authorized by law\" under CRA, is my point of departure in this\r\ndifficult case.\r\nThere are a number of facts that cut against the result\r\nreached by Judge Lynch's opinion.  First, the district court found\r\nRosenberg to be a mature, well-educated businesswoman when she\r\nbegan her career as a financial consultant with Merrill Lynch. \r\nSecond, discovery in this case was not even completed before\r\ndefendant moved to compel arbitration under the U-4 agreement and\r\napplicable exchange/securities rules.  Third, in denying the\r\nmotion, the district court found that Rosenberg signed the\r\nagreement, but allegedly did not receive any applicable exchange\r\nrules.  She asserted that she was not advised of, and was ignorant\r\nabout, the arbitration documents.  The district court, however,\r\nmakes no reference to Merrill Lynch's position vis-a-visfurnishing advice, documentation, or information to Rosenberg at\r\nor before--or after--Rosenberg signed the agreement to arbitrate. \r\nJudge Lynch notes that Merrill Lynch \"does not dispute\" that\r\nRosenberg was not given a copy of applicable rules of any\r\norganization referred to in Item 10 of U-4, but I do not conclude\r\nfrom the available record that Merrill Lynch concedes that a copy\r\nof the rules was not available to her at all pertinent times upon\r\nrequest.  Nowhere in the record do I find a contention that\r\nRosenberg asked about such rules or sought advice or information\r\nfrom Merrill Lynch about the meaning and effect of the U-4\r\nagreement which she signed.  We do not know what, if anything,\r\nMerrill Lynch's representatives did, said or furnished Rosenberg\r\nin connection with the arbitration agreement, and/or in response\r\nto any inquiry or actions of Rosenberg regarding the said\r\nagreement.\r\nI would find the arbitration clause in question not to\r\nbe \"inappropriate\" as to the issues in this case.  Congress, in\r\nusing the expression \"[w]here [arbitration is] appropriate\" may\r\nwell have intended some threshold determination that the type of\r\nemployee-employer dispute be amenable to resolution by\r\narbitration.  The Supreme Court in Wright v. Universal Maritime\r\nServ. Corp., 119 S.Ct. 391 (1998), interpreted the \"[w]here\r\nappropriate and to the extent authorized by law\" language of the\r\nCivil Rights Act as a single unit in deciding that a collective\r\nbargaining agreement negotiated by a union would not be enforced\r\nagainst an affected employee under the circumstances of that case. \r\nThat situation was different from the private employee-employer\r\nagreement here involved.  Wright limited its holding to the\r\ncontext where a labor union waived a member's federal statutory\r\nrights.\r\nThe form signed by Rosenberg indicated an agreement to\r\narbitrate and directed her to read the agreement carefully with\r\nspecific reference to New York Stock Exchange Rules.  Under all\r\nthe circumstances, I would be inclined to remand to the district\r\ncourt to develop fully the facts as to whether Rosenberg was\r\nafforded a reasonable opportunity to appreciate the arbitration\r\nimplications of her employment agreement.  Did she have an\r\nopportunity to be familiar, or did she have a duty to familiarize\r\nherself, with the arbitration undertaking?\r\nI do not consider Ramirez-De-Arellano v. American\r\nAirlines, Inc., 133 F.3d 89 (1st Cir. 1997), to support the\r\nmajority view.  Ramirez was an action \"brought primarily under the\r\nFair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and Puerto Rico law.\"  Id. at 89. \r\nIt did not involve a civil rights claim, and the court upheld\r\nsummary judgment for defendant in the discharge of plaintiff.  The\r\nRamirez court simply held that plaintiff could pursue his action\r\nin federal court because of the court's dissatisfaction with\r\naspects of American Airlines' arbitration procedures not akin to\r\nthose involved in the instant dispute.\r\nMore important, however, is my disagreement with Judge\r\nLynch's conclusion in part IVB that arbitration would not be\r\n\"appropriate\" because, as plaintiff avers, Merrill Lynch did not\r\nfurnish Rosenberg with a copy of the pertinent rules, and because\r\nMerrill Lynch falsely certified that Rosenberg was \"familiar with\"\r\nthe rules. \r\nI am reluctant to join a finding that Merrill Lynch,\r\nand/or its representative, John Wyllys, falsely certified\r\nRosenberg's qualifications, fitness, and knowledge as a financial\r\nrepresentative and her familiarity with the rules.  Even assuming,\r\nhowever, that the certification was incorrect, I disagree with the\r\nconclusion reached in Part IVB. \r\nUnlike Judge Lynch, I would hold that Rosenberg was\r\npresumed to understand, and to be bound by, the plain terms of her\r\nU-4 agreement even if she were not furnished copies of the\r\nexchange rules at the time of signing.  I believe the agreement\r\nwas broad and plain and that it put Rosenberg on notice that she\r\nagreed to arbitrate at the outset \"any dispute, claim or\r\ncontroversy\" with Merrill Lynch under exchange rules.  If she\r\n\"did not make herself aware of the existence or scope of [the\r\narbitration] clause [in the U-4 agreement], she did so at her own\r\nperil.\"  Beauchamp v. Great West Life Ins. Co., 918 F.Supp. 1091,\r\n1099 (E.D. Mich. 1996).  She is \"presumed to know the contents of\r\nthe signed agreement\" as well as its reasonable import.  Creminv. Merrill Lynch Pierce, 957 F.Supp. 1460, 1477 (N.D. Ill. 1997)\r\n(citing Beauchamp, 918 F.Supp. at 1097-98).\r\nLudwig v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.,\r\n978 F.Supp. 1379, 1382 (D.Kansas 1997), puts it even more\r\nspecifically under facts and contentions similar to those in this\r\ncase:  \"regardless of whether plaintiff received the NASD Code,\r\nthe potential breadth of the arbitration provision immediately put\r\nher on notice that any and all employment disputes were subject\r\nto mandatory arbitration.\"  Id. at 1382; see also Herko v.\r\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co., 978 F.Supp. 141, 147 (W.D. N.Y. 1997).\r\nAll these district court cases cited herein involve\r\nagreements and contentions by plaintiffs similar to those made in\r\nthis case by Rosenberg.  I would hold to the presumption, in light\r\nof these authorities, that Rosenberg was put on notice and should\r\nhave made prompt inquiry in connection with her executing the\r\narbitration agreement as to the scope and nature of the exchange\r\nrules.\r\nI would therefore REVERSE and grant the defendant's\r\nmotion for arbitration.\n",

The question raised is whether\r\nCongress intended to prohibit enforcement of pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements covering employment discrimination claims\r\nunder Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as a\r\nmatter of law in all cases or at least under certain facts said to\r\nbe present here.  Every circuit that has considered the issue save\r\none has upheld the use of such agreements.  The case here, in which\r\nthe district court refused to compel a plaintiff to arbitrate such\r\nclaims when the employer wished to arbitrate under a pre-dispute\r\nagreement, has also drawn much attention in the form of nine briefs\r\namici curiae.\r\nThe plaintiff, Susan Rosenberg, signed a standard\r\nsecurities industry form, the \"U-4 Form,\" agreeing to arbitrate\r\ncertain claims after being hired by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner\r\n&amp; Smith as a trainee financial consultant.  The form itself did not\r\nstate which claims were to be arbitrated, but rather referred to\r\nthe rules of various organizations with which Rosenberg was\r\nregistering.  When her employment was later terminated, Rosenberg\r\nfiled suit alleging age and gender discrimination and related\r\nclaims.  Merrill Lynch moved to enforce the agreement and compel\r\narbitration in the arbitration system of the New York Stock\r\nExchange.\r\nThe district court found no actual bias in the NYSE\r\narbitral forum.  Nonetheless, troubled by a perceived tension\r\nbetween the federal policies favoring vindication of civil rights\r\nand those favoring arbitration, the court denied the motion to\r\ncompel.  In a thoughtful opinion, the court based its reasoning on\r\ntwo grounds: first, that the 1991 Civil Rights Act (\"1991 CRA\")\r\namendments to Title VII preclude enforcement of pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements concerning discrimination claims, and\r\nsecond, that the arbitral forum involved, set up by the rules of\r\nthe NYSE, was not an adequate forum due to what the district court\r\ncalled \"structural bias.\"  Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\r\nFenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1598508\"><a href=\"/opinion/1598508/rosenberg-v-merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 203, 207 (D. Mass. 1998).\r\nIn the end we agree that the motion to compel was\r\nproperly denied on the facts of this particular case, but for\r\nreasons different than those advanced by the district court.  As to\r\nthe first ground relied on by the district court, we hold as a\r\nmatter of law that application of pre-dispute arbitration\r\nagreements to federal claims arising under Title VII and the ADEA\r\nis not precluded by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act\r\n(\"OWBPA\") amendments to the ADEA or by Title VII as amended by the\r\n1991 CRA.  As to the second ground, we disavow the district court's\r\nconclusion that the agreement is not enforceable due to \"structural\r\nbias\" in the NYSE arbitral forum, a conclusion that was based on\r\nerrors of law and fact.  We agree that there has been no showing of\r\nactual bias in the forum selected and that a refusal to grant a\r\nmotion to compel arbitration therefore may not be based on that\r\nground.  \r\nWe nonetheless conclude that there is an independent\r\nground requiring affirmance of the order denying the motion to\r\ncompel arbitration.  The parties have agreed that the essential\r\nmaterial facts are undisputed and that this court should, if\r\nnecessary, resolve an issue not resolved by the district court: \r\nwhether the parties' agreement met the standard set forth in the\r\n1991 CRA for enforcing arbitration clauses \"where appropriate and\r\nto the extent authorized by law.\"  We hold, on the facts presented,\r\nthat this standard was not met, and thus that the motion to compel\r\nwas properly denied.\r\n                           I\r\nRosenberg, whose prior experience had been in accounting\r\nand product engineering, was hired by Merrill Lynch on January 6,\r\n1992.  She was forty-five years old and held a Bachelor of Science\r\ndegree in accounting.  She had no experience in the securities\r\nindustry when she entered Merrill Lynch's twenty-four month\r\ntraining program for financial consultants.  \r\nRosenberg was required to fill out a standardized\r\nregistration form generally required of employees in the securities\r\nindustry.  That form, the Uniform Application for Securities\r\nIndustry Registration or Transfer, commonly referred to as the U-4\r\nForm, included the following language under the heading \"THE\r\nAPPLICANT MUST READ THE FOLLOWING VERY CAREFULLY\":\r\nI agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy\r\nthat may arise between me and my firm, or a customer, or\r\nany other person, that is required to be arbitrated under\r\nthe rules, constitutions, or by-laws of the organizations\r\nindicated in Item 10 as may be amended from time to time\r\nand that any arbitration award rendered against me may be\r\nentered as a judgement in any court of competent\r\njurisdiction.\r\nItem 10 included boxes for various securities organizations and\r\njurisdictions with which an applicant might be registered.  On\r\nRosenberg's form the boxes marked ASE, CBOE, NASD, NYSE, and MA\r\nwere checked -- signifying the American Stock Exchange, Chicago\r\nBoard of Exchange, National Association of Securities Dealers, New\r\nYork Stock Exchange, and Massachusetts.  The ASE, NASD, and NYSE\r\nboxes were apparently checked on or prior to January 10, 1992.  The\r\nCBOE and MA boxes were checked sometime between January 10 and\r\nJanuary 24.  Rosenberg's supervisor, John Wyllys, signed the form\r\non January 10, but Rosenberg did not sign the form until January 24\r\n-- although the form was back-dated to January 10.  Rosenberg has\r\nno memory of reading or signing the form, although she admits that\r\nthe signature is hers, and she says that she did not herself check\r\nany of the boxes.  Wyllys in turn certified that Rosenberg would be\r\nfamiliar with the applicable rules, including the NYSE rules, at\r\nthe time of approval of her U-4 Form.  That certification was\r\nuntrue.\r\nRosenberg says that she was not given a copy of the\r\nrules, or any amendments to the rules, of the NYSE, the NASD, or\r\nany of the other organizations referred to in Item 10 of the U-4. \r\nMerrill Lynch does not dispute this claim.  \r\nOn May 5, 1992, Rosenberg was given the title of\r\nFinancial Consultant, and she worked for Merrill Lynch until May 2,\r\n1994, when her employment was terminated by John Wyllys.  The\r\nreason given for the termination was inadequate performance.\r\nRosenberg alleges that she performed better than at least\r\nfour male consultants during her two-year tenure, but that she, and\r\nnot any of them, was terminated in mid-1994.  She also says that\r\namong those with two years of tenure in her office she was the only\r\nconsultant who was over age forty.  \r\nRosenberg also alleges that on March 9, 1994, a few\r\nmonths before her termination, John Wyllys sexually harassed her by\r\nactivating and handing to her a phallus-shaped vibrator when she\r\nwent into his office to obtain a document.  (Wyllys denies this and\r\nsays the only unusual electrical apparatus in his office was a\r\n\"stress buster.\")  Rosenberg did not file a harassment complaint\r\ninternally with Merrill Lynch.\r\nOn April 25, 1994 -- allegedly the next time Rosenberg\r\nand Wyllys spoke -- Rosenberg met with Wyllys to discuss her work\r\nperformance.  Wyllys suggested she tender her resignation, saying\r\nthat her work was not up to expected levels.  The next day\r\nRosenberg called Wyllys to invite him to have dinner with her to\r\ndiscuss his evaluation of her, and he accepted the invitation on\r\nApril 27.  At dinner, Rosenberg said she would not resign.  Her\r\nemployment was terminated within days.\r\n                           II\r\nIn July 1994, Rosenberg filed an administrative complaint\r\nwith the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\")\r\nalleging age and gender discrimination.  In October 1995, the MCAD\r\nfound no probable cause.  One year later, Rosenberg brought suit in\r\nstate court asserting discrimination and tort claims against\r\nMerrill Lynch and John Wyllys.  The defendants removed the case to\r\nfederal court.\r\nMerrill Lynch moved to compel arbitration and to stay the\r\nmatter pending arbitration.  Merrill Lynch originally moved to\r\ncompel arbitration in accordance with the rules of the NASD, which\r\nMerrill Lynch argued required arbitration \"of any dispute, claim,\r\nor controversy . . . arising out of the employment or termination\r\nof employment of associated person(s) with any member [of the\r\nNASD].\"  NASD Manual, Code of Arbitration Procedure Rule 10101\r\n(July 1996).  Rosenberg contended that this language was not in\r\nforce at the time she signed the U-4, and that the NASD rules in\r\neffect at that time did not apply to employment claims.  Merrill\r\nLynch disputed this, and argued that subsequent modifications of\r\nthe rules applied to Rosenberg, given the U-4's reference to rules\r\nthat \"may be amended from time to time.\"  Merrill Lynch also argued\r\nthat regardless of whether the NASD rules required the arbitration\r\nof employment disputes, the NYSE Rules clearly did require\r\narbitration of Rosenberg's claim.  The district court, however,\r\ndiscussed only the NYSE rules.  Merrill Lynch's arguments to this\r\ncourt have similarly focused on the NYSE rules.\r\nThe NYSE rules at the time Rosenberg brought her claim\r\nrequired arbitration of all employment disputes.  Rule 347 stated: \r\nAny controversy between a registered representative and\r\nany member or member organization arising out of the\r\nemployment or termination of employment of such\r\nregistered representative by and with such member or\r\nmember organization shall be settled by arbitration, at\r\nthe instance of any such party, in accordance with the\r\narbitration procedure prescribed elsewhere in these\r\nrules.\r\n\nNYSE R. 347.  No one explained to Rosenberg that the U-4 Form\r\nagreement to arbitrate that she had signed encompassed employment\r\ndisputes she might have with her employer.  She was given a copy of\r\nMerrill Lynch's \"voluminous\" employment handbook, but there is no\r\nargument that the handbook states that employment disputes are to\r\nbe arbitrated.\r\nRosenberg also said in an affidavit that if she had been\r\ninformed that her agreement to arbitrate certain claims included\r\nany potential employment discrimination claims she would have\r\nraised questions and might have sought outside advice.  Merrill\r\nLynch responded that the signing of these forms is an absolute\r\ncondition of employment, or at least was at that time.\r\nThe district court initially issued an opinion deferring\r\ndecision on the motion to stay and ordering \"additional briefing\r\nand discovery on certain legal issues -- the application of Gilmer[v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112584\"><a href=\"/opinion/112584/gilmer-v-interstatejohnson-lane-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991)] to the\r\nparticular statutory schemes at issue here, gender discrimination\r\nand sexual harassment under Title VII, age discrimination under .\r\n. .

Merrill Lynch,\r\nPierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2138848\"><a href=\"/opinion/2138848/rosenberg-v-merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (D. Mass.\r\n1997).\r\n Later, the district court denied the motion to compel. \r\nSee Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 212.  The court attempted to\r\ndistinguish the Supreme Court's decision in Gilmer, which had held\r\nvalid a pre-dispute arbitration clause in a U-4 Form signed by a\r\nsecurities industry employee and compelled arbitration of an ADEA\r\nclaim.  The district court reasoned first that in Title VII, in\r\ncontrast to the ADEA, Congress intended to preclude pre-dispute\r\narbitration clauses, and second, that as a factual matter the NYSE\r\nprovided an inadequate arbitral forum to vindicate Rosenberg's\r\nTitle VII and ADEA claims.  The forum was inadequate, the court\r\nconcluded, because of \"the extent to which the NYSE arbitration\r\nsystem is dominated by the securities industry, that is, by the\r\nemployment side of this dispute.\"  Id. at 207.  The heart of the\r\ncourt's analysis was its conclusion that there was a close identity\r\nbetween Merrill Lynch and the NYSE, that the NYSE dominated the\r\narbitral process, and that the process therefore favored Merrill\r\nLynch.  Specifically, the district court found that the Director of\r\nArbitration, an employee of the NYSE, appoints the panel of\r\narbitrators from various pools.  Those pools, including the pool of\r\n\"public arbitrators,\" are recommended and appointed by the Chairman\r\nof the NYSE Board.  The Director of Arbitration and his staff also\r\ndecide some pre-hearing procedural matters.  See id. at 210-11. \r\nThe court was concerned with such involvement by NYSE employees,\r\nbecause it found that \"Merrill Lynch . . . helps govern the NYSE.\" \r\nId. at 210.  The district court considered that these deficiencies\r\nwere not cured by a rule allowing each party to use one peremptory\r\nchallenge and unlimited challenges for cause to remove arbitrators\r\nfrom the panel.\r\nAfter the district court's decision, Merrill Lynch\r\nabandoned its policy of requiring employees to agree to arbitrate\r\nemployment discrimination claims; however, this change in policy\r\napplies only to claims filed after July 1, 1998, and thus not to\r\nRosenberg.  Pursuant to a class action settlement in Cremin v.\r\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., No. 96C 3773 (N.D.\r\nIll. Sept. 2, 1998), Merrill Lynch has agreed that, regardless of\r\nthe language of the U-4 Form, employees who file discrimination\r\nclaims after July 1, 1998 will be able to bring their claims in\r\ncourt.  Employees with discrimination claims filed before that date\r\nwill still be required to submit their claims to arbitration, but\r\nwill not be required to do so in the NYSE's arbitration system. \r\nInstead, arbitrations will be conducted by outside organizations,\r\nbefore arbitrators who are trained in employment law issues. \r\nRosenberg opted out of the settlement, instead choosing to pursue\r\nthe case that is before this court.  See id.\r\nThe NYSE has proposed a rule change that will exclude\r\nemployment discrimination claims from the scope of cases to be\r\narbitrated.  See Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of\r\nProposed Rule Changes by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating\r\nto Arbitration Rules, 63 Fed. Reg. 52,782 (1998).  The SEC has yet\r\nto approve the change, but it recently approved a similar change in\r\nthe NASD's rules.  See Self-Regulatory Organizations; National\r\nAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to\r\nProposed Rule Change Relating to the Arbitration of Employment\r\nDiscrimination Claims, 63 Fed. Reg. 35,299 (1998).\r\nRosenberg argues that the NYSE's proposed rule change\r\nmakes this case moot; the defendants say it is not now moot and\r\nwill not become moot.  Although the rule change may be approved,\r\nthe proposed rules are silent as to whether the rule change would\r\napply retroactively to existing claims.  The NASD rule change was\r\nnot retroactive.  Even if the NYSE rules are changed and those\r\nchanges made retroactive and thus Rosenberg cannot be compelled to\r\narbitrate her claims in the NYSE arbitral forum, Merrill Lynch may\r\nstill be able to compel arbitration in one of the other fora listed\r\non the U-4, including the NASD.  This is because the rule change\r\nwill alter NYSE Rules 347 and 600 to create an exception for\r\nemployment disputes; the rule change has no effect on the U-4 Form. \r\nThe issues in this case would apply with equal force to any attempt\r\nby Merrill Lynch to compel arbitration in the NASD.  Thus, the case\r\nis not moot.\r\n                          III\r\nA.  Congressional Intent In Title VII and the OWBPA\r\n1.  Title VII and Arbitration Agreements\r\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by\r\nthe 1991 CRA, does not, as a matter of law, prohibit pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements, contrary to the holding of the district\r\ncourt.  This is a legal issue which we review de novo. SeeBercovitch v. Baldwin School, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750078\"><a href=\"/opinion/750078/jason-bercovitch-v-baldwin-school-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 147 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).\r\nWhether pre-dispute agreements are prohibited by Title\r\nVII is a question of whether Congress intended to preclude their\r\nuse.  It is not a question of resolving the lively current public\r\npolicy debate about whether use of arbitration, rather than a\r\ncourt, to resolve claims of employment discrimination hinders or\r\nadvances the vindication of basic civil rights.  Good arguments\r\nhave been made on both sides of this policy debate.  The EEOC has\r\nissued a policy statement discouraging the use of pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements.  See EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 10,\r\n1997), reprinted in Excerpts from Text: EEOC Rejects Mandatory\r\nBinding Employment Arbitration, 52 Disp. Resol. J. 11 (1997).  Not\r\nsurprisingly, supporters of arbitration have criticized the EEOC\r\nstatement.  See, e.g., Oppenheimer &amp; Johnstone, Con: A Management\r\nPerspective: Mandatory Arbitration Agreements Are An Effective\r\nAlternative to Employment Litigation, 52 Disp. Resol. J. 19, 19-20\r\n(1997).\r\nIn Gilmer, the Supreme Court held that the Federal\r\nArbitration Act (\"FAA\") required the enforcement of the pre-dispute\r\nmandatory arbitration clause in a U-4 Form identical to the one\r\nsigned by Rosenberg.  Gilmer involved a claim of age discrimination\r\nbrought under the ADEA.  The Court, noting numerous other contexts\r\nin which it had held that statutory claims could be the subject of\r\narbitration agreements, ruled that pre-dispute arbitration clauses\r\nshould be enforced unless the plaintiff could show congressional\r\nintent to preclude arbitration.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 26.  To\r\ndetermine that intent, courts were directed to look to a statute's\r\ntext and legislative history and to ascertain whether there was a\r\nconflict between arbitration and the statute's goals.  See id.\r\n We find no conflict between the language or purposes of\r\nTitle VII, as amended, and arbitration.  The question of\r\ncongressional intent in this case is resolved primarily by looking\r\nat the language Congress chose to use in the 1991 CRA, which, at\r\nsection 118, provides: \r\n[w]here appropriate and to the extent authorized by law,\r\nthe use of alternative means of dispute resolution,\r\nincluding . . . arbitration, is encouraged to resolve\r\ndisputes arising under the Acts or provisions of Federal\r\nlaw amended by this title.\r\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166,  118, 105 Stat.\r\n1071, 1081 (1991).\r\nRelying on this language, the district court found that\r\nthe language and legislative history of section 118 \"unambiguously\r\nreject mandatory arbitration agreements.\"  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp.\r\nat 201.  The court focused on the language \"where appropriate and\r\nto the extent authorized by law.\"  The court acknowledged that\r\nCongress passed the 1991 amendments after the Supreme Court's\r\ndecision in Gilmer, but noted that the specific language was\r\ndrafted prior to the Gilmer decision.  The court concluded that the\r\nlegislative history of the amendments made clear that \"to the\r\nextent authorized by law\" referred to the law as it existed prior\r\nto Gilmer, and thus evidenced congressional \"intent to preclude\r\nmandatory arbitration.\"  Id.  In particular, the court ruled that\r\nCongress had intended the revisions to be consistent with Alexanderv. Gardner-Denver Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108961\"><a href=\"/opinion/108961/alexander-v-gardner-denver-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), in which the Supreme\r\nCourt held that an arbitration clause in a collective bargaining\r\nagreement did not preclude an employee from bringing a Title VII\r\nclaim in court.  See Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 201-04.\r\nIn reviewing the district court's legal determination, we\r\nhave the benefit of having construed identical language in the\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq.(1994).  See Bercovitch, 133 F.3d at 150.  Compare 42 U.S.C.\r\n12212 (ADA) with 105 Stat. at 1081 (1991 CRA).  The district\r\ncourt apparently did not consider this court's opinion in\r\nBercovitch, which was decided shortly before the district court\r\nissued its order refusing to compel Rosenberg to arbitrate her\r\nclaims.  Bercovitch held that a plaintiff could be compelled to\r\narbitrate claims brought under the ADA \"where the plaintiff had\r\nvoluntarily signed an agreement requiring arbitration.\" \r\nBercovitch, 133 F.3d at 143.  Examining the text of the ADA, we\r\nfound that the statute's language, \"far from evidencing an\r\nintention to preclude arbitration, can only be interpreted as\r\nfavoring it.\"  Id. at 150.  Additionally, language in the Committee\r\nReport accompanying the 1991 CRA, cited in Rosenberg's brief as\r\nevidence of congressional intent to preclude mandatory arbitration,\r\nis identical to language in the Committee Report accompanying the\r\nADA.  In Bercovitch, however, we found that the legislative\r\nhistory of the ADA did not \"rebut the presumption in favor of\r\narbitration\" made manifest by the clear language of the statute. \r\nId. at 150.  We reach the same conclusion here.\r\nRosenberg and her amici present additional argument that\r\nCongress intended to preclude pre-dispute arbitration agreements in\r\nthe Title VII context.  For example, Congress rejected a proposed\r\namendment to the 1991 CRA that would have explicitly permitted pre-\r\ndispute mandatory arbitration agreements, and the majority report\r\nrejecting the proposed amendment stated that \"under the [proposed\r\namendment] employers could refuse to hire workers unless they\r\nsigned a binding statement waiving all rights to file Title VII\r\ncomplaints\" in court and declared that \"American workers should not\r\nbe forced to choose between their jobs and their civil rights.\" \r\nH.R. Rep. No. 102-40(I), at 104 (1991), reprinted in 1991\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 549, 642.  In addition, Rosenberg and her amici point\r\nto a statement that section 118 \"contemplates the use of voluntary\r\narbitration to resolve specific disputes after they have arisen,\r\nnot coercive attempts to force employees in advance to forego\r\nstatutory rights.\"  137 Cong. Rec. H9505-01, H9530 (daily ed. Nov.\r\n7, 1991) (statement of Rep. Edwards).\r\nSuch statements are insufficient to overcome the\r\npresumption in favor of arbitration which Gilmer establishes.  As\r\nother amici note in support of Merrill Lynch, additional statements\r\nby members of Congress expressed the view that section 118 did not\r\npreclude binding arbitration.  See 137 Cong. Rec. S15,472-01,\r\nS15,478 (daily ed. Oct. 30, 1991) (statement of Sen. Dole) (\"This\r\nprovision encourages the use of alternative means of dispute\r\nresolution, including binding arbitration, where the parties\r\nknowingly and voluntarily elect to use these methods.  In light of\r\nthe litigation crisis facing this country and the increasing\r\nsophistication and reliability of alternatives to litigation, there\r\nis no reason to disfavor the use of such forums.\").  Congress has\r\nrepeatedly rejected legislation that would explicitly bar mandatory\r\nagreements to arbitrate employment discrimination claims.  SeeCivil Rights Procedures Protection Act of 1997, H.R. 983, S. 63,\r\n105th Cong. (proposing to revise Title VII and the ADEA to state\r\nthat \"[n]otwithstanding any Federal statute of general\r\napplicability that would modify any of the powers and procedures\r\nexpressly applicable to a claim arising under this title, such\r\npowers and procedures shall be the exclusive powers and procedures\r\napplicable to such claim unless after such claim arises the\r\nclaimant voluntarily enters into an agreement to resolve such claim\r\nthrough arbitration or another procedure\"); Civil Rights Procedures\r\nProtection Act of 1996, H.R. 3748, 104th Cong.; Civil Rights\r\nProcedures Protection Act of 1994, H.R. 4981, S. 2405, 103d Cong.\r\nNumerous circuit courts have held that the Supreme\r\nCourt's reasoning in Gilmer applies to Title VII claims and that\r\npre-dispute agreements to arbitrate Title VII claims are\r\npermissible.

The\r\nDuffield court found section 118's statement that arbitration is\r\nencouraged \"[w]here appropriate and to the extent authorized by\r\nlaw\" to be ambiguous, and thus looked to the purposes of the 1991\r\nCRA and to legislative history to elucidate the phrase's meaning. \r\nSee id. at 1198.  The court concluded that the legislative history,\r\ncontext, and text of the 1991 CRA demonstrated \"that Congress\r\nintended to preclude compulsory arbitration of Title VII claims.\" \r\nId. at 1199.\r\nTwo courts have, without discussion, held that the 1991\r\nCRA supports enforcement of pre-dispute agreements to arbitrate\r\nTitle VII claims.  See Patterson, 113 F.3d at 837 (stating that\r\n\"the arbitrability of Title VII claims finds support in the Civil\r\nRights Act of 1991\"); Austin, 78 F.3d at 881 (\"The language of the\r\nstatutes could not be any more clear in showing Congressional favor\r\ntowards arbitration.\").\r\nThe Third Circuit has interpreted section 118's reference\r\nto \"the extent authorized by law\" to refer to the Federal\r\nArbitration Act, not to case law as it stood at the time Congress\r\ndrafted the 1991 CRA.  See Seus, 146 F.3d at 183 (disagreeing with\r\nDuffield, 144 F.3d at 1194-98).  Like this court in Bercovitch, the\r\nThird Circuit first looked to the plain meaning of section 118,\r\nstating that section 118's endorsement of arbitration \"simply\r\ncannot be 'interpreted' to mean that the FAA is impliedly repealed\r\nwith respect to agreements to arbitrate Title VII and ADEA claims\r\nthat will arise in the future.\"  See Seus, 146 F.3d at 182.  We\r\nagree.\r\nWe hold that neither the language of the statute nor the\r\nlegislative history demonstrates an intent in the 1991 CRA to\r\npreclude pre-dispute arbitration agreements.  Under Gilmer, the\r\nremaining question is whether \"compulsory arbitration of [Title\r\nVII] claims pursuant to arbitration agreements would be\r\ninconsistent with the statutory framework and purposes of\" Title\r\nVII.  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 27 (discussing the ADEA).  The district\r\ncourt found that mandatory arbitration would be at odds with the\r\n\"structure and purpose\" of the 1991 CRA and with the 1991 CRA's\r\ncreation of a right to a jury trial for Title VII plaintiffs. \r\nRosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 204-06. \r\nResolving this issue requires determining whether there\r\nis any meaningful distinction between Title VII, as amended, and\r\neither the ADEA, which was construed by the Supreme Court in\r\nGilmer, or the ADA, which was construed by this court in\r\nBercovitch.  Gilmer found no clash between arbitration and the\r\npurposes of the ADEA, noting instead that \"[s]o long as the\r\nprospective litigant effectively may vindicate [his or her]\r\nstatutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will\r\ncontinue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.\" \r\nGilmer, 500 U.S. at 28 (second alteration in original) (quoting\r\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111513\"><a href=\"/opinion/111513/mitsubishi-motors-corp-v-soler-chrysler-plymouth-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637 (1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Bercovitchheld that \"[t]here is no reason to think that the ADA presents a\r\nstronger policy case against arbitration than [the] ADEA.\" \r\nBercovitch, 133 F.3d at 150.  \r\nIt is difficult to see why the purposes of Title VII\r\npresent a stronger case for rejecting arbitration than do the\r\npurposes of either the ADEA or the ADA.  In finding that it was\r\n\"not plausible . . . that the . . . Act would have . . . undermined\r\n[a plaintiff's private attorney general] role by endorsing private\r\nmandatory pre-dispute arbitration agreements,\" Rosenberg, 995 F.\r\nSupp. at 205, the district court overlooked Gilmer's statement that\r\npublic rights may be enforced through arbitration.  The district\r\ncourt's comment that an endorsement of arbitration would be at odds\r\nwith the 1991 CRA's creation of a right to a jury trial, see id. at\r\n205-06, similarly ignores Gilmer's endorsement of arbitration under\r\nthe ADEA -- which also provides for jury trials.  It may also\r\nevince a distrust of arbitration that the Supreme Court has long\r\nsince disavowed.  While people may and do reasonably disagree about\r\nwhether pre-dispute arbitration agreements are a wise way of\r\nresolving discrimination claims, there is no \"inherent conflict\"\r\nbetween the goals of Title VII and the goals of the FAA, as Gilmerused that phrase.  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 26 (quoting\r\nShearson/American Express, Inc. v. McMahon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111910\"><a href=\"/opinion/111910/shearsonamerican-express-inc-v-mcmahon/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227\r\n(1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nThe Supreme Court's very recent decision in Wright v.Universal Maritime Service Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), reinforces\r\nthis conclusion.  Wright addressed the issue of waiver of a\r\njudicial forum for ADA claims by virtue of general language in a\r\ncollective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\").  The Court did not reach\r\nthe issue of whether a \"clear and unmistakable\" waiver in a CBA\r\nwould be enforced: nor did it take a position on waivers \"in areas\r\noutside collective bargaining.\"  Id. at 396-97 &amp; n.2.  But nothing\r\nin the opinion suggests that Gilmer is not still good law; rather,\r\nthe contrary is true.\r\n2.  The OWBPA and Arbitration Agreements\r\nHaving found that Congress intended to preclude pre-\r\ndispute arbitration agreements in the 1991 CRA, the district court\r\ndid not consider Rosenberg's and amici's argument that the OWBPA\r\nindependently and explicitly makes pre-dispute arbitration\r\nagreements inapplicable to age discrimination claims.  The district\r\ncourt apparently felt that Gilmer controlled the issue, stating\r\nonly that \"Congress has not clearly expressed its intent to\r\npreclude enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements under\r\nthe ADEA.\"  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 206.  We agree with the\r\ndistrict court that ADEA claims may be the subject of pre-dispute\r\narbitration agreements, although the issue cannot be resolved by\r\nreference to Gilmer alone. \r\nRosenberg and her amici argue that the OWBPA, which the\r\ndistrict court did not analyze, provides an alternative ground for\r\nupholding the denial of Merrill Lynch's motion to compel\r\narbitration.  Congress enacted the OWBPA in 1990.  Although the\r\nSupreme Court decided Gilmer after Congress's passage of the OWBPA,\r\nGilmer involved a contract signed prior to the OWBPA, and thus did\r\nnot consider the effect of the act.  Rosenberg signed her U-4 Form\r\nin 1992, well after the OWBPA became effective.\r\nAs modified by the OWBPA, the ADEA provides:\r\n(1) An individual may not waive any right or claim under\r\nthis chapter unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary. \r\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2), a waiver may not be\r\nconsidered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum --\r\n     . . . . \r\n     (C) the individual does not waive rights or\r\n     claims that may arise after the date the waiver\r\n     is executed[.]\r\n29 U.S.C.  626(f)(1).  Rosenberg and her amici argue that the\r\nreference to \"waiver\" should be interpreted to include the U-4\r\nForm's arbitration clause and that the reference to \"right[]\" should\r\nbe interpreted to include the right to a bench or jury trial on\r\nADEA claims.  Amici point to legislative history that suggests that\r\nCongress was particularly concerned about older workers losing the\r\nright to a jury trial for ADEA claims.  However, the cited language\r\nspeaks only of ensuring that older workers are able to obtain legal\r\nrelief and does not mention arbitration or waiver of a judicial\r\nforum.  See S. Rep. No. 101-263, at 31-36 (1990), reprinted in 1990\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1509, 1537-1541; H.R. Rep.

Yet the EEOC's recently issued\r\nrules on the \"Waiver of Rights and Claims Under the Age\r\nDiscrimination in Employment Act\" include no discussion of the\r\ndefinition of \"right\" or \"claim,\" see 29 C.F.R.  1625.22\r\n(effective July 6, 1998), and do not say that \"waivers\" mean\r\narbitration clauses.  We do not defer to views espoused only in the\r\ncontext of litigation.  See Massachusetts v. Blackstone Valley\r\nElec. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705987\"><a href=\"/opinion/705987/commonwealth-of-massachusetts-v-blackstone-valley-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (1st Cir. 1995).  This is particularly\r\ntrue where the agency has gone through rule making and has\r\nconspicuously ignored the topic in its rules.  See id. \r\nMost courts which have considered the issue have\r\ninterpreted OWBPA's reference to \"any right\" to apply to substantive\r\nrights, or, at any rate, not to the right to proceed in court\r\nrather than in arbitration.  See, e.g., Seus, 146 F.3d at 181-82;\r\nWilliams v. Cigna Fin. Advisors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697291\"><a href=\"/opinion/697291/68-fair-emplpraccas-bna-65-66-empl-prac-dec-p-43601-19-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 660-61 (5th\r\nCir. 1995).  Courts that have interpreted the OWBPA to apply to\r\nwaivers of substantive rights have relied in part on dicta in\r\nGilmer commenting that \"Congress . . . did not explicitly preclude\r\narbitration or other nonjudicial resolution of claims, even in its\r\nrecent amendments to the ADEA.\"  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 29; see Seus,\r\n146 F.3d at 181-82; Cigna Fin. Advisors, 56 F.3d at 660-61 (\"There\r\nis no indication that Congress intended the OWBPA to affect\r\nagreements to arbitrate employment disputes.\").  The recent Wrightdecision reaffirms what was said in Gilmer: that an employee's\r\nstatutory right to a judicial forum for claims of employment\r\ndiscrimination \"is not a substantive right.\"  Wright, 119 S. Ct. at\r\n396.\r\nRosenberg and her amici point to the Supreme Court's \r\ndecision in Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118169\"><a href=\"/opinion/118169/oubre-v-entergy-operations-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1998), in which the Court commented that \"[t]he OWBPA implements\r\nCongress' policy via a strict, unqualified statutory stricture on\r\nwaivers, and we are bound to take Congress at its word.\"  Id. at\r\n841.  These comments are not particularly relevant here because\r\nthey do not go to the issue of whether the term \"waiver\" was meant\r\nto apply to pre-dispute arbitration agreements.  Indeed, while\r\nOubre did not consider whether the OWBPA applies to waivers of\r\nprocedural as well as substantive rights, the Court did state that\r\nthe OWBPA \"is clear: An employee 'may not waive' any ADEA claim\"\r\nunless the requirements of  626(f) are satisfied.  Id. (emphasis\r\nadded).  To the degree that Oubre has any relevance here, the\r\nreference to \"claim\" suggests that the waiver provisions refer to\r\nsubstantive claims.  A substantive ADEA claim may be presented in\r\nan arbitral or a judicial forum.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 28.\r\nNeither Rosenberg nor amicus curiae the EEOC points to\r\nany court that has held that the OWBPA evinces congressional intent\r\nto preclude pre-dispute arbitration agreements.  The EEOC argues\r\nthat the Duffield court suggested that the OWBPA reference to\r\n\"right[s]\" applies to the right to a judicial forum.  However, the\r\nDuffield court did not consider the issue, merely commenting that\r\n\"current ADEA claims may require different treatment\" from those the\r\nSupreme Court considered in Gilmer.  See Duffield, 144 F.3d at 1190\r\nn.5.\r\nWe hold that Congress did not intend to preclude pre-\r\ndispute arbitration agreements when it enacted the OWBPA.  Other\r\ncircuits have noted that:\r\n[i]n enacting the OWBPA, Congress' primary concern was\r\nwith releases and voluntary separation agreements in\r\nwhich employees were forced to waive their rights. . . .\r\n[T]he OWBPA protects against the waiver of a right or\r\nclaim, not against the waiver of a judicial forum. . . .\r\n     We recognize that Congress, through the OWBPA, has\r\nprotected terminated employees who waive their\r\nsubstantive rights under ADEA in exchange for a more\r\nfavorable severance package; however, we find no clear\r\nindication that Congress was likewise concerned with\r\nprotecting employees who agree to arbitrate claims that\r\nmay arise during the course of their employment.\r\nSeus, 146 F.3d at 181 (alterations in original) (quoting Cigna Fin.\r\nAdvisors, Inc., 56 F.3d at 660-61) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).  Nothing in the language or history of the OWBPA shows an\r\nintent impliedly to repeal the FAA for such claims.  Congress\r\ncertainly may act to preclude arbitration, but its failure to do so\r\nclearly here means there was no such intent.  \r\nTo interpret the OWBPA's reference to \"right\" to include\r\nprocedural rights -- and the right to a judicial forum in\r\nparticular -- would be to ignore the Supreme Court's repeated\r\nstatements that arbitral and judicial fora are both able to give\r\neffect to the policies that underlie legislation.  A party who\r\nagrees to arbitrate \"does not forgo the substantive rights afforded\r\nby the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,\r\nrather than a judicial, forum.\"  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 26 (quoting\r\nMitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628) (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nInterpreting the OWBPA to preclude pre-dispute arbitration\r\nagreements would run afoul of the presumption that arbitration\r\nprovides a fair and adequate mechanism for enforcing statutory\r\nrights.  \r\nB.  The New York Stock Exchange's Arbitration System\r\nIn addition to finding that Congress, in enacting the\r\n1991 CRA, had clearly precluded pre-dispute agreements to\r\narbitrate, the district court found an additional ground for\r\nrefusing to compel arbitration: what it described as \"structural\r\nbias\" in the NYSE's arbitration procedures.  The court found that\r\nthe NYSE arbitration process was \"inadequate to vindicate\r\nRosenberg's ADEA and Title VII rights.\"  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at\r\n212.  In reaching this conclusion, the district court committed two\r\ntypes of errors.  \r\nFirst, the district court misinterpreted the window\r\navailable post-Gilmer for challenges to a specific arbitral forum. \r\nThe district court found no actual bias in the NYSE's arbitration\r\nsystem, but nevertheless refused to compel arbitration due to\r\nalleged structural infirmities.  Absent a showing of actual bias --\r\nand we agree with the district court that there was no such showing\r\nin this case -- Gilmer required the district court to compel\r\narbitration.  Second, the district court erred in its description\r\nof the NYSE's arbitration procedures. \r\nIn Gilmer, the Court noted that \"the NYSE arbitration\r\nrules . . . provide protections against biased panels,\" and held\r\nthat plaintiff Gilmer had not shown actual bias.  See Gilmer, 500\r\nU.S. at 30.  The Court rejected arguments that arbitration was\r\ninappropriate for ADEA claims due to limitations on discovery and\r\nthe lack of written opinions.  See id. at 31-32.  However, Gilmeralso noted that future plaintiffs might be able to demonstrate\r\n\"procedural inadequacies . . . in specific cases.\"  Gilmer, 500\r\nU.S. at 33.\r\nThe district court found that \"Rosenberg has risen to the\r\nSupreme Court's challenge\" to demonstrate that the NYSE arbitration\r\nprocedures were inadequate to ensure fair adjudication of her\r\nclaims.  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 206.  In reaching this\r\nconclusion, however, the district court engaged in a generalized\r\ninquiry of the sort that Gilmer precludes.  In particular, the\r\ncourt found that \"the NYSE arbitration system is dominated by the\r\nsecurities industry.\"  Id. at 207.  This conclusion was based on\r\ntwo findings.  First, the district court found that Merrill Lynch\r\nwas a member firm of the NYSE, and that the NYSE's member firms\r\n\"'govern' the [NYSE] as part of [its] self-regulating scheme.\"  Id. \r\nThe district court explicitly found that there was no\r\nconclusive evidence of bias, either in the manner in which NYSE\r\narbitrations are conducted or in the makeup of the arbitration\r\npanels.  Limited evidence presented in this case suggests that, if\r\nanything, women are more likely to win awards in discrimination\r\nclaims brought through arbitration than they are in claims brought\r\nin court.  Evidence submitted in this case also shows that in most\r\ndiscrimination cases brought under the NYSE's arbitration\r\nprocedures, at least one of the arbitrators is a woman.  The NYSE\r\nhas taken a number of steps since the decision in Gilmer --\r\nincluding training arbitrators in employment law and expanding its\r\npool of arbitrators -- to make the system fairer than that which\r\nthe Gilmer Court endorsed.\r\nSecond, the court found that \"[f]rom the rules that\r\ngovern arbitral procedure, through the selection of the\r\narbitrators, to the details of discovery practice, the system is\r\ndominated by the NYSE itself.\"  Id. at 210.  For instance, \"the\r\nChairman of the Board [of the NYSE] recommends and appoints the\r\narbitration pools from which individual arbitrators are chosen,\r\nincluding the pool of non-securities industry 'public'\r\narbitrators,\" and the NYSE's Director of Arbitration selects \"the\r\nentire initial panel and any replacements.\"  Id.  The district\r\ncourt concluded that \"[d]ominance of an arbitral system by one side\r\nin the dispute does not comport with any model of arbitral\r\nimpartiality,\" regardless of the \"competence or fairness of\r\nindividual arbitrators who participate [in] the NYSE system.\"  Id.at 211.\r\nThe district court misinterpreted certain facts regarding\r\nthe structure of the NYSE's arbitration system.  In particular, the\r\ncourt mischaracterized both Merrill Lynch's role in the NYSE and\r\nNYSE arbitration procedures.  The district court stated that the\r\nmajority of NYSE board members were \"industry representatives.\"  Id.at 207 n.22.  However, representatives of the securities industry\r\nactually occupy a minority of seats on the NYSE's board.  In\r\naddition, the NYSE is subject to regulation by the SEC, and such\r\nregulation includes the NYSE's arbitration procedures.  The Supreme\r\nCourt noted this in Shearson/American Express, Inc. when it\r\ncommented that the SEC possesses \"expansive power to ensure the\r\nadequacy of the arbitration procedures employed by\" self-regulating\r\norganizations such as the NYSE.  Shearson/American Express, Inc.,\r\n482 U.S. at 233.  Rather than being controlled by the securities\r\nindustry, the NYSE plays a significant role in monitoring and\r\ndisciplining exchange members for non-compliance with its rules.\r\nThe district court also erred in its description of\r\nspecific arbitration procedures, including its description of the\r\npool of potential arbitrators, and in equating the NYSE's\r\nappointment of arbitrators with appointment of arbitrators by a\r\ntrade association.  For example, arbitrators come from a range of\r\norganizations and backgrounds.  In disputes between NYSE members\r\nand non-members, including employment discrimination disputes, \"a\r\nmajority of [the arbitrators] shall not be from the securities\r\nindustry, unless the . . . non-member requests a panel consisting\r\nof at least a majority from the securities industry.\"  NYSE R. 607. \r\nAdditionally, NYSE Rules include a detailed provision prohibiting\r\npersons with industry links from serving as public arbitrators. \r\nSee Guidelines for Classification of Arbitrators, in New York Stock\r\nExchange Dep't of Arbitration, Arbitration Rules 33, 33 (Sept.\r\n1995).  Parties to NYSE arbitrations may exercise one peremptory\r\nchallenge or unlimited challenges for cause against arbitrators. \r\nAs Gilmer noted, the NYSE's own rules protect against biased\r\npanels.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 30.  Panel members are required to\r\ndisclose any possible conflicts of interest, and the system is\r\ndesigned to ensure that no Merrill Lynch employee could serve as an\r\narbitrator in an employment dispute brought against the company. \r\nSee NYSE R. 610. \r\nThe district court commented that the NYSE \"provision for\r\none peremptory challenge and unlimited challenges for cause . . .\r\ncannot correct the fundamental imbalance in a system in which the\r\nentire initial panel and any replacements are appointed by the\r\nDirector of Arbitration.\"  Rosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 210. \r\nHowever, the Director of Arbitration serves the NYSE, not the\r\nsecurities industry.\r\nRosenberg's supporting amici argue that the NYSE's\r\narbitration procedures are inadequate for Title VII claims because\r\narbitrators often refuse to award statutory attorneys' fees and\r\nbecause plaintiffs are charged forum fees, which may be as high as\r\n$3,000 per day and tens of thousands of dollars per case.  Amici\r\nrely on Cole, in which the court held that arbitration agreements\r\nrequiring plaintiffs to pay forum fees in order to vindicate\r\nstatutory rights are impermissible.  See Cole, 105 F.3d at 1484-85. \r\nThere are three responses.  First, that arbitrators may\r\nsometimes do undesirable things in individual cases does not mean\r\nthe arbitral system is structurally inadequate.  Nothing in the\r\nchoice of arbitration mandates these outcomes, nor are such\r\noutcomes necessary concomitants of the NYSE arbitral system.  The\r\nNYSE rules do not limit available relief.  Rule 627 provides that\r\narbitrators may award \"damages and/or other relief.\"  NYSE R.\r\n627(e); see also Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 32.  \r\nThe second is that it does not appear to be the usual\r\nsituation that a plaintiff is asked to bear forum fees.  Amici in\r\nsupport of Rosenberg cite arbitration decisions in which plaintiffs\r\nhave been required to pay costs.  Merrill Lynch replies that the\r\nrecord does not support this claim: in the thirty-three arbitration\r\ncases Rosenberg placed in the record, only one plaintiff who\r\nprevailed on statutory grounds was denied fees and costs.  NYSE\r\narbitrators possess discretion to award costs and fees when they\r\ndecide a dispute.  Cf. Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 32 (stating that \"the\r\nNYSE rules applicable here do not restrict the types of relief an\r\narbitrator may award\"); Uniform Code of Arbitration  30, inSecurities Industry Conference on Arbitration Report #9, at 7, 22-\r\n24 (June 1996); Securities Indus. Conference on Arbitration, The\r\nArbitrator's Manual 29 (Oct. 1996) (stating that \"[g]enerally,\r\nparties to an arbitration are responsible for their personal costs\r\nassociated with bringing or defending an arbitration action,\" but\r\nnoting that exceptions exist, including where there is a statutory\r\nbasis for attorneys' fees); id. at 30 (stating that although forum\r\nfees are required, they may be waived); see also Kuehner v.\r\nDickinson &amp; Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718368\"><a href=\"/opinion/718368/kay-v-kuehner-v-dickinson-company-an-iowa-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (9th Cir. 1996) (stating that\r\nsecurities arbitrators \"have the full power to provide the legal\r\nand equitable remedies available\" under statutes).  Indeed, in Colethe D.C. Circuit enforced an arbitration agreement in part because\"under NYSE rules and NASD rules, it is standard practice in the\r\nsecurities industry for employers to pay all of the arbitrators'\r\nfees. . . . [I]n Gilmer, the Supreme Court endorsed a system of\r\narbitration in which employees are not required to pay for the\r\narbitrator assigned to hear their statutory claims.\"  Cole, 105\r\nF.3d at 1483-84.\r\nThird, if unreasonable fees were to be imposed on a\r\nparticular employee, the  argument that this was inconsistent with\r\nthe 1991 CRA could be presented by the employee to the reviewing\r\ncourt.  Cf. Cole, 105 F.3d at 1485.  That issue is not presented by\r\nthis case.  As Gilmer said, \"'although judicial scrutiny of\r\narbitration awards necessarily is limited, such review is\r\nsufficient to ensure that arbitrators comply with the requirements\r\nof the statute' at issue.\"  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 32 n.4 (quoting\r\nShearson/American Express, Inc., 482 U.S. at 232).\r\nContrary to Rosenberg's arguments, arbitration is often\r\nfar more affordable to plaintiffs and defendants alike than is\r\npursuing a claim in court.  Cf. Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 31 (noting that\r\nalthough arbitration discovery \"procedures might not be as\r\nextensive as in the federal courts, by agreeing to arbitrate, a\r\nparty 'trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the\r\ncourtroom for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of\r\narbitration'\" (quoting Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628)).\r\nGilmer does not mandate enforcement of all arbitration\r\nagreements.  Plaintiffs are not required to take their claims to\r\nbiased panels or through biased procedures.  But the evidence here\r\nestablishes no basis to invalidate the NYSE arbitral scheme. \r\n                           IV\r\nThe district court did not reach Rosenberg's arguments\r\nthat her particular U-4 Form arbitration clause was unenforceable\r\nbecause the contract was an unconscionable adhesion contract, or\r\nbecause her signing of the agreement was not knowing and voluntary\r\nor otherwise not within the scope of Congress's intention.  SeeRosenberg, 995 F. Supp. at 212.  Rosenberg renews these arguments\r\non appeal.  The parties agree that all material facts are before\r\nthis court and that we should resolve the issue if we reach it. \r\nThis court possesses the discretion to resolve these issues, as the\r\nparties have had a full opportunity to present their arguments to\r\nthe district court.  See New Hampshire Motor Transp. Ass'n v.\r\nFlynn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445647\"><a href=\"/opinion/445647/new-hampshire-motor-transport-association-v-richard-m-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (1st Cir. 1984).  We reject Rosenberg's\r\nargument that the U-4 Form was an unconscionable contract of\r\nadhesion.  However, on the specific facts presented and under the\r\nlanguage of the 1991 CRA, we hold that Rosenberg cannot be\r\ncompelled to arbitrate her employment discrimination claims against\r\nMerrill Lynch.  Our resolution of this case has no bearing\r\nwhatsoever on the enforceability of agreements to arbitrate\r\nconsumer disputes.  In addition, nothing in this opinion concerns\r\nthe enforceability of provisions of the U-4 Form or the NYSE Rules\r\nnot related to the arbitration of employment discrimination\r\ndisputes.\r\nA.   Was Rosenberg's Agreement to Arbitrate Invalid\r\n     Because It Was An Unconscionable Contract of\r\n     Adhesion?\r\n\nRosenberg and amici argue that the arbitration agreement\r\nshould not be enforced because it is unconscionable and because it\r\nis the result of a gross disparity of bargaining power.  We reject\r\nthese arguments, which are not frivolous, because the law has long\r\nimposed a heavy burden on those who make such arguments and\r\nRosenberg has not met her burden of proof.\r\nThe district court found that signing the U-4 Form was a\r\nprerequisite for employment as a securities broker, and Merrill\r\nLynch has acknowledged that it would not \"employ or promote\r\nfinancial consultants who refuse to sign the Form U-4.\"  Securities\r\nindustry officials similarly confirmed that financial consultants\r\nwere not permitted to excise the arbitration clause from the U-4\r\nForm.  Rosenberg argues that the imposition of such a requirement\r\nrenders the U-4 Form arbitration clause invalid as an unenforceable\r\ncontract of adhesion. \r\nWe agree with the Third Circuit that the U-4 Form\r\narbitration clause is not unenforceable on these grounds.  SeeSeus, 146 F.3d at 184.  In Seus, the court found that even if the\r\nU-4 Form arbitration agreement were a contract of adhesion\r\nplaintiff would still need to show \"both a lack of meaningful\r\nchoice about whether to accept the provision in question, and that\r\nthe disputed provisions were so onesided as to be oppressive.\"  Id.(quoting Stebok v. American Gen. Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 715 F.\r\nSupp. 711, 714 (W.D.

And section 211 of the\r\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts states that a term in a\r\nstandardized agreement is enforceable unless one party \"has reason\r\nto believe that the party manifesting . . . assent would not do so\r\nif he knew that the writing contained a particular term.\" \r\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts  211 (1979); see also Waters v.\r\nMin Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233 (Mass. 1992) (\"Unconscionability must\r\nbe determined on a case-by-case basis, with particular attention to\r\nwhether the challenged provision could result in oppression and\r\nunfair surprise to the disadvantaged party and not to allocation of\r\nrisk because of 'superior bargaining power.'\"  (quoting Zapatha v.\r\nDairy Mart, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1375 (Mass. 1980))).  Rosenberg\r\nhas made no such showing.\r\nIn addition, in Gilmer, the Court stated that inequality\r\nin bargaining power \"is not a sufficient reason to hold that\r\narbitration agreements are never enforceable in the employment\r\ncontext.\"  Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 33.  Gilmer, after all, involved the\r\nsame U-4 Form arbitration clause at issue here.  Absent a showing\r\nof fraud or oppressive conduct -- which Rosenberg does not allege\r\noccurred -- the contract is not unenforceable on these grounds. \r\nB.   Was Rosenberg's Agreement to Arbitrate\r\n     Appropriate and Authorized By Law Within the\r\n     Meaning of the 1991 CRA?\r\nWe repeat what Rosenberg's U-4 Form said and did not say. \r\nThe U-4 Form stated that Rosenberg agreed to arbitrate \"any\r\ndispute, claim or controversy that may arise . . . that is required\r\nto be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of the\r\norganizations indicated in Item 10\" (emphasis added).  The\r\nagreement did not state that Rosenberg agreed to arbitrate alldisputes, or even any dispute.  The agreement only required\r\nRosenberg to arbitrate any dispute that the NYSE's rules,\r\nconstitution, or bylaws (or those of any of the organizations\r\nlisted in item 10) required to be arbitrated.  Cf. Prudential Ins.\r\nCo. of America v. Lai, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684420\"><a href=\"/opinion/684420/the-prudential-insurance-co-of-america-a-new-jersey-corporation-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1302 (9th Cir. 1994) (noting\r\nthat the U-4 Form arbitration provision \"does not in and of itself\r\nbind appellants to arbitrate any particular dispute\").  It is\r\nundisputed that Rosenberg's execution of this provision was a\r\ncondition of her employment with Merrill Lynch.\r\nThe NYSE Rules in turn required Rosenberg to arbitrate\r\n\"[a]ny controversy . . . arising out of [her] employment or\r\ntermination of [her] employment.\"  NYSE R. 347.  Merrill Lynch does\r\nnot dispute Rosenberg's statement that she never received a copy of\r\nthe NYSE rules and has provided no evidence that it gave her a copy\r\nor made one available to Rosenberg at the time of the employment,\r\nat the time of NYSE approval, or even later.  Nor has Merrill Lynch\r\nprovided evidence it even told Rosenberg that the clause required\r\nher to arbitrate any employment discrimination claims.  Had the U-4\r\nprovided for arbitration of all disputes, or given explicit notice\r\nthat employment disputes were subject to arbitration, we would have\r\nhad little difficulty in finding that Rosenberg had agreed to\r\narbitrate her employment discrimination claims within the meaning\r\nof the 1991 CRA.\r\nFor purposes of the 1991 CRA, the parties and the\r\ndistrict court have adopted the analytical rubric of whether the\r\nagreement was \"knowing and voluntary\" to examine the agreement. \r\nThis usage is common, see, e.g., Bercovitch, 133 F.3d at 151\r\n(dicta), and stems from a footnote in Gardner-Denver:\r\nIn determining the effectiveness of any such waiver, a\r\ncourt would have to determine at the outset that the\r\nemployee's consent . . . was voluntary and knowing.\r\n\nGardner-Denver, 415 U.S. at 52 n.15.\r\n\nThe \"knowing and voluntary\" language undoubtedly comes\r\nfrom thinking of arbitration as \"a waiver of judicial remedies.\"\r\nMitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628 (emphasis added).  It is commonplace\r\nthat waivers of certain rights, particularly substantive rights,\r\nare enforceable only if they are knowing and voluntary.  Whether a\r\nstandard similar to the one that applies to rights such as the\r\nright to counsel, cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 465 (1938),\r\nshould apply to waivers of a judicial forum is an open question.\r\nAs the Seventh Circuit has noted, if this \"knowing and\r\nvoluntary\" standard is meant to add another layer of protection for\r\nthe employee, then it is \"[l]ess clear . . . whether the right to\r\nhave one's federal claims determined judicially rather than in an\r\narbitration proceeding qualifies for this added protection.\" \r\nGibson, 121 F.3d at 1129.  On this issue of whether there is a\r\nheightened level of protection the circuits are split.  The Supreme\r\nCourt has not directly decided the issue.\r\nThe Ninth Circuit has expressly adopted a \"knowing\"\r\nstandard for such arbitration clauses and has described the\r\nstandard as being a heightened one.  See Renteria v. Prudential\r\nIns. Co. of America, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740591\"><a href=\"/opinion/740591/rachel-renteria-v-prudential-insurance-company-of-america-gary-westerman/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1105-06 (9th Cir. 1997); Lai,\r\n42 F.3d at 1305.  The Third Circuit has rejected any heightened\r\nstandard.  See Seus, 146 F.3d at 183-84 &amp; n.2.  The Eighth Circuit\r\nappears to have done the same in Patterson.  See Patterson, 113\r\nF.3d at 838.  The Seventh Circuit recognized the issue in Gibson,\r\nbut found it unnecessary to resolve it.  Gibson, 121 F.3d at 1130. \r\nWe also find it unnecessary to resolve this general\r\nissue.  Rather, we focus on the language of the 1991 CRA, in which\r\nthe terms \"knowing and voluntary\" do not appear.  The operative\r\nlanguage is:\r\n[w]here appropriate and to the extent authorized by law,\r\n. . . arbitration . . . is encouraged to resolve disputes\r\narising under [these laws].\r\n\n1991 CRA  118, 105 Stat. at 1081.  There has been little case law\r\non the meaning of these terms.\r\nAt a minimum the words \"to the extent authorized by law\"\r\nmust mean that arbitration agreements that are unenforceable under\r\nthe FAA are also unenforceable when applied to claims under Title\r\nVII and the ADEA.  Under the FAA, arbitration agreements are\r\nenforceable \"save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity\r\nfor the revocation of any contract.\"  9 U.S.C.  2.  In Mitsubishi,\r\nthe Court gave an example of the sorts of agreements which are\r\nunenforceable under the FAA:\r\nOf course, courts should remain attuned to well-supported\r\nclaims that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from the\r\nsort of fraud or overwhelming economic power that would\r\nprovide grounds \"for the revocation of any contract.\"\r\n\nMitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 627 (quoting 9 U.S.C.  2).  The question\r\nunder the FAA of whether an arbitration agreement is enforceable is\r\ngenerally determined by reference to common-law principles of\r\ngeneral applicability.  See Perry v. Thomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111920\"><a href=\"/opinion/111920/perry-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 n.9\r\n(1987); Southland Corp. v.

When\r\ndeciding whether the parties agreed under the FAA to arbitrate a\r\ncertain matter, courts \"generally . . . should apply ordinary\r\nstate-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.\" \r\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v.

See Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v.\r\nMercury Constr. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1983).  There is often, as\r\nhere, a predecessor question of whether there was an agreement at\r\nall to arbitrate.  See MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Exalon Indus., Inc.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752112\"><a href=\"/opinion/752112/mci-telecommunications-corp-v-exalon-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428-29 (1st Cir. 1998).  Reference should be made to\r\nstandard principles of contract law in making such a determination. \r\nSee id. at 429-30.  We need not resolve here whether the \"to the\r\nextent authorized by law\" clause has a meaning greater than a\r\nreference to the FAA.\r\nWhile such principles provide background, the resolution\r\nof the case does not turn on them but on the language of the 1991\r\nCRA; that is, whether under these facts, the arbitration clause was\r\n\"appropriate.\"  Thus, this case does not implicate any broader\r\nquestions of enforceability of the arbitration clause when the 1991\r\nCRA or ADEA are not involved.\r\nWe set the context.  Rosenberg's and Merrill Lynch's\r\narbitration agreement did not by itself define the range of claims\r\nsubject to arbitration, even though Merrill Lynch expressly\r\nrepresented that she would be advised of the rules.  It referred\r\nonly to arbitration of such claims as were required to be\r\narbitrated by the NYSE rules.  But those rules were not given to\r\nRosenberg or described to her.  The question then becomes which\r\nparty should bear the risk of her ignorance.  Given Congress's\r\nconcern that agreements to arbitrate employment discrimination\r\nclaims should be enforced only where \"appropriate,\" a concern not\r\nexpressed in the FAA or at common law, Merrill Lynch should, we\r\nbelieve, bear that risk.\r\nAs part of its employment agreement with Rosenberg,\r\nMerrill Lynch required her to agree to the terms of the U-4 Form. \r\nThe U-4 Form, prepared under the NYSE Rules, requires that\r\nemployees being asked to execute the U-4 Form be given a copy of\r\nthe NYSE rules or information to the same effect, at least by the\r\ntime of approval.  The U-4 Form thus explicitly contemplated that\r\nMerrill Lynch would take the steps necessary to ensure that\r\nRosenberg was aware of the NYSE rules.  The same U-4 Form that\r\nRosenberg signed to register with the NYSE was also signed by John\r\nWyllys on behalf of Merrill Lynch.  Under the heading, \"THE FIRM\r\nMUST COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING,\" the U-4 Form stated:\r\nTo the best of my knowledge and belief, the applicant is\r\ncurrently bonded where required, and, at the time of\r\napproval, will be familiar with the statute(s),\r\nconstitutions(s), rules and by-laws of the agency,\r\njurisdiction or self-regulatory organization with which\r\nthis application is being filed, and the rules governing\r\nregistered persons, and will be fully qualified for the\r\nposition for which application is being made herein.\r\n\nWyllys' signature follows this statement.  But Wyllys'\r\ncertification was false: Merrill Lynch never provided Rosenberg\r\nwith a copy of the rules and Merrill Lynch has provided no\r\nevidence it made Rosenberg familiar with the rules as to\r\narbitration.  Merrill Lynch's failure runs afoul of the mutual\r\nunderstandings.  Since the arbitration requirement stems from the\r\nNYSE Rules and the U-4 Form requires that the employee be\r\n\"familiar with\" the rules and thus with the requirement for\r\narbitration of employment claims, we think that Merrill Lynch's\r\ninaction undercuts the imposition of an arbitration requirement. \r\nSee Dickstein v. duPont, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"297078\"><a href=\"/opinion/297078/merritt-dickstein-v-edmond-dupont-as-they-are-partners-of-francis-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 784 (1st Cir. 1971)\r\n(stating that the predecessor to the U-4 Form \"was an integral and\r\nmutually binding part of [the] employment arrangement\" between an\r\nemployee and a NYSE brokerage house).  The NYSE rules contemplated\r\nthat Merrill Lynch certify to it that, at least as of the time of\r\nNYSE approval of Rosenberg's application, Rosenberg be \"familiar\"\r\nwith the rules including the rules that all employment disputes\r\nbe arbitrated.  Merrill Lynch's failure, we believe, makes it\r\ninappropriate to enforce the provision.\r\nThis holding is in accordance with Ramirez-De-Arellanov.

Our\r\napproach is close to that taken by the Supreme Court in Wright. \r\nThere the court declined to mandate arbitration of an ADA claim\r\nwhere the waiver of a judicial forum set forth in a CBA was not\r\n\"clear and unmistakable.\"  Wright, 119 S. Ct. at 396-97.  To be\r\nsure, Wright carefully distinguished a private arbitration\r\nagreement from an agreement in the collective bargaining context. \r\nSee id. at 397 n.2.  There are sound reasons to recognize such a\r\ndistinction and a lesser standard than \"clear and unmistakable\"\r\napplies to private agreements.  See id. at 396.  But Wright also\r\nteaches that the \"appropriate\" language of the 1991 CRA, which\r\nparallels that of the ADA, has some teeth:\r\nOur conclusion that a union waiver of employee rights\r\nto a federal judicial forum for employment\r\ndiscrimination claims must be clear and unmistakable\r\nmeans that, absent a clear waiver, it is not\r\n'appropriate' . . . to find an agreement to arbitrate.\r\n\nId. at 397 n.2.  In recognizing that \"the right to a federal\r\njudicial forum is of sufficient importance to be protected,\" id.at 396, Wright leads to the conclusion, we think, that there be\r\nsome minimal level of notice to the employee that statutory claims\r\nare subject to arbitration.\r\n                           V\r\nThis case requires applying the Supreme Court's holding\r\nin Gilmer to Title VII as amended by the 1991 CRA and the ADEA as\r\namended by the OWBPA.  This case does not involve evaluation of\r\nthe policies in favor of and against litigation as opposed to\r\narbitration.  We hold that there was no congressional intent to\r\npreclude pre-dispute arbitration agreements manifested in the 1991\r\nCRA or the OWBPA.  We also hold that the evidence does not support\r\na finding that there is \"structural bias\" or that the NYSE arbitral\r\nrules create \"procedural inadequacies\" sufficient to be an\r\nexception to Gilmer.  Our holding here that Rosenberg cannot be\r\ncompelled to arbitrate her claims is limited.  As stated above,\r\nhad Merrill Lynch taken the modest effort required to make\r\nrelevant information regarding the arbitrability of employment\r\ndisputes available to Rosenberg as it committed itself to do, it\r\nwould have been able to compel Rosenberg to arbitration.  This\r\ncase does not concern the enforceability of Form U-4 arbitration\r\nagreements with customers.  Nor does it concern the enforceability\r\nof employment disputes where the claims involved are not\r\nemployment discrimination claims under the federal civil rights\r\nlaws.\r\nAffirmed.

I concur entirely with Judge Lynch's\r\nexcellent analysis of the issues in this case and in her opinion\r\non those issues set out in Parts I, II and III, which reverse the\r\ndecision of the district court.  Furthermore, I concur in Part IVA\r\nof Judge Lynch's analysis concerning whether the contract involved\r\nwas an unenforceable, \"unconscionable adhesion contract.\" \r\nRosenberg's agreement to arbitrate was not invalid, and this case\r\nis not moot.\r\nIn general, I concur with the conclusion that Gilmer v.\r\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112584\"><a href=\"/opinion/112584/gilmer-v-interstatejohnson-lane-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), is still good\r\nlaw and applies to the issues in this controversy.

I would, in short, like\r\nJudge Lynch, reject the reasoning of the district court in this\r\ncase.\r\nI write separately, however, in respectful disagreement\r\nwith the conclusions in Part IVB.  The analysis concerning non-\r\nenforcement of the parties' agreement, because not \"appropriate\r\nand authorized by law\" under CRA, is my point of departure in this\r\ndifficult case.\r\nThere are a number of facts that cut against the result\r\nreached by Judge Lynch's opinion.  First, the district court found\r\nRosenberg to be a mature, well-educated businesswoman when she\r\nbegan her career as a financial consultant with Merrill Lynch. \r\nSecond, discovery in this case was not even completed before\r\ndefendant moved to compel arbitration under the U-4 agreement and\r\napplicable exchange/securities rules.  Third, in denying the\r\nmotion, the district court found that Rosenberg signed the\r\nagreement, but allegedly did not receive any applicable exchange\r\nrules.  She asserted that she was not advised of, and was ignorant\r\nabout, the arbitration documents.  The district court, however,\r\nmakes no reference to Merrill Lynch's position vis-a-visfurnishing advice, documentation, or information to Rosenberg at\r\nor before--or after--Rosenberg signed the agreement to arbitrate. \r\nJudge Lynch notes that Merrill Lynch \"does not dispute\" that\r\nRosenberg was not given a copy of applicable rules of any\r\norganization referred to in Item 10 of U-4, but I do not conclude\r\nfrom the available record that Merrill Lynch concedes that a copy\r\nof the rules was not available to her at all pertinent times upon\r\nrequest.  Nowhere in the record do I find a contention that\r\nRosenberg asked about such rules or sought advice or information\r\nfrom Merrill Lynch about the meaning and effect of the U-4\r\nagreement which she signed.  We do not know what, if anything,\r\nMerrill Lynch's representatives did, said or furnished Rosenberg\r\nin connection with the arbitration agreement, and/or in response\r\nto any inquiry or actions of Rosenberg regarding the said\r\nagreement.\r\nI would find the arbitration clause in question not to\r\nbe \"inappropriate\" as to the issues in this case.  Congress, in\r\nusing the expression \"[w]here [arbitration is] appropriate\" may\r\nwell have intended some threshold determination that the type of\r\nemployee-employer dispute be amenable to resolution by\r\narbitration.  The Supreme Court in Wright v. Universal Maritime\r\nServ. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), interpreted the \"[w]here\r\nappropriate and to the extent authorized by law\" language of the\r\nCivil Rights Act as a single unit in deciding that a collective\r\nbargaining agreement negotiated by a union would not be enforced\r\nagainst an affected employee under the circumstances of that case. \r\nThat situation was different from the private employee-employer\r\nagreement here involved.  Wright limited its holding to the\r\ncontext where a labor union waived a member's federal statutory\r\nrights.\r\nThe form signed by Rosenberg indicated an agreement to\r\narbitrate and directed her to read the agreement carefully with\r\nspecific reference to New York Stock Exchange Rules.  Under all\r\nthe circumstances, I would be inclined to remand to the district\r\ncourt to develop fully the facts as to whether Rosenberg was\r\nafforded a reasonable opportunity to appreciate the arbitration\r\nimplications of her employment agreement.  Did she have an\r\nopportunity to be familiar, or did she have a duty to familiarize\r\nherself, with the arbitration undertaking?\r\nI do not consider Ramirez-De-Arellano v. American\r\nAirlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197707\"><a href=\"/opinion/197707/ramirez-de-arellano-v-american-airlines/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1997), to support the\r\nmajority view.  Ramirez was an action \"brought primarily under the\r\nFair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and Puerto Rico law.\"  Id. at 89. \r\nIt did not involve a civil rights claim, and the court upheld\r\nsummary judgment for defendant in the discharge of plaintiff.  The\r\nRamirez court simply held that plaintiff could pursue his action\r\nin federal court because of the court's dissatisfaction with\r\naspects of American Airlines' arbitration procedures not akin to\r\nthose involved in the instant dispute.\r\nMore important, however, is my disagreement with Judge\r\nLynch's conclusion in part IVB that arbitration would not be\r\n\"appropriate\" because, as plaintiff avers, Merrill Lynch did not\r\nfurnish Rosenberg with a copy of the pertinent rules, and because\r\nMerrill Lynch falsely certified that Rosenberg was \"familiar with\"\r\nthe rules. \r\nI am reluctant to join a finding that Merrill Lynch,\r\nand/or its representative, John Wyllys, falsely certified\r\nRosenberg's qualifications, fitness, and knowledge as a financial\r\nrepresentative and her familiarity with the rules.  Even assuming,\r\nhowever, that the certification was incorrect, I disagree with the\r\nconclusion reached in Part IVB. \r\nUnlike Judge Lynch, I would hold that Rosenberg was\r\npresumed to understand, and to be bound by, the plain terms of her\r\nU-4 agreement even if she were not furnished copies of the\r\nexchange rules at the time of signing.  I believe the agreement\r\nwas broad and plain and that it put Rosenberg on notice that she\r\nagreed to arbitrate at the outset \"any dispute, claim or\r\ncontroversy\" with Merrill Lynch under exchange rules.  If she\r\n\"did not make herself aware of the existence or scope of [the\r\narbitration] clause [in the U-4 agreement], she did so at her own\r\nperil.\"  Beauchamp v. Great West Life Ins.
