Debtor-appellant  Jose  Raul  Perez\r                                 \r\n\nappeals  pro  se  from  a  decision  of  the  district  court\r                            \r\n\naffirming the  dismissal of  his third Chapter  13 bankruptcy\r\n\ncase and a related adversary proceeding.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Under 11 U.S.C.   109(g)(1), no individual may be a\r\n\n\"debtor\" if he or she has  been a debtor in the preceding 180\r\n\ndays and the previous case was dismissed for \"willful failure\r\n\n. .  . to abide by  orders of the court, or  to appear before\r\n\nthe court in proper prosecution of the case.\"  Perez's second\r\n\nbankruptcy case was dismissed based upon  his failure to file\r\n\na  plan  or  schedules,  failure  to  appear  at  the     341\r\n\ncreditors' meeting, and failure to  make payments.  The third\r\n\nbankruptcy  petition  was  filed   within  180  days  of  the\r\n\ndismissal of  the second.   Relying on these  facts, creditor\r\n\nFajardo  Federal  Savings Bank  argued before  the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt that Perez was ineligible for bankruptcy relief under  \r\n\n109(g)(1).   The bankruptcy  judge agreed, finding  a willful\r\n\nfailure to abide by orders of the court and to prosecute.\r\n\n          Perez argues that it was error to dismiss his third\r\n\ncase pursuant to   109(g)(1) because the bankruptcy court, in\r\n\nits order  dismissing the  second case, did  not specifically\r\n\nfind a \"willful\"  failure.  He also contends that  he was not\r\n\nput on notice that  willfulness would be an issue.   Finally,\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nhe argues that  the evidence  does not support  a finding  of\r\n\nwillfulness.\r\n\n          Contrary to Perez's suggestion, no specific finding\r\n\nof \"willfulness\"  was necessary  in the order  dismissing the\r\n\nsecond petition.  A finding of willfulness may be made at the\r\n\ntime  of a  dismissal.   However, it  can also  be made  in a\r\n\nsubsequent case  when the  bankruptcy court  is called up  to\r\n\ndetermine  if  the  earlier  dismissal   renders  the  debtor\r\n\nineligible under    109(g) to proceed in the subsequent case.\r\n\nSee Montgomery v. Ryan  (In re Montgomery), 37 F.3d  413, 415\r                                                     \r\n\n(8th  Cir. 1994);  In re  Robinson, 198  B.R. 1017,  1023 n.8\r                                              \r\n\n(Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1996).  \r\n\n          We  think  that  Fajardo Federal's  citation  to   \r\n\n109(g)  put Perez  on  notice that  willfulness  would be  an\r\n\nissue.    Moreover,  Perez's  opposition  to  the  motion  to\r\n\ndismiss--in  which he argued that  \"the previous case was not\r\n\ndismissed for  willful failure\"--makes  it plain that  he was\r                                  \r\n\naware it was a key issue.\r\n\n          Finally,  based  on  the  record  before  him,  the\r\n\nbankruptcy judge did not  clearly err in finding willfulness.\r\n\nThere was a pattern  of failure to abide by  court orders, as\r\n\nwell  as of failure to  prosecute.1  Moreover,  Perez did not\r                                              1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Perez's  first  bankruptcy  case was  dismissed  after he\r               1\r\nfailed to  file a plan  and failed  to show up  at the    341\r\ncreditors' meeting.  The second case was dismissed based upon\r\nPerez's failure  to  file a  plan  or schedules,  failure  to\r\nappear at the    341 creditors' meeting, and failure  to make\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nintroduce   any   evidence  on   the   point.     Under   the\r\n\ncircumstances, an  inference  of willfulness  was  justified.\r\n\nSee, e.g., In re Herrera, 194 B.R. 178, 189 (Bankr. N.D. Ill.\r                                    \r\n\n1996)  (inferring  willful  conduct  based on  a  pattern  of\r\n\nrepeated failures).\r\n\n          Since the  dismissal of  the third  bankruptcy case\r\n\nwas proper  under     109(g)(1), we  need  not  consider  the\r\n\nalternative bases given for dismissal.  Perez has waived, for\r\n\nfailure  to raise the issue  in his brief,  any argument that\r\n\nthe  dismissal  of the  adversary  proceeding  was in  error.\r\n\nFinally,  since it is not material to any decision before us,\r\n\nwe need  not consider whether  the bankruptcy judge  erred in\r\n\nmaking certain  findings in connection with a  motion to stay\r\n\npending appeal.\r\n\n          Affirmed.2\r                               2\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\npayments.  In  his third case, Perez filed his  plan late and\r\nfailed to file a statement of affairs or schedules.\r\n\n   2The motion  of appellee  Juan R.
