Background\n\n      Explorica was formed in 2000 to compete in the field of\n\nglobal tours for high school students. Several of Explorica's\n\nemployees formerly were employed by appellee EF, which has been\n\nin   business   for    more   than   thirty-five     years.     EF   and   its\n\npartners and subsidiaries make up the world's largest private\n\nstudent travel organization.\n\n      Shortly after the individual defendants left EF in the\n\nbeginning of 2000, Explorica began competing in the teenage tour\n\nmarket. The company's vice president (and former vice president\n\n\n      1 The individual defendants-appellants are Olle Olsson,\nPeter Nilsson, Philip Gormley, Alexandra Bernadotte, Anders\nErikkson, Deborah Johnson, and Stefan Nilsson.    They are all\nformer employees of plaintiffs-appellees, EF Cultural Tours BV,\nEF Institute for Cultural Exchange, Inc. (\"EFICE\"), EF Cultural\nServices BV, and Go Ahead Vacations, Inc.    The appellees are\ncollectively referred to as \"EF.\"\n     The injunction was also issued against a second company,\nZefer Corporation (\"Zefer\"), which also appealed.         After\nbriefing was completed, Zefer filed for bankruptcy. We granted\na joint motion to sever Zefer's appeal, which has been stayed.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fof information strategy at EF), Philip Gormley, envisioned that\n\nExplorica could gain a substantial advantage over all other\n\nstudent tour companies, and especially EF, by undercutting EF's\n\nalready competitive prices on student tours.            Gormley considered\n\nseveral ways to obtain and utilize EF's prices: by manually\n\nkeying in the information from EF's brochures and other printed\n\nmaterials; by using a scanner to record that same information;\n\nor, by manually searching for each tour offered through EF's\n\nwebsite.       Ultimately,       however,     Gormley     engaged   Zefer,\n\nExplorica's Internet consultant, to design a computer program\n\ncalled a \"scraper\" to glean all of the necessary information\n\nfrom EF's website.     Zefer designed the program in three days.\n\n    The scraper has been likened to a \"robot,\" a tool that is\n\nextensively used on the Internet.           Robots are used to gather\n\ninformation    for   countless    purposes,    ranging     from   compiling\n\nresults for search engines such as Yahoo! to filtering for\n\ninappropriate content.       The widespread deployment of robots\n\nenables global Internet users to find comprehensive information\n\nquickly and almost effortlessly.\n\n    Like a robot, the scraper sought information through the\n\nInternet.     Unlike other robots, however, the scraper focused\n\nsolely on EF’s website, using information that other robots\n\nwould not have.      Specifically, Zefer utilized tour codes whose\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fsignificance was not readily understandable to the public.   With\n\nthe tour codes, the scraper accessed EF's website repeatedly and\n\neasily obtained pricing information for those specific tours.\n\nThe scraper sent more than 30,000 inquiries to EF's website and\n\nrecorded the pricing information into a spreadsheet.2\n\n    Zefer ran the scraper program twice, first to retrieve the\n\n2000 tour prices and then the 2001 prices.       All told, the\n\nscraper downloaded 60,000 lines of data, the equivalent of eight\n\n\n\n\n    2  John Hawley, one of Zefer's senior technical associates,\nexplained the technical progression of the scraper in an\naffidavit:\n\n         [a.]      Open an Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet\n                   initially contains EFTours gateway and\n                   destination city codes, which are available\n                   on the EFTours web site.\n         [b.]      Identify the first gateway and destination\n                   city codes [on the] Excel spreadsheet.\n         [c.]      Create a [website address] request for the\n                   EFTours tour prices page based on a\n                   combination of gateway and destination city.\n                   Example: show me all the prices for a London\n                   trip leaving JFK.\n         [d.]      View the requested web page which is\n                   retained in the random access memory of the\n                   requesting computer in the form of HTML\n                   [computer language] code. * * *\n         [e.]      Search the HTML for the tour prices for each\n                   season, year, etc.\n         [f.]      Store the prices into the Excel spreadsheet.\n         [g.]      Identify the next gateway and city codes in\n                   the spreadsheet.\n         [8.]      Repeat steps 3-7 for all gateway and\n                   destination city combinations.\n\n                              -5-\n\ftelephone directories of information.3   Once Zefer “scraped” all\n\nof the prices, it sent a spreadsheet containing EF’s pricing\n\ninformation to Explorica, which then systematically undercut\n\nEF's prices.4 Explorica thereafter printed its own brochures and\n\nbegan competing in EF's tour market.\n\n    The development and use of the scraper came to light about\n\na year and a half later during state-court litigation regarding\n\nappellant Olsson’s departure from appellee EFICE.   EF then filed\n\nthis action, alleging violations of the CFAA; the Copyright Act\n\nof 1976, 17 U.S.C. § 101; the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961; and various related state\n\nlaws.   It sought a preliminary injunction barring Explorica and\n\nZefer from using the scraper program and demanded the return of\n\nall materials generated through use of the scraper.\n\n    On May 30, 2001, the district court granted a preliminary\n\ninjunction against Explorica based on the CFAA, which criminally\n\nand civilly prohibits certain access to computers.        See 18\n\n\n\n    3   Appellants dispute the relevance of the size of the\nprinted data, arguing that 60,000 printed lines, while\nvoluminous on paper, is not a large amount of data for a\ncomputer to store. This is a distinction without a difference.\nThe fact is that appellants utilized the scraper program to\ndownload EF's pricing data. In June 2000, EF's website listed\n154,293 prices for various tours.\n    4   Explorica later varied its prices slightly to mask its\nacross-the-board discount of EF’s prices.\n\n                               -6-\n\fU.S.C. § 1030(a)(4).        The court found that EF would likely prove\n\nthat Explorica violated the CFAA when it used EF's website in a\n\nmanner outside the \"reasonable expectations\" of both EF and its\n\nordinary users.         The court also concluded that EF could show\n\nthat it suffered a loss, as required by the statute, consisting\n\nof reduced business, harm to its goodwill, and the cost of\n\ndiagnostic measures it incurred to evaluate possible harm to\n\nEF's       systems,   although   it   could   not   show   that   Explorica's\n\nactions physically damaged its computers.                  In a supplemental\n\nopinion5 the district court further articulated its “reasonable\n\nexpectations” standard and explained that copyright, contractual\n\nand technical restraints sufficiently notified Explorica that\n\nits use of a scraper would be unauthorized and thus would\n\nviolate the CFAA.\n\n       The district court first relied on EF’s use of a copyright\n\nsymbol on one of the pages of its website and a link directing\n\nusers with questions to contact the company,6 finding that “such\n\n\n       5 Zefer, Explorica's consultant, had objected to the\ninitial decision on the ground that it could face liability\nunder the preliminary injunction even though it had not had an\nopportunity to respond to EF's preliminary injunction motion.\nThe district court allowed all of the parties to submit\nsupplemental briefs and issued a further decision on July 2,\n2001.\n       6   The notice stated in full:\n\n              Copyright © 2000 EF Cultural Travel BV\n\n                                       -7-\n\fa clear statement should have dispelled any notion a reasonable\n\nperson    may    have    had    that      the   ‘presumption     of     open    access’\n\napplied to information on EF’s website.”                   The court next found\n\nthat the manner by which Explorica accessed EF’s website likely\n\nviolated a confidentiality agreement between appellant Gormley\n\nand EF, because Gormley provided to Zefer technical instructions\n\nconcerning the creation of the scraper.                   Finally, the district\n\ncourt    noted    without       elaboration        that   the    scraper       bypassed\n\ntechnical restrictions embedded in the website to acquire the\n\ninformation.      The court therefore let stand its earlier decision\n\ngranting the preliminary injunction.                  Appellants contend that\n\nthe district court erred in taking too narrow a view of what is\n\nauthorized under the CFAA and similarly mistook the reach of the\n\nconfidentiality         agreement.         Appellants     also    argue        that   the\n\ndistrict    court       erred    in    finding     that   appellees      suffered       a\n\n\"loss,\"    as    defined       by   the    CFAA,    and   that    the    preliminary\n\ninjunction violates the First Amendment.\n\n                           II.      Standard of Review\n\n    A district court may issue a preliminary injunction only\n\nupon considering \"(1) the likelihood of success on the merits;\n\n(2) the potential for irreparable harm if the injunction is\n\n\n            EF Educational Tours is a member of the EF group of\n            companies.\n            Questions? Please contact us.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fdenied; (3) the balance of relevant impositions . . . ; and (4)\n\nthe   effect   (if    any)   of   the    court's      ruling   on   the   public\n\ninterest.\" Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102\n\nF.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996).              Appellants challenge only the\n\ndistrict court's finding that appellees are likely to succeed on\n\nthe merits, and we thus confine our review to that factor.                    As\n\nin any other appeal, we review the merits of a preliminary\n\ninjunction     depending     on    the        issue   under    consideration.\n\n\"Generally speaking, pure issues of law (e.g., the construction\n\nof a statute) are reviewed de novo, findings of fact for clear\n\nerror, and 'judgment calls' with considerable deference. . . .\"\n\n Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    Each of these is applicable here, where the district\n\ncourt's judgment relied on both its analysis of the CFAA and its\n\nassessment of the voluminous documentary evidence.\n\n               III.    The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\n\n      Although appellees alleged violations of three provisions\n\nof the CFAA, the district court found that they were likely to\n\nsucceed only under section 1030(a)(4).7               That section provides\n\n      [Whoever] knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a\n      protected computer without authorization, or exceeds\n      authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers\n\n\n      7  Appellees have not challenged the district court's\nfinding that they were unlikely to succeed on claims brought\nunder 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030(5)(C) and(6)(A).\n\n                                        -9-\n\f       the intended fraud and obtains anything of value . . .\n       shall be punished.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4).8\n\n       Appellees allege that the appellants knowingly and with\n\nintent to defraud accessed the server hosting EF's website more\n\nthan       30,000   times    to    obtain    proprietary    pricing      and   tour\n\ninformation,        and     confidential      information      about    appellees'\n\ntechnical abilities.              At the heart of the parties' dispute is\n\nwhether appellants' actions either were \"without authorization\"\n\nor \"exceed[ed] authorized access\" as defined by the CFAA.9                       We\n\nconclude that because of the broad confidentiality agreement\n\nappellants' actions \"exceed[ed] authorized access,\" and so we do\n\nnot    reach    the   more    general       arguments   made    about   statutory\n\n\n\n\n       8\n       Although the CFAA is primarily a criminal statute, under\n§ 1030(g), \"any person who suffers damage or loss . . . may\nmaintain a civil action . . . for compensatory damages and\ninjunctive relief or other equitable relief.\"\n       9\n       At oral argument, appellants contended that they had no\n\"intent to defraud\" as defined by the CFAA. That argument was\nnot raised in the briefs and thus has been waived. See Garcia-\nAyala v. Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 645 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(failure to brief an argument constitutes waiver despite attempt\nto raise the argument at oral argument). Likewise, at oral\nargument Explorica attempted to adopt appellant Zefer's argument\nthat the preliminary injunction violates the First Amendment.\nThe lateness of Explorica's attempt renders it fruitless. See\nid.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fmeaning, including whether use of a scraper alone renders access\n\nunauthorized.10\n\n     A.    \"Exceeds authorized access\"\n\n     Congress defined \"exceeds authorized access,\" as accessing\n\n\"a computer with authorization and [using] such access to obtain\n\nor alter information in the computer that the accesser is not\n\nentitled so to obtain or alter.\"   18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(6).      EF is\n\nlikely    to   prove   such   excessive   access   based   on    the\n\nconfidentiality agreement between Gormley and EF. Pertinently,\n\nthat agreement provides:\n\n     Employee agrees to maintain in strict confidence and not to\n     disclose to any third party, either orally or in writing,\n     any Confidential or Proprietary Information . . . and never\n     to at any time (i) directly or indirectly publish,\n     disseminate or otherwise disclose, deliver or make\n     available to anybody any Confidential or Proprietary\n     Information or (ii) use such Confidential or [P]roprietary\n\n\n     10    Congress   did  not   define   the  phrase   \"without\nauthorization,\" perhaps assuming that the words speak for\nthemselves.   The meaning, however, has proven to be elusive.\nThe district court applied what it termed the \"default rule\"\nthat conduct is without authorization only if it is not \"in line\nwith the reasonable expectations\" of the website owner and its\nusers.    Appellants argue that this is an overly broad reading\nthat restricts access and is at odds with the Internet's\nintended purpose of providing the \"open and free exchange of\ninformation.\"    They urge us to adopt instead the Second\nCircuit's reasoning that computer use is \"without authorization\"\nonly if the use is not \"in any way related to [its] intended\nfunction,\" United States v. Morris, 928 F.2d 504, 510 (2d Cir.\n1991).   Appellees contend that the result would be the same\nunder either test, but we need not resolve this dispute because\nwe affirm the court's ruling based on the \"exceeds authorized\naccess\" prong of § 1030(a)(4).\n\n                                -11-\n\f    Information for Employee's own benefit or for the benefit\n    of any other person or business entity other than EF.\n    * * *\n    As used in this Agreement, the term \"Confidential or\n    Proprietary Information\" means (a) any trade or business\n    secrets or confidential information of EF, whether or not\n    reduced to writing . . . ; (b) any technical, business, or\n    financial information, the use or disclosure of which might\n    reasonably be construed to be contrary to the interests of\n    EF. . . .\n\n    The record contains at least two communications from Gormley\n\nto Zefer seeming to rely on information about EF to which he was\n\nprivy only because of his employment there.        First, in an email\n\nto Zefer employee Joseph Alt exploring the use of a scraper,\n\nGormley wrote: \"[m]ight one of the team be able to write a\n\nprogram to automatically extract prices . . . ? I could work\n\nwith him/her on the specification.\"            Gormley also sent the\n\nfollowing email to Zefer employee John Hawley:\n\n    Here is a link to the page where you can grab EF's prices.\n    There are two important drop down menus on the right. . .\n    . With the lowest one you select one of about 150 tours. *\n    * * You then select your origin gateway from a list of\n    about\n    100 domestic gateways (middle drop down menu). When you\n    select your origin gateway a page with a couple of tables\n    comes up. One table has 1999-2000 prices and the other has\n    2000-2001 prices. * * * On a high speed connection it is\n    possible to move quickly from one price table to the next\n    by hitting backspace and then the down arrow.\n\nThis documentary evidence points to Gormley's heavy involvement\n\nin the conception of the scraper program. Furthermore, the\n\nvoluminous spreadsheet containing all of the scraped information\n\nincludes   the   tour   codes,   which   EF   claims   are   proprietary\n\n                                  -12-\n\finformation.        Each page of the spreadsheet produced by Zefer\n\nincludes the tour and gateway codes, the date of travel, and the\n\nprice for the tour.       An uninformed reader would regard the tour\n\ncodes as nothing but gibberish. 11               Although the codes can be\n\ncorrelated to the actual tours and destination points, the codes\n\nstanding alone need to be \"translated\" to be meaningful.\n\n    Explorica        argues   that   none   of    the   information   Gormley\n\nprovided Zefer was confidential and that the confidentiality\n\nagreement therefore is irrelevant. 12              The case on which they\n\nrely, Lanier Professional Services, Inc. v. Ricci, 192 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 1999), focused almost exclusively on an employee's\n\nnon-compete agreement.         The opinion mentioned in passing that\n\nthere    was   no   actionable   misuse     of    confidential   information\n\nbecause the only evidence that the employee had taken protected\n\ninformation was a \"practically worthless\" affidavit from the\n\nemployee's successor.         Id. at 5.\n\n    Here, on the other hand, there is ample evidence that\n\nGormley provided Explorica proprietary information about the\n\n\n\n    11   An example of the website address including the tour\ninformation is http://www.eftours.com/tours/PriceResult.asp?\nGate=GTF&TourID=LPM. In this address, the proprietary codes are\n\"GTF\" and \"LPM.\"\n    12   The Agreement provides that confidential information\ndoes not include anything that \"is or becomes generally known\nwithin EF's industry.\"\n\n                                     -13-\n\fstructure of the website and the tour codes.                 To be sure,\n\ngathering manually the various codes through repeated searching\n\nand deciphering of the URLs13 theoretically may be possible.\n\nPractically speaking, however, if proven, Explorica's wholesale\n\nuse of EF's travel codes to facilitate gathering EF's prices\n\nfrom        its   website   reeks   of   use--and,     indeed,   abuse--of\n\nproprietary information that goes beyond any authorized use of\n\nEF's website.14\n\n       Gormley      voluntarily     entered   a    broad   confidentiality\n\nagreement prohibiting his disclosure of any information \"which\n\nmight reasonably be construed to be contrary to the interests of\n\nEF.\"15       Appellants would face an uphill battle trying to argue\n\nthat it was not against EF's interests for appellants to use the\n\ntour codes to mine EF's pricing data.             See Anthony's Pier Four,\n\n\n       13\n        URL is the acronym for \"uniform resource locator,\" the\ntechnical name for the web address typed in by an Internet user.\nFor example, EF's URL is http://www.eftours.com.\n       14\n        Among the several emails in the record is one from\nZefer employee Joseph Alt to the Explorica \"team\" at Zefer:\n\n       Below is the information needed to log into EF's site as a\n       tour leader.     Please use this to gather competitor\n       information from both a business and experience design\n       perspective.   We may also be able to glean knowledge of\n       their technical abilities. As with all of our information,\n       this is extremely confidential.    Please do not share it\n       with anyone.\n       15Ironically, appellant Olsson countersigned Gormley's\nconfidentiality agreement as the representative of EF.\n\n                                     -14-\n\fInc. v. HBC Assoc., 411 Mass. 451, 471, 583 N.E.2d 806, 820\n\n(1991) (imposing a duty of good faith and fair dealing in all\n\ncontracts under Massachusetts law).                 If EF's allegations are\n\nproven,   it    will      likely   prove     that    whatever     authorization\n\nExplorica      had   to    navigate      around     EF's   site   (even     in   a\n\ncompetitive vein), it exceeded that authorization by providing\n\nproprietary information and know-how to Zefer to create the\n\nscraper.16      Accordingly,       the   district     court's     finding    that\n\nExplorica likely violated the CFAA was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n\n\n     16  EF also claims that Explorica skirted the website's\ntechnical restraints. To learn about a specific tour, a user\nmust navigate through several different web pages by \"clicking\"\non various drop-down menus and choosing the desired departure\nlocation, date, tour destination, tour length, and price range.\nThe district court found that the scraper circumvented the\ntechnical restraints by operating at a warp speed that the\nwebsite was not normally intended to accommodate. We need not\nreach the argument that this alone was a violation of the CFAA,\nhowever, because the apparent transfer of information in\nviolation   of  the  Confidentiality   Agreement   furnishes  a\nsufficient basis for injunctive relief.\n     Likewise, we express no opinion on the district court's\nruling that EF's copyright notice served as a \"clear statement\n[that] should have dispelled any notion a reasonable person may\nhave had the 'presumption of open access'\" to EF's website.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f       B.   Damage or Loss under section 1030(g)\n\n       Appellants also challenge the district court's finding that\n\nthe appellees would likely prove they met the CFAA's \"damage or\n\nloss\" requirements.     Under the CFAA, EF may maintain a private\n\ncause of action if it suffered \"damage or loss.\"               18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1030(g).     \"Damage\" is defined as \"any impairment to the\n\nintegrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or\n\ninformation that . . . causes loss aggregating at least $5,000\n\nin value during any 1-year period to one or more individuals .\n\n. . . \" 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(8).      \"Loss\" is not defined.\n\n       The district court held that although EF could not show any\n\n\"damage\" it would likely be able to show \"loss\" under the\n\nstatute.    It reasoned that a general understanding of the word\n\n\"loss\" would fairly encompass a loss of business, goodwill, and\n\nthe cost of diagnostic measures that EF took after it learned of\n\nExplorica's access to its website. 17         Appellants respond that\n\nsuch    diagnostic   measures   cannot   be   included   in   the   $5,000\n\nthreshold because their actions neither caused any physical\n\ndamage nor placed any stress on      EF's website.\n\n\n\n       17It is undisputed that appellees paid $20,944.92 to\nassess whether their website had been compromised. Appellees\nalso claim costs exceeding $40,000 that they will incur to\n\"remedy and secure their website and computer.\" We need not\nconsider whether these expenses constitute loss because the\ninitial $20,944.92 greatly exceeds the threshold.\n\n                                  -16-\n\f    Few courts have endeavored to resolve the contours of damage\n\nand loss under the CFAA.    See, e.g., Shaw v. Toshiba Am. Info.\n\nSys., 91 F. Supp. 2d 926 (E.D. Tex. 1999) (noting the paucity of\n\ndecisions construing the Act).     Two district courts that have\n\naddressed the issue have found that expenses such as those borne\n\nby EF do fall under the statute.     In Shurgard Storage Center v.\n\nSafeguard Self Storage, Inc., 119 F. Supp. 2d 1121 (W.D. Wa.\n\n2000), the district court found that the need to assess whether\n\na defendant's actions compromised the plaintiff's computers was\n\ncompensable under the CFAA because the computer's integrity was\n\ncalled into question.      The court based its finding on the\n\nlegislative history of the 1996 amendments to the CFAA:\n\n    The 1994 Amendment required both \"damage\" and \"loss,\" but\n    it is not always clear what constitutes \"damage.\"       For\n    example, intruders often alter existing log-on programs so\n    that user passwords are copied to a file which the hackers\n    can retrieve later.    After retrieving the newly created\n    password file, the intruder restores the altered log-on\n    file to its original condition.       Arguably, in such a\n    situation, neither the computer nor its information is\n    damaged. Nonetheless, this conduct allows the intruder to\n    accumulate valid user passwords to the system, requires all\n    system users to change their passwords, and requires the\n    system administrator to devote resources to re-securing the\n    system. Thus, although there is arguably no \"damage,\" the\n    victim does suffer \"loss.\" If the loss to the victim meets\n    the required monetary threshold, the conduct should be\n    criminal, and the victim should be entitled to relief.\n\nS. Rep. No. 104-357, at 11 (1996) (quoted in Shurgard, 119 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 1126).      Another district court held that this\n\nlegislative history makes \"clear that Congress intended the term\n\n                              -17-\n\f'loss' to target remedial expenses borne by victims that could\n\nnot properly be considered direct damage caused by a computer\n\nhacker.\"   In re Doubleclick Inc. Privacy Litig., 154 F. Supp. 2d\n\n497, 521 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).\n\n    We agree with this construction of the CFAA.                       In the\n\nabsence of a statutory definition for \"loss,\" we apply the well-\n\nknown rule of assigning undefined words their normal, everyday\n\nmeaning.    See Inmates of Suffolk Cty. Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d\n\n649, 653-54 (1st Cir. 1997).       The word \"loss\" means \"detriment,\n\ndisadvantage, or deprivation from failure to keep, have or get.\"\n\nThe Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1137 (2d ed.\n\n1983).     Appellees unquestionably suffered a detriment and a\n\ndisadvantage by having to expend substantial sums to assess the\n\nextent, if any, of the physical damage to their website caused\n\nby appellants' intrusion.     That the physical components were not\n\ndamaged    is   fortunate,   but    it     does     not   lessen     the    loss\n\nrepresented     by   consultant    fees.          Congress's   use     of    the\n\ndisjunctive, \"damage or loss,\" confirms that it anticipated\n\nrecovery in cases involving other than purely physical damage.\n\nBut see In re Intuit Privacy Litig., 138 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1281\n\n(C.D. Ca. 2001) (loss means \"irreparable damage\" and any other\n\ninterpretation \"would render the term 'damage' superfluous\");\n\nRegister.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., 126 F. Supp. 2d 238, 252 n.12\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f(S.D.N.Y. 2000) (lost business or goodwill could not constitute\n\nloss      absent    the   impairment    or    unavailability        of     data      or\n\nsystems).      To parse the words in any other way would not only\n\nimpair Congress's intended scope of the Act, but would also\n\nserve to reward sophisticated intruders.                   As we move into an\n\nincreasingly electronic world, the instances of physical damage\n\nwill likely be fewer while the value to the victim of what has\n\nbeen stolen and the victim's costs in shoring up its security\n\nfeatures undoubtedly will loom ever-larger.                       If we were to\n\nrestrict      the    statute   as    appellants      urge,    we    would      flout\n\nCongress's intent by effectively permitting the CFAA to languish\n\nin the twentieth century, as violators of the Act move into the\n\ntwenty-first century and beyond.\n\n       We do not hold, however, that any loss is compensable. The\n\nCFAA provides recovery for \"damage\" only if it results in a loss\n\nof   at    least    $5,000.     We    agree   with    the     court      in    In    re\n\nDoubleclick        Inc.   Privacy    Litigation,     154     F.    Supp.      2d    497\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2001), that Congress could not have intended other\n\ntypes of loss to support recovery unless that threshold were\n\nmet.      Indeed, the Senate Report explicitly states that \"if the\n\nloss to the victim meets the required monetary threshold,\" the\n\nvictim is entitled to relief under the CFAA.                  S. Rep. 104-357,\n\nat 11.      We therefore conclude that expenses of at least $5,000\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fresulting from a party's intrusion are \"losses\" for purposes of\n\nthe \"damage or loss\" requirement of the CFAA.18\n\n                        IV.   Conclusion\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the district court\n\nthat appellees will likely succeed on the merits of their CFAA\n\nclaim under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4). Accordingly, the preliminary\n\ninjunction was properly ordered.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    18    Only appellant Zefer raised the argument that the\npreliminary injunction violated the First Amendment. Explorica\nattempted to adopt that argument at oral argument. The lateness\nof Explorica's attempt renders it fruitless. See Garcia-Ayala\nv. Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 645 (1st Cir. 2000) (failure\nto brief an argument constitutes waiver despite attempt to raise\nthe argument at oral argument); Piazza v. Aponte Roque, 909 F.2d\n35, 37 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Except in extraordinary circumstances\n. . . a court of appeals will not consider an issue raised for\nthe first time at oral argument.\").\n\n                              -20-\n\f",

Background\n\n      Explorica was formed in 2000 to compete in the field of\n\nglobal tours for high school students. Several of Explorica's\n\nemployees formerly were employed by appellee EF, which has been\n\nin   business   for    more   than   thirty-five     years.     EF   and   its\n\npartners and subsidiaries make up the world's largest private\n\nstudent travel organization.\n\n      Shortly after the individual defendants left EF in the\n\nbeginning of 2000, Explorica began competing in the teenage tour\n\nmarket. The company's vice president (and former vice president\n\n\n      1 The individual defendants-appellants are Olle Olsson,\nPeter Nilsson, Philip Gormley, Alexandra Bernadotte, Anders\nErikkson, Deborah Johnson, and Stefan Nilsson.    They are all\nformer employees of plaintiffs-appellees, EF Cultural Tours BV,\nEF Institute for Cultural Exchange, Inc. (\"EFICE\"), EF Cultural\nServices BV, and Go Ahead Vacations, Inc.    The appellees are\ncollectively referred to as \"EF.\"\n     The injunction was also issued against a second company,\nZefer Corporation (\"Zefer\"), which also appealed.         After\nbriefing was completed, Zefer filed for bankruptcy. We granted\na joint motion to sever Zefer's appeal, which has been stayed.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fof information strategy at EF), Philip Gormley, envisioned that\n\nExplorica could gain a substantial advantage over all other\n\nstudent tour companies, and especially EF, by undercutting EF's\n\nalready competitive prices on student tours.            Gormley considered\n\nseveral ways to obtain and utilize EF's prices: by manually\n\nkeying in the information from EF's brochures and other printed\n\nmaterials; by using a scanner to record that same information;\n\nor, by manually searching for each tour offered through EF's\n\nwebsite.       Ultimately,       however,     Gormley     engaged   Zefer,\n\nExplorica's Internet consultant, to design a computer program\n\ncalled a \"scraper\" to glean all of the necessary information\n\nfrom EF's website.     Zefer designed the program in three days.\n\n    The scraper has been likened to a \"robot,\" a tool that is\n\nextensively used on the Internet.           Robots are used to gather\n\ninformation    for   countless    purposes,    ranging     from   compiling\n\nresults for search engines such as Yahoo! to filtering for\n\ninappropriate content.       The widespread deployment of robots\n\nenables global Internet users to find comprehensive information\n\nquickly and almost effortlessly.\n\n    Like a robot, the scraper sought information through the\n\nInternet.     Unlike other robots, however, the scraper focused\n\nsolely on EF’s website, using information that other robots\n\nwould not have.      Specifically, Zefer utilized tour codes whose\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fsignificance was not readily understandable to the public.   With\n\nthe tour codes, the scraper accessed EF's website repeatedly and\n\neasily obtained pricing information for those specific tours.\n\nThe scraper sent more than 30,000 inquiries to EF's website and\n\nrecorded the pricing information into a spreadsheet.2\n\n    Zefer ran the scraper program twice, first to retrieve the\n\n2000 tour prices and then the 2001 prices.       All told, the\n\nscraper downloaded 60,000 lines of data, the equivalent of eight\n\n\n\n\n    2  John Hawley, one of Zefer's senior technical associates,\nexplained the technical progression of the scraper in an\naffidavit:\n\n         [a.]      Open an Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet\n                   initially contains EFTours gateway and\n                   destination city codes, which are available\n                   on the EFTours web site.\n         [b.]      Identify the first gateway and destination\n                   city codes [on the] Excel spreadsheet.\n         [c.]      Create a [website address] request for the\n                   EFTours tour prices page based on a\n                   combination of gateway and destination city.\n                   Example: show me all the prices for a London\n                   trip leaving JFK.\n         [d.]      View the requested web page which is\n                   retained in the random access memory of the\n                   requesting computer in the form of HTML\n                   [computer language] code. * * *\n         [e.]      Search the HTML for the tour prices for each\n                   season, year, etc.\n         [f.]      Store the prices into the Excel spreadsheet.\n         [g.]      Identify the next gateway and city codes in\n                   the spreadsheet.\n         [8.]      Repeat steps 3-7 for all gateway and\n                   destination city combinations.\n\n                              -5-\n\ftelephone directories of information.3   Once Zefer “scraped” all\n\nof the prices, it sent a spreadsheet containing EF’s pricing\n\ninformation to Explorica, which then systematically undercut\n\nEF's prices.4 Explorica thereafter printed its own brochures and\n\nbegan competing in EF's tour market.\n\n    The development and use of the scraper came to light about\n\na year and a half later during state-court litigation regarding\n\nappellant Olsson’s departure from appellee EFICE.   EF then filed\n\nthis action, alleging violations of the CFAA; the Copyright Act\n\nof 1976, 17 U.S.C. § 101; the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961; and various related state\n\nlaws.   It sought a preliminary injunction barring Explorica and\n\nZefer from using the scraper program and demanded the return of\n\nall materials generated through use of the scraper.\n\n    On May 30, 2001, the district court granted a preliminary\n\ninjunction against Explorica based on the CFAA, which criminally\n\nand civilly prohibits certain access to computers.        See 18\n\n\n\n    3   Appellants dispute the relevance of the size of the\nprinted data, arguing that 60,000 printed lines, while\nvoluminous on paper, is not a large amount of data for a\ncomputer to store. This is a distinction without a difference.\nThe fact is that appellants utilized the scraper program to\ndownload EF's pricing data. In June 2000, EF's website listed\n154,293 prices for various tours.\n    4   Explorica later varied its prices slightly to mask its\nacross-the-board discount of EF’s prices.\n\n                               -6-\n\fU.S.C. § 1030(a)(4).        The court found that EF would likely prove\n\nthat Explorica violated the CFAA when it used EF's website in a\n\nmanner outside the \"reasonable expectations\" of both EF and its\n\nordinary users.         The court also concluded that EF could show\n\nthat it suffered a loss, as required by the statute, consisting\n\nof reduced business, harm to its goodwill, and the cost of\n\ndiagnostic measures it incurred to evaluate possible harm to\n\nEF's       systems,   although   it   could   not   show   that   Explorica's\n\nactions physically damaged its computers.                  In a supplemental\n\nopinion5 the district court further articulated its “reasonable\n\nexpectations” standard and explained that copyright, contractual\n\nand technical restraints sufficiently notified Explorica that\n\nits use of a scraper would be unauthorized and thus would\n\nviolate the CFAA.\n\n       The district court first relied on EF’s use of a copyright\n\nsymbol on one of the pages of its website and a link directing\n\nusers with questions to contact the company,6 finding that “such\n\n\n       5 Zefer, Explorica's consultant, had objected to the\ninitial decision on the ground that it could face liability\nunder the preliminary injunction even though it had not had an\nopportunity to respond to EF's preliminary injunction motion.\nThe district court allowed all of the parties to submit\nsupplemental briefs and issued a further decision on July 2,\n2001.\n       6   The notice stated in full:\n\n              Copyright © 2000 EF Cultural Travel BV\n\n                                       -7-\n\fa clear statement should have dispelled any notion a reasonable\n\nperson    may    have    had    that      the   ‘presumption     of     open    access’\n\napplied to information on EF’s website.”                   The court next found\n\nthat the manner by which Explorica accessed EF’s website likely\n\nviolated a confidentiality agreement between appellant Gormley\n\nand EF, because Gormley provided to Zefer technical instructions\n\nconcerning the creation of the scraper.                   Finally, the district\n\ncourt    noted    without       elaboration        that   the    scraper       bypassed\n\ntechnical restrictions embedded in the website to acquire the\n\ninformation.

Under the CFAA, EF may maintain a private\n\ncause of action if it suffered \"damage or loss.\"               18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1030(g).     \"Damage\" is defined as \"any impairment to the\n\nintegrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or\n\ninformation that . . . causes loss aggregating at least $5,000\n\nin value during any 1-year period to one or more individuals .\n\n. . . \" 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(8).      \"Loss\" is not defined.\n\n       The district court held that although EF could not show any\n\n\"damage\" it would likely be able to show \"loss\" under the\n\nstatute.    It reasoned that a general understanding of the word\n\n\"loss\" would fairly encompass a loss of business, goodwill, and\n\nthe cost of diagnostic measures that EF took after it learned of\n\nExplorica's access to its website. 17         Appellants respond that\n\nsuch    diagnostic   measures   cannot   be   included   in   the   $5,000\n\nthreshold because their actions neither caused any physical\n\ndamage nor placed any stress on      EF's website.\n\n\n\n       17It is undisputed that appellees paid $20,944.92 to\nassess whether their website had been compromised.

The court based its finding on the\n\nlegislative history of the 1996 amendments to the CFAA:\n\n    The 1994 Amendment required both \"damage\" and \"loss,\" but\n    it is not always clear what constitutes \"damage.\"       For\n    example, intruders often alter existing log-on programs so\n    that user passwords are copied to a file which the hackers\n    can retrieve later.    After retrieving the newly created\n    password file, the intruder restores the altered log-on\n    file to its original condition.       Arguably, in such a\n    situation, neither the computer nor its information is\n    damaged. Nonetheless, this conduct allows the intruder to\n    accumulate valid user passwords to the system, requires all\n    system users to change their passwords, and requires the\n    system administrator to devote resources to re-securing the\n    system. Thus, although there is arguably no \"damage,\" the\n    victim does suffer \"loss.\" If the loss to the victim meets\n    the required monetary threshold, the conduct should be\n    criminal, and the victim should be entitled to relief.\n\nS. Rep. No. 104-357, at 11 (1996) (quoted in Shurgard, 119 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 1126).

Supp.      2d    497\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2001), that Congress could not have intended other\n\ntypes of loss to support recovery unless that threshold were\n\nmet.      Indeed, the Senate Report explicitly states that \"if the\n\nloss to the victim meets the required monetary threshold,\" the\n\nvictim is entitled to relief under the CFAA.                  S. Rep. 104-357,\n\nat 11.      We therefore conclude that expenses of at least $5,000\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fresulting from a party's intrusion are \"losses\" for purposes of\n\nthe \"damage or loss\" requirement of the CFAA.18\n\n                        IV.   Conclusion\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the district court\n\nthat appellees will likely succeed on the merits of their CFAA\n\nclaim under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4). Accordingly, the preliminary\n\ninjunction was properly ordered.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    18    Only appellant Zefer raised the argument that the\npreliminary injunction violated the First Amendment. Explorica\nattempted to adopt that argument at oral argument. The lateness\nof Explorica's attempt renders it fruitless. See Garcia-Ayala\nv.
