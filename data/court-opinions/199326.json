Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Jay P.\nMcCloskey, United States Attorney, on brief, for appellee.\n\n    James S. Hewes on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                        March 22, 2001\n\f\f         BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.     Defendant-appellant Tad\n\nMichaud pleaded guilty to five criminal counts arising from his\n\nrobbery of a convenience store.         Because he used a short-\n\nbarreled shotgun during the crime, he was sentenced to the\n\nstatutory minimum of ten years’ imprisonment.        18 U.S.C. §§\n\n921(a)(6), 924(c)(1).   Michaud appeals from his sentence on the\n\nground that the weapon did not meet the measurement requirements\n\ncontained in section 921(a)(6).      We affirm.\n\n                         I.   BACKGROUND\n\n         On the evening of July 21, 1999, Michaud entered an\n\nExxon convenience store in Westbrook, Maine, carrying a sawed-\n\noff shotgun.   He pointed the shotgun at the store’s attendant\n\nand the attendant’s son, ordering them into a back room where a\n\nsafe was located.   The attendant and his son resisted Michaud\n\nand took the weapon away from him.       They used the shotgun to\n\nhold Michaud until the police arrived and arrested him.\n\n         On August 19, 1999, a federal grand jury returned a\n\nfive-count indictment against Michaud.        He was charged with\n\nobstructing commerce by attempting robbery in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1951(a) (Count One); using and carrying a firearm\n\nduring a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\n\n(Count Two); possessing shotguns and a rifle as a convicted\n\nfelon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) (Counts Three and\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fFour); and possessing an unregistered firearm in violation of 26\n\nU.S.C. § 5861(d) (Count Five).1           Michaud pleaded guilty to all\n\ncounts of the indictment.\n\n              At the sentencing hearing, Michaud contended that the\n\nweapon he used during the robbery did not meet the statutory\n\nrequirements for a ten-year minimum sentence for using a short-\n\nbarreled shotgun, 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(6).                He also sought a\n\ndownward departure for “aberrant behavior.”              See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(b);       U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 (permitting departure for certain\n\naggravating or mitigating circumstances that should result in\n\ndifferent sentence); United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555,\n\n560-61 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 to defendant’s\n\naberrant       behavior).    The    district    court    rejected   these\n\ncontentions and sentenced Michaud to 177 months' imprisonment:\n\n57 months on Counts One, Three, Four and Five, to be served\n\nconcurrently, plus a consecutive sentence of 120 months on Count\n\nTwo.       This appeal followed.\n\n                            II.    DISCUSSION\n\n              First, Michaud challenges the ten-year consecutive\n\nsentence imposed on Count Two, renewing his argument that the\n\n\n\n       1\n     The weapons possession charges arose from Michaud’s use of\nthe sawed-off shotgun during the robbery as well as from\nadditional weapons discovered in his home in a subsequent\nsearch.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fweapon he used during the robbery did not meet the statutory\n\ndefinition of a short-barreled shotgun.                18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(6).\n\nWe review this question of statutory interpretation de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Rostoff, 164 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            18   U.S.C.    §   924(c)(1)(B)(i)         mandates   a   ten-year\n\nsentence for the use or carrying of a short-barreled shotgun\n\nduring a crime of violence.2          The statute defines a “shotgun” as:\n\n            a weapon designed or redesigned, made or\n            remade, and intended to be fired from the\n            shoulder and designed or redesigned and made\n            or remade to use the energy of an explosive\n            to force through a smooth bore either a\n            number of ball shot or a single projectile\n            for each single pull of the trigger.\n\nId.   §   921(a)(5).      As   used    in    section    924(c)(1)(B)(i),   the\n\nstatute defines a “short-barreled shotgun” as:\n\n            a shotgun having one or more barrels less\n            than eighteen inches in length and any\n            weapon made from a shotgun (whether by\n            alteration, modification or otherwise) if\n            such a weapon as modified has an overall\n            length of less than twenty-six inches.\n\nId. § 921(a)(6).\n\n            It is uncontested that the weapon Michaud used during\n\nthe robbery was a sawed-off shotgun with a barrel measuring\n\n\n      2\n      Congress considered criminals’ use of short-barreled\nshotguns   worthy  of   enhanced  punishment   because  it   is\nparticularly dangerous: shot scatters more widely from a short\nbarrel, thus killing indiscriminately, and a shortened shotgun\nis easier to conceal and wield. United States v. Hall, 972 F.2d\n67, 70 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\n                                       -5-\n\ftwelve and one-quarter inches long and an overall length of\n\ntwenty-seven and one-quarter inches.           When recovered by the\n\npolice, it was fully operational and test-fired normally.\n\n              At the sentencing hearing, after argument from the\n\nprosecution and Michaud, the district court ruled:\n\n              I’m  satisfied   that  Subsection   (6)   of\n              Subsection (a) of Section 921 gives two\n              alternative definitions, and that the weapon\n              here qualifies under the first alternative;\n              namely, it is a shotgun, having one or more\n              barrels less than 18 inches in length. And\n              that that alone satisfies the definition of\n              the statute. The fact that it obtained its\n              shorter length by modification does not\n              prevent it from qualifying under that part\n              of the definition, and I’m satisfied that\n              the [Fourth] Circuit decision in Hall says\n              nothing different, that in fact it supports\n              the conclusion I’m reaching.\n\n              Michaud contends that the two measurement requirements\n\ncontained at section 921(a)(6) should be read conjunctively due\n\nto the use of the word “and” instead of “or.”                 Under this\n\ntheory, a weapon must have a barrel length of less than eighteen\n\ninches and an overall length of less than twenty-six inches to\n\nbe   a   short-barreled    shotgun.     Because   Michaud's    sawed-off\n\nshotgun satisfied only the barrel length requirement, he argues,\n\nsection 924(c)(1)(B)(i) cannot apply.\n\n              We disagree, and conclude that the district court’s\n\nreading of the statute was correct.         The plain language of 18\n\nU.S.C.    §    921(a)(6)   includes   within   its   definition    of   a\n\n                                  -6-\n\fshort-barreled shotgun two categories of weapon: a shotgun with\n\na barrel of less than eighteen inches in length, and any weapon\n\nmade from a shotgun that has an overall length of less than\n\ntwenty-six inches.       United States v. Hall, 972 F.2d 67, 70 (4th\n\nCir. 1992).    Because Michaud’s shotgun satisfied the first\n\nrequirement,   it   is    covered    by   the   statute;   it   makes   no\n\ndifference that it did not additionally fall into the second\n\ncategory of weapons, i.e., those having an overall length of\n\nless than twenty-six inches.        See id.; United States v. Bandy,\n\n239 F.3d 802, 806 (6th Cir. 2001) (\"A barrel length of less than\n\n18 inches brings the shotgun within the proscription of [section\n\n921(a)(6)], regardless of the total length of the weapon.\")\n\n         As the Fourth Circuit pointed out, the construction of\n\nsection 921(a)(6) supports this conclusion.\n\n         [If] Congress intended to punish the use of\n         only   one,   narrow  subset   of   modified\n         shotguns--those with a barrel length of less\n         than eighteen inches and an overall length\n         of less than twenty-six inches--Congress\n         would have had absolutely no reason to\n         insert into the provision the second subject\n         category.   Congress   simply   could   have\n         declared that: \"short barreled shotgun means\n         a shotgun having one or more barrels less\n         than eighteen inches in length and an\n         overall length of less than twenty-six\n         inches.\"    Because Congress chose not to\n         structure the statute in this way, it is\n         evident on the face of the statute that it\n         is intended to proscribe the use of both\n         shotguns with a barrel length of less than\n         eighteen inches and other weapons made from\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           shotguns with an overall length of less than\n           twenty-six inches.\n\nHall, 972 F.2d at 70.\n\n           This   interpretation         is   further     buttressed   by       the\n\ndefinition of a shotgun contained at section 921(a)(5).                         It\n\nexpressly includes weapons “designed or redesigned and made or\n\nremade.”      Hence,         section     921(a)(6)’s      definition       of     a\n\nshort-barreled shotgun as “a shotgun having one or more barrels\n\nof less than eighteen inches in length” includes sawed-off\n\nshotguns as well as          unmodified shotguns.3\n\n           Additionally, Michaud contends that the district court\n\nerred in declining to award a downward departure on the ground\n\nthat his criminal conduct was “aberrant behavior.”               The court of\n\nappeals has no jurisdiction, however, to review a district\n\ncourt’s decision not to depart downward unless the district\n\ncourt misunderstood its authority to do so.                 United States v.\n\nOrlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 49 (1st Cir. 2000).               Michaud does\n\nnot   contend,    and    the    record    does     not    reflect,   any    such\n\nmisunderstanding        on     the     part   of    the     district   court.\n\n\n\n      3\n     The government also contends that the legislative history\nof section 921(a)(6) supports the disjunctive reading of the\nlanguage at issue. Because we conclude that the plain language\nof the provision makes clear that a shotgun need only satisfy\none of the length requirements, we need not consider the\nlegislative history.    See Telematics Int'l, Inc. v. NEMLC\nLeasing Corp., 967 F.2d 703, 706 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                                       -8-\n\fAccordingly, we may not review the district court’s rejection of\n\nMichaud’s aberrant behavior argument.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -9-\n\f",

Because he used a short-barreled shotgun during the crime, he was sentenced to the statutory minimum of ten years' imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 921(a)(6), 924(c)(1). Michaud appeals from his sentence on the ground that the weapon did not meet the measurement requirements contained in section 921(a)(6). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of July 21, 1999, Michaud entered an Exxon convenience store in Westbrook, Maine, carrying a sawed-off shotgun. He pointed the shotgun at the store's attendant and the attendant's son, ordering them into a back room where a safe was located. The attendant and his son resisted Michaud and took the weapon away from him. They used the shotgun to hold Michaud until the police arrived and arrested him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 1999, a federal grand jury returned a five-count indictment against Michaud. He was charged with obstructing commerce by attempting robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a) (Count One); using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (Count Two); possessing shotguns and a rifle as a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) (Counts Three and Four); and possessing an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d) (Count Five).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Michaud pleaded guilty to all counts of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, Michaud contended that the weapon he used during the robbery did not meet the statutory requirements for a ten-year minimum sentence for using a short-barreled shotgun, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(6). He also sought a downward departure for \"aberrant behavior.\" See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 (permitting departure for certain aggravating or mitigating circumstances that should result in different sentence); United States v. Grandmaison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196611\"><a href=\"/opinion/196611/united-states-v-grandmaison/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 560-61 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 to defendant's aberrant behavior). The district court rejected these contentions and sentenced Michaud to 177 months' imprisonment: 57 months on Counts One, Three, Four and Five, to be served concurrently, plus a consecutive sentence of 120 months on Count Two. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Michaud challenges the ten-year consecutive sentence imposed on Count Two, renewing his argument that the weapon he used during the robbery did not meet the statutory definition of a short-barreled shotgun. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(6). We review this question of statutory interpretation de novo. United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198276\"><a href=\"/opinion/198276/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(B)(i) mandates a ten-year sentence for the use or carrying of a short-barreled shotgun during a crime of violence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The statute defines a \"shotgun\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a weapon designed or redesigned, made or remade, and intended to be fired from the shoulder and designed or redesigned and made or remade to use the energy of an explosive to force through a smooth bore either a number of ball shot or a single projectile for each single pull of the trigger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 921(a)(5). As used in section 924(c)(1)(B)(i), the statute defines a \"short-barreled shotgun\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a shotgun having one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length and any weapon made from a shotgun (whether by alteration, modification or otherwise) if such a weapon as modified has an overall length of less than twenty-six inches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 921(a)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is uncontested that the weapon Michaud used during the robbery was a sawed-off shotgun with a barrel measuring twelve and one-quarter inches long and an overall length of twenty-seven and one-quarter inches. When recovered by the police, it was fully operational and test-fired normally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, after argument from the prosecution and Michaud, the district court ruled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm satisfied that Subsection (6) of Subsection (a) of Section 921 gives two alternative definitions, and that the weapon here qualifies under the first alternative; namely, it is a shotgun, having one or more barrels less than 18 inches in length. And that that alone satisfies the definition of the statute. The fact that it obtained its shorter length by modification does not prevent it from qualifying under that part of the definition, and I'm satisfied that the [Fourth] Circuit decision in Hall says nothing different, that in fact it supports the conclusion I'm reaching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Michaud contends that the two measurement requirements contained at section 921(a)(6) should be read conjunctively due to the use of the word \"and\" instead of \"or.\" Under this theory, a weapon must have a barrel length of less than eighteen inches and an overall length of less than twenty-six inches to be a short-barreled shotgun. Because Michaud's sawed-off shotgun satisfied only the barrel length requirement, he argues, section 924(c)(1)(B)(i) cannot apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree, and conclude that the district court's reading of the statute was correct. The plain language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(6) includes within its definition of a short-barreled shotgun two categories of weapon: a shotgun with a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length, and any weapon made from a shotgun that has an overall length of less than twenty-six inches. United States v. Hall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588180\"><a href=\"/opinion/588180/united-states-v-john-robert-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 70 (4th Cir. 1992). Because Michaud's shotgun satisfied the first requirement, it is covered by the statute; it makes no difference that it did not additionally fall into the second category of weapons, i.e., those having an overall length of less than twenty-six inches.

Bandy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772014\"><a href=\"/opinion/772014/united-states-v-michael-bandy/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span>, 806 (6th Cir. 2001) (\"A barrel length of less than 18 inches brings the shotgun within the proscription of [section 921(a)(6)], regardless of the total length of the weapon.\") As the Fourth Circuit pointed out, the construction of section 921(a)(6) supports this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[If] Congress intended to punish the use of only one, narrow subset of modified shotguns--those with a barrel length of less than eighteen inches and an overall length of less than twenty-six inches--Congress would have had absolutely no reason to insert into the provision the second subject category.
