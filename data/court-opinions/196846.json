PaineWebber  filed a\r\n\ncomplaint  in   federal  district   court  seeking   to  stay\r\n\narbitration, alleging that the  claims were time-barred under\r\n\nthe terms of the arbitration  agreement.

Any\r\n          arbitration shall be  in accordance  with\r\n          the  rules in  effect of  either the  New\r\n          York Stock Exchange, Inc., American Stock\r\n          Exchange,  Inc., National  Association of\r\n          Securities   Dealers,   Inc.,  or   where\r\n          appropriate,  the  Chicago Board  Options\r\n          Exchange or National Futures Association,\r\n          as the [client] may elect.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nIt also  provided that \"[t]his agreement  and its enforcement\r\n\nshall be construed and governed  by the laws of the  State of\r\n\nNew York.\"\r\n\n          Some  time in 1994, the Elahis notified PaineWebber\r\n\nof their intention to  pursue claims that one of  its brokers\r\n\nhad sold them unsuitable  and highly speculative investments,\r\n\nfalsely  guaranteed  a  twelve-percent  minimum  return,  and\r\n\ndeceptively assured them  that their investments were  secure\r\n\nwhen  in fact  they had  already lost  a significant  part of\r\n\ntheir  initial investment.  On August 3, 1994, the Elahis and\r\n\nPaineWebber executed  an agreement  to toll, as  of June  28,\r\n\n1994, the  running of all  statutes of limitations  and other\r\n\ndefenses based  on the passage of time,  apparently hoping to\r\n\nreach a  negotiated settlement.   The  effective date  of the\r\n\ntolling agreement was more than seven years after the Elahis'\r\n\nlast purchase of an investment from PaineWebber.  \r\n\n          On December 29, 1994,  the Elahis filed a Statement\r\n\nof Claim with the National Association of Securities Dealers,\r\n\nInc. (\"NASD\"),  seeking arbitration  of claims arising  under\r\n\nthe  federal  securities  laws,  Massachusetts  statutes, and\r\n\nvarious Massachusetts common law theories of fraud and breach\r\n\nof fiduciary  duty.   PaineWebber responded by  bringing this\r\n\naction for declaratory and  injunctive relief, seeking to bar\r\n\nthe arbitration of the  Elahis' claims.  PaineWebber asserted\r\n\nthat the arbitration rules of the NASD precluded claims filed\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nmore  than six years after the purchase of the investments at\r\n\nissue.   Specifically, PaineWebber  pointed to Section  15 of\r\n\nthe NASD Code of  Arbitration Procedure (\"section 15\"), which\r\n\nprovides:\r\n\n          Time Limitation Upon Submission\r                                                     \r\n               Sec.  15.   No  dispute,  claim,  or\r\n          controversy   shall   be   eligible   for\r\n          submission to arbitration under this Code\r\n          where six (6) years have elapsed from the\r\n          occurrence  or event  giving rise  to the\r\n          act  or  dispute, claim,  or controversy.\r\n          This section shall not  extend applicable\r\n          statutes  of  limitations,  nor shall  it\r\n          apply to  any case  which is  directed to\r\n          arbitration  by  a  court   of  competent\r\n          jurisdiction.\r\n\nPaineWebber  postulated  that  the  Elahis' claims  were  not\r\n\n\"eligible   for  submission  to   arbitration\"  because  they\r\n\nconcerned securities  purchased more than  seven years before\r\n\nthe effective date  of the tolling  agreement and over  eight\r\n\nyears before  the claim  for arbitration was  filed with  the\r\n\nNASD.  The Elahis' countered by filing motions (1) to dismiss\r\n\nPaineWebber's complaint  and (2) to compel  arbitration under\r\n\nthe Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.   4.\r\n\n          The  district court  granted  the Elahis'  motions.\r\n\nThe  court  found   that  the  parties  had  signed  a  valid\r\n\narbitration  agreement  covering  disputes   over  investment\r\n\ntransactions, and  consequently ruled that  the applicability\r\n\nof the time-bar provision of section 15 was a question to  be\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndetermined  by  the   arbitrator  rather  than  the   court.1\r\n\nPaineWebber appeals.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          PaineWebber argues  on appeal  that the section  15\r\n\ntime bar makes the Elahis' claims ineligible for arbitration,\r\n\nand that the  court, not the arbitrator must therefore decide\r\n\nthe timeliness  question.   The  issue  before us,  then,  is\r\n\nwhether the time-bar provision is to be construed and applied\r\n\nby the  arbitrator  or  by the  court.2   We  are  the  tenth\r\n\ncircuit court  to address that question;  our sister circuits\r\n\nare split  five-to-four.   The Third, Sixth,  Seventh, Tenth,\r\n\nand Eleventh Circuits  have held that  the court must  decide\r\n\nthe applicability  of the  section 15  time bar;  the Second,\r\n\nFifth,  and Eighth,  and  Ninth Circuits  have held  that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The district  court based  its decision on  its published\r\nopinion in a similar  case, PaineWebber, Inc. v. Landay,  903\r                                                                   \r\nF. Supp. 193 (D. Mass. 1995), which the court incorporated by\r\nreference  in its  unpublished memorandum  and order  in this\r\ncase.\r\n\n2.  Ultimately,  the arbitrator  or the  court will  probably\r\nneed to  determine (1) whether the  only relevant \"occurrence\r\nor event\" triggering the time bar was the Elahis' purchase of\r\ninvestments, or whether the time bar should be measured  from\r\nthe date of alleged  subsequent acts or omissions related  to\r\nthe  investments, and (2) whether the time bar is absolute or\r\nsubject  to  equitable tolling.    We need  not  decide those\r\nissues.   We are faced  solely with the  question whether the\r\ndistrict  court correctly referred the time bar issues to the\r\narbitrator, or should have decided them itself.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\narbitrator decides.3   In our  view, this  body of  appellate\r\n\ncaselaw leaves important aspects of the  problem unaddressed,\r\n\nas  we  shall explain.    The  relevant Supreme  Court  cases\r\n\nprovide  guidance, but  do not point  clearly to  the correct\r\n\nresult  in this  case.   Consequently, we  embark on  our own\r\n\nanalysis.\r\n\n          Because  this appeal  presents a  question of  law,\r\n\nappellate  review is plenary.  See McCarthy v. Azure, 22 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n351, 354 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying de novo review to district\r                                                      \r\n\ncourt's ruling on scope of arbitration agreement); Commercial\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnion Ins.

See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., Merrill  Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v.

Here, the  breadth  of the  arbitration\r\n\nclause --  encompassing \"all  controversies . .  . concerning\r\n\nany transaction\"  as well as the  \"construction, performance,\r\n\nor breach\" of the agreement  -- militates against reading the\r\n\nchoice-of-law clause  as a  limit on the  arbitrator's power.\r\n\nMoreover,  the agreement provides  that \"arbitration shall be\r\n\nin accordance with the rules in  effect of the . . .

In sum, we can  do no better than  to borrow from\r\n\nMastrobuono:\r                       \r\n\n          We  think the  best way to  harmonize the\r\n          choice-of-law    provision    with    the\r\n          arbitration  provision  is  to read  \"the\r\n          laws  of  the  State  of  New   York\"  to\r\n          encompass substantive principles that New\r\n          York  courts  would  apply,  but  not  to\r\n          include   special   rules  limiting   the\r\n          authority  of  arbitrators.    Thus,  the\r\n          choice-of-law provision covers the rights\r\n          and  duties of  the  parties,  while  the\r\n          arbitration clause covers arbitration . .\r\n          . .\r\n\nId. at 1219.\r               \r\n\n          Thus,  relying  on Mastrobuono,  we  hold  that the\r                                                    \r\n\nparties' contractual choice of New York law  does not require\r\n\na  judicial determination  of  the effect  of  the NASD  Code\r\n\nsection  15  time  bar.5     We  move  on  to   consider  the\r\n\narbitration clause  itself (and the NASD  Code of Arbitration\r\n\nProcedure  incorporated therein)  to determine,  in light  of\r\n\nfederal arbitration  law, whether  the parties  intended that\r\n\nthe arbitrator or the court apply the time bar.\r\n\nB.

Thus, we can glean from First Options that the\r                                                                \r\n\nissue  of whether  a  person is  a  party to  an  arbitration\r\n\nagreement is an \"arbitrability\" issue, and presumptively  for\r\n\nthe court to decide.\r\n\n          In  AT&amp;T,  the other  Supreme  Court  case on  \"who\r                              \r\n\ndecides arbitrability,\" the \"arbitrability\" issue was whether\r\n\nthe subject  matter of  the underlying dispute  was expressly\r                               \r\n\nmade  non-arbitrable  by   the  terms   of  the   arbitration\r\n\nagreement.     The  arbitration   clause  of  the  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement (\"CBA\") in  AT&amp;T expressly did not cover\r                                                 \r\n\ndisputes  \"excluded from  arbitration by other  provisions of\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nthis contract.\"   AT&amp;T, 475  U.S. at 645.   The  CBA provided\r                                  \r\n\nfurther that the employer, AT&amp;T, was free to exercise certain\r\n\nmanagement   functions,   including   the    termination   of\r\n\nemployment, \"not subject to the provisions of the arbitration\r\n\nclause.\"  Id.   Another CBA term provided that  layoffs would\r                         \r\n\noccur  in reverse  order  of seniority,  defining layoffs  as\r\n\nterminations  resulting from  \"lack  of  work\"; the  \"layoff\"\r\n\nprovision did  not  specify whether  it  was subject  to,  or\r\n\nexcepted  from, the arbitration clause.   Id.   The issue was\r                                                         \r\n\nwhether  the  union  could  compel  arbitration  over certain\r\n\nlayoffs, or, instead, whether the layoffs were non-arbitrable\r\n\nmanagement functions.  The Supreme  Court held that the issue\r\n\nwhether \"layoffs\" were an arbitrable subject matter was to be\r\n\ndecided by  the courts,  not the  arbitrator, given  that the\r\n\nparties had expressly agreed that certain subjects, including\r\n\n\"termination  of employment,\"  were not  arbitrable.   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n651.  Thus, we glean from AT&amp;T  that the question whether the\r                                          \r\n\nsubject matter  of the underlying dispute is within the scope\r\n\nof  an   expressly  limited   arbitration  agreement  is   an\r\n\n\"arbitrability\" issue.\r\n\n          In the  case at hand,  it is without  question that\r\n\nPaineWebber  and the  Elahis  are parties  to an  arbitration\r\n\nagreement  of broad  scope, and  that the  underlying dispute\r\n\nover unsuitable  investments concerns a  subject matter  that\r\n\nthey  intended  to   arbitrate.    Nonetheless,   PaineWebber\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\ncontends  that  the NASD  section  15 time  bar  prevents the\r\n\narbitrator from  hearing any aspect of  this dispute, because\r\n\nthe  time bar  is a  \"substantive eligibility  requirement.\" \r\n\nThe question before  us, then, is  whether the timeliness  of\r\n\nsubmission goes to  the \"arbitrability\" of the  merits of the\r\n\nunderlying  dispute,  within  the  meaning of  that  term  as\r\n\nsuggested by AT&amp;T and First Options.\r                                               \r\n\n          The    Supreme    Court    has     twice    defined\r\n\n\"arbitrability\":  in  AT&amp;T as  \"whether the .  . .  agreement\r                                      \r\n\ncreates a duty  for the parties  to arbitrate the  particular\r\n\ngrievance,\" id. at 649; and in First Options as \"whether they\r                                                        \r\n\nagreed to arbitrate the merits\" of the dispute, 115 S. Ct. at\r\n\n1923.    It is  not immediately  obvious  how to  apply these\r\n\ndefinitions  to determine  whether the  NASD time  bar is  an\r\n\narbitrability issue.\r\n\n          One could  say here that \"arbitrability\"  is not an\r\n\nissue, because  the parties  clearly agreed to  arbitrate the\r\n\nmerits   of   disputes    about   investment    transactions.\r\n\nAlternatively, one could say that the  parties only agreed to\r\n\narbitrate investment  disputes less  than six years  old,7 in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  parties  apparently  agree  that the  NASD  Code  of\r\nArbitration  Procedure  was  incorporated  by  reference into\r\ntheir agreement,  even though it was not known at the time of\r\nexecution that the NASD  would be the chosen arbitral  forum.\r\nCf.  PaineWebber Inc. v. Bybyk,  81 F.3d 1193,  1201 (2d Cir.\r                                          \r\n1996) (holding that NASD Code not incorporated into identical\r\nclient-broker   arbitration   agreement   because  NASD   not\r\nidentifiable as actual arbitral forum at time of execution of\r\nthe agreement).\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nwhich case the  time bar would  be an \"arbitrability\"  issue.\r\n\nBut  where does  that  logic  take  us?    Many  a  mandatory\r\n\nprocedural rule  could be  called an \"arbitrability\"  rule if\r\n\nthe failure  to comply  prevented arbitration of  the merits.\r\n\nFor example,  one might say  that, by incorporating  the NASD\r\n\nrules, the  parties agreed  to arbitrate only  those disputes\r\n\nfor  which  the arbitrator's  fee  has  been paid;  questions\r\n\nrelating to  the fee could be  called \"arbitrability\" issues.\r\n\nIt would  be illogical, though,  to conclude that  the court,\r\n\nnot  the  arbitrator, must  determine if  the proper  fee was\r\n\npaid.   Thus,  it  is not  immediately  clear how  we  should\r\n\ndetermine,  at the margins at least,  what is and what is not\r\n\nan  arbitrability   issue.    Seeking  more   light  on  what\r\n\n\"arbitrability\" means and whether the  section 15 time bar is\r\n\nan  \"arbitrability\" issue,  we  next examine  the rulings  of\r\n\nother circuits on the  question whether courts or arbitrators\r\n\napply the section 15 time bar.  \r\n\n               a.

Section 15  of the NASD Code does not\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Some  of the  cited cases  involve an  identical time-bar\r\nrule of the New York Stock Exchange, and we see  no reason to\r\ndistinguish  the cases.  Furthermore, none  of the cases turn\r\non  the minor variations  in the language  of the arbitration\r\nclauses in the broker-client agreements.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nspeak  to  who decides  the  applicability of  the  time bar.\r                          \r\n\nSection   15  does   not   plainly  create   a  question   of\r\n\n\"arbitrability,\"  because it  does  not address  whether  the\r\n\nbasic  subject matter of the  dispute is within  the scope of\r\n\nthe arbitration clause.\r\n\n          One could credibly view  section 15 as analogous to\r\n\na  statute   of  limitations   rather  than   a  \"substantive\r\n\neligibility  requirement.\"    Courts  have  often  held  that\r\n\ntimeliness issues  are for the  arbitrator to decide,  so the\r\n\nmere  fact  that  the  rule  creates   a  time-based  bar  to\r\n\nsuccessful  assertion of a claim does not by itself create an\r\n\n\"arbitrability\"  issue for the court.  See Moses H. Cone, 460\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. at 24-25 (1983); Local 285, Serv.

See PaineWebber Inc. v.  Farnam, 870\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1286,  1292 (7th Cir.  1989).  In our  view, reliance on\r\n\nthe NASD staff attorney's  letter is misplaced.  There  is no\r\n\nassurance  that the  letter represented  the position  of the\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nNASD at the time.  More importantly, it does  not reflect the\r\n\ncurrent view of the  NASD.  Recently, the NASD  has concluded\r\n\nthat section  15 is silent  on whether courts  or arbitrators\r                                      \r\n\ndecide if an action is time-barred.  The NASD has proposed an\r\n\namendment to  section 15  which would  provide that  the NASD\r\n\nDirector   of   Arbitration   would  make   the   eligibility\r\n\ndetermination under the six-year time-bar rule.  59 Fed.

The NASD's 1994  statement seriously\r                                  \r\n\nundermines  the  five-circuit  majority's   \"plain  language\"\r\n\nrationale, as  well as any  reliance on the  staff attorney's\r\n\nletter as an agency opinion entitled to some deference.\r\n\n          In sum, we are not persuaded by the analysis of the\r\n\nfive-circuit majority.\r\n\n                    ii.

In our  view,  the\r\nwithdrawal  of the  proposed  amendment does  not negate  the\r\nsignificance of the NASD's statement in 1994 that  section 15\r\ndoes  not specify who  decides the applicability  of the time\r\nbar. \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\n          Four  circuits  -- the  Second, Fifth,  Eighth, and\r\n\nNinth --  take the view  that the  section 15 time  bar is  a\r\n\nmatter for the arbitrator to decide.  While we agree with the\r\n\nresult  these  circuits  reach,  in our  view,  their  varied\r\n\nanalyses leave important questions unanswered.  \r\n\n          In Smith  Barney Shearson,  Inc. v.

The Fourth  Circuit, which has not  decided the question\r\npresented  here,  appears  to   embrace  the  \"substance  vs.\r\nprocedure\"  approach of  the  Fifth Circuit.

That result\r\nfollowed from  the court's finding that  the NASD arbitration\r\nrules related  only to  arbitration \"procedure,\" and  not the\r\n\"substantive  rules  that  may  bear  on  the merits  of  the\r\nunderlying  dispute.\"  Id.   It would appear  that the Fourth\r                                      \r\nCircuit's  analytical  approach  (i.e., that  the  procedural\r                                                  \r\nrules  of  the  arbitral   forum  are  incorporated  into  an\r\narbitration agreement only  to govern arbitration  procedure)\r\nwould lead  to the same result with  respect to the NASD time\r\nbar:    the NASD  Code  of  Arbitration Procedure,  including\r\nsection 15, is for the arbitrator to interpret and apply.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          The Eighth Circuit held that section 15 was for the\r\n\narbitrator to apply, but declined to address whether the NASD\r\n\ntime bar was procedural  or substantive.

Instead, the\r                 \r\n\ncourt in Freel determined that  another provision of the NASD\r                          \r\n\nCode  of Arbitration Procedure, section 35,  was a \"clear and\r\n\nunmistakable expression\"  of the parties' intent  to have the\r\n\narbitrator decide  the applicability  of the section  15 time\r\n\nbar.

Thus,  the Second  Circuit\r                                   \r\n\nrelied on several  alternative grounds to find that  the time\r\n\nbar should be applied by the arbitrator.\r\n\n          The Ninth  Circuit has  held that \"the  validity of\r\n\ntime-barred defenses to enforcement of arbitration agreements\r\n\nshould generally be determined  by the arbitrator rather than\r\n\nthe  court.

After all, the intent of the parties\r\n\nalways controls what is  to be arbitrated.  AT&amp;T, 475 U.S. at\r                                                            \r\n\n648.    Given  the  existence  here  of  a  valid  and  broad\r\n\narbitration  clause  covering \"all  controversies\" concerning\r\n\ninvestment transactions \"or the construction,  performance or\r\n\nbreach  of this  or  any other  agreement,\"  did the  parties\r\n\nintend  that  the time  bar  of section  15  should determine\r                  \r\n\n\"arbitrability\"  as  that term  is  used  in AT&amp;T  and  First\r                                                                         \r\n\nOptions?\r                   \r\n\n          If the  parties  clearly intend  that a  particular\r\n\nissue must be resolved by the courts before there is any duty\r\n\nto submit to arbitration,  then the courts must respect  that\r\n\nintent by deciding the issue.  See AT&amp;T, 475 U.S. at 648.  On\r                                                   \r\n\nthe other hand, if it is ambiguous whether the parties intend\r\n\na  given issue to be an \"arbitrability\" issue, we must make a\r\n\nsensible presumption about their intent.\r\n\n          Thus, if the parties have  (1) entered into a valid\r\n\narbitration     agreement    (satisfying     First    Options\r                                                                         \r\n\n\"arbitrability\"),  and (2)  the arbitration  agreement covers\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nthe  subject matter  of the  underlying dispute  between them\r\n\n(satisfying AT&amp;T \"arbitrability\"), then we will  presume that\r                            \r\n\nthe  parties have  made a  commitment to  have an  arbitrator\r\n\ndecide all the remaining issues necessary to reach a decision\r\n\non the merits of  the dispute.  Put differently,  the signing\r\n\nof a valid agreement  to arbitrate the merits of  the subject\r\n\nmatter in dispute presumptively pushes the parties across the\r\n\n\"arbitrability\" threshold; we  will then  presume that  other\r\n\nissues  relating  to  the substance  of  the  dispute  or the\r\n\nprocedures of arbitration are for the  arbitrator.  Cf. Moses\r                                                                         \r\n\nH. Cone,  460 U.S. at 24-25.  But, if the parties clearly and\r                   \r\n\nunmistakably provide that an issue is one of \"arbitrability\"\r\n\n-- i.e.,  that the issue is  a threshold matter  that must be\r                   \r\n\ndetermined before  any adjudicative power will  be granted to\r\n\nthe  arbitrator --  then  the court  must respect  that clear\r\n\nexpression of intent and  decide that threshold issue, rather\r\n\nthan compelling arbitration.\r\n\n          This presumption  about whether  an  issue goes  to\r\n\n\"arbitrability\" is  consistent with  both the federal  policy\r\n\nfavoring arbitration and common sense about the likely intent\r\n\nof parties who have agreed to arbitrate the subject matter of\r\n\nthe  underlying dispute.   We believe  that parties  who have\r\n\nagreed to  arbitrate a given  subject most likely  intend and\r\n\nexpect  that the  arbitrator should  resolve all  issues that\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\narise  concerning that subject; if they do not, we think they\r\n\nwould clearly express their contrary intent.\r\n\n          The  presumption  that  we  now  adopt  (i.e., that\r                                                                   \r\n\nissues  other  than  (1)  the  existence  of  an  arbitration\r\n\nagreement  between the  parties and  (2) whether  the subject\r\n\nmatter of the underlying  dispute is within the scope  of the\r\n\narbitration  clause  are  presumptively  not  \"arbitrability\"\r\n\nissues) must not be confused with -- and in no way diminishes\r\n\n-- the  presumption, established  in AT&amp;T and  First Options,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthat issues of  arbitrability are normally  to be decided  by\r\n\ncourts, not arbitrators.  The presumption that we adopt today\r\n\nis  about whether  an issue  is one  of \"arbitrability\";  the\r                             \r\n\nAT&amp;T/First Options  presumption is  about who  decides issues\r                                                                  \r\n\nthat have been classified as \"arbitrability\" issues.\r\n\n          The Court explained  in First Options that  parties\r                                                           \r\n\nare  unlikely to have focused  on the question  of who should\r\n\ndecide arbitrability, and therefore the courts should presume\r\n\nthat they did not intend to submit arbitrability issues to an\r\n\narbitrator.  115 S.  Ct. at 1924-25.   This is obvious  where\r\n\nthe \"arbitrability\" question is whether there is an agreement\r\n\nat all (as in  First Options); certainly a party  who did not\r                                        \r\n\nsign  the  agreement  did  not  consider  who  should  decide\r\n\narbitrability.   This presumption  (that arbitrability issues\r\n\nare for the courts) also makes sense where the subject matter\r\n\nof the dispute may be outside the scope of an otherwise valid\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nagreement  (as in AT&amp;T); in  such a case,  the parties likely\r                                  \r\n\nbelieved  that it was  enough to exclude  certain issues from\r\n\nthe arbitration clause, and probably  did not think about the\r\n\narbitrator's power to decide  whether a particular close case\r\n\nwas excluded or not.\r\n\n          On the  other hand, where the  parties have clearly\r\n\nagreed  to arbitrate  the subject  of the  underlying dispute\r\n\nbetween them, as the  parties have here, it is  unlikely that\r\n\nthey intended  other issues related  to the dispute,  such as\r\n\nthe  timeliness of the submission of the claim, to affect the\r\n\n\"arbitrability\"  of   the  dispute.     Such  an   intent  is\r\n\nparticularly  unlikely  where  the arbitration  clause  is as\r\n\nbroad  as it  is in  this case.   Thus,  we presume  that the\r\n\nparties here did not intend to make the section 15 time bar a\r\n\nthreshold \"arbitrability\" question  to be  determined by  the\r\n\ncourts rather than an arbitrator.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          2. Did the parties clearly and unmistakably express\r                                                                         \r\n\n          an   intent  to   make   the  NASD   time  bar   an\r                                                                         \r\n\n          \"arbitrability\" issue?\r                                            \r\n\n            Although  we presume  that the  time bar  was not\r\n\nintended  to be an arbitrability issue, we do not stop there;\r\n\nwe must look closely at the agreement between PaineWebber and\r\n\nthe Elahis for  any clear and  unmistakable expression of  an\r\n\nintent  contrary  to that  presumption.    We apply  \"general\r\n\nstate-law  principles  of   contract  interpretation\"  to  an\r\n\narbitration agreement,  but with \"due regard\"  to the federal\r\n\npolicy favoring arbitration.

[the NASD].\"11   PaineWebber's  argument\r\n\nthat  the time bar is  an arbitrability issue  centers on the\r\n\n\"eligible  for  submission\"  language  of  section  15   (\"No\r\n\ndispute,  claim,  or   controversy  shall  be   eligible  for\r                                                                         \r\n\nsubmission to arbitration under this Code where six (6) years\r                      \r\n\nhave  elapsed  .  . .  .\").    PaineWebber  asserts that  the\r\n\narbitrator  is  only empowered  to  act  on claims  that  are\r\n\n\"eligible  for submission\" to the NASD,  thus someone else --\r\n\nthe  court --  must  decide  if  a  claim  is  \"eligible  for\r\n\nsubmission.\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  The notion of the Elahis having an intent with regard to\r\nsection 15 is somewhat artificial -- it seems unlikely that a\r\nsmall, private investor would  have any specific knowledge of\r\nthe  NASD arbitration  rules.   But the  parties here  do not\r\ndispute  that the  NASD rules  were effectively  incorporated\r\ninto their  agreement, nor  is  there any  argument that  the\r\nagreement was an unconscionable  contract of adhesion.  Thus,\r\nby incorporation, the  parties have committed to  be bound by\r\nsection 15, whether  or not  they even knew  it existed,  let\r\nalone  understood what it meant.   See Level  Export Corp. v.\r                                                                      \r\nWolz, Aiken &amp; Co.,  111 N.E.2d 218, 221 (N.Y.  1953) (one who\r                             \r\naccepts a contract is deemed to know its contents).\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n          As we concluded earlier  in our analysis of whether\r\n\nthe time bar presented an arbitrability  issue, PaineWebber's\r\n\nview  is  plausible,  but  it   is  not  the  only  plausible\r\n\ninterpretation of this  phrase.  \"Submission  to arbitration\"\r\n\ncould mean  submission for  full adjudication of  the merits,\r\n\nrather than  submission for preliminary  determinations, such\r\n\nas  whether   the  claim  is  time-barred,   or  whether  the\r\n\nappropriate fee was paid, or whether the  claim was submitted\r\n\non the proper forms.  The NASD itself  recently stated, as we\r\n\nhave noted, that  \"Section 15  does not specify  who has  the\r\n\nauthority  to determine if a claim is eligible for submission\r\n\nto arbitration.\"   59 Fed. Reg. 39,373,  39,373-74, quoted in\r                                                                         \r\n\nCogswell, 78 F.3d at 479-80.   Thus, we conclude, as  did the\r                    \r\n\nNASD itself,  that the \"eligible for  submission\" language in\r\n\nsection  15 is  not  a clear  expression  of intent  to  make\r\n\ntimeliness an arbitrability issue.\r\n\n          A  number  of  other  considerations   support  our\r\n\nconclusion  that section 15 was not clearly intended to be an\r\n\narbitrability  issue  for judicial  determination.12   First,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.

If  the parties  expressly  intend  a\r\ntimeliness  issue  (or  other  procedural  issue)  to  be  an\r\n\"arbitrability\" issue that the arbitrator cannot decide, then\r\nwe  must respect that contractual intent.  Thus, we think our\r\nanalysis better reflects the primacy of the parties' intent.\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nprocedures, rather  than a rule that  is somehow \"off-limits\"\r\n\nfor arbitrators to apply.\r\n\n          Third, the NASD rules only come into play after the\r\n\nNASD has been  chosen as  the arbitral forum.   Although  the\r\n\nother potential  forums specified in the parties' arbitration\r\n\nclause  appear to have a nearly  identical six-year time bar,\r\n\nthey might,  in theory,  have very different  time-bar rules,\r\n\nwith different time  periods, or different language  (perhaps\r\n\nphrased in  terms  of \"eligibility  for submission,\"  perhaps\r\n\nnot).  If  other forums did  have differently phrased  rules,\r\n\nthe question whether timeliness presented  an \"arbitrability\"\r\n\nissue would depend on which  of the potential arbitral forums\r\n\nwas chosen.   If the parties  intended to make  a time bar  a\r\n\nthreshold  issue   for   judicial,  rather   than   arbitral,\r\n\ndetermination,  it  seems  unlikely  that they  would  do  so\r\n\nthrough such potentially unreliable means.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          Because   the  parties  agreed  to  arbitrate  \"all\r\n\ncontroversies\" concerning investment transactions, as well as\r\n\ncontroversies concerning the  construction, performance,  and\r\n\nbreach  of the  arbitration agreement,  we presume  that they\r\n\nintended  to arbitrate  the timeliness  of the  submission of\r\n\nthis dispute about investments.   Finding no clear expression\r\n\nof  an intent contrary to  our presumption, we  hold that the\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\ninterpretation and  application of  the six-year time  bar of\r\n\nsection  15 is a matter for the arbitrator.

On August 3, 1994, the Elahis and\r\n\nPaineWebber executed  an agreement  to toll, as  of June  28,\r\n\n1994, the  running of all  statutes of limitations  and other\r\n\ndefenses based  on the passage of time,  apparently hoping to\r\n\nreach a  negotiated settlement.   The  effective date  of the\r\n\ntolling agreement was more than seven years after the Elahis'\r\n\nlast purchase of an investment from PaineWebber.  \r\n\n          On December 29, 1994,  the Elahis filed a Statement\r\n\nof Claim with the National Association of Securities Dealers,\r\n\nInc.

PaineWebber responded by  bringing this\r\n\naction for declaratory and  injunctive relief, seeking to bar\r\n\nthe arbitration of the  Elahis' claims.

Specifically, PaineWebber  pointed to Section  15 of\r\n\nthe NASD Code of  Arbitration Procedure (\"section 15\"), which\r\n\nprovides:\r\n\n          Time Limitation Upon Submission\r                                                     \r\n               Sec.  15.   No  dispute,  claim,  or\r\n          controversy   shall   be   eligible   for\r\n          submission to arbitration under this Code\r\n          where six (6) years have elapsed from the\r\n          occurrence  or event  giving rise  to the\r\n          act  or  dispute, claim,  or controversy.\r\n          This section shall not  extend applicable\r\n          statutes  of  limitations,  nor shall  it\r\n          apply to  any case  which is  directed to\r\n          arbitration  by  a  court   of  competent\r\n          jurisdiction.\r\n\nPaineWebber  postulated  that  the  Elahis' claims  were  not\r\n\n\"eligible   for  submission  to   arbitration\"  because  they\r\n\nconcerned securities  purchased more than  seven years before\r\n\nthe effective date  of the tolling  agreement and over  eight\r\n\nyears before  the claim  for arbitration was  filed with  the\r\n\nNASD.  The Elahis' countered by filing motions (1) to dismiss\r\n\nPaineWebber's complaint  and (2) to compel  arbitration under\r\n\nthe Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.   4.\r\n\n          The  district court  granted  the Elahis'  motions.\r\n\nThe  court  found   that  the  parties  had  signed  a  valid\r\n\narbitration  agreement  covering  disputes   over  investment\r\n\ntransactions, and  consequently ruled that  the applicability\r\n\nof the time-bar provision of section 15 was a question to  be\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndetermined  by  the   arbitrator  rather  than  the   court.1\r\n\nPaineWebber appeals.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          PaineWebber argues  on appeal  that the section  15\r\n\ntime bar makes the Elahis' claims ineligible for arbitration,\r\n\nand that the  court, not the arbitrator must therefore decide\r\n\nthe timeliness  question.   The  issue  before us,  then,  is\r\n\nwhether the time-bar provision is to be construed and applied\r\n\nby the  arbitrator  or  by the  court.2   We  are  the  tenth\r\n\ncircuit court  to address that question;  our sister circuits\r\n\nare split  five-to-four.   The Third, Sixth,  Seventh, Tenth,\r\n\nand Eleventh Circuits  have held that  the court must  decide\r\n\nthe applicability  of the  section 15  time bar;  the Second,\r\n\nFifth,  and Eighth,  and  Ninth Circuits  have held  that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

Ultimately,  the arbitrator  or the  court will  probably\r\nneed to  determine (1) whether the  only relevant \"occurrence\r\nor event\" triggering the time bar was the Elahis' purchase of\r\ninvestments, or whether the time bar should be measured  from\r\nthe date of alleged  subsequent acts or omissions related  to\r\nthe  investments, and (2) whether the time bar is absolute or\r\nsubject  to  equitable tolling.    We need  not  decide those\r\nissues.   We are faced  solely with the  question whether the\r\ndistrict  court correctly referred the time bar issues to the\r\narbitrator, or should have decided them itself.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\narbitrator decides.3   In our  view, this  body of  appellate\r\n\ncaselaw leaves important aspects of the  problem unaddressed,\r\n\nas  we  shall explain.

Here, the  breadth  of the  arbitration\r\n\nclause --  encompassing \"all  controversies . .  . concerning\r\n\nany transaction\"  as well as the  \"construction, performance,\r\n\nor breach\" of the agreement  -- militates against reading the\r\n\nchoice-of-law clause  as a  limit on the  arbitrator's power.\r\n\nMoreover,  the agreement provides  that \"arbitration shall be\r\n\nin accordance with the rules in  effect of the . . . [NASD],\"\r\n\nwhich  further  undermines the  likelihood  that the  parties\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nintended  to adopt  arbitration rules  contained in  New York\r\n\ncaselaw.    In sum, we can  do no better than  to borrow from\r\n\nMastrobuono:\r                       \r\n\n          We  think the  best way to  harmonize the\r\n          choice-of-law    provision    with    the\r\n          arbitration  provision  is  to read  \"the\r\n          laws  of  the  State  of  New   York\"  to\r\n          encompass substantive principles that New\r\n          York  courts  would  apply,  but  not  to\r\n          include   special   rules  limiting   the\r\n          authority  of  arbitrators.    Thus,  the\r\n          choice-of-law provision covers the rights\r\n          and  duties of  the  parties,  while  the\r\n          arbitration clause covers arbitration . .\r\n          . .\r\n\nId. at 1219.\r               \r\n\n          Thus,  relying  on Mastrobuono,  we  hold  that the\r                                                    \r\n\nparties' contractual choice of New York law  does not require\r\n\na  judicial determination  of  the effect  of  the NASD  Code\r\n\nsection  15  time  bar.5     We  move  on  to   consider  the\r\n\narbitration clause  itself (and the NASD  Code of Arbitration\r\n\nProcedure  incorporated therein)  to determine,  in light  of\r\n\nfederal arbitration  law, whether  the parties  intended that\r\n\nthe arbitrator or the court apply the time bar.\r\n\nB.

The Supreme  Court held that the issue\r\n\nwhether \"layoffs\" were an arbitrable subject matter was to be\r\n\ndecided by  the courts,  not the  arbitrator, given  that the\r\n\nparties had expressly agreed that certain subjects, including\r\n\n\"termination  of employment,\"  were not  arbitrable.

Thus, we glean from AT&amp;T  that the question whether the\r                                          \r\n\nsubject matter  of the underlying dispute is within the scope\r\n\nof  an   expressly  limited   arbitration  agreement  is   an\r\n\n\"arbitrability\" issue.\r\n\n          In the  case at hand,  it is without  question that\r\n\nPaineWebber  and the  Elahis  are parties  to an  arbitration\r\n\nagreement  of broad  scope, and  that the  underlying dispute\r\n\nover unsuitable  investments concerns a  subject matter  that\r\n\nthey  intended  to   arbitrate.    Nonetheless,   PaineWebber\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\ncontends  that  the NASD  section  15 time  bar  prevents the\r\n\narbitrator from  hearing any aspect of  this dispute, because\r\n\nthe  time bar  is a  \"substantive eligibility  requirement.\" \r\n\nThe question before  us, then, is  whether the timeliness  of\r\n\nsubmission goes to  the \"arbitrability\" of the  merits of the\r\n\nunderlying  dispute,  within  the  meaning of  that  term  as\r\n\nsuggested by AT&amp;T and First Options.\r                                               \r\n\n          The    Supreme    Court    has     twice    defined\r\n\n\"arbitrability\":  in  AT&amp;T as  \"whether the .  . .  agreement\r                                      \r\n\ncreates a duty  for the parties  to arbitrate the  particular\r\n\ngrievance,\" id. at 649; and in First Options as \"whether they\r                                                        \r\n\nagreed to arbitrate the merits\" of the dispute, 115 S. Ct. at\r\n\n1923.    It is  not immediately  obvious  how to  apply these\r\n\ndefinitions  to determine  whether the  NASD time  bar is  an\r\n\narbitrability issue.\r\n\n          One could  say here that \"arbitrability\"  is not an\r\n\nissue, because  the parties  clearly agreed to  arbitrate the\r\n\nmerits   of   disputes    about   investment    transactions.\r\n\nAlternatively, one could say that the  parties only agreed to\r\n\narbitrate investment  disputes less  than six years  old,7 in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  parties  apparently  agree  that the  NASD  Code  of\r\nArbitration  Procedure  was  incorporated  by  reference into\r\ntheir agreement,  even though it was not known at the time of\r\nexecution that the NASD  would be the chosen arbitral  forum.\r\nCf.

Many  a  mandatory\r\n\nprocedural rule  could be  called an \"arbitrability\"  rule if\r\n\nthe failure  to comply  prevented arbitration of  the merits.\r\n\nFor example,  one might say  that, by incorporating  the NASD\r\n\nrules, the  parties agreed  to arbitrate only  those disputes\r\n\nfor  which  the arbitrator's  fee  has  been paid;  questions\r\n\nrelating to  the fee could be  called \"arbitrability\" issues.\r\n\nIt would  be illogical, though,  to conclude that  the court,\r\n\nnot  the  arbitrator, must  determine if  the proper  fee was\r\n\npaid.   Thus,  it  is not  immediately  clear how  we  should\r\n\ndetermine,  at the margins at least,  what is and what is not\r\n\nan  arbitrability   issue.

More importantly, it does  not reflect the\r\n\ncurrent view of the  NASD.

See AT&amp;T, 475 U.S. at 648.  On\r                                                   \r\n\nthe other hand, if it is ambiguous whether the parties intend\r\n\na  given issue to be an \"arbitrability\" issue, we must make a\r\n\nsensible presumption about their intent.\r\n\n          Thus, if the parties have  (1) entered into a valid\r\n\narbitration     agreement    (satisfying     First    Options\r                                                                         \r\n\n\"arbitrability\"),  and (2)  the arbitration  agreement covers\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nthe  subject matter  of the  underlying dispute  between them\r\n\n(satisfying AT&amp;T \"arbitrability\"), then we will  presume that\r                            \r\n\nthe  parties have  made a  commitment to  have an  arbitrator\r\n\ndecide all the remaining issues necessary to reach a decision\r\n\non the merits of  the dispute.  Put differently,  the signing\r\n\nof a valid agreement  to arbitrate the merits of  the subject\r\n\nmatter in dispute presumptively pushes the parties across the\r\n\n\"arbitrability\" threshold; we  will then  presume that  other\r\n\nissues  relating  to  the substance  of  the  dispute  or the\r\n\nprocedures of arbitration are for the  arbitrator.  Cf. Moses\r                                                                         \r\n\nH. Cone,  460 U.S. at 24-25.  But, if the parties clearly and\r                   \r\n\nunmistakably provide that an issue is one of \"arbitrability\"\r\n\n-- i.e.,  that the issue is  a threshold matter  that must be\r                   \r\n\ndetermined before  any adjudicative power will  be granted to\r\n\nthe  arbitrator --  then  the court  must respect  that clear\r\n\nexpression of intent and  decide that threshold issue, rather\r\n\nthan compelling arbitration.\r\n\n          This presumption  about whether  an  issue goes  to\r\n\n\"arbitrability\" is  consistent with  both the federal  policy\r\n\nfavoring arbitration and common sense about the likely intent\r\n\nof parties who have agreed to arbitrate the subject matter of\r\n\nthe  underlying dispute.   We believe  that parties  who have\r\n\nagreed to  arbitrate a given  subject most likely  intend and\r\n\nexpect  that the  arbitrator should  resolve all  issues that\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\narise  concerning that subject; if they do not, we think they\r\n\nwould clearly express their contrary intent.\r\n\n          The  presumption  that  we  now  adopt  (i.e., that\r                                                                   \r\n\nissues  other  than  (1)  the  existence  of  an  arbitration\r\n\nagreement  between the  parties and  (2) whether  the subject\r\n\nmatter of the underlying  dispute is within the scope  of the\r\n\narbitration  clause  are  presumptively  not  \"arbitrability\"\r\n\nissues) must not be confused with -- and in no way diminishes\r\n\n-- the  presumption, established  in AT&amp;T and  First Options,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthat issues of  arbitrability are normally  to be decided  by\r\n\ncourts, not arbitrators.  The presumption that we adopt today\r\n\nis  about whether  an issue  is one  of \"arbitrability\";  the\r                             \r\n\nAT&amp;T/First Options  presumption is  about who  decides issues\r                                                                  \r\n\nthat have been classified as \"arbitrability\" issues.\r\n\n          The Court explained  in First Options that  parties\r                                                           \r\n\nare  unlikely to have focused  on the question  of who should\r\n\ndecide arbitrability, and therefore the courts should presume\r\n\nthat they did not intend to submit arbitrability issues to an\r\n\narbitrator.  115 S.  Ct. at 1924-25.   This is obvious  where\r\n\nthe \"arbitrability\" question is whether there is an agreement\r\n\nat all (as in  First Options); certainly a party  who did not\r                                        \r\n\nsign  the  agreement  did  not  consider  who  should  decide\r\n\narbitrability.   This presumption  (that arbitrability issues\r\n\nare for the courts) also makes sense where the subject matter\r\n\nof the dispute may be outside the scope of an otherwise valid\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nagreement  (as in AT&amp;T); in  such a case,  the parties likely\r                                  \r\n\nbelieved  that it was  enough to exclude  certain issues from\r\n\nthe arbitration clause, and probably  did not think about the\r\n\narbitrator's power to decide  whether a particular close case\r\n\nwas excluded or not.\r\n\n          On the  other hand, where the  parties have clearly\r\n\nagreed  to arbitrate  the subject  of the  underlying dispute\r\n\nbetween them, as the  parties have here, it is  unlikely that\r\n\nthey intended  other issues related  to the dispute,  such as\r\n\nthe  timeliness of the submission of the claim, to affect the\r\n\n\"arbitrability\"  of   the  dispute.     Such  an   intent  is\r\n\nparticularly  unlikely  where  the arbitration  clause  is as\r\n\nbroad  as it  is in  this case.   Thus,  we presume  that the\r\n\nparties here did not intend to make the section 15 time bar a\r\n\nthreshold \"arbitrability\" question  to be  determined by  the\r\n\ncourts rather than an arbitrator.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          2.

We apply  \"general\r\n\nstate-law  principles  of   contract  interpretation\"  to  an\r\n\narbitration agreement,  but with \"due regard\"  to the federal\r\n\npolicy favoring arbitration.

The agreement simply\r\n\nsays that \"arbitration  shall be in accordance with the rules\r\n\nin effect of  . .  . [the NASD].\"11   PaineWebber's  argument\r\n\nthat  the time bar is  an arbitrability issue  centers on the\r\n\n\"eligible  for  submission\"  language  of  section  15   (\"No\r\n\ndispute,  claim,  or   controversy  shall  be   eligible  for\r                                                                         \r\n\nsubmission to arbitration under this Code where six (6) years\r                      \r\n\nhave  elapsed  .  . .  .\").    PaineWebber  asserts that  the\r\n\narbitrator  is  only empowered  to  act  on claims  that  are\r\n\n\"eligible  for submission\" to the NASD,  thus someone else --\r\n\nthe  court --  must  decide  if  a  claim  is  \"eligible  for\r\n\nsubmission.\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  The notion of the Elahis having an intent with regard to\r\nsection 15 is somewhat artificial -- it seems unlikely that a\r\nsmall, private investor would  have any specific knowledge of\r\nthe  NASD arbitration  rules.   But the  parties here  do not\r\ndispute  that the  NASD rules  were effectively  incorporated\r\ninto their  agreement, nor  is  there any  argument that  the\r\nagreement was an unconscionable  contract of adhesion.  Thus,\r\nby incorporation, the  parties have committed to  be bound by\r\nsection 15, whether  or not  they even knew  it existed,  let\r\nalone  understood what it meant.

The NASD itself  recently stated, as we\r\n\nhave noted, that  \"Section 15  does not specify  who has  the\r\n\nauthority  to determine if a claim is eligible for submission\r\n\nto arbitration.\"   59 Fed.

Thus, we conclude, as  did the\r                    \r\n\nNASD itself,  that the \"eligible for  submission\" language in\r\n\nsection  15 is  not  a clear  expression  of intent  to  make\r\n\ntimeliness an arbitrability issue.\r\n\n          A  number  of  other  considerations   support  our\r\n\nconclusion  that section 15 was not clearly intended to be an\r\n\narbitrability  issue  for judicial  determination.12   First,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.

We\r                                                \r\nrejected   that  argument,   explaining  that   the  employer\r\n\"misapprehend[ed]  the  distinction  between substantive  and\r\nprocedural arbitrability.\"   Id.

If  the parties  expressly  intend  a\r\ntimeliness  issue  (or  other  procedural  issue)  to  be  an\r\n\"arbitrability\" issue that the arbitrator cannot decide, then\r\nwe  must respect that contractual intent.  Thus, we think our\r\nanalysis better reflects the primacy of the parties' intent.\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nprocedures, rather  than a rule that  is somehow \"off-limits\"\r\n\nfor arbitrators to apply.\r\n\n          Third, the NASD rules only come into play after the\r\n\nNASD has been  chosen as  the arbitral forum.   Although  the\r\n\nother potential  forums specified in the parties' arbitration\r\n\nclause  appear to have a nearly  identical six-year time bar,\r\n\nthey might,  in theory,  have very different  time-bar rules,\r\n\nwith different time  periods, or different language  (perhaps\r\n\nphrased in  terms  of \"eligibility  for submission,\"  perhaps\r\n\nnot).  If  other forums did  have differently phrased  rules,\r\n\nthe question whether timeliness presented  an \"arbitrability\"\r\n\nissue would depend on which  of the potential arbitral forums\r\n\nwas chosen.   If the parties  intended to make  a time bar  a\r\n\nthreshold  issue   for   judicial,  rather   than   arbitral,\r\n\ndetermination,  it  seems  unlikely  that they  would  do  so\r\n\nthrough such potentially unreliable means.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          Because   the  parties  agreed  to  arbitrate  \"all\r\n\ncontroversies\" concerning investment transactions, as well as\r\n\ncontroversies concerning the  construction, performance,  and\r\n\nbreach  of the  arbitration agreement,  we presume  that they\r\n\nintended  to arbitrate  the timeliness  of the  submission of\r\n\nthis dispute about investments.   Finding no clear expression\r\n\nof  an intent contrary to  our presumption, we  hold that the\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\ninterpretation and  application of  the six-year time  bar of\r\n\nsection  15 is a matter for the arbitrator.
