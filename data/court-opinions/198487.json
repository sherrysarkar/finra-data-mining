FRACASSO,\n\n                           Debtor,\n                                         \n\n                     MARILYN A.

GEORGE REDER, TRUSTEE,\n\n                          Appellant.\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL\n\n                    OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                           Before\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n   L. George Reder on brief pro se.\n   Kirk Whitaker Jones, Louis S. Robin and Fitzgerald, O'Brien,\nRobin &amp; Shapiro on brief for appellee.\n\nMay 15, 1999\n\n          Per Curiam.   Debtor-appellee Marilyn A. Fracasso\nclaimed a homestead exemption under the Massachusetts homestead\nstatute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, 1.  The trustee-appellant L.\nGeorge Reder, the Chapter 7 trustee in bankruptcy of the\ndebtor, filed an Objection to Debtor's Claim of Exemptions, on\nthe ground that the debts were contracted prior to the formal\nacquisition of the homestead estate and, therefore, were\nexcepted from the exemption. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188,\n1(2).  The bankruptcy court sustained the objection, ruling\nthat \"522(c) of the Code does not restrict the right of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, as reserved to the states by\nCongress, to craft its Homestead Statute with an exception for\nprehomestead debts.\"  In re Fracasso, 210 B.R. 221, 228 (Bankr.\nD. Mass. 1997).  \n          The United States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the\nFirst Circuit (\"BAP\") reversed the bankruptcy court's order\nsustaining the trustee's objection to the debtor's homestead\nexemption.  See In re Fracasso, 222 B.R. 400 (1st Cir. BAP\n(Mass.) 1998).  The BAP (in reliance upon a decision by another\npanel of that court) held that \" 522(c)[of the Bankruptcy\nCode] overrides the provision in the state statute excepting\nfrom the debtor's homestead exemption contractual obligations\nincurred prior to acquisition of the homestead estate.\" Id. at\n401.  The trustee appeals from the BAP's judgment reversing the\nbankruptcy court's order.\n          The sole issue on appeal is whether the Bankruptcy\nCode preempts Mass. Gen. L. ch.  1(2), excepting from the\nexemption statute debts contracted prior to the acquisition of\nthe homestead.  This very issue was recently decided by another\npanel of this court. In In re Weinstein, 164 F.3d 677, 683 (1st\nCir. 1999), this court held that \"section 1(2) of the homestead\nstatute is preempted by  522(c) of the Code.\"  We are bound by\nthat prior panel decision. See United States v. Caron, 64 F.3d\n713, 718 (1st Cir. 1995).\n          The judgment of the BAP, dated July 15, 1998, is\naffirmed. See Loc. R. 27.1. \n",
