(\"Miniter\")   appeals  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  grant  of  summary judgment  in  favor  of\r\n\ndefendant-appellee   Ohio   Indemnity  Company   (\"Ohio\")  on\r\n\nMiniter's six-count  complaint for  damages arising out  of a\r\n\ndispute over  right to commissions.1   Finding  no error,  we\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          Miniter, an insurance  brokerage located in Quincy,\r\n\nMassachusetts, serves  over four hundred  and fifty insureds,\r\n\nthree  hundred  of  which   are  banks  and  other  financial\r\n\ninstitutions.  Banks and  financial institutions need,  among\r\n\nothers, a type of insurance known as Vender's Single Interest\r\n\nInsurance  (\"VSI\"), which  insures lenders  against potential\r\n\nlosses arising from the differential between the actual value\r\n\nof  a  vehicle  being  financed  and  the  lender's  security\r\n\ninterest.   VSI  is offered  by  Ohio, an  insurance  company\r\n\nlocated in Columbus.  \r\n\n          In  1984, Miniter  became  broker  for  Connecticut\r\n\nNational Bank  (\"CNB\")  and procured  a  VSI policy  for  CNB\r\n\nthrough Fidelity and  Deposit Insurance Company (\"Fidelity\").\r\n\nIn  1988, CNB  merged  with Shawmut  Bank (\"Shawmut\"),  which\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  As   amended,  Miniter's  complaint   alleged  breach  of\r\ncontract, breach of  the implied covenant  of good faith  and\r\nfair dealing,  breach of  fiduciary duty,  unjust enrichment,\r\ninterference  with advantageous  relations, and  violation of\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A,    2, 9, and 11.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ncontinued to meet its insurance needs  through Miniter.  That\r\n\nsame   year,  Fidelity  stopped   issuing  VSI   policies  in\r\n\nMassachusetts, and  Miniter moved Shawmut's  VSI coverage  to\r\n\nTravelers  Insurance  Company  (\"Travelers\").     Eventually,\r\n\nTravelers  also discontinued  its  VSI  business,  which  led\r\n\nMiniter to solicit a  VSI proposal from Ohio.  In  1990, Ohio\r\n\nagreed to  provide  VSI  to Shawmut,  and  Miniter  and  Ohio\r\n\nentered   into   an  agency   agreement  to   effectuate  the\r\n\narrangement.\r\n\n          Miniter  characterizes  the  agreement  as  a  non-\r\n\nexclusive   agency  agreement  under  which  Miniter  had  no\r\n\nobligation to  issue insurance exclusively through Ohio; Ohio\r\n\nhad  no  obligation  to  accept  only  policies  brokered  by\r\n\nMiniter.   The agency agreement contained  several provisions\r\n\nrelevant to  this dispute.   First, it provided  that Miniter\r\n\nwould  receive commissions  of 20%  of the  premiums  paid on\r\n\npolicies  issued  by  Ohio  to  \"policyholders  obtained\"  by\r\n\nMiniter.  Second, it provided that should a conflict arise as\r\n\nto which agent  was entitled to  commissions on a  particular\r\n\npolicy, \"the policyholder's written statement designating his\r\n\nagent  or broker  shall be  binding\" upon  Miniter and  Ohio.\r\n\nThird,  the  agreement  provided  that   Miniter's  right  to\r\n\ncommissions  would  cease  upon  proper  cancellation of  the\r\n\npolicy.  Finally, Ohio  orally agreed not to contact  or deal\r\n\ndirectly with Shawmut without involving Miniter.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          In September 1990, Ohio issued the first of two VSI\r\n\npolicies  to Shawmut.   The  first policy  provided \"run-off\"\r\n\ncoverage, meaning  that should either Shawmut  or Ohio cancel\r\n\nthe policy, Ohio would be obligated to continue coverage  for\r\n\nany vehicle insured  during the life of the policy.  In order\r\n\nto provide run-off coverage, Ohio needed to hold a portion of\r\n\neach  premium   in  reserve  for  potential   future  claims.\r\n\nAccording to  Ohio, the run-off coverage  rendered its policy\r\n\nto  Shawmut unprofitable.   Miniter, however,  viewed run-off\r\n\ncoverage  as  an  essential element  of  any  VSI policy  for\r\n\nShawmut.\r\n\n          In  the spring  of 1993  David  Juredine, Miniter's\r\n\ncontact at Ohio, began to indicate to Arthur Donley, Chairman\r\n\nof the  Board and  Chief Executive  Officer of  Miniter, that\r\n\nOhio wished  to cease providing run-off  coverage to Shawmut.\r\n\nIn the spring of 1994, Juredine indicated to Donley that Ohio\r\n\nwould make a  one time, lump  sum payment  to Shawmut of  its\r\n\nrun-off  reserve if  Shawmut  would relieve  Ohio of  run-off\r\n\nliability.    During the  same  period,  Gary Grondin,  Vice-\r\n\nPresident of  Shawmut   who handled VSI,  began conveying  to\r\n\nMiniter Shawmut's desire to reduce the amount Shawmut paid in\r\n\npremiums  on its  VSI policy.   At  some point  Grondin asked\r\n\nDonley to solicit proposals from other carriers.\r\n\n          On May 19, 1994 Juredine informed Miniter that Ohio\r\n\ncould offer a lump sum payment of approximately $2,000,000 to\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nShawmut.    Miniter immediately  communicated  this  offer to\r\n\nShawmut.    On  May  20,  however,  Ohio  faxed  Miniter  the\r\n\nfollowing:\r\n\n          Dear  Art:  Please disregard previous and\r\n          current  correspondence   (UPS  overnight\r\n          already mailed).  The amount  of unearned\r\n          premiums  mentioned  is inaccurate.   The\r\n          new figure is being calculated.\r\n\nOn May  26, Ohio faxed Miniter  a new lump sum  offer of $1.8\r\n\nmillion, contingent on  Shawmut's agreement to eliminate  the\r\n\nrun-off coverage.  Miniter  communicated the reduced offer as\r\n\nwell.\r\n\n          From late  May into  July 1994, Grondin  and Donley\r\n\ncontinued to  discuss whether Shawmut would  receive the lump\r\n\nsum payment.  The discussions came to a head in mid-July at a\r\n\nmeeting  between Grondin,  Grondin's supervisor,  Donley, and\r\n\nDonley's  daughter  Julianne,  who  serves  as  president  of\r\n\nMiniter.   Grondin came to the meeting expecting a check from\r\n\nOhio, payable  to  Shawmut, in  the amount  of $1.8  million.\r\n\nInstead,  Donley informed  him that  Ohio had reneged  on its\r\n\noffer,  that Ohio had no interest in  making a deal, and that\r\n\nhe  wanted to move Shawmut  to a different  carrier.  Grondin\r\n\nasked  Donley for  something in  writing to  this effect,  in\r\n\nresponse  to  which  Donley  produced  a  letter  from  Ohio.\r\n\nGrondin  testified that \"[a]fter [he]  read the letter  . . .\r\n\n[he]  stated to Arthur Donley  that this does  not state that\r\n\nDavid Juredine from  [Ohio] didn't want  to drop the  run-off\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ncoverage  and  give  us the  $1.8  million.\"2   Grondin  then\r\n\nrefused to  consider  proposals Miniter  had  solicited  from\r\n\nother  carriers,  and  cancelled  a  subsequent  meeting with\r\n\nDonley.\r\n\n          At that point, Shawmut  began to lose patience with\r\n\nMiniter, and felt deceived  and \"taken for a ride.\"   Shortly\r\n\nafter the meeting,  Grondin informed Donley that he wanted to\r\n\nspeak directly with someone at  Ohio.  Donley responded  that\r\n\nOhio  did not want to  speak with Shawmut  and reiterated his\r\n\ndesire to change insurance carriers.  Grondin replied that he\r\n\ndid  not want to change  carriers; he simply  wanted the $1.8\r\n\nmillion. On his own, Grondin  began to solicit proposals from\r\n\nother carriers.  Grondin also called Juredine at Ohio.  \r\n\n          In   his   conversation   with  Juredine,   Grondin\r\n\nindicated  that  he   viewed  Ohio's  offer  and   subsequent\r\n\nretraction as very unethical.  Grondin also informed Juredine\r\n\nthat  Shawmut sought to broker  a new policy  directly with a\r\n\ncarrier  rather than  work through  Miniter or any  agent and\r\n\nthat Shawmut intended to change carriers.  Grondin indicated,\r\n\nhowever,  that  if  Juredine  wished to  submit  a  proposal,\r\n\nGrondin would  consider it.   Juredine responded that  he had\r\n\n\"no  problem\" giving Shawmut the 1.8 million dollars.  In the\r\n\nsame  conversation Juredine also  informed Grondin  that Ohio\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Grondin  testified that  he did  not have  a copy  of the\r\nletter Donley showed him,  and the letter is absent  from the\r\nrecord.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nhad  no  problem  letting  Shawmut  have  a  portion  of  the\r\n\ncommissions, but that Donley did not want to reduce Miniter's\r\n\ncommission level.\r\n\n          Juredine then called  Donley and apprised  him that\r\n\nGrondin had  contacted him  and that  Shawmut wanted  to work\r\n\nthrough its own in-house agency, that is, Shawmut wanted some\r\n\nor  all  of the  commissions  deriving from  the  VSI policy.\r\n\nDonley asked  Juredine  what he  planned to  do and  Juredine\r\n\nresponded that he had to save the business for Ohio before he\r\n\ncould  worry  about Miniter.   Donley  gave no  indication to\r\n\nJuredine whether  Shawmut had terminated Miniter.   He simply\r\n\nreminded Juredine that  he was not to  negotiate with Shawmut\r\n\ndirectly without Miniter's involvement.\r\n\n          From that point forward  Shawmut began to negotiate\r\n\nVSI coverage  directly with Ohio.  On  July 28, 1994 Ohio and\r\n\nShawmut came to an agreement on  the second VSI policy.   The\r\n\nterms of  the second policy designated  the Shawmut Insurance\r\n\nAgency  as the broker and required Ohio to pay commissions of\r\n\n30%.  The new  policy did not include  run-off coverage.   It\r\n\ndid  include a lump  sum payment to  Shawmut of  just over $2\r\n\nmillion,  representing  the   $1.8  million  plus  additional\r\n\nreserves earned during the summer of  1994.  Also on July 28,\r\n\nGrondin and his supervisor  informed Donley by telephone that\r\n\nShawmut was  terminating its relationship  with Miniter,  and\r\n\nGrondin followed up with a letter.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n                      Standard of Review\r                                  Standard of Review\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review  the award  of summary judgment  de novo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSee Ortiz-Pinero  v.

First, it asserts, Ohio breached the written\r\n\nagreement  by  failing to  pay  Miniter  commissions for  the\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nsecond policy  issued to Shawmut.   Second, Miniter contends,\r\n\nOhio breached  \"its subsidiary  but separate promise\"  not to\r\n\ncontact  or  deal  directly  with  Shawmut  without involving\r\n\nMiniter.  \r\n\n          1.  The Agency Agreement\r                                              \r\n\n          The  relevant provisions  of  the agency  agreement\r\n\nprovide:\r\n\n          The   Agent   shall   be    entitled   to\r\n          commissions equal to  20% of the  written\r\n          premiums paid  on policies issued  by the\r\n          Company to policyholders obtained  by the\r\n          Agent.  If a  conflict exists as to which\r\n          producer  is  authorized  to represent  a\r\n          policyholder, the  policyholder's written\r\n          statement designating his agent or broker\r\n          shall be binding upon  the Agent and  the\r\n          Company.  \r\n\n                             ....\r\n\n          The  Agent's  right to  commissions shall\r\n          cease  upon cancellation  of a  policy in\r\n          accordance    with    the    cancellation\r\n          provisions in the policy.\r\n\nThe  district court found  the relevant  terms of  the agency\r\n\nagreement  unambiguous, and  held  that as  a  matter of  law\r\n\nShawmut's  designation of  its in-house  agency as  broker of\r\n\nrecord  disposed of  Miniter's  claim to  commissions on  the\r\n\nsecond policy.\r\n\n          On appeal Miniter asserts  that the language in the\r\n\nagreement  allows  for  more  than  one  interpretation,  and\r\n\ntherefore,   should   have   precluded    summary   judgment.\r\n\nSpecifically, Miniter  asserts that  an issue of  fact exists\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nwhether  it \"obtained\"  Shawmut  for purposes  of the  agency\r\n\nagreement.   Miniter also  contends that the  term \"producer\"\r\n\ndoes not apply  in this  situation between an  agent and  the\r\n\ninsured client.   Instead, Miniter contends,  the term should\r\n\nonly apply  in situations  involving two competing  insurance\r\n\nagents.   Finally, Miniter avers that  it produced the second\r\n\npolicy.  We disagree.\r\n\n          Neither  the  parties' nor  our own  examination of\r\n\nOhio  law has  uncovered  any cases  construing the  disputed\r\n\nterms  of  the  agency agreement.    We  turn, therefore,  to\r\n\ngeneral  principles  of  contract  construction.    In  Ohio,\r\n\nconstruction of  written contracts is  a matter of  law, with\r\n\nthe underlying  purpose of  discovering and  effectuating the\r\n\nintent of the  parties.  See Graham v. Drydock  Coal Co., 667\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d  949,  952 (Ohio  1996).   We  must give  common words\r\n\nappearing in  written  contracts \"their  plain  and  ordinary\r\n\nmeaning  unless manifest  absurdity  results or  unless  some\r\n\nother meaning  is clearly intended  from the face  or overall\r\n\ncontents\"  of the  contract.   Alexander v.  Buckeye Pipeline\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.,  374 N.E.2d  146,  150 (Ohio  1978).   We  may  consider\r               \r\n\nextrinsic evidence  to ascertain  the parties'  intent either\r\n\nwhen  faced  with  unclear  or ambiguous  language,  or  when\r\n\ncircumstances  surrounding  the  agreement  give   the  plain\r\n\nlanguage special  meaning.  See  Graham, 667  N.E.2d at  952.\r                                                   \r\n\n\"[W]here  the terms  in an  existing contract  are  clear and\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nunambiguous,\"  however, we  \"cannot  in effect  create a  new\r\n\ncontract  by finding  an intent  not  expressed in  the clear\r\n\nlanguage employed by the parties.\"   Alexander, 374 N.E.2d at\r                                                          \r\n\n150.\r\n\n          We agree with the  district court that the language\r\n\nof  the  agency  agreement  is  clear  and  unambiguous,  and\r\n\nprovides  without  caveat  that  the  policyholder's  written\r\n\nstatement designating its agent binds Miniter and  Ohio.  The\r\n\nagency   agreement  provides  that   the  agent's   right  to\r\n\ncommissions shall cease upon  cancellation of a policy.   The\r\n\nparties  do  not dispute  that  Shawmut  cancelled the  first\r\n\npolicy,  terminating  Miniter's  right to  commissions.   The\r\n\nagency  agreement  further provides  that  the policyholder's\r\n\ndesignation  of  its agent  or  broker  shall be  binding  on\r\n\nMiniter and Ohio.   Shawmut's  written statement  designating\r\n\nits  in-house  agency  as  its  agent,   therefore,  controls\r\n\ndisbursement of commissions under the second policy.\r\n\n          Miniter's contention that it \"obtained\" Shawmut for\r\n\npurposes of the second policy fails to find support either in\r\n\nthe agreement  or  the  record.    Miniter  asserts  that  by\r\n\nintroducing Shawmut  to Ohio and brokering  the first policy,\r\n\nMiniter obtained  Shawmut for  the  second policy.   On  that\r\n\nbasis,  Miniter contends, the  agency agreement requires Ohio\r\n\nto remit commissions to  Miniter, and not Shawmut.   The most\r\n\nobvious flaw in this argument is that it ignores the sentence\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nimmediately following the  \"obtained\" sentence, which, as  we\r\n\nhave pointed out, provides  that in the event of  a conflict,\r\n\nthe  policyholder's written  statement designating  its agent\r\n\nshall bind Miniter and Ohio.\r\n\n          The  record  further  belies  Miniter's  assertion.\r\n\nShawmut  cancelled the  first  policy, initiated  discussions\r\n\nwith  Ohio as well as  other carriers, and  ultimately made a\r\n\ndeal with Ohio.  Shawmut's  decision to work in-house  rather\r\n\nthan  through   an  independent  agency   fatally  undermines\r\n\nMiniter's contention  that it  obtained Shawmut for  Ohio for\r\n\npurposes of the  second policy.   Further, as  we discuss  in\r\n\ngreater  detail below,  Miniter tried  to steer  Shawmut away\r\n\nfrom Ohio toward another carrier rather than maintain Shawmut\r\n\nas a policyholder of Ohio.    Miniter  ominously argues  that\r\n\nto  interpret the  agency  agreement in  this fashion  \"would\r\n\neviscerate  the independent agency  practice and arm insurers\r\n\nwith  a lethal  weapon for  eliminating and  compromising the\r\n\nintermediary agent after the account has been brought to it.\"\r\n\nMiniter's interpretation would  effectively allow Miniter  to\r\n\ncollect  premiums on  any  policies Ohio  issued to  Shawmut,\r\n\nwhether or not  it actually brokered them,  simply because it\r\n\nbrokered  the  initial  VSI  policy  between  those  parties.\r\n\nMiniter's  interpretation would  preclude Ohio  from honoring\r\n\nShawmut's designation  in any insurance  policies Ohio issued\r\n\nto  Shawmut.    In  other words,  that  interpretation  would\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\ncontradict subsequent  provisions in the same  section of the\r\n\nagreement.  We reiterate that \"where the terms in an existing\r\n\ncontract  are clear  and unambiguous,  [we] cannot  in effect\r\n\ncreate a new contract  by finding an intent not  expressed in\r\n\nthe clear language.\"  Alexander, 374 N.E.2d at 150.\r                                           \r\n\n          Miniter argues that \"the producer provision applies\r\n\nwhen there are two competing insurance agents, not between an\r\n\nagent and the insured.\"  Miniter points to no language in the\r\n\nagreement limiting  that  provision beyond  its plain  terms.\r\n\nOhio  law  dictates that  we  must presume  that  the written\r\n\ncontract  reflects the intent of the parties, see Graham, 667\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d at  952, and that  we may consider  extrinsic evidence\r\n\nonly when  that language  is ambiguous or  when circumstances\r\n\nsurrounding  the agreement  give the  plain language  special\r\n\nmeaning.   See  id.    Miniter  points  us  to  no  authority\r                               \r\n\nindicating that an insured may not procure insurance directly\r\n\nfrom  a  carrier, and  in  effect, act  as its  own  agent or\r\n\nbroker.    We  do  not  identify  any  special  circumstances\r\n\nsurrounding  this   agreement  which  might  give  the  plain\r\n\nlanguage special meaning.\r\n\n          We note  that by  the terms  of the  agreement, the\r\n\nproducer provision  only takes effect when  a conflict exists\r\n\nregarding which producer represents a policyholder.   Shawmut\r\n\ninformed  Ohio that  it  would no  longer be  working through\r\n\nMiniter and that it  was seeking proposals for a  new policy.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nShawmut  cancelled  the  first  policy.   While  Miniter  now\r\n\nattempts  to generate a conflict, or argue that the provision\r\n\ndoes  not  govern  this  situation,  nothing  in  the  record\r\n\ntriggers the  producer provision  inasmuch as Shawmut  on its\r\n\nown affirmatively undertook to negotiate the second policy.\r\n\n          Equally unavailing  is Miniter's argument  that it,\r\n\nand  not  Shawmut's  in-house  agency,  produced  the  second\r\n\npolicy.  Accepting  Miniter's definition of \"produced,\"3  the\r\n\nrecord  does not support its contention that, at a minimum, a\r\n\ndispute of fact exists  as to whether it or  Shawmut produced\r\n\nthe  second policy.    Instead, as  the record  demonstrates,\r\n\nMiniter  repeatedly urged  Shawmut  to move  its business  to\r\n\nanother carrier  rather than come to an  agreement with Ohio,\r\n\nand  effectively  forced Shawmut  to  produce  the policy  by\r\n\nitself.  \r\n\n          Grondin's  undisputed testimony  reflects Miniter's\r\n\nindication  that Ohio was  no longer  interested in  making a\r\n\ndeal with  Shawmut involving the  lump sum payment.   Miniter\r\n\nmade  this  assertion despite  the  fact  that Ohio  remained\r\n\nwilling to  remit  $1.8 million  to  Shawmut.   In  addition,\r\n\nMiniter tried  to present  Shawmut with proposals  from other\r\n\ncompanies and  urged Shawmut to let Miniter  move the account\r\n\nto a different carrier.  It was not until  Shawmut decided to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  According  to Miniter,  \"[t]he  common  sense meaning  of\r\nproduce  or 'producer'  is  one who  'brings forth,'  'brings\r\nforward,' 'generates,' or 'causes,' or 'to effect.'\"\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nwork  directly  with a  carrier and  contacted Ohio  that the\r\n\nsecond policy began to  take shape.  On the  undisputed facts\r\n\nin this  record, Miniter cannot  lay claim to  commissions on\r\n\nthe  second  policy by  claiming  that it,  and  not Shawmut,\r\n\nproduced the policy.\r\n\n          2.  The No-Contact Agreement\r                                                  \r\n\n          For  purposes of  summary judgment,  Ohio does  not\r\n\ndispute  that in  addition to  the written  agency agreement,\r\n\nMiniter  and  Ohio  orally  agreed that  Ohio  would  neither\r\n\ncommunicate nor deal directly with Shawmut without  including\r\n\nMiniter.  The district  court found that Ohio did  not breach\r\n\nthe no-contact agreement on the basis that Shawmut decided to\r\n\nterminate  Miniter prior  to initiating  direct contact  with\r\n\nOhio  and then  informed Ohio  of that  fact.   Miniter makes\r\n\nthree principal arguments on appeal:  (1) compliance with the\r\n\nagreement did not hinge on which party initiated the contact;\r\n\n(2)  Ohio's wrongful  conduct precipitated  Shawmut's contact\r\n\nand Ohio's misrepresentations  then compounded the situation;\r\n\nand  (3)  whether  and  when Shawmut  intended  to  terminate\r\n\nMiniter  presents a  dispute of  fact that  precludes summary\r\n\njudgment on this  claim.  Miniter attempts  to buttress these\r\n\narguments  with  evidence  of  an industry  custom  which  it\r\n\nalleges Ohio violated.   We find none  of Miniter's arguments\r\n\npersuasive  and conclude  that on  this record  no reasonable\r\n\njury could find that Ohio breached the no-contact agreement.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          We understand Miniter's first  argument essentially\r\n\nto contend that even if Shawmut initiated the direct contact,\r\n\nthe  agreement   bound  Ohio   to  include  Miniter   on  the\r\n\nsubstantive discussions as long as Miniter remained Shawmut's\r\n\nbroker  of record.  Even  if the fact  that Shawmut initiated\r\n\nthe contact  does not relieve  Ohio of its  obligations under\r\n\nthe  no-contact  agreement,   the  undisputed  substance   of\r\n\nShawmut's initial contact does.\r\n\n          After the July meeting  which failed to net Shawmut\r\n\na  $1.8  million payment,  Grondin  informed  Donley that  he\r\n\nwished to contact Ohio.  He  then called Juredine at Ohio, as\r\n\nwell  as at  least one  other insurance  company, to  solicit\r\n\nproposals.  Grondin told  Juredine of his disappointment that\r\n\nOhio had reneged on  the $1.8 million lump sum  payment, that\r\n\nhe  was planning  to  change carriers,  that  Shawmut was  no\r\n\nlonger going  to use  Miniter, that  Shawmut desired to  work\r\n\ndirectly  with a carrier  rather than  through an  agent, and\r\n\nthat if Juredine wished he could submit a proposal.  Juredine\r\n\nthen  apprised  Miniter  of the  situation.    Only then  did\r\n\nGrondin and  Juredine engage in substantive  discussions on a\r\n\nsecond VSI policy.   In other words, only after  Shawmut told\r\n\nOhio that Miniter was out of  the picture, that Ohio was next\r\n\non  the chopping  block,  and Ohio  informed  Miniter of  the\r\n\nsituation  did Juredine  and  Grondin engage  in  substantive\r\n\nnegotiations.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          The  record does  not support  Miniter's contention\r\n\nthat  misconduct by Ohio  precipitated Shawmut's contact with\r\n\nOhio.   Miniter takes the  position that Ohio,  in retracting\r\n\nthe  initial   offer  of   $2   million,  injured   Miniter's\r\n\ncredibility with  Shawmut, its client.   The record, however,\r\n\ndoes  not  support  Miniter's  claim.    Ohio  erred  in  its\r\n\ncalculation of $2 million and immediately informed Miniter of\r\n\nthat  error.  Six  days later, Ohio  submitted a recalculated\r\n\nfigure  of $1.8  million.   Contrary  to  Donley's claims  to\r\n\nGrondin and Grondin's supervisor,  Ohio never  indicated that\r\n\nit no longer wished to negotiate  a lump sum deal.  Grondin's\r\n\ndisgruntlement came not  from the reduction of  the figure to\r\n\n$1.8  million, but  from his  understanding from  Donley that\r\n\nOhio had  backed out altogether.   In his  deposition Grondin\r\n\nrepeatedly testified that Shawmut expected  $1.8 million from\r\n\nOhio.\r\n\n          The record  similarly  does not  support  Miniter's\r\n\nclaim  that  Ohio's  misrepresentations  following  Shawmut's\r\n\ninitial contact in any way compounded the situation.  Miniter\r\n\ncontends that Ohio cast  Miniter in a poor light  by averring\r\n\nthat it  never had a problem  with the lump sum  payment.  As\r\n\nthe  record reflects,  however, Ohio  simply told  the truth.\r\n\nOhio's concern had  been primarily with the  amount, which it\r\n\nreduced from $2 million to $1.8 million, as well as with some\r\n\nof  the  details  of  the  revised  VSI  coverage.    Despite\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nMiniter's   characterizations,   Ohio  remained   willing  to\r\n\nprovide, and ultimately  did provide Shawmut with a  lump sum\r\n\npayment.\r\n\n          Miniter  also  asserts that  Ohio  falsely informed\r\n\nShawmut  that  \"any  impediment  to any  deal  was  Miniter's\r\n\ncommission  expense.\"    This  mischaracterizes  the  record.\r\n\nGrondin testified that in their first conversation, and after\r\n\nhe informed  Juredine that  Shawmut desired to  work directly\r\n\nwith a  carrier, Juredine  responded that  he  had neither  a\r\n\nproblem with paying a  $1.8 million lump sum nor  with giving\r\n\nShawmut a part  of the commissions or a fee,  but that Donley\r\n\ndid not want to reduce  his commission percentage. Nothing in\r\n\nthe    record    supports   Miniter's    highly   exaggerated\r\n\ncharacterization of Juredine's remark.  In addition, Juredine\r\n\ndid not  make that remark  until after  Grondin informed  him\r\n\nthat Shawmut would no longer be working through Miniter.\r\n\n          Miniter  asserts that an  issue of fact  as to when\r\n\nShawmut  actually terminated  Miniter  should have  precluded\r\n\nsummary judgment on  its breach of  the no contact  agreement\r\n\nclaim.  The district court found that Ohio did not breach the\r\n\nno contact  agreement in part  because it determined  that by\r\n\nthe time Shawmut contacted  Ohio, Shawmut had already decided\r\n\nto terminate Miniter.  Miniter correctly asserts that Shawmut\r\n\ndid not  formally terminate its  brokerage designation  until\r\n\nafter  Shawmut had  negotiated the  second policy  with Ohio.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nUntil  that  time  the record    supports  a conclusion  that\r\n\nShawmut remained  willing  to consider  any proposal  Miniter\r\n\nmight  have  made  along  with any  other  proposals  Shawmut\r\n\nreceived.  Grondin would have treated a proposal from Miniter\r\n\nlike any other he received.\r\n\n          We conclude  that to the  extent an  issue of  fact\r\n\nexists as to when Shawmut decided to terminate Miniter, it is\r\n\nnot material  to this dispute.  See J. Geils Band, 76 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1250-51  (explaining that a material fact is one that has the\r\n\npotential to affect  the outcome  of the dispute).   What  is\r\n\nmaterial  is what Grondin  conveyed to Juredine  in the first\r\n\ncall, namely, that Shawmut would no longer be working through\r\n\nMiniter or  any independent  agent, that Shawmut  intended to\r\n\nchange  carriers, and that Ohio could submit a proposal if it\r\n\nwished. \r\n\n          Finally, Miniter  points  to the  affidavit of  its\r\n\nexpert, Frederick J. England, Jr., to establish the insurance\r\n\nindustry  custom that  insurers should  not engage  in direct\r\n\ndealings with  insureds who  are also clients  of independent\r\n\nagents.    According to  Miniter,  Ohio's  violation of  this\r\n\ncustom further supports Miniter's claim for breach of the no-\r\n\ncontact agreement.\r\n\n          England  defines   the   industry  custom   as   an\r\n\nobligation by  Ohio not to  engage in continuous  dealings or\r\n\ndiscussions,  regardless of  whether  Shawmut  initiated  the\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ncontact, without first seeking to involve Miniter.  The facts\r\n\nin this record  do not support Miniter's assertion  that Ohio\r\n\nviolated  industry  custom.    During  the  first  call  from\r\n\nGrondin, Juredine  urged Shawmut  to  officially resolve  the\r\n\nsituation  with Miniter  prior to  moving forward.   Juredine\r\n\nthen  called Donley to inform him of the situation.  Notably,\r\n\nDonley did not  clarify to  Ohio whether or  not Shawmut  had\r\n\nterminated  Miniter.   He  merely  exhorted  Juredine not  to\r\n\nnegotiate with Shawmut without  his involvement.  We conclude\r\n\nthat Ohio made a good faith effort to abide by  the custom in\r\n\nthe industry as England describes it.\r\n\nB.  Miniter's Remaining Claims\r                                          \r\n\n          In addition to breach  of contract, Miniter alleged\r\n\nbreach  of  the  implied  covenant of  good  faith  and  fair\r\n\ndealing,    intentional   interference    with   advantageous\r\n\nrelations,   unjust  enrichment,   and   violation   of   the\r\n\nMassachusetts unfair trade practices statute, Mass. Gen. Laws\r\n\nch. 93A.   Each of  these claims rests  in large part  on the\r\n\nconduct  which  has failed  to  support  Miniter's claim  for\r\n\nbreach  of the  no  contact  agreement.    We  find  each  of\r\n\nMiniter's arguments on appeal unpersuasive.   For the sake of\r\n\nthoroughness, however, we discuss each of them in turn.\r\n\n          1.   Breach of the  Implied Covenant of  Good Faith\r                                                                         \r\nand       Fair Dealing\r                                  \r\n\n          Miniter  alleged  that  Ohio's  breach  of  the  no\r\n\ncontact agreement violated the implied covenant of good faith\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nand  fair  dealing.    The  district  court  granted  summary\r\n\njudgment in favor of Ohio, determining that \"Ohio courts have\r\n\ndeclined to  recognize the doctrine in  an at-will employment\r\n\ncontext.\"   On appeal Miniter argues  alternatively that Ohio\r\n\ndoes recognize the implied covenant  in this context and that\r\n\nthe  district court  should have  applied Massachusetts  law,\r\n\nwhich  recognizes the  implied  covenant  in every  contract.\r\n\nAppellee Ohio, by  contrast, seeks  to apply the  law of  the\r\n\nstate  of Ohio,  arguing  that Ohio  law  does not  recognize\r\n\nMiniter's claim.\r\n\n          We  need not  determine which state's  law governs.\r\n\nEven  if,  as  Miniter  contends,  the  common  law  of  Ohio\r\n\nrecognizes  a cause  of  action  for  breach of  the  implied\r\n\ncovenant  of good  faith and  fair dealing,  Miniter has  not\r\n\ndiscussed  how Ohio law would  apply in this  case.  Instead,\r\n\nMiniter argues the merits of this claim only under the law of\r\n\nMassachusetts.  We have indicated that \"issues adverted to on\r\n\nappeal   in  a  perfunctory  manner,  unaccompanied  by  some\r\n\ndeveloped argumentation,  are deemed to have been abandoned.\"\r\n\nRyan v.  Royal Ins. Co. of  Am., 916 F.2d 731,  714 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1990); see also  Williams v.  Poulos, 11 F.3d  271, 285  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1993).   We  conclude,  moreover,  that Miniter  cannot\r\n\nprevail under the law of Massachusetts.    \r\n\n          As we have recognized, \"Massachusetts law implies a\r\n\nduty  of  good faith  and  fair  dealing  in  every  existing\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\ncontract.\"  F.D.I.C. v.  LeBlanc, 85 F.3d 815, 822  (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1996); see also Anthony's Pier Four v. HBC Assoc., 583 N.E.2d\r                                                             \r\n\n806,  820  (Mass.  1991).     Under  this  implied  covenant,\r\n\n\"'neither party  shall do anything that will  have the effect\r\n\nof destroying or  injuring the  right of the  other party  to\r\n\nreceive  the fruits of the contract.'\"   Anthony's Pier Four,\r                                                                        \r\n\n583  N.E.2d  at 820  (quoting  Drucker v.  Roland  Wm. Jutras\r                                                                         \r\n\nAssocs., 348 N.E.2d 763, 765 (Mass. 1976)).  The existence of\r                   \r\n\nthe covenant in no way depends on the level of sophistication\r\n\nof the parties.  Massachusetts law  implies the covenant even\r\n\nin contracts between sophisticated  business people.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 821.  \r\n\n          According  to Miniter,  Ohio  dealt  directly  with\r\n\nShawmut in  breach of  the no  contact agreement  and falsely\r\n\nindicated to Shawmut a  willingness to pay the lump  sum with\r\n\nthe  purpose  of excluding  Miniter  from  any deal,  thereby\r\n\neliminating  Miniter's  commissions.    Miniter  claims  that\r\n\nOhio's actions  \"were calculated and intended  to subvert the\r\n\nrelationship  and  to  otherwise obtain  the  Shawmut account\r\n\ndirectly and eliminate Miniter's involvement and commission.\"\r\n\n          Miniter, however, fails to identify evidence in the\r\n\nrecord that would establish a genuine issue of material  fact\r\n\nwhether Ohio acted in  bad faith.  The record  indicates that\r\n\nby  the time Shawmut began negotiating  with Ohio Grondin had\r\n\ninformed Juredine that Shawmut  was no longer working through\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nMiniter.    Juredine,   moreover,  informed  Donley  of   the\r\n\nsituation  shortly  after he  received  Grondin's  call.   In\r\n\nshort, the record does  not support Miniter's contention that\r\n\nOhio  acted  to destroy  or  injure Miniter's  rights  to the\r\n\nfruits  of the contract.  See Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d\r                                                             \r\n\nat  820.   Assuming  Massachusetts  law  governs this  claim,\r\n\nMiniter  fails to  point  to record  evidence supporting  its\r\n\nallegations that Ohio acted in bad faith.4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Miniter's claim  for unjust enrichment also  fails.  That\r\nclaim  is  based on  Miniter's  argument  that it  introduced\r\nShawmut to Ohio,  that it brokered  the initial policy,  that\r\nOhio went  behind its back  and dealt directly  with Shawmut,\r\nthat Ohio  made misrepresentations  to Shawmut, all  with the\r\nresult  that Ohio  benefited by  gaining a  new client.   See\r                                                                         \r\nSalamon  v.  Terra, 477  N.E.2d  1029,  1031-32 (Mass.  1985)\r                              \r\n(remedy  lies  for  value  of benefit  conferred).    We have\r\nalready concluded  that rather than broker  or facilitate the\r\nsecond policy,  Miniter urged Shawmut to  change carriers and\r\nrepresented  to Shawmut  that Ohio  reneged on  its lump  sum\r\noffer.   Our  conclusion  that Ohio  did  not engage  in  any\r\nwrongful  conduct  precludes  any  plausible  assertion  that\r\nMiniter  conferred  a  benefit  upon Ohio  beyond  the  first\r\npolicy.  \r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\n          2.  Interference with Advantageous Relations  \r                                                                  \r\n\n          Miniter  contends that the  district court erred in\r\n\ngranting summary judgment in  favor of Ohio on its  claim for\r\n\ninterference  with  advantageous  relations.    A  claim  for\r\n\ninterference with  advantageous  relations depends  upon  the\r\n\npresence of  four criteria:  \"(1) a business  relationship or\r\n\ncontemplated   contract  of   economic   benefit;   (2)   the\r\n\ndefendant's  knowledge   of   such  relationship;   (3)   the\r\n\ndefendant's intentional and malicious interference   with it;\r\n\n(4) the plaintiff's loss of advantage directly resulting from\r\n\nthe   defendant's conduct.\"   Comey v. Hill,  438 N.E.2d 811,\r                                                       \r\n\n816 (Mass. 1982); see also Speen v. Crown Clothing Corp., 102\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 625, 634 (1st Cir. 1996).  The Supreme Judicial Court of\r\n\nMassachusetts has  indicated that the third  element requires\r\n\nmerely  an improper  interference, and  not a  malicious one.\r\n\nSee  United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, 551 N.E.2d 20, 23\r                                                      \r\n\n(Mass. 1990).5   Nevertheless,  a successful claim  must show\r\n\nsomething more  than just the  interference itself.   See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nTo the extent,  therefore, that any  of Ohio's actions  could\r\n\nconstitute  an  interference,  that  alone  would  not  incur\r\n\nliability.   Instead,  Miniter must  demonstrate wrongfulness\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  We  note  that in  Geltman,  the  Supreme Judicial  Court\r                                          \r\nspecifically  examined the  tort of  intentional interference\r\nwith a  contract and prospective contractual  relations.  The\r\ncourt  indicated, however, that at least  with respect to the\r\nthird  element, the same standard applied in both torts.  See\r                                                                         \r\nid. at 23 n.6.  \r               \r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nbeyond the interference itself.  The interference must arise,\r\n\nfor example,  from improper  motives or the  use of  improper\r\n\nmeans.  See id.\r                           \r\n\n          Miniter   bases  this   claim  yet  again   on  its\r\n\ncontention that Ohio engaged  in direct dealings with Shawmut\r\n\nin  violation of the no contact  agreement and made injurious\r\n\nmisrepresentations about  the lump  sum payment  and Miniter.\r\n\nOur examination of the record  has revealed no such  conduct.\r\n\nMiniter  points to  nothing  in  addition  to  the  facts  we\r\n\nconsidered in relation to Miniter's breach of contract claims\r\n\nthat might support a  claim for intentional interference with\r\n\nadvantageous relations.   In  the absence of  record evidence\r\n\nupon  which   a  reasonable  jury  could   find  an  improper\r\n\ninterference, Miniter cannot survive summary judgment on this\r\n\nclaim.        \r\n\n          3.   Breach of  Fiduciary Duty/Mass. Gen.  Laws ch.\r                                                                         \r\n\n93A\r               \r\n\n          Finally,  Miniter  appeals  the  grant  of  summary\r\n\njudgment in favor of  Ohio on its claim under Mass. Gen. Laws\r\n\nch. 93A (\"93A\") based  on breach of fiduciary duty.   Section\r\n\n2(a)  of Mass.  Gen.

Whether a particular set of\r\n\nfacts  constitutes  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or practices\r\n\nordinarily is a question of fact.  See id.

See id. at 44.\r                            \r\n\n          To fall within these  parameters, the conduct which\r\n\nundergirds  the complaint  must reside  \"within at  least the\r\n\npenumbra  of some common-law,  statutory or other established\r\n\nconcept  of  unfairness,\" or  rise to  the level  of immoral,\r\n\nunethical,   oppressive  or   unscrupulous,  and   result  in\r\n\nsubstantial injury to competitors  or other business  people.\r\n\nId. (internal quotations and  citations omitted).  At bottom,\r               \r\n\na  claim under  93A must  rest on  conduct that  attained \"'a\r\n\nlevel of  rascality that would  raise the eyebrow  of someone\r\n\ninured  to the rough and  tumble of the  world of commerce.'\"\r\n\nSee id. at 43 (quoting  Quaker St. Oil Ref.

See Sequoia  Pac.\r                                                                         \r\n\nSys., 44 F.3d at 44.  We conclude, however, that Ohio did not\r                \r\n\nbreach  its  duty.    Miniter  supports  its  93A claim  with\r\n\nmischaracterizations  of  the  record   upon  which  we  have\r\n\nelaborated.      In   short,    Ohio   did   not   make   the\r\n\nmisrepresentations Miniter  claims,  nor did  it violate  its\r\n\nwritten or oral agreements.  The record further reflects that\r\n\nOhio adhered to the industry custom as described by Miniter's\r\n\nexpert,  Frederick England.  As  such, Ohio did  not breach a\r\n\nfiduciary duty  to Miniter.    Miniter's 93A  claim based  on\r\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty, therefore, fails.\r\n\n          Affirmed.

Banks and financial institutions need, among others, a type of insurance known as Vender's Single Interest Insurance (\"VSI\"), which insures lenders against potential losses arising from the differential between the actual value of a vehicle being financed and the lender's security interest.  VSI is offered by Ohio, an insurance company located in Columbus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, Miniter became broker for Connecticut National Bank (\"CNB\") and procured a VSI policy for CNB through Fidelity and Deposit Insurance Company (\"Fidelity\").  In 1988, CNB merged with Shawmut Bank (\"Shawmut\"), which continued to meet its insurance needs through Miniter.  That same year, Fidelity stopped issuing VSI policies in Massachusetts, and Miniter moved Shawmut's VSI coverage to Travelers Insurance Company (\"Travelers\").  Eventually, Travelers also discontinued its VSI business, which led Miniter to solicit a VSI proposal from Ohio.  In 1990, Ohio agreed to provide VSI to Shawmut, and Miniter and Ohio entered into an agency agreement to effectuate the arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter characterizes the agreement as a nonexclusive agency agreement under which Miniter had no obligation to issue insurance exclusively through Ohio;  Ohio had no obligation to accept only policies brokered by Miniter.  The agency agreement contained several provisions relevant to this dispute.  First, it provided that Miniter would receive commissions of 20% of the premiums paid on policies issued by Ohio to \"policyholders obtained\" by Miniter.  Second, it provided that should a conflict arise as to which agent was entitled to commissions on a particular policy, \"the policyholder's written statement designating his agent or broker shall be binding\" upon Miniter and Ohio.  Third, the agreement provided that Miniter's right to commissions would cease upon proper cancellation of the policy.  Finally, Ohio orally agreed not to contact or deal directly with Shawmut without involving Miniter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1990, Ohio issued the first of two VSI policies to Shawmut.  The first policy provided \"run-off\" coverage, meaning that should either Shawmut or Ohio cancel the policy, Ohio would be obligated to continue coverage for any vehicle insured during the life of the policy.  In order to provide run-off coverage, Ohio needed to hold a portion of each premium in reserve for potential future claims.  According to Ohio, the run-off coverage rendered its policy to Shawmut unprofitable.  Miniter, however, viewed run-off coverage as an essential element of any VSI policy for Shawmut.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1993 David Juredine, Miniter's contact at Ohio, began to indicate to Arthur Donley, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Miniter, that Ohio wished to cease providing run-off coverage to Shawmut.  In the spring of 1994, Juredine indicated to Donley that Ohio would make a one time, lump sum payment to Shawmut of its run-off reserve if Shawmut would relieve Ohio of run-off liability.  During the same period, Gary Grondin, Vice-President of Shawmut who handled VSI, began conveying to Miniter Shawmut's desire to reduce the amount Shawmut paid in premiums on its VSI policy.  At some point Grondin asked Donley to solicit proposals from other carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 19, 1994 Juredine informed Miniter that Ohio could offer a lump sum payment of approximately $2,000,000 to Shawmut.  Miniter immediately communicated this offer to Shawmut.  On May 20, however, Ohio faxed Miniter the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Dear Art:  Please disregard previous and current correspondence (UPS overnight already mailed).  The amount of unearned premiums mentioned is inaccurate.  The new figure is being calculated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 26, Ohio faxed Miniter a new lump sum offer of $1.8 million, contingent on Shawmut's agreement to eliminate the run-off coverage.  Miniter communicated the reduced offer as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From late May into July 1994, Grondin and Donley continued to discuss whether Shawmut would receive the lump sum payment.  The discussions came to a head in mid-July at a meeting between Grondin, Grondin's supervisor, Donley, and Donley's daughter Julianne, who serves as president of Miniter.  Grondin came to the meeting expecting a check from Ohio, payable to Shawmut, in the amount of $1.8 million.  Instead, Donley informed him that Ohio had reneged on its offer, that Ohio had no interest in making a deal, and that he wanted to move Shawmut to a different carrier.  Grondin asked Donley for something in writing to this effect, in response to which Donley produced a letter from Ohio.  Grondin testified that \"[a]fter [he] read the letter ... [he] stated to Arthur Donley that this does not state that David Juredine from [Ohio] didn't want to drop the run-off coverage and give us the $1.8 million.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Grondin then refused to consider proposals Miniter had solicited from other carriers, and cancelled a subsequent meeting with Donley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, Shawmut began to lose patience with Miniter, and felt deceived and \"taken for a ride.\"   Shortly after the meeting, Grondin informed Donley that he wanted to speak directly with someone at Ohio.  Donley responded that Ohio did not want to speak with Shawmut and reiterated his desire to change insurance carriers.  Grondin replied that he did not want to change carriers;  he simply wanted the $1.8 million.  On his own, Grondin began to solicit proposals from other carriers.  Grondin also called Juredine at Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his conversation with Juredine, Grondin indicated that he viewed Ohio's offer and subsequent retraction as very unethical.  Grondin also informed Juredine that Shawmut sought to broker a new policy directly with a carrier rather than work through Miniter or any agent and that Shawmut intended to change carriers.  Grondin indicated, however, that if Juredine wished to submit a proposal, Grondin would consider it.  Juredine responded that he had \"no problem\" giving Shawmut the 1.8 million dollars.  In the same conversation Juredine also informed Grondin that Ohio had no problem letting Shawmut have a portion of the commissions, but that Donley did not want to reduce Miniter's commission level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juredine then called Donley and apprised him that Grondin had contacted him and that Shawmut wanted to work through its own in-house agency, that is, Shawmut wanted some or all of the commissions deriving from the VSI policy.  Donley asked Juredine what he planned to do and Juredine responded that he had to save the business for Ohio before he could worry about Miniter.  Donley gave no indication to Juredine whether Shawmut had terminated Miniter.  He simply reminded Juredine that he was not to negotiate with Shawmut directly without Miniter's involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that point forward Shawmut began to negotiate VSI coverage directly with Ohio.  On July 28, 1994 Ohio and Shawmut came to an agreement on the second VSI policy.  The terms of the second policy designated the Shawmut Insurance Agency as the broker and required Ohio to pay commissions of 30%.  The new policy did not include run-off coverage.  It did include a lump sum payment to Shawmut of just over $2 million, representing the $1.8 million plus additional reserves earned during the summer of 1994.  Also on July 28, Grondin and his supervisor informed Donley by telephone that Shawmut was terminating its relationship with Miniter, and Grondin followed up with a letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the award of summary judgment de novo.  See Ortiz-Pinero v. Rivera-Arroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.1996).  Summary judgment is appropriate in the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  A fact is material when it has the potential to affect the outcome of the suit.  See J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v.

Ohio removed the case to federal district court in Massachusetts.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332.  The parties agree that, pursuant to a choice of law provision in the agency agreement, Ohio law governs Miniter's contract based claims, and that Massachusetts law governs Miniter's tort claims.  The parties dispute only which state's law governs the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, ostensibly because of Ohio's contention that the common law of the state of Ohio does not recognize such a cause of action in these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that \"[w]here ... the parties have agreed about what law governs, a federal court sitting in diversity is free, if it chooses, to forego an independent analysis and accept the parties' agreement.\"  Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d 370, 375 (1st Cir.1991).  In the absence of any compelling reason to do otherwise, we will honor the parties' choice of law on all counts upon which they agree.  As we explain below, we need not decide which state's law governs Miniter's claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated, the district court granted summary judgment against Miniter on all counts.  On appeal Miniter claims that the district court improperly resolved genuine issues of material fact in order to arrive at its conclusions.  We review Miniter's claims in turn, and, finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter advances two arguments within its breach of contract claim.  First, it asserts, Ohio breached the written agreement by failing to pay Miniter commissions for the second policy issued to Shawmut.  Second, Miniter contends, Ohio breached \"its subsidiary but separate promise\" not to contact or deal directly with Shawmut without involving Miniter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Agency Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant provisions of the agency agreement provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>The Agent shall be entitled to commissions equal to 20% of the written premiums paid on policies issued by the Company to policyholders obtained by the Agent.  If a conflict exists as to which producer is authorized to represent a policyholder, the policyholder's written statement designating his agent or broker shall be binding upon the Agent and the Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>The Agent's right to commissions shall cease upon cancellation of a policy in accordance with the cancellation provisions in the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the relevant terms of the agency agreement unambiguous, and held that as a matter of law Shawmut's designation of its in-house agency as broker of record disposed of Miniter's claim to commissions on the second policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Miniter asserts that the language in the agreement allows for more than one interpretation, and therefore, should have precluded summary judgment.  Specifically, Miniter asserts that an issue of fact exists whether it \"obtained\" Shawmut for purposes of the agency agreement.  Miniter also contends that the term \"producer\" does not apply in this situation between an agent and the insured client.  Instead, Miniter contends, the term should only apply in situations involving two competing insurance agents.  Finally, Miniter avers that it produced the second policy.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the parties' nor our own examination of Ohio law has uncovered any cases construing the disputed terms of the agency agreement.  We turn, therefore, to general principles of contract construction.  In Ohio, construction of written contracts is a matter of law, with the underlying purpose of discovering and effectuating the intent of the parties.  See Graham v. Drydock Coal Co., 76 Ohio St.3d 311, 667 N.E.2d 949, 952 (1996).  We must give common words appearing in written contracts \"their plain and ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results or unless some other meaning is clearly intended from the face or overall contents\" of the contract.  Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co., 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 374 N.E.2d 146, 150 (1978).  We may consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain the parties' intent either when faced with unclear or ambiguous language, or when circumstances surrounding the agreement give the plain language special meaning.  See Graham, 667 N.E.2d at 952.  \"[W]here the terms in an existing contract are clear and unambiguous,\" however, we \"cannot in effect create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language employed by the parties.\"  Alexander, 374 N.E.2d at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the language of the agency agreement is clear and unambiguous, and provides without caveat that the policyholder's written statement designating its agent binds Miniter and Ohio.  The agency agreement provides that the agent's right to commissions shall cease upon cancellation of a policy.  The parties do not dispute that Shawmut cancelled the first policy, terminating Miniter's right to commissions.  The agency agreement further provides that the policyholder's designation of its agent or broker shall be binding on Miniter and Ohio.  Shawmut's written statement designating its in-house agency as its agent, therefore, controls disbursement of commissions under the second policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter's contention that it \"obtained\" Shawmut for purposes of the second policy fails to find support either in the agreement or the record.  Miniter asserts that by introducing Shawmut to Ohio and brokering the first policy, Miniter obtained Shawmut for the second policy.  On that basis, Miniter contends, the agency agreement requires Ohio to remit commissions to Miniter, and not Shawmut.  The most obvious flaw in this argument is that it ignores the sentence immediately following the \"obtained\" sentence, which, as we have pointed out, provides that in the event of a conflict, the policyholder's written statement designating its agent shall bind Miniter and Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record further belies Miniter's assertion.  Shawmut cancelled the first policy, initiated discussions with Ohio as well as other carriers, and ultimately made a deal with Ohio.  Shawmut's decision to work in-house rather than through an independent agency fatally undermines Miniter's contention that it obtained Shawmut for Ohio for purposes of the second policy.  Further, as we discuss in greater detail below, Miniter tried to steer Shawmut away from Ohio toward another carrier rather than maintain Shawmut as a policyholder of Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter ominously argues that to interpret the agency agreement in this fashion \"would eviscerate the independent agency practice and arm insurers with a lethal weapon for eliminating and compromising the intermediary agent after the account has been brought to it.\"   Miniter's interpretation would effectively allow Miniter to collect premiums on any policies Ohio issued to Shawmut, whether or not it actually brokered them, simply because it brokered the initial VSI policy between those parties.  Miniter's interpretation would preclude Ohio from honoring Shawmut's designation in any insurance policies Ohio issued to Shawmut.  In other words, that interpretation would contradict subsequent provisions in the same section of the agreement.  We reiterate that \"where the terms in an existing contract are clear and unambiguous, [we] cannot in effect create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language.\"  Alexander, 374 N.E.2d at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter argues that \"the producer provision applies when there are two competing insurance agents, not between an agent and the insured.\"   Miniter points to no language in the agreement limiting that provision beyond its plain terms.  Ohio law dictates that we must presume that the written contract reflects the intent of the parties, see Graham, 667 N.E.2d at 952, and that we may consider extrinsic evidence only when that language is ambiguous or when circumstances surrounding the agreement give the plain language special meaning.  See id.   Miniter points us to no authority indicating that an insured may not procure insurance directly from a carrier, and in effect, act as its own agent or broker.  We do not identify any special circumstances surrounding this agreement which might give the plain language special meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that by the terms of the agreement, the producer provision only takes effect when a conflict exists regarding which producer represents a policyholder.  Shawmut informed Ohio that it would no longer be working through Miniter and that it was seeking proposals for a new policy.  Shawmut cancelled the first policy.  While Miniter now attempts to generate a conflict, or argue that the provision does not govern this situation, nothing in the record triggers the producer provision inasmuch as Shawmut on its own affirmatively undertook to negotiate the second policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally unavailing is Miniter's argument that it, and not Shawmut's in-house agency, produced the second policy.  Accepting Miniter's definition of \"produced,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the record does not support its contention that, at a minimum, a dispute of fact exists as to whether it or Shawmut produced the second policy.  Instead, as the record demonstrates, Miniter repeatedly urged Shawmut to move its business to another carrier rather than come to an agreement with Ohio, and effectively forced Shawmut to produce the policy by itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grondin's undisputed testimony reflects Miniter's indication that Ohio was no longer interested in making a deal with Shawmut involving the lump sum payment.  Miniter made this assertion despite the fact that Ohio remained willing to remit $1.8 million to Shawmut.  In addition, Miniter tried to present Shawmut with proposals from other companies and urged Shawmut to let Miniter move the account to a different carrier.  It was not until Shawmut decided to work directly with a carrier and contacted Ohio that the second policy began to take shape.  On the undisputed facts in this record, Miniter cannot lay claim to commissions on the second policy by claiming that it, and not Shawmut, produced the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The No-Contact Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of summary judgment, Ohio does not dispute that in addition to the written agency agreement, Miniter and Ohio orally agreed that Ohio would neither communicate nor deal directly with Shawmut without including Miniter.  The district court found that Ohio did not breach the no-contact agreement on the basis that Shawmut decided to terminate Miniter prior to initiating direct contact with Ohio and then informed Ohio of that fact.  Miniter makes three principal arguments on appeal:  (1) compliance with the agreement did not hinge on which party initiated the contact;  (2) Ohio's wrongful conduct precipitated Shawmut's contact and Ohio's misrepresentations then compounded the situation;  and (3) whether and when Shawmut intended to terminate Miniter presents a dispute of fact that precludes summary judgment on this claim.  Miniter attempts to buttress these arguments with evidence of an industry custom which it alleges Ohio violated.  We find none of Miniter's arguments persuasive and conclude that on this record no reasonable jury could find that Ohio breached the no-contact agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We understand Miniter's first argument essentially to contend that even if Shawmut initiated the direct contact, the agreement bound Ohio to include Miniter on the substantive discussions as long as Miniter remained Shawmut's broker of record.  Even if the fact that Shawmut initiated the contact does not relieve Ohio of its obligations under the no-contact agreement, the undisputed substance of Shawmut's initial contact does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the July meeting which failed to net Shawmut a $1.8 million payment, Grondin informed Donley that he wished to contact Ohio.  He then called Juredine at Ohio, as well as at least one other insurance company, to solicit proposals.  Grondin told Juredine of his disappointment that Ohio had reneged on the $1.8 million lump sum payment, that he was planning to change carriers, that Shawmut was no longer going to use Miniter, that Shawmut desired to work directly with a carrier rather than through an agent, and that if Juredine wished he could submit a proposal.  Juredine then apprised Miniter of the situation.  Only then did Grondin and Juredine engage in substantive discussions on a second VSI policy.  In other words, only after Shawmut told Ohio that Miniter was out of the picture, that Ohio was next on the chopping block, and Ohio informed Miniter of the situation did Juredine and Grondin engage in substantive negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record does not support Miniter's contention that misconduct by Ohio precipitated Shawmut's contact with Ohio.  Miniter takes the position that Ohio, in retracting the initial offer of $2 million, injured Miniter's credibility with Shawmut, its client.  The record, however, does not support Miniter's claim.  Ohio erred in its calculation of $2 million and immediately informed Miniter of that error.  Six days later, Ohio submitted a recalculated figure of $1.8 million.  Contrary to Donley's claims to Grondin and Grondin's supervisor, Ohio never indicated that it no longer wished to negotiate a lump sum deal.  Grondin's disgruntlement came not from the reduction of the figure to $1.8 million, but from his understanding from Donley that Ohio had backed out altogether.  In his deposition Grondin repeatedly testified that Shawmut expected $1.8 million from Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record similarly does not support Miniter's claim that Ohio's misrepresentations following Shawmut's initial contact in any way compounded the situation.  Miniter contends that Ohio cast Miniter in a poor light by averring that it never had a problem with the lump sum payment.  As the record reflects, however, Ohio simply told the truth.  Ohio's concern had been primarily with the amount, which it reduced from $2 million to $1.8 million, as well as with some of the details of the revised VSI coverage.  Despite Miniter's characterizations, Ohio remained willing to provide, and ultimately did provide Shawmut with a lump sum payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter also asserts that Ohio falsely informed Shawmut that \"any impediment to any deal was Miniter's commission expense.\"   This mischaracterizes the record.  Grondin testified that in their first conversation, and after he informed Juredine that Shawmut desired to work directly with a carrier, Juredine responded that he had neither a problem with paying a $1.8 million lump sum nor with giving Shawmut a part of the commissions or a fee, but that Donley did not want to reduce his commission percentage.  Nothing in the record supports Miniter's highly exaggerated characterization of Juredine's remark.  In addition, Juredine did not make that remark until after Grondin informed him that Shawmut would no longer be working through Miniter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter asserts that an issue of fact as to when Shawmut actually terminated Miniter should have precluded summary judgment on its breach of the no contact agreement claim.  The district court found that Ohio did not breach the no contact agreement in part because it determined that by the time Shawmut contacted Ohio, Shawmut had already decided to terminate Miniter.  Miniter correctly asserts that Shawmut did not formally terminate its brokerage designation until after Shawmut had negotiated the second policy with Ohio.  Until that time the record supports a conclusion that Shawmut remained willing to consider any proposal Miniter might have made along with any other proposals Shawmut received.  Grondin would have treated a proposal from Miniter like any other he received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that to the extent an issue of fact exists as to when Shawmut decided to terminate Miniter, it is not material to this dispute.  See J. Geils Band, 76 F.3d at 1250-51 (explaining that a material fact is one that has the potential to affect the outcome of the dispute).  What is material is what Grondin conveyed to Juredine in the first call, namely, that Shawmut would no longer be working through Miniter or any independent agent, that Shawmut intended to change carriers, and that Ohio could submit a proposal if it wished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Miniter points to the affidavit of its expert, Frederick J. England, Jr., to establish the insurance industry custom that insurers should not engage in direct dealings with insureds who are also clients of independent agents.  According to Miniter, Ohio's violation of this custom further supports Miniter's claim for breach of the no-contact agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">England defines the industry custom as an obligation by Ohio not to engage in continuous dealings or discussions, regardless of whether Shawmut initiated the contact, without first seeking to involve Miniter.  The facts in this record do not support Miniter's assertion that Ohio violated industry custom.  During the first call from Grondin, Juredine urged Shawmut to officially resolve the situation with Miniter prior to moving forward.  Juredine then called Donley to inform him of the situation.  Notably, Donley did not clarify to Ohio whether or not Shawmut had terminated Miniter.  He merely exhorted Juredine not to negotiate with Shawmut without his involvement.  We conclude that Ohio made a good faith effort to abide by the custom in the industry as England describes it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Miniter's Remaining Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to breach of contract, Miniter alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional interference with advantageous relations, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Massachusetts unfair trade practices statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A. Each of these claims rests in large part on the conduct which has failed to support Miniter's claim for breach of the no contact agreement.  We find each of Miniter's arguments on appeal unpersuasive.  For the sake of thoroughness, however, we discuss each of them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter alleged that Ohio's breach of the no contact agreement violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ohio, determining that \"Ohio courts have declined to recognize the doctrine in an at-will employment context.\"   On appeal Miniter argues alternatively that Ohio does recognize the implied covenant in this context and that the district court should have applied Massachusetts law, which recognizes the implied covenant in every contract.  Appellee Ohio, by contrast, seeks to apply the law of the state of Ohio, arguing that Ohio law does not recognize Miniter's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not determine which state's law governs.  Even if, as Miniter contends, the common law of Ohio recognizes a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Miniter has not discussed how Ohio law would apply in this case.  Instead, Miniter argues the merits of this claim only under the law of Massachusetts.  We have indicated that \"issues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\"  Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990);  see also Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 285 (1st Cir.1993).  We conclude, moreover, that Miniter cannot prevail under the law of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have recognized, \"Massachusetts law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every existing contract.\"  F.D.I.C. v. LeBlanc, 85 F.3d 815, 822 (1st Cir.1996);  see also Anthony's Pier Four v. HBC Assoc., 411 Mass. 451, 583 N.E.2d 806, 820 (1991).  Under this implied covenant, \" 'neither party shall do anything that will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.' \"  Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 820 (quoting Druker v. Roland Wm. Jutras Assocs., 370 Mass. 383, 348 N.E.2d 763, 765 (1976)).  The existence of the covenant in no way depends on the level of sophistication of the parties.  Massachusetts law implies the covenant even in contracts between sophisticated business people.  See id. 583 N.E.2d at 821.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Miniter, Ohio dealt directly with Shawmut in breach of the no contact agreement and falsely indicated to Shawmut a willingness to pay the lump sum with the purpose of excluding Miniter from any deal, thereby eliminating Miniter's commissions.  Miniter claims that Ohio's actions \"were calculated and intended to subvert the relationship and to otherwise obtain the Shawmut account directly and eliminate Miniter's involvement and commission.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter, however, fails to identify evidence in the record that would establish a genuine issue of material fact whether Ohio acted in bad faith.  The record indicates that by the time Shawmut began negotiating with Ohio Grondin had informed Juredine that Shawmut was no longer working through Miniter.  Juredine, moreover, informed Donley of the situation shortly after he received Grondin's call.  In short, the record does not support Miniter's contention that Ohio acted to destroy or injure Miniter's rights to the fruits of the contract.  See Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 820.   Assuming Massachusetts law governs this claim, Miniter fails to point to record evidence supporting its allegations that Ohio acted in bad faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Interference with Advantageous Relations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ohio on its claim for interference with advantageous relations.  A claim for interference with advantageous relations depends upon the presence of four criteria:  \"(1) a business relationship or contemplated contract of economic benefit;  (2) the defendant's knowledge of such relationship;  (3) the defendant's intentional and malicious interference with it;  (4) the plaintiff's loss of advantage directly resulting from the defendant's conduct.\"  Comey v. Hill, 387 Mass. 11, 438 N.E.2d 811, 816 (1982);  see also Speen v. Crown Clothing Corp., 102 F.3d 625, 634 (1st Cir.1996).  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has indicated that the third element requires merely an improper interference, and not a malicious one.  See United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, 406 Mass. 811, 551 N.E.2d 20, 23 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Nevertheless, a successful claim must show something more than just the interference itself.  See id.   To the extent, therefore, that any of Ohio's actions could constitute an interference, that alone would not incur liability.  Instead, Miniter must demonstrate wrongfulness beyond the interference itself.  The interference must arise, for example, from improper motives or the use of improper means.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter bases this claim yet again on its contention that Ohio engaged in direct dealings with Shawmut in violation of the no contact agreement and made injurious misrepresentations about the lump sum payment and Miniter.  Our examination of the record has revealed no such conduct.  Miniter points to nothing in addition to the facts we considered in relation to Miniter's breach of contract claims that might support a claim for intentional interference with advantageous relations.  In the absence of record evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find an improper interference, Miniter cannot survive summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Breach of Fiduciary Duty/Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Miniter appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of Ohio on its claim under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A (\"93A\") based on breach of fiduciary duty.  Section 2(a) of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A provides that \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\"  Section 11 extends &#167; 2's general protection to commercial parties.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A &#167; 11;  Industrial Gen. Corp. v. Sequoia Pac.  Sys. Corp., 44 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir.1995).  Whether a particular set of facts constitutes unfair or deceptive acts or practices ordinarily is a question of fact.  See id.   The parameters of conduct the factfinder may consider, however, is a question of law.  See id. at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To fall within these parameters, the conduct which undergirds the complaint must reside \"within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory or other established concept of unfairness,\" or rise to the level of immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous, and result in substantial injury to competitors or other business people.  Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted).  At bottom, a claim under 93A must rest on conduct that attained \" 'a level of rascality that would raise the eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.' \"   See id. at 43 (quoting Quaker State Oil Ref.  Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1513 (1st Cir.1989) (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter contends that the agency agreement placed it and Ohio in a fiduciary relationship, the contours of which derive from \"the established obligations imposed in the industry that an insurer is obligated to refrain from interfering with an independent agent's property right in expirations [and] the concomitant prohibition against engaging in direct dealings with the insured while the agent remains the broker of record.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Miniter that breach of a fiduciary duty might constitute a 93A violation.  See Sequoia Pac.  Sys., 44 F.3d at 44.   We conclude, however, that Ohio did not breach its duty.  Miniter supports its 93A claim with mischaracterizations of the record upon which we have elaborated.  In short, Ohio did not make the misrepresentations Miniter claims, nor did it violate its written or oral agreements.  The record further reflects that Ohio adhered to the industry custom as described by Miniter's expert, Frederick England.  As such, Ohio did not breach a fiduciary duty to Miniter.  Miniter's 93A claim based on breach of fiduciary duty, therefore, fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As amended, Miniter's complaint alleged breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, interference with advantageous relations, and violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167;&#167; 2, 9, and 11</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Grondin testified that he did not have a copy of the letter Donley showed him, and the letter is absent from the record</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> According to Miniter, \"[t]he common sense meaning of produce or 'producer' is one who 'brings forth,' 'brings forward,' 'generates,' or 'causes,' or 'to effect.' \"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Miniter's claim for unjust enrichment also fails.  That claim is based on Miniter's argument that it introduced Shawmut to Ohio, that it brokered the initial policy, that Ohio went behind its back and dealt directly with Shawmut, that Ohio made misrepresentations to Shawmut, all with the result that Ohio benefited by gaining a new client.  See Salamon v. Terra, 394 Mass. 857, 477 N.E.2d 1029, 1031-32 (1985) (remedy lies for value of benefit conferred).  We have already concluded that rather than broker or facilitate the second policy, Miniter urged Shawmut to change carriers and represented to Shawmut that Ohio reneged on its lump sum offer.  Our conclusion that Ohio did not engage in any wrongful conduct precludes any plausible assertion that Miniter conferred a benefit upon Ohio beyond the first policy</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that in Geltman, the Supreme Judicial Court specifically examined the tort of intentional interference with a contract and prospective contractual relations.  The court indicated, however, that at least with respect to the third element, the same standard applied in both torts.  See id. 551 N.E.2d at 23 n. 6</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Miniter Insurance Agency, Inc.  (\"Miniter\") appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Ohio Indemnity Company (\"Ohio\") on Miniter's six-count complaint for damages arising out of a dispute over right to commissions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter, an insurance brokerage located in Quincy, Massachusetts, serves over four hundred and fifty insureds, three hundred of which are banks and other financial institutions.  Banks and financial institutions need, among others, a type of insurance known as Vender's Single Interest Insurance (\"VSI\"), which insures lenders against potential losses arising from the differential between the actual value of a vehicle being financed and the lender's security interest.  VSI is offered by Ohio, an insurance company located in Columbus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, Miniter became broker for Connecticut National Bank (\"CNB\") and procured a VSI policy for CNB through Fidelity and Deposit Insurance Company (\"Fidelity\").  In 1988, CNB merged with Shawmut Bank (\"Shawmut\"), which continued to meet its insurance needs through Miniter.  That same year, Fidelity stopped issuing VSI policies in Massachusetts, and Miniter moved Shawmut's VSI coverage to Travelers Insurance Company (\"Travelers\").  Eventually, Travelers also discontinued its VSI business, which led Miniter to solicit a VSI proposal from Ohio.  In 1990, Ohio agreed to provide VSI to Shawmut, and Miniter and Ohio entered into an agency agreement to effectuate the arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter characterizes the agreement as a nonexclusive agency agreement under which Miniter had no obligation to issue insurance exclusively through Ohio;  Ohio had no obligation to accept only policies brokered by Miniter.  The agency agreement contained several provisions relevant to this dispute.  First, it provided that Miniter would receive commissions of 20% of the premiums paid on policies issued by Ohio to \"policyholders obtained\" by Miniter.  Second, it provided that should a conflict arise as to which agent was entitled to commissions on a particular policy, \"the policyholder's written statement designating his agent or broker shall be binding\" upon Miniter and Ohio.  Third, the agreement provided that Miniter's right to commissions would cease upon proper cancellation of the policy.  Finally, Ohio orally agreed not to contact or deal directly with Shawmut without involving Miniter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1990, Ohio issued the first of two VSI policies to Shawmut.  The first policy provided \"run-off\" coverage, meaning that should either Shawmut or Ohio cancel the policy, Ohio would be obligated to continue coverage for any vehicle insured during the life of the policy.  In order to provide run-off coverage, Ohio needed to hold a portion of each premium in reserve for potential future claims.  According to Ohio, the run-off coverage rendered its policy to Shawmut unprofitable.  Miniter, however, viewed run-off coverage as an essential element of any VSI policy for Shawmut.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1993 David Juredine, Miniter's contact at Ohio, began to indicate to Arthur Donley, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Miniter, that Ohio wished to cease providing run-off coverage to Shawmut.  In the spring of 1994, Juredine indicated to Donley that Ohio would make a one time, lump sum payment to Shawmut of its run-off reserve if Shawmut would relieve Ohio of run-off liability.  During the same period, Gary Grondin, Vice-President of Shawmut who handled VSI, began conveying to Miniter Shawmut's desire to reduce the amount Shawmut paid in premiums on its VSI policy.  At some point Grondin asked Donley to solicit proposals from other carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 19, 1994 Juredine informed Miniter that Ohio could offer a lump sum payment of approximately $2,000,000 to Shawmut.  Miniter immediately communicated this offer to Shawmut.  On May 20, however, Ohio faxed Miniter the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Dear Art:  Please disregard previous and current correspondence (UPS overnight already mailed).  The amount of unearned premiums mentioned is inaccurate.  The new figure is being calculated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 26, Ohio faxed Miniter a new lump sum offer of $1.8 million, contingent on Shawmut's agreement to eliminate the run-off coverage.  Miniter communicated the reduced offer as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From late May into July 1994, Grondin and Donley continued to discuss whether Shawmut would receive the lump sum payment.  The discussions came to a head in mid-July at a meeting between Grondin, Grondin's supervisor, Donley, and Donley's daughter Julianne, who serves as president of Miniter.  Grondin came to the meeting expecting a check from Ohio, payable to Shawmut, in the amount of $1.8 million.  Instead, Donley informed him that Ohio had reneged on its offer, that Ohio had no interest in making a deal, and that he wanted to move Shawmut to a different carrier.  Grondin asked Donley for something in writing to this effect, in response to which Donley produced a letter from Ohio.  Grondin testified that \"[a]fter [he] read the letter ... [he] stated to Arthur Donley that this does not state that David Juredine from [Ohio] didn't want to drop the run-off coverage and give us the $1.8 million.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Grondin then refused to consider proposals Miniter had solicited from other carriers, and cancelled a subsequent meeting with Donley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, Shawmut began to lose patience with Miniter, and felt deceived and \"taken for a ride.\"   Shortly after the meeting, Grondin informed Donley that he wanted to speak directly with someone at Ohio.  Donley responded that Ohio did not want to speak with Shawmut and reiterated his desire to change insurance carriers.  Grondin replied that he did not want to change carriers;  he simply wanted the $1.8 million.  On his own, Grondin began to solicit proposals from other carriers.  Grondin also called Juredine at Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his conversation with Juredine, Grondin indicated that he viewed Ohio's offer and subsequent retraction as very unethical.  Grondin also informed Juredine that Shawmut sought to broker a new policy directly with a carrier rather than work through Miniter or any agent and that Shawmut intended to change carriers.  Grondin indicated, however, that if Juredine wished to submit a proposal, Grondin would consider it.  Juredine responded that he had \"no problem\" giving Shawmut the 1.8 million dollars.  In the same conversation Juredine also informed Grondin that Ohio had no problem letting Shawmut have a portion of the commissions, but that Donley did not want to reduce Miniter's commission level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juredine then called Donley and apprised him that Grondin had contacted him and that Shawmut wanted to work through its own in-house agency, that is, Shawmut wanted some or all of the commissions deriving from the VSI policy.  Donley asked Juredine what he planned to do and Juredine responded that he had to save the business for Ohio before he could worry about Miniter.  Donley gave no indication to Juredine whether Shawmut had terminated Miniter.  He simply reminded Juredine that he was not to negotiate with Shawmut directly without Miniter's involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that point forward Shawmut began to negotiate VSI coverage directly with Ohio.  On July 28, 1994 Ohio and Shawmut came to an agreement on the second VSI policy.  The terms of the second policy designated the Shawmut Insurance Agency as the broker and required Ohio to pay commissions of 30%.  The new policy did not include run-off coverage.  It did include a lump sum payment to Shawmut of just over $2 million, representing the $1.8 million plus additional reserves earned during the summer of 1994.  Also on July 28, Grondin and his supervisor informed Donley by telephone that Shawmut was terminating its relationship with Miniter, and Grondin followed up with a letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the award of summary judgment de novo.

Ohio removed the case to federal district court in Massachusetts.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332.  The parties agree that, pursuant to a choice of law provision in the agency agreement, Ohio law governs Miniter's contract based claims, and that Massachusetts law governs Miniter's tort claims.  The parties dispute only which state's law governs the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, ostensibly because of Ohio's contention that the common law of the state of Ohio does not recognize such a cause of action in these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that \"[w]here ... the parties have agreed about what law governs, a federal court sitting in diversity is free, if it chooses, to forego an independent analysis and accept the parties' agreement.\"  Borden v.

Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter advances two arguments within its breach of contract claim.  First, it asserts, Ohio breached the written agreement by failing to pay Miniter commissions for the second policy issued to Shawmut.  Second, Miniter contends, Ohio breached \"its subsidiary but separate promise\" not to contact or deal directly with Shawmut without involving Miniter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Agency Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant provisions of the agency agreement provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>The Agent shall be entitled to commissions equal to 20% of the written premiums paid on policies issued by the Company to policyholders obtained by the Agent.  If a conflict exists as to which producer is authorized to represent a policyholder, the policyholder's written statement designating his agent or broker shall be binding upon the Agent and the Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>The Agent's right to commissions shall cease upon cancellation of a policy in accordance with the cancellation provisions in the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the relevant terms of the agency agreement unambiguous, and held that as a matter of law Shawmut's designation of its in-house agency as broker of record disposed of Miniter's claim to commissions on the second policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Miniter asserts that the language in the agreement allows for more than one interpretation, and therefore, should have precluded summary judgment.  Specifically, Miniter asserts that an issue of fact exists whether it \"obtained\" Shawmut for purposes of the agency agreement.  Miniter also contends that the term \"producer\" does not apply in this situation between an agent and the insured client.  Instead, Miniter contends, the term should only apply in situations involving two competing insurance agents.  Finally, Miniter avers that it produced the second policy.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the parties' nor our own examination of Ohio law has uncovered any cases construing the disputed terms of the agency agreement.  We turn, therefore, to general principles of contract construction.  In Ohio, construction of written contracts is a matter of law, with the underlying purpose of discovering and effectuating the intent of the parties.  See Graham v. Drydock Coal Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">949</span></span>, 952 (1996).  We must give common words appearing in written contracts \"their plain and ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results or unless some other meaning is clearly intended from the face or overall contents\" of the contract.  Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>, 150 (1978).  We may consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain the parties' intent either when faced with unclear or ambiguous language, or when circumstances surrounding the agreement give the plain language special meaning.  See Graham, 667 N.E.2d at 952.  \"[W]here the terms in an existing contract are clear and unambiguous,\" however, we \"cannot in effect create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language employed by the parties.\"  Alexander, 374 N.E.2d at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the language of the agency agreement is clear and unambiguous, and provides without caveat that the policyholder's written statement designating its agent binds Miniter and Ohio.  The agency agreement provides that the agent's right to commissions shall cease upon cancellation of a policy.  The parties do not dispute that Shawmut cancelled the first policy, terminating Miniter's right to commissions.  The agency agreement further provides that the policyholder's designation of its agent or broker shall be binding on Miniter and Ohio.  Shawmut's written statement designating its in-house agency as its agent, therefore, controls disbursement of commissions under the second policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter's contention that it \"obtained\" Shawmut for purposes of the second policy fails to find support either in the agreement or the record.  Miniter asserts that by introducing Shawmut to Ohio and brokering the first policy, Miniter obtained Shawmut for the second policy.  On that basis, Miniter contends, the agency agreement requires Ohio to remit commissions to Miniter, and not Shawmut.  The most obvious flaw in this argument is that it ignores the sentence immediately following the \"obtained\" sentence, which, as we have pointed out, provides that in the event of a conflict, the policyholder's written statement designating its agent shall bind Miniter and Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record further belies Miniter's assertion.  Shawmut cancelled the first policy, initiated discussions with Ohio as well as other carriers, and ultimately made a deal with Ohio.  Shawmut's decision to work in-house rather than through an independent agency fatally undermines Miniter's contention that it obtained Shawmut for Ohio for purposes of the second policy.  Further, as we discuss in greater detail below, Miniter tried to steer Shawmut away from Ohio toward another carrier rather than maintain Shawmut as a policyholder of Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter ominously argues that to interpret the agency agreement in this fashion \"would eviscerate the independent agency practice and arm insurers with a lethal weapon for eliminating and compromising the intermediary agent after the account has been brought to it.\"   Miniter's interpretation would effectively allow Miniter to collect premiums on any policies Ohio issued to Shawmut, whether or not it actually brokered them, simply because it brokered the initial VSI policy between those parties.  Miniter's interpretation would preclude Ohio from honoring Shawmut's designation in any insurance policies Ohio issued to Shawmut.  In other words, that interpretation would contradict subsequent provisions in the same section of the agreement.  We reiterate that \"where the terms in an existing contract are clear and unambiguous, [we] cannot in effect create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language.\"  Alexander, 374 N.E.2d at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter argues that \"the producer provision applies when there are two competing insurance agents, not between an agent and the insured.\"   Miniter points to no language in the agreement limiting that provision beyond its plain terms.  Ohio law dictates that we must presume that the written contract reflects the intent of the parties, see Graham, 667 N.E.2d at 952, and that we may consider extrinsic evidence only when that language is ambiguous or when circumstances surrounding the agreement give the plain language special meaning.  See id.   Miniter points us to no authority indicating that an insured may not procure insurance directly from a carrier, and in effect, act as its own agent or broker.  We do not identify any special circumstances surrounding this agreement which might give the plain language special meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that by the terms of the agreement, the producer provision only takes effect when a conflict exists regarding which producer represents a policyholder.  Shawmut informed Ohio that it would no longer be working through Miniter and that it was seeking proposals for a new policy.  Shawmut cancelled the first policy.  While Miniter now attempts to generate a conflict, or argue that the provision does not govern this situation, nothing in the record triggers the producer provision inasmuch as Shawmut on its own affirmatively undertook to negotiate the second policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally unavailing is Miniter's argument that it, and not Shawmut's in-house agency, produced the second policy.  Accepting Miniter's definition of \"produced,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the record does not support its contention that, at a minimum, a dispute of fact exists as to whether it or Shawmut produced the second policy.  Instead, as the record demonstrates, Miniter repeatedly urged Shawmut to move its business to another carrier rather than come to an agreement with Ohio, and effectively forced Shawmut to produce the policy by itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grondin's undisputed testimony reflects Miniter's indication that Ohio was no longer interested in making a deal with Shawmut involving the lump sum payment.  Miniter made this assertion despite the fact that Ohio remained willing to remit $1.8 million to Shawmut.  In addition, Miniter tried to present Shawmut with proposals from other companies and urged Shawmut to let Miniter move the account to a different carrier.  It was not until Shawmut decided to work directly with a carrier and contacted Ohio that the second policy began to take shape.  On the undisputed facts in this record, Miniter cannot lay claim to commissions on the second policy by claiming that it, and not Shawmut, produced the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The No-Contact Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of summary judgment, Ohio does not dispute that in addition to the written agency agreement, Miniter and Ohio orally agreed that Ohio would neither communicate nor deal directly with Shawmut without including Miniter.  The district court found that Ohio did not breach the no-contact agreement on the basis that Shawmut decided to terminate Miniter prior to initiating direct contact with Ohio and then informed Ohio of that fact.  Miniter makes three principal arguments on appeal:  (1) compliance with the agreement did not hinge on which party initiated the contact;  (2) Ohio's wrongful conduct precipitated Shawmut's contact and Ohio's misrepresentations then compounded the situation;  and (3) whether and when Shawmut intended to terminate Miniter presents a dispute of fact that precludes summary judgment on this claim.  Miniter attempts to buttress these arguments with evidence of an industry custom which it alleges Ohio violated.  We find none of Miniter's arguments persuasive and conclude that on this record no reasonable jury could find that Ohio breached the no-contact agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We understand Miniter's first argument essentially to contend that even if Shawmut initiated the direct contact, the agreement bound Ohio to include Miniter on the substantive discussions as long as Miniter remained Shawmut's broker of record.  Even if the fact that Shawmut initiated the contact does not relieve Ohio of its obligations under the no-contact agreement, the undisputed substance of Shawmut's initial contact does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the July meeting which failed to net Shawmut a $1.8 million payment, Grondin informed Donley that he wished to contact Ohio.  He then called Juredine at Ohio, as well as at least one other insurance company, to solicit proposals.  Grondin told Juredine of his disappointment that Ohio had reneged on the $1.8 million lump sum payment, that he was planning to change carriers, that Shawmut was no longer going to use Miniter, that Shawmut desired to work directly with a carrier rather than through an agent, and that if Juredine wished he could submit a proposal.  Juredine then apprised Miniter of the situation.  Only then did Grondin and Juredine engage in substantive discussions on a second VSI policy.  In other words, only after Shawmut told Ohio that Miniter was out of the picture, that Ohio was next on the chopping block, and Ohio informed Miniter of the situation did Juredine and Grondin engage in substantive negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record does not support Miniter's contention that misconduct by Ohio precipitated Shawmut's contact with Ohio.  Miniter takes the position that Ohio, in retracting the initial offer of $2 million, injured Miniter's credibility with Shawmut, its client.  The record, however, does not support Miniter's claim.  Ohio erred in its calculation of $2 million and immediately informed Miniter of that error.  Six days later, Ohio submitted a recalculated figure of $1.8 million.  Contrary to Donley's claims to Grondin and Grondin's supervisor, Ohio never indicated that it no longer wished to negotiate a lump sum deal.  Grondin's disgruntlement came not from the reduction of the figure to $1.8 million, but from his understanding from Donley that Ohio had backed out altogether.  In his deposition Grondin repeatedly testified that Shawmut expected $1.8 million from Ohio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record similarly does not support Miniter's claim that Ohio's misrepresentations following Shawmut's initial contact in any way compounded the situation.  Miniter contends that Ohio cast Miniter in a poor light by averring that it never had a problem with the lump sum payment.  As the record reflects, however, Ohio simply told the truth.  Ohio's concern had been primarily with the amount, which it reduced from $2 million to $1.8 million, as well as with some of the details of the revised VSI coverage.  Despite Miniter's characterizations, Ohio remained willing to provide, and ultimately did provide Shawmut with a lump sum payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter also asserts that Ohio falsely informed Shawmut that \"any impediment to any deal was Miniter's commission expense.\"   This mischaracterizes the record.  Grondin testified that in their first conversation, and after he informed Juredine that Shawmut desired to work directly with a carrier, Juredine responded that he had neither a problem with paying a $1.8 million lump sum nor with giving Shawmut a part of the commissions or a fee, but that Donley did not want to reduce his commission percentage.  Nothing in the record supports Miniter's highly exaggerated characterization of Juredine's remark.  In addition, Juredine did not make that remark until after Grondin informed him that Shawmut would no longer be working through Miniter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter asserts that an issue of fact as to when Shawmut actually terminated Miniter should have precluded summary judgment on its breach of the no contact agreement claim.  The district court found that Ohio did not breach the no contact agreement in part because it determined that by the time Shawmut contacted Ohio, Shawmut had already decided to terminate Miniter.  Miniter correctly asserts that Shawmut did not formally terminate its brokerage designation until after Shawmut had negotiated the second policy with Ohio.  Until that time the record supports a conclusion that Shawmut remained willing to consider any proposal Miniter might have made along with any other proposals Shawmut received.  Grondin would have treated a proposal from Miniter like any other he received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that to the extent an issue of fact exists as to when Shawmut decided to terminate Miniter, it is not material to this dispute.  See J. Geils Band, 76 F.3d at 1250-51 (explaining that a material fact is one that has the potential to affect the outcome of the dispute).  What is material is what Grondin conveyed to Juredine in the first call, namely, that Shawmut would no longer be working through Miniter or any independent agent, that Shawmut intended to change carriers, and that Ohio could submit a proposal if it wished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Miniter points to the affidavit of its expert, Frederick J. England, Jr., to establish the insurance industry custom that insurers should not engage in direct dealings with insureds who are also clients of independent agents.  According to Miniter, Ohio's violation of this custom further supports Miniter's claim for breach of the no-contact agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">England defines the industry custom as an obligation by Ohio not to engage in continuous dealings or discussions, regardless of whether Shawmut initiated the contact, without first seeking to involve Miniter.  The facts in this record do not support Miniter's assertion that Ohio violated industry custom.  During the first call from Grondin, Juredine urged Shawmut to officially resolve the situation with Miniter prior to moving forward.  Juredine then called Donley to inform him of the situation.  Notably, Donley did not clarify to Ohio whether or not Shawmut had terminated Miniter.  He merely exhorted Juredine not to negotiate with Shawmut without his involvement.  We conclude that Ohio made a good faith effort to abide by the custom in the industry as England describes it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Miniter's Remaining Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to breach of contract, Miniter alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional interference with advantageous relations, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Massachusetts unfair trade practices statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A. Each of these claims rests in large part on the conduct which has failed to support Miniter's claim for breach of the no contact agreement.  We find each of Miniter's arguments on appeal unpersuasive.  For the sake of thoroughness, however, we discuss each of them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter alleged that Ohio's breach of the no contact agreement violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ohio, determining that \"Ohio courts have declined to recognize the doctrine in an at-will employment context.\"   On appeal Miniter argues alternatively that Ohio does recognize the implied covenant in this context and that the district court should have applied Massachusetts law, which recognizes the implied covenant in every contract.  Appellee Ohio, by contrast, seeks to apply the law of the state of Ohio, arguing that Ohio law does not recognize Miniter's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not determine which state's law governs.  Even if, as Miniter contends, the common law of Ohio recognizes a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Miniter has not discussed how Ohio law would apply in this case.  Instead, Miniter argues the merits of this claim only under the law of Massachusetts.  We have indicated that \"issues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\"  Ryan v. Royal Ins.

We conclude, moreover, that Miniter cannot prevail under the law of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have recognized, \"Massachusetts law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every existing contract.\"  F.D.I.C. v.

Under this implied covenant, \" 'neither party shall do anything that will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.' \"  Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 820 (quoting Druker v.

The existence of the covenant in no way depends on the level of sophistication of the parties.  Massachusetts law implies the covenant even in contracts between sophisticated business people.  See id. 583 N.E.2d at 821.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Miniter, Ohio dealt directly with Shawmut in breach of the no contact agreement and falsely indicated to Shawmut a willingness to pay the lump sum with the purpose of excluding Miniter from any deal, thereby eliminating Miniter's commissions.  Miniter claims that Ohio's actions \"were calculated and intended to subvert the relationship and to otherwise obtain the Shawmut account directly and eliminate Miniter's involvement and commission.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter, however, fails to identify evidence in the record that would establish a genuine issue of material fact whether Ohio acted in bad faith.  The record indicates that by the time Shawmut began negotiating with Ohio Grondin had informed Juredine that Shawmut was no longer working through Miniter.  Juredine, moreover, informed Donley of the situation shortly after he received Grondin's call.  In short, the record does not support Miniter's contention that Ohio acted to destroy or injure Miniter's rights to the fruits of the contract.  See Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 820.   Assuming Massachusetts law governs this claim, Miniter fails to point to record evidence supporting its allegations that Ohio acted in bad faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Interference with Advantageous Relations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Ohio on its claim for interference with advantageous relations.  A claim for interference with advantageous relations depends upon the presence of four criteria:  \"(1) a business relationship or contemplated contract of economic benefit;  (2) the defendant's knowledge of such relationship;  (3) the defendant's intentional and malicious interference with it;  (4) the plaintiff's loss of advantage directly resulting from the defendant's conduct.\"  Comey v.

The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has indicated that the third element requires merely an improper interference, and not a malicious one.  See United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2090012\"><a href=\"/opinion/2090012/united-truck-leasing-corp-v-geltman/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2090012\"><a href=\"/opinion/2090012/united-truck-leasing-corp-v-geltman/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Nevertheless, a successful claim must show something more than just the interference itself.  See id.   To the extent, therefore, that any of Ohio's actions could constitute an interference, that alone would not incur liability.  Instead, Miniter must demonstrate wrongfulness beyond the interference itself.  The interference must arise, for example, from improper motives or the use of improper means.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter bases this claim yet again on its contention that Ohio engaged in direct dealings with Shawmut in violation of the no contact agreement and made injurious misrepresentations about the lump sum payment and Miniter.  Our examination of the record has revealed no such conduct.  Miniter points to nothing in addition to the facts we considered in relation to Miniter's breach of contract claims that might support a claim for intentional interference with advantageous relations.

Gen. Laws ch.  93A (\"93A\") based on breach of fiduciary duty.  Section 2(a) of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A provides that \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\"  Section 11 extends &#167; 2's general protection to commercial parties.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A &#167; 11;  Industrial Gen. Corp. v. Sequoia Pac.  Sys. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195833\"><a href=\"/opinion/195833/industrial-v-sequoia/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1995).  Whether a particular set of facts constitutes unfair or deceptive acts or practices ordinarily is a question of fact.  See id.   The parameters of conduct the factfinder may consider, however, is a question of law.  See id. at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To fall within these parameters, the conduct which undergirds the complaint must reside \"within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory or other established concept of unfairness,\" or rise to the level of immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous, and result in substantial injury to competitors or other business people.  Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted).  At bottom, a claim under 93A must rest on conduct that attained \" 'a level of rascality that would raise the eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.' \"   See id. at 43 (quoting Quaker State Oil Ref.  Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529278\"><a href=\"/opinion/529278/quaker-state-oil-refining-corporation-v-garrity-oil-company-inc-quaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span>, 1513 (1st Cir.1989) (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miniter contends that the agency agreement placed it and Ohio in a fiduciary relationship, the contours of which derive from \"the established obligations imposed in the industry that an insurer is obligated to refrain from interfering with an independent agent's property right in expirations [and] the concomitant prohibition against engaging in direct dealings with the insured while the agent remains the broker of record.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Miniter that breach of a fiduciary duty might constitute a 93A violation.  See Sequoia Pac.  Sys., 44 F.3d at 44.   We conclude, however, that Ohio did not breach its duty.  Miniter supports its 93A claim with mischaracterizations of the record upon which we have elaborated.  In short, Ohio did not make the misrepresentations Miniter claims, nor did it violate its written or oral agreements.  The record further reflects that Ohio adhered to the industry custom as described by Miniter's expert, Frederick England.  As such, Ohio did not breach a fiduciary duty to Miniter.  Miniter's 93A claim based on breach of fiduciary duty, therefore, fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As amended, Miniter's complaint alleged breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, interference with advantageous relations, and violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167;&#167; 2, 9, and 11</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Grondin testified that he did not have a copy of the letter Donley showed him, and the letter is absent from the record</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> According to Miniter, \"[t]he common sense meaning of produce or 'producer' is one who 'brings forth,' 'brings forward,' 'generates,' or 'causes,' or 'to effect.' \"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Miniter's claim for unjust enrichment also fails.  That claim is based on Miniter's argument that it introduced Shawmut to Ohio, that it brokered the initial policy, that Ohio went behind its back and dealt directly with Shawmut, that Ohio made misrepresentations to Shawmut, all with the result that Ohio benefited by gaining a new client.  See Salamon v. Terra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2048377\"><a href=\"/opinion/2048377/salamon-v-terra/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2048377\"><a href=\"/opinion/2048377/salamon-v-terra/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span>, 1031-32 (1985) (remedy lies for value of benefit conferred).  We have already concluded that rather than broker or facilitate the second policy, Miniter urged Shawmut to change carriers and represented to Shawmut that Ohio reneged on its lump sum offer.  Our conclusion that Ohio did not engage in any wrongful conduct precludes any plausible assertion that Miniter conferred a benefit upon Ohio beyond the first policy</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that in Geltman, the Supreme Judicial Court specifically examined the tort of intentional interference with a contract and prospective contractual relations.  The court indicated, however, that at least with respect to the third element, the same standard applied in both torts.  See id. 551 N.E.2d at 23 n. 6</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
