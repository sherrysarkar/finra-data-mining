Stern, United States\r\nAttorney, and John F. Daly, Attorney, Appellate Staff, were on\r\nbrief for Andrew Cuomo, Etc.\r\nCarl A.S. Coan, Jr., with whom Carl A.S.

The United States\r\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") agreed to\r\nsubsidize a portion of tenants' rents in a housing rehabilitation\r\nproject owned by the Heywood-Wakefield Associates Limited\r\nPartnership (\"Heywood-Wakefield\").  Appellee/cross-appellant\r\nTrafalgar Capital Associates, Inc. (\"Trafalgar\"), the general\r\npartner of Heywood-Wakefield, complained that HUD miscalculated\r\nthe amounts to which the project was entitled.  Upon cross-motions\r\nfor summary judgment, the district court found that three decisions\r\nby HUD were arbitrary and capricious and that Trafalgar's claim on\r\na fourth HUD decision was barred by the statute of limitations.  We\r\nhold that the district court erred on two of the claims, but\r\ncorrectly ruled for HUD on the third and on the statute of\r\nlimitations.  We accordingly affirm in part, and reverse in part. \r\n                     I. Background\r\nA. Statutory Scheme\r\nHUD agreed to subsidize Trafalgar's project under the\r\nModerate Rehabilitation Program, 42 U.S.C.  1437f(e)(2), one of\r\nthe programs under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of\r\n1937, 42 U.S.C.  1437f (\"Section 8\").   The Moderate\r\nRehabilitation Program is designed to encourage private individuals\r\nto rehabilitate low and moderate income housing through the award\r\nof rent subsidies.  Under the program, HUD contracts with local\r\npublic housing agencies, which in turn contract with the project\r\nowners who rehabilitate the property.  Regulations require the\r\nlocal public housing agency to secure a preliminary contract with\r\nthe project owner prior to rehabilitation, and a permanent\r\nagreement once the rehabilitation is completed and the units are\r\nready for occupancy.  \r\nBoth the preliminary agreement, known as the \"AHAP,\" or\r\nAgreement to Enter into a Housing Assistance Payments contract, and\r\nthe permanent agreement, known as the \"HAP,\" or Housing Assistance\r\nPayments contract, set a \"contract rent\" based on the applicable\r\nregulations.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408 (1998).  Residents eligible\r\nfor Section 8 housing are required to pay rent based on their\r\nmonthly income.  See 42 U.S.C.  1437a(a).  HUD pays the owner the\r\ndifference between the \"contract rent\" and the amount the resident\r\npays.  See 42 U.S.C.  1437f(c)(3)(A). \r\nThe contract rent is based on two components: 1) the\r\n\"monthly rehabilitation debt service,\" which covers the cost of\r\nrehabilitation; and 2) the \"base rent,\" reflecting the cost of\r\nowning, managing, and maintaining the property independent of\r\nrehabilitation costs.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408(c)(2) (1998).  The\r\nbase rent is also allowed to incorporate a reasonable return on\r\ninvestment.  HUD Handbook 7420.3 (\"HUD Handbook\"), p. 2.  Both the\r\nbase rent component and the contract rent total are subject to\r\nmarket-based ceilings, and are adjusted annually.  See 42 U.S.C.\r\n1437f(c); 24 C.F.R.  882.410(a)(1) (1998).  The base rent is\r\nordinarily capped at the Existing Housing Fair Market Rent (\"FMR\"),\r\nand the contract rent has a ceiling of 120 percent of the relevant\r\nFMR.  See 42 U.S.C.  1437f(c); 24 C.F.R.  882.408(a) (1998). \r\nFMRs, published annually by HUD, are based on an analysis of the\r\nrents charged for similar standard units in the same general\r\ngeographic region. See 42 U.S.C.  1437f(c).\r\nIn certain situations HUD can approve increases for costs\r\nnot sufficiently taken into account in the contract rent\r\ncalculation.   An \"exception rent\" may be granted if the FMR does\r\nnot accurately reflect the actual rents charged in the project's\r\n\"specified area,\" meaning its more narrowly defined geographic\r\nregion.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408(b) (1998), HUD Handbook, Ch. 10,\r\n10-2(c)(1).  If HUD approves such an exception rent, the owner may\r\ncharge an additional 10 percent over the usual contract rent\r\nceiling.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408(b) (1998).\r\nB. Facts\r\nIn February 1984, Trafalgar filed its proposal with HUD\r\nto convert an abandoned furniture factory in Gardner, Massachusetts\r\ninto moderate income housing.  The preliminary AHAP for the project\r\nwas executed on April 30, 1986, with a retroactive effective date\r\nof February 8, 1986.  The rehabilitation proceeded in four stages. \r\nAfter the fourth stage was completed, the final portion of the\r\npermanent HAP was executed on April 17, 1990.\r\nTrafalgar also has a contract in connection with the same\r\nproject to receive more than $1.1 million in assistance over 15\r\nyears from a state program known as the Massachusetts State Housing\r\nAssistance for Rental Production (\"SHARP\") program.\r\nTrafalgar believed that HUD made several incorrect\r\ndecisions that had the effect of reducing the subsidies to which\r\nTrafalgar was entitled.  After lengthy correspondence and proposals\r\nto revise the HAP, Trafalgar brought this action under the\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C.  551-59, 701-6,\r\nand the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.  2201.  Trafalgar's\r\ncomplaint charged four errors: (1) HUD erroneously excluded costs\r\nincurred before the AHAP; (2) HUD improperly refused to raise the\r\ncontract rent after offsetting errors were discovered; (3) HUD\r\nmistakenly characterized the Massachusetts SHARP assistance as a\r\ngrant rather than a loan; and (4) HUD incorrectly used the 1985 FMR\r\ninstead of the 1986 FMR.  Upon cross-motions for summary judgment,\r\nthe district court ruled that HUD's decisions on the first three\r\nissues were arbitrary and capricious, but that Trafalgar's claim on\r\nthe fourth was barred by the statute of limitations.  Both parties\r\nappealed.\r\nAdditional facts will be developed in subsequent sections \r\nas they become relevant.\r\n                     II. Discussion\r\nThis court reviews the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to\r\nthe non-moving party.  See FDIC v. Kane, 148 F.3d 36, 38 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).  We can affirm only if \"the record discloses no trialworthy\r\nissue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment\r\nas a matter of law.\"  EEOC v. Green, 76 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).\r\nWith respect to the three HUD decisions, they can only be\r\nset aside if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\r\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"  5 U.S.C. \r\n706(2)(A).  When exposed to judicial review, HUD's decisions are\r\nentitled to \"great deference\" and are presumed valid.  Associated\r\nFisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  The court must affirm HUD's decisions if they are\r\n\"reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\" \r\nId.  \"Although searching and careful, review under the 'arbitrary\r\nand capricious' standard is narrow in scope.\"  Pan Am. Grain Mfg.\r\nCo. v. E.P.A., 95 F.3d 101, 103 (1st Cir. 1996).  The court may not\r\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the agency, and agency\r\ndecisions will be upheld so long as they \"do not collide directly\r\nwith substantive statutory commands and so long as procedural\r\ncorners are squarely turned.\"  Adams v. E.P.A., 38 F.3d 43, 49 (1st\r\nCir. 1994).  The court's deference to HUD's decisions \"is magnified\r\nwhen the agency interprets its own regulations.\"  Puerto Rico\r\nAqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. E.P.A., 35 F.3d 600, 604 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nWhile this standard of review is highly deferential, \"it is not a\r\nrubber stamp.\"  Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear\r\nRegulatory Comm'n, 59 F.3d 284, 290 (1st Cir. 1995).  To avoid\r\nbeing found arbitrary and capricious, HUD's decision must be\r\nrational; that is it \"must make sense to [the] reviewing court[].\" \r\nPuerto Rico Sun Oil Co. v. E.P.A., 8 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nWhether the statute of limitations barred Trafalgar's\r\nclaim regarding the relevant FMR is an issue of law, and that\r\naspect of the district court's decision will be reviewed de novo.\r\nSee American Airlines, Inc. v. Cardoza-Rodriguez, 133 F.3d 111, 125\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).\r\nA.  Whether HUD improperly excluded costs incurred before February\r\n8, 1985 from the rent calculation.\r\nAlthough HUD regulations require that the parties execute\r\nan AHAP before the owner begins rehabilitation, see 42 C.F.R. \r\n882.505 (1998), Trafalgar started work before executing such an\r\nagreement.  When the public housing agency overseeing\r\nrehabilitation learned of Trafalgar's failure to enter into the\r\nAHAP, it ordered rehabilitation halted, and a meeting was called on\r\nFebruary 5, 1986.  At that meeting the parties agreed to execute an\r\nAHAP, which they finally did on April 30, 1986.  Because it was\r\nclear that the AHAP would be executed, and the parties wanted\r\nrehabilitation to continue, they agreed at the meeting to backdate\r\nthe AHAP to February 8, 1986, three days hence. \r\nBetween the date the proposal was submitted and February\r\n8, 1986, Trafalgar had spent about $1.6 million on rehabilitation.\r\nAt the February 5 meeting the parties discussed how these funds\r\nmight be incorporated into the amounts Trafalgar could recover from\r\nHUD, but they evidently did not settle the specific method for\r\ndoing so.  HUD, however, later determined that regulations barred\r\nincluding the $1.6 million in the subsidy calculations.  The\r\ndistrict court ruled that HUD's apparent reversal was arbitrary and\r\ncapricious.  Our review persuades us to the contrary.\r\nIt is undisputed that Trafalgar's pre-AHAP costs could\r\nonly be incorporated into the base rent section of the contract\r\nrent because the monthly rehabilitation debt service may include\r\nonly the rehabilitation costs incurred after the AHAP's effective\r\ndate.  Trafalgar argues that the amount should be allowed under\r\neither of two different sub-parts of base rent: the property debt\r\nservice or return on investment.  HUD argues that the structure and\r\nlanguage of the regulations prohibit it from including the disputed\r\ncosts in either category.  We consider each possibility in turn.\r\n1. Property Debt Service.  HUD denied Trafalgar's request\r\nthat the expenses be included in the property debt service on the\r\nground that that component is temporally limited to costs incurred\r\nbefore the project proposal is submitted to HUD.  Trafalgar argues\r\nthat the regulations and HUD Handbook impose no such limitation. \r\nEach side cites language in the HUD Handbook to support its\r\nposition.\r\nThe Handbook sets forth detailed guidelines to which HUD\r\nmust adhere in setting the terms of an AHAP and a HAP.  It includes\r\na form for calculating the base and contract rents, as well as\r\nextensive instructions on how to complete the form.  HUD points to\r\nthe \"property debt service\" instructions, which require the owner\r\nto \"[e]nter the annual principal and interest (P &amp; I) payments for\r\nloans related to purchase and improvement of the property at the\r\ndate of proposal submittal.\"  HUD Handbook, p. 9 (emphasis omitted\r\nand added).  \r\nTrafalgar, in response, looks to the general overview\r\nlanguage, which states that the base rent should reflect the\r\n\"[a]nnual expenses for property debt service, insurance, taxes,\r\nutilities, management, and maintenance, projected to the date of\r\nHAP contract execution.\"  HUD Handbook, p. 2 (emphasis added). \r\nHowever, Trafalgar neglects to mention that the Handbook describes\r\nthis overview as a \"brief summary,\" and notes that \"[d]etailed\r\ninstructions are contained in the rent calculation formats.\"  Id. \r\nThe fact that the overview language states that a variety of costs\r\nshould be calculated to the date of the HAP contract execution does\r\nnot alter Trafalgar's obligation to comply with the specific\r\ninstructions on how those calculations are to be performed.  As HUD\r\nrecognizes, the provision allowing for annual expenses to be\r\n\"projected to the date of HAP contract execution,\" is HUD's method\r\nof acknowledging that estimated increases in operating costs should\r\nbe included.  The provision does not authorize inclusion of\r\nrehabilitation costs, or any other costs not otherwise within the\r\ninstructions for property debt service.\r\nThe well-known canon of statutory construction that the\r\nspecific governs the general dictates the same result.  See Moralesv. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 384-85 (1992); Lloydv. FDIC, 22 F.3d 335, 337 (1st Cir. 1994).  The specific limitation\r\nthat property debt service includes only costs prior to proposal\r\nsubmission trumps the general language that the costs should be\r\ncalculated through the date of HAP execution.\r\nNot only the Handbook's language but also the logic of\r\nthe subsidy program supports HUD's position.  In essence Trafalgar\r\nargues that the $1.6 million is recoverable as part of the property\r\ndebt service regardless of when it was spent.  This approach would\r\njustify inclusion of the same costs in two parts of the contract\r\nrent.  If Trafalgar had followed the HUD regulations and executed\r\nan AHAP prior to beginning rehabilitation, the costs would have\r\nbeen includable in the monthly rehabilitation debt service\r\ncomponent.  Its argument here is that they are also recoverable\r\nunder the property debt service sub-part of base rent.  Trafalgar's\r\nargument assumes a redundancy in the Handbook, and deprives the\r\ndistinction between rehabilitation debt service and base rent of\r\nany sense.  The structure of the subsidy calculations confirms the\r\nconclusion that Trafalgar is not entitled to recover these pre-AHAP\r\nrehabilitation costs as part of the property debt service.\r\n2. Return on Investment.  The only other possible method\r\nfor recovering these costs is including them as part of \"an\r\nadequate return on the owner's investment.\"  HUD Handbook, p. 2. \r\nIn general, return on investment is limited in the same manner as\r\nthe property debt service: it is capped at \"the owner's actual cash\r\nequity in the property at the time of proposal submission.\"  HUD\r\nHandbook, p. 13 (emphasis added).  However, the notes detailing how\r\nto calculate return on investment create a narrow exception for\r\npost-proposal, pre-AHAP investment.\r\nUnder the Handbook the return on investment element may\r\ninclude post-proposal costs if two conditions are met: 1) a\r\n\"prolonged period [must have] elapsed between proposal submission\r\nand [AHAP] execution;\" and 2) consistent with other requests for\r\nreturn on investment, the costs must be expended from \"actual cash\r\nequity.\"  HUD Handbook, p. 13.  Actual cash equity is defined as\r\nthe cost of capital expenditures less the outstanding indebtedness. \r\nSee id.  Taking these provisions together, the owner may capture an\r\nadequate return on investment for rehabilitation undertaken only\r\nthrough capital expenditures, not through borrowed funds, and only \r\nif there was a prolonged delay between proposal and AHAP.  \r\nHUD determined that Trafalgar's post-proposal, pre-AHAP\r\ncosts could not be included in a return on investment request,\r\ndespite its meeting the prolonged period element, because Trafalgar\r\nfailed to meet the actual cash equity requirement.  The $1.6\r\nmillion was expended from borrowed funds, not owner capital. \r\nTrafalgar argues that differentiating between actual cash equity\r\nand financed funds for the purposes of return on investment is\r\narbitrary and capricious.  \r\nIn our view, limiting return on investment to capital\r\nexpenditures is fully supportable.  HUD recognizes that the larger\r\ncosts, such as the cost of acquiring the property, could either be\r\nfinanced or paid out of owner capital, and has established a scheme\r\nto deal with each scenario.  For financed costs, HUD allows the\r\nowner to be repaid the principal and interest through property debt\r\nservice.  For large costs paid from owner capital, HUD allows the\r\nowner to recoup the expenditure plus a reasonable \"return on\r\ninvestment.\"  In theory then, owners are repaid any borrowed costs\r\nthrough property debt service and any capital expenditures through\r\nreturn on investment.  Under this scheme, it is not arbitrary and\r\ncapricious to restrict property debt service to outstanding\r\nindebtedness, and limit return on investment to actual cash equity.\r\nThe problem for Trafalgar is that it incurred\r\nrehabilitation expenses earlier than it should have.  Had Trafalgar\r\ncomplied with HUD regulations and executed an AHAP before\r\ncommencing rehabilitation, see 24 C.F.R.  882.505 (1998), its\r\ncosts would have been incorporated into rehabilitation debt\r\nservice.  Although the parties discussed the possibility of\r\nincluding pre-AHAP costs in base rent, the HUD Handbook, available\r\nto Trafalgar at the time, provides for return on investment only if\r\nthe two conditions are met.  HUD's ultimate decision to follow its\r\nHandbook in dealing with the situation once it understood that\r\nTrafalgar could not comply with both conditions was \"reasoned and\r\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\"  Associate\r\nFisheries, 127 F.3d at 109.  In fact, a decision to allow Trafalgar\r\nto recover these costs, contrary to the regulations and the HUD\r\nHandbook, might have provoked criticism that HUD was acting\r\narbitrarily and capriciously by inconsistently applying its own\r\npolicies.\r\nWe therefore conclude that HUD appropriately denied\r\nTrafalgar's request to include the $1.6 million in base rent. \r\nHUD's regulations reasonably barred incorporating these costs in\r\neither the property debt service component or return on investment\r\nallowance, and the agency's decision to follow those regulations\r\ncannot be termed arbitrary or capricious.  The district court's\r\nfinding to the contrary must be reversed.\r\nB.  Whether HUD inappropriately refused to raise the contract rents\r\nafter two errors were discovered.\r\nIn the HAP, HUD made two errors in calculating the\r\ncontract rent, one to Trafalgar's detriment and the other to its\r\nbenefit.  HUD refused to remedy the error that disadvantaged\r\nTrafalgar because this error was more than offset by the mistake to\r\nTrafalgar's benefit.  The district court found HUD's decision to\r\nmaintain the status quo arbitrary and capricious.  We disagree.\r\nOn September 24, 1984, the public housing agency\r\nsponsoring the project requested an \"exception rent,\" allowing for\r\na 10 percent increase in the contract rent ceiling.  Under the\r\nregulations, an exception rent is appropriate only when the rate\r\notherwise applicable does not accurately reflect the rents being\r\ncharged in the project's specific geographic area.  See 24 C.F.R.\r\n882.408(b) (1998).  HUD's Boston Regional Office initially denied\r\nthe request, and Trafalgar appealed the denial to the Assistant\r\nSecretary for Housing.  Before HUD headquarters had decided the\r\nappeal, however, the Regional Administrator reassessed the\r\nsituation, reversed the earlier decision, and erroneously agreed to\r\nallow Trafalgar to charge an exception rent.  The very next day,\r\nHUD headquarters, unaware of the Regional Director's new decision,\r\naffirmed the earlier denial of an exception rent.  Since the\r\nRegional Administrator had approved the request, the HAP included\r\nthe erroneous exception rent, to Trafalgar's benefit.\r\nThe other error in the HAP stemmed from HUD's application\r\nof the wrong debt service constant, which had the effect of\r\nreducing the contract rent, thereby limiting how much Trafalgar\r\ncould recoup from HUD.  HUD has conceded it made this debt service\r\nerror and that it negatively impacted Trafalgar's payment from HUD. \r\nWhen the debt service error was discovered in 1992,\r\nTrafalgar requested a correction.  As a result of this request, HUD\r\nwas required to recalculate the contract rent, and, in the course\r\nof doing so, realized the error in allowing Trafalgar to charge an\r\nexception rent.  HUD decided that the most appropriate course of\r\naction would be to correct all errors.  \r\nThe exception rent error, accruing to Trafalgar's\r\nbenefit, was greater than the debt service error, to its detriment. \r\nCorrection of both errors would therefore end up lowering, rather\r\nthan raising, the contract rent, and would reduce the amounts\r\nTrafalgar would receive from HUD.  An amendment to the Moderate\r\nRehabilitation Program statute prohibits HUD from reducing the\r\ncontract rents in effect on or after April 15, 1987, see 42 U.S.C.\r\n1437f(c)(2)(C), except when the property is refinanced and the\r\nowner's debt costs are decreased.  Since the correction of both\r\nerrors would have resulted in reducing the contract rent in\r\nviolation of the statute, HUD chose to maintain the status quo with\r\nthe two errors.\r\nUpon cross-motions for summary judgment, the district\r\ncourt separated the two errors.  Addressing the debt service\r\nmistake first, the court found that HUD was required to make a\r\ncorrection.  In support of this decision, the court emphasized the\r\nlanguage of paragraph 1.5 of the HAP, which states that contract\r\nrents \"are subject to post-audit and change in accordance with HUD\r\nrequirements, including the correction of errors in computation.\" \r\nTrafalgar Capital Assoc., Inc. v. Cisneros, 973 F. Supp. 214,  221\r\n(D. Mass. 1997) (quoting HAP,  1.5).  The district court found\r\nthis mistake to be an error in computation that had to be corrected\r\nin accordance with that paragraph's mandate.  See id.  Having found\r\nthat HUD was required to correct the debt service constant, the\r\ndistrict court went on to consider the exception rent mistake.  It\r\ndetermined that correcting that error would result in a reduction\r\ncontrary to  1437f(c)(2)(C)'s mandate.  The net result of the\r\ndistrict court's ruling left HUD correcting the debt service error,\r\nbut Trafalgar continuing to benefit from the exception rent error.\r\nHUD argues on appeal that it was entitled to offset the\r\nerrors and that, because the net result would disadvantage\r\nTrafalgar, it could maintain the status quo in order to comply with\r\nthe statutory prohibition against reducing the contract rents. \r\nTrafalgar argues that failure to correct the debt service error\r\ncauses a de facto reduction because using the correct debt service\r\nconstant would have produced a higher contract rent.\r\nTo determine whether HUD's decision to maintain the\r\nstatus quo was legitimate, we look to the anti-reduction provision\r\nof the statute.  The \"starting point for interpretation of a\r\nstatute 'is the language of the statute itself.'\"  Kaiser Aluminum\r\n&amp; Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 835 (1990) (quoting\r\nConsumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102,\r\n108 (1980)); see Arnold v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 136 F.3d\r\n854, 857-58 (1st Cir. 1998).  \"If the intent of Congress is clear,\r\nthat is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the\r\nagency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of\r\nCongress.\"  Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\r\nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).  If the statutory text and\r\ncongressional intent are ambiguous, HUD's interpretation is\r\nentitled to deference if it is reasonable.  See id. at 844-45.\r\nThe statute provides:\r\nThe Secretary may not reduce the contract\r\nrents in effect on or after April 15, 1987,\r\nfor newly constructed, substantially\r\nrehabilitated, or moderately rehabilitated\r\nprojects assisted under this section\r\n(including projects assisted under this\r\nsection as in effect prior to November 30,\r\n1983), unless the project has been refinanced\r\nin a manner that reduces the periodic payments\r\nof the owner.   \r\n\n42 U.S.C.  1437f(c)(2)(C).  We first must determine what contract\r\nrent was \"in effect,\" and then must assess whether HUD's decision\r\nto maintain the error-riddled status quo reduced that rent in\r\nviolation of the statute.\r\n1. Contract Rent In Effect.  The only contract rent used\r\nby the parties is the erroneous rent set in the HAP in 1990. \r\nTrafalgar argues that that contract rent was not \"in effect\" within\r\nthe meaning of the statute, because the regulations require HUD to\r\nraise the contract rent to correct the debt service error. \r\nTrafalgar maintains that, therefore, \"by law, the increased\r\n'contract rents' were 'in effect' and HUD's refusal to raise the\r\n[contract rents accordingly] constituted a de facto reduction . .\r\n. in violation of 42 U.S.C.A.  1437f(c)(2)(C).\"  (Brief for\r\nappellee/cross-appellant, p. 25).\r\nThe regulation on which Trafalgar relies provides that\r\nthe \"initial Contract Rents . . . will be the Contract Rents on the\r\neffective date of the [HAP] except . . . [w]hen necessary to\r\ncorrect errors in computation of the base and Contract Rents to\r\ncomply with the HUD requirements.\"  24 C.F.R.  882.408(d)(1)\r\n(1998).  Trafalgar invokes this language to correct one error, but\r\nnot the other.  If this regulation required the agency \"to correct\r\nerrors in computation. . . to comply with the HUD requirements,\"\r\nHUD would have to correct both errors.  Such an argument undermines\r\nTrafalgar's position because the contract rent \"in effect\" would\r\ncontain neither error.  The end result of this argument is that the\r\ncontract rent \"in effect\" would be lower than that under which the\r\nparties have been operating.  It is therefore to Trafalgar's\r\nadvantage that we view the contract rent \"in effect\" to be the rent\r\nunder which the parties have been operating.  Because HUD does not\r\ndispute this construction of the language, we accept it as\r\ngoverning here.\r\n2. Reduction of the Contract Rent.  Having identified the\r\nrent \"in effect\" as the status quo, we easily can dispose of the\r\ncontention that HUD violated  1437f(c)(2)(C) by reducing the\r\ncontract rent in effect.  The contract rent in effect has been\r\nneither reduced nor increased.  The plain language barring\r\nreductions does not require HUD to raise the contract rent in this\r\nsituation. \"[I]t is reductions in rent that are expressly\r\nproscribed by section [1437f](c)(2)(C).\"  Foxglenn, 35 F.3d at 950\r\n(emphasis added).  HUD's decision to keep the current contract\r\nrents complied with the statute's plain language, and consequently\r\ncannot be considered arbitrary and capricious.  The district\r\ncourt's decision to the contrary must be reversed.\r\nC.  Whether HUD inappropriately classified the SHARP funds as \r\ngrants.\r\nIn 1985 and 1987, Trafalgar entered into contracts to\r\nreceive more than $1 million over 15 years from the Massachusetts\r\nSHARP program.  In determining how the receipt of those funds\r\nimpacted Trafalgar's contract with HUD, HUD was required to\r\nclassify them as either a grant or a loan.  If the SHARP funds were\r\ngrants, the HUD regulations would require Trafalgar to subtract the\r\namount from the debt service calculations, and it therefore would\r\nnot be included in the base rent.  If the SHARP funds were loans,\r\nthe amounts would have been included in the debt service\r\ncalculation for the purposes of computing the base rents.\r\nThe SHARP contracts have many of the indicia of loans. \r\nIndeed, the SHARP program's enabling legislation provides that the\r\nfinancial assistance shall be \"in the form of a loan.\"  Mass. Gen.\r\nLaws ch. 23B,  27.  The Massachusetts Department of Housing and\r\nCommunity Development (\"DCHD\") is empowered to determine the\r\nappropriate annual amount of the \"loan proceeds\" to be distributed\r\nto each project.  Id.  One of the restrictions on the DCHD's\r\nauthority is that the disbursement decisions must be \"consistent\r\nwith the repayment of the loan as hereinafter provided.\"  Id.  The\r\nrepayment obligations may not be waived in whole or in part.  Seeid.  To guarantee that the loans are actually repaid, they are\r\nsecured by a lien on real or personal property, or both.  See id.\r\nThe contracts executed by Trafalgar and the Massachusetts\r\nHousing Finance Agency (\"MHFA\"), the body overseeing the SHARP\r\nprogram financing obligations, confirm these details.  The\r\ncontracts provide that Trafalgar would receive \"housing subsidy\r\nloans\" under the SHARP Program.  (App. at 50).  Paragraph 12 of the\r\ncontracts contains language highly relevant to the decision to\r\nclassify SHARP proceeds as a grant or loan:\r\nThe parties specifically understand and agree\r\nthat the SHARP funds provided by this Contract\r\nare considered to be a loan from the\r\n[Executive Office of Communities and\r\nDevelopment (\"EOCD\")] to the [MHFA] and not a\r\ngrant of money.  The loan provided hereunder\r\nshall be evidenced by a Subsidy Repayment\r\nNote. . . . This Subsidy Repayment Note shall\r\nbe, and hereby is, secured by the mortgage on\r\nthe Project.\r\n\n(App. at 55, 68).  Three statements in this paragraph are relevant:\r\n1) the parties acknowledged that this money was a loan \"and not a\r\ngrant\" from EOCD to MHFA, who then loaned it to Trafalgar; 2) the\r\nloan was  evidenced by a repayment note; and 3) the repayment\r\nobligation was secured by a mortgage.  \r\nThe attached \"Subsidy Repayment Notes\" stated that\r\nTrafalgar would repay the MHFA the principal amount of the notes,\r\n\"together with simple interest thereon.\"  (App. at 60, 74). \r\nTrafalgar was obliged to repay the principal and interest on\r\nDecember 1, 2016, unless Trafalgar had defaulted on the loans or\r\nsold the project prior to that date.  While the notes were\r\nexpressly secondary to any existing mortgage on the property,\r\nTrafalgar agreed to use any assets remaining after repaying the\r\nmortgage to repay the notes, and agreed \"to pay, in addition to\r\nother amounts due, all reasonable legal charges and expenses\r\nincurred for collecting the debt, including attorney's fees.\" \r\n(App. at 61, 75).\r\nDespite these indicators suggesting that the SHARP funds\r\nwere loans, HUD decided to classify them as grants for two reasons. \r\nFirst, HUD stated that the repayment obligations were not\r\nsufficiently imminent because Trafalgar was not required to repay\r\nany of the loan proceeds until December 1, 2016.  HUD took the\r\nposition that base rents should not reflect costs that will not\r\ncome due during the term of the HAP; the HAP expired in the year\r\n2002, fourteen years before the loan's due date.  Second, HUD\r\nstated that the SHARP obligations were not sufficiently certain to\r\njustify inclusion in the base rents.  Under the SHARP contracts,\r\nTrafalgar's obligation to repay the principal and interest might be\r\naltered.  Trafalgar could \"recycle\" the principal into the  project\r\nby, for instance, providing the tenants with rent subsidies or a\r\ncredit toward the purchase of project units.  Interest payments\r\ncould be forgiven if Trafalgar instituted a program to limit the\r\nimpact of the SHARP program termination on the low and moderate\r\nincome tenants.  Because the principal could be recycled and the\r\ninterest forgiven, HUD found that the repayment obligations were\r\ntoo uncertain to justify treatment as a loan and inclusion in the\r\ncontract rents.\r\nAt first blush, these reasons seem rational, and perhaps\r\nsufficient to survive review under the deferential arbitrary and\r\ncapricious standard.  However, neither basis for HUD's decision\r\nmakes rational sense to this court, as the arbitrary and capricious\r\nstandard requires.\r\n1. Costs due after HAP termination.  As stated earlier,\r\nthe base rent is designed to represent the cost of owning, managing\r\nand maintaining the unit.  In this case some of those costs have\r\nbeen advanced by a third party.  The fact that Trafalgar's\r\nrepayment obligations do not mature until after the conclusion of\r\nthe HAP contract does not mean that the principal and interest\r\npayments are not costs of owning, managing and maintaining the\r\nunit.  HUD's argument could be used to exclude other significant\r\ncosts.  For instance, Trafalgar might have purchased the property\r\nby a mortgage with a single balloon payment due after the HAP term. \r\nIn such a situation, HUD's argument would bar consideration of the\r\nmortgage obligation, even though it clearly represents a cost of\r\nowning, managing and maintaining the property.  As the district\r\ncourt stated, the fact that Trafalgar's repayment obligation\r\naccrues well after the conclusion of the HAP term does not mean\r\nthat Trafalgar has \"received a gift . . . and not a loan.\" \r\nTrafalgar Capital Assoc., 973 F. Supp. at  220. \r\nHUD has recognized that the rehabilitation debt service\r\nmay include amounts to be paid by the project owner after the\r\nconclusion of the HAP, specifically payment of a rehabilitation\r\nloan whose term might extend beyond the 15-year HAP period.  (SeeHUD Handbook, p. 17 (the proposal might include \"a loan term longer\r\nthan 15 years (e.g. 30 years if a 30-year loan is obtained)\").  The\r\nagency does not exclude the rehabilitation costs being paid by such\r\na loan even though some principal might not be repaid until years\r\nafter the HAP has terminated.  We see no basis for excluding from\r\nbase rent costs that are similarly financed in a long range manner. \r\nA balloon payment of principal and interest strikes us as\r\nmaterially equivalent to the extended loan payments that HUD\r\nroutinely views as appropriate costs.  HUD's argument that the\r\nSHARP funds are a grant because they are repaid after HAP\r\ntermination is thus inconsistent with its other practices and, as\r\na result, unconvincing.\r\n2. Costs not sufficiently certain.  The second reason HUD\r\ngives for classification of the SHARP funds as a grant is the\r\npossibility that the principal might be \"recycled\" into the\r\nproject, and the interest might be forgiven.  This rationale is\r\nequally unavailing.\r\nUnder the SHARP statute, Trafalgar is required to submit\r\na proposal to Massachusetts to limit the impact of SHARP assistance\r\ntermination on low and moderate income tenants.  As noted earlier,\r\nsuch a proposal might involve using the SHARP principal to\r\nsubsidize the tenants' rents, or it might feature a credit to the\r\ntenants toward the purchase of their unit.  Whatever the form of\r\nthe proposal, Trafalgar's receipts would be less than they\r\notherwise would have been.  Instead of paying the principal to\r\nMHFA, Trafalgar effectively would be paying that amount to the\r\ntenants.\r\nThe direct recipient of Trafalgar's \"repayment\" is\r\nimmaterial for determining whether the SHARP funds are a grant or\r\na loan; if \"recycling\" occurs, Trafalgar suffers the same financial\r\nloss as it would in repaying the loan directly to the MHFA.  The\r\ndistrict court was correct when it stated that \"[i]t is entirely\r\nunreasonable to suggest that, because the eventual recipients of\r\n[Trafalgar's] repayment are the tenants, . . . [Trafalgar] is not,\r\nin reality, paying back the loan's principal.\"  Trafalgar Capital\r\nAssoc., 973 F. Supp. at 220.\r\nThe fact that interest might be forgiven also does not\r\nautomatically mean that the SHARP funds become a grant rather than\r\na loan.  As HUD well knows, any decision to reduce or waive the\r\ninterest is in the sole and exclusive discretion of MHFA, and \"will\r\nonly be allowed if [Trafalgar] produces an exceptional plan for\r\nhelping low and moderate income families\" transition from receiving\r\nSHARP financial assistance to the termination of the SHARP program. \r\n(App. at 228)(emphasis added).  Any future decision by MHFA to\r\nwaive the interest does not alter Trafalgar's current obligation to\r\npay interest on the principal it has received.  In addition, even\r\nif interest on the SHARP funds is waived in part or in whole, the\r\nSHARP assistance would constitute either a low-interest or\r\ninterest-free loan, both of which are still loans.  (See id.)  If\r\nthe principal still must be repaid, the reduction or elimination of\r\ninterest does not convert a loan to a grant.\r\nIn sum, then, it was not rational for HUD to classify the\r\nSHARP funds as a grant rather than a loan.  The SHARP contracts\r\nhave all the indicia of loans.  They require repayment of the\r\nprincipal and interest.  They are secured by a lien on the\r\nproperty.  If Trafalgar does not fulfill its obligations, it agreed\r\nto pay all legal costs, including attorney's fees, associated with\r\ncollection efforts.  And the language in the contracts explicitly\r\nstates that they are loans and not grants.  HUD's reasons for\r\nclassifying them as grants are not reasonable.  The expense of\r\nrepaying the SHARP funds, although incurred after HAP termination,\r\nis a cost of owning, managing and maintaining the property. \r\nInterest is forgiven only under the state's discretion, and, even\r\nif it were forgiven, an interest-free loan is still a loan.  We\r\ntherefore affirm the district court's ruling that HUD's decision to\r\nclassify the SHARP funds as a grant was arbitrary and capricious. \r\nD.  Whether the statute of limitations bars Trafalgar's claim that\r\nthe 1986 FMR should have been used.\r\nThe Fair Market Rent, or FMR, used in the AHAP and HAP\r\nestablishes the ceiling for the contract rents and therefore has a\r\nsignificant impact on an owner's subsidy from HUD.  Trafalgar\r\nargues that HUD improperly used the 1985 FMR instead of the higher\r\n1986 FMR, thereby reducing the funds to which Trafalgar was\r\nentitled.  The district court found this claim to be barred by the\r\nstatute of limitations, and Trafalgar challenges this decision on\r\ncross-appeal.  Application of the statute of limitations by\r\ndefinition involves an appreciation of the dates involved, so our\r\nanalysis must start there.\r\nThe FMR is based on the rents actually charged for units\r\nin the same area, and the Secretary of HUD is required to establish\r\nFMRs \"periodically but not less than annually.\"  42 U.S.C. \r\n1437f(c)(1).  On July 5, 1984, HUD first published the 1985 FMRs as\r\nan interim rule with an effective date of October 1, 1984.  The\r\n1985 FMRs were published in final rule form on April 16, 1985.\r\nThe AHAP was executed on April 30, 1986.  In accordance\r\nwith the regulations, it specified that the initial contract rents\r\nwould be based on the FMRs then in effect, which were the 1985\r\nrates.  The 1986 FMR applicable to the project was published and\r\nmade effective on August 29, 1986, four months after AHAP\r\nexecution, and twenty-two months after the 1985 FMR had gone into\r\neffect.\r\nOn April 17, 1990, the parties executed the final stage\r\nof the HAP contract.  Trafalgar argued that the base and contract\r\nrent ceilings should be based on the 1986 FMR, but HUD insisted on\r\nusing the 1985 rate.  Trafalgar chose to pursue administrative\r\nremedies, which were exhausted with HUD's final denial on April 7,\r\n1995.  \r\nTrafalgar filed its claim in the district court on June\r\n15, 1995.  It argued that, consistent with the statutory\r\nrequirement, the 1986 FMRs should have been established by October\r\n1, 1985, one year after the 1985 FMRs went into effect.  Had HUD\r\nfollowed the statutory mandate to set the FMRs no less than\r\nannually, the AHAP and HAP would have used the 1986 FMRs.\r\nA complaint under the APA for review of an agency action\r\nis a civil action that must be filed within the six year\r\nlimitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C.  2401(a).  See, e.g.,\r\nDaingerfield Island Protective Society v. Babbitt, 40 F.3d 442, 445\r\n(D.C. Cir. 1994); Wind River Mining Corp. v. United States, 946\r\nF.2d 710, 712 (9th Cir. 1990).  The only two relevant actions\r\nwithin six years of the June 15, 1995 filing of the complaint are\r\nthe HAP execution on April 17, 1990, and the conclusion of\r\nadministrative appeals on April 7, 1995.  Appreciating this fact,\r\nTrafalgar argues that the claim did not accrue either until the HAP\r\nwas executed or until Trafalgar had exhausted its administrative\r\nremedies.  In its decision that Trafalgar's claim was barred by the\r\nstatute of limitations, the district court implicitly rejected\r\nTrafalgar's first argument, and explicitly rejected the second.\r\n1. HAP execution.  In general, \"[a] cause of action\r\nagainst an administrative agency 'first accrues,' within the\r\nmeaning of  2401(a), as soon as . . . the person challenging the\r\nagency action can institute and maintain a suit in court.\"  Spannusv. DOJ, 824 F.2d 52, 56 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Under the APA, the\r\ninjured party can maintain a suit once the agency has issued a\r\n\"final agency action.\"  5 U.S.C.  704; see, e.g., Sierra Club v.\r\nSlater, 120 F.3d 623, 631 (6th Cir. 1997); Dunn-McCampbell Royalty\r\nInterest, Inc. v. National Park Serv., 112 F.3d 1283, 1287 (5th\r\nCir. 1997).  In determining whether a particular agency action is\r\nfinal, \"[t]he core question is whether the agency has completed its\r\ndecisionmaking process, and whether the result of that process is\r\none that will directly affect the parties.\"  Franklin v.\r\nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992).  To be a \"final agency\r\naction,\" it must be a \"definitive statement[ ] of [the agency's]\r\nposition\" with \"direct and immediate\" consequences.  FTC v.\r\nStandard Oil Co., 449 U.S. 232, 241 (1980).\r\nDetermining which HUD statement was the final agency\r\naction is a relatively straightforward exercise.  HUD regulations\r\nrequire that initial rents are capped at the FMR \"applicable to the\r\nunit on the date that the [AHAP] is executed.\"  24 C.F.R. \r\n882.408(c) (1998).  This limit applies to both the AHAP and HAP,\r\neven though payments do not commence until rehabilitation has been\r\ncompleted and the parties have executed the HAP, which may be well\r\nafter the date of the AHAP.  Therefore, the final agency action for\r\nthe purpose of commencing the statute of limitations was the final\r\nstatement by HUD setting the FMR that applied on the date of AHAP\r\nexecution.\r\nThe 1985 FMR was in effect at the time of AHAP execution\r\non April 30, 1986.  Although HUD should have promulgated the 1986\r\nFMRs by that time, HUD followed the regulation requirement to apply\r\nthe FMR then in effect.  A strong argument can be made that AHAP\r\nexecution was the final agency action for the purpose of commencing\r\nthe statute of limitations.\r\nHowever, one could also argue that the final agency\r\naction did not occur until HUD actually issued the 1986 FMR on\r\nAugust 29, 1986.  On that date, at the latest, Trafalgar learned\r\nthat HUD would not apply the new rate to its previously executed\r\nAHAP.  Prior to that date, Trafalgar had a possible argument that\r\nthe 1986 FMR, which reflected rates as of April 1, could be applied\r\nretroactively to the AHAP executed April 30.\r\nDeciding which of these decisions was the final agency\r\naction is unnecessary, because both occurred well outside the\r\nstatute of limitations.  Even if the issuance of the 1986 FMR were\r\nthe final agency action, rather than AHAP execution, Trafalgar\r\nwould have been required to file its action in court before August\r\n29, 1992, six years later.  Trafalgar's complaint was not filed\r\nuntil June 15, 1995, almost three years after the expiration of the\r\nstatute of limitations.\r\nTrafalgar argues that the HAP was the final agency\r\ndecision because HUD could change the terms of the contract between\r\nthe AHAP and HAP.  The relevant regulation allows HUD to change the\r\ncontract rent between the AHAP and HAP under certain limited\r\ncircumstances: unexpected changes in rehabilitation costs, changes\r\nin financing, changes in relocation payments to tenants, or to\r\ncorrect errors in computation.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408(d)(1)\r\n(1998).  None of these situations applies.  Moreover, the\r\nregulations specifically require application of the FMR applicable\r\non the date of the execution of the AHAP.  HUD's issuance of the\r\n1986 FMR was therefore the final agency action with respect to\r\nTrafalgar's claim.\r\n2. Exhaustion of administrative remedies.  In the\r\nalternative, Trafalgar alleges that the cause of action did not\r\naccrue until it had exhausted all available administrative\r\nremedies.  The district court rejected this argument, ruling that\r\nTrafalgar's decision to pursue administrative remedies not\r\nexplicitly a prerequisite to suit did not affect the accrual of its\r\nclaim. \r\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"no one is entitled to\r\njudicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the\r\nprescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\" Myers v.\r\nBethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 50-51 (1938).  \"In\r\npractice, the doctrine has softer edges than this language\r\nimplies.\"  Portela-Gonzalez v. Secretary of the Navy, 109 F.3d 74,\r\n77 (1st Cir. 1997).  When Congress explicitly requires that\r\nadministrative remedies must be pursued before seeking judicial\r\nrelief, litigants must obviously follow that mandate.  See Coit\r\nIndependence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U.S. 561, 579 (1989).  On\r\nthe other hand, \"where Congress has not clearly required\r\nexhaustion, sound judicial discretion governs.\" McCarthy v.\r\nMadigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144 (1992).  \r\nWhile most of the decisions regarding administrative\r\nremedies involve whether the litigant has filed suit too early,\r\ni.e., before exhaustion of administrative remedies, this case\r\ninvolves the opposite question.  We must consider whether or when\r\na party that does pursue administrative remedies before filing suit\r\nis barred for untimeliness.  \r\nIn this latter event, it makes a difference whether the\r\nadministrative route is mandatory, i.e., a condition precedent to\r\nsuit, or permissive, i.e., permitted but not required as a\r\ncondition precedent.  In the former situation, the cause of action\r\ndoes not accrue until the completion of the required administrative\r\nproceedings.  See Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, 386 U.S.\r\n503, 522 (1967); United States v. Suntip Co., 82 F.3d 1468, 1475\r\n(9th Cir. 1996); United States v. Gordon, 78 F.3d 781, 786 (2d Cir.\r\n1996).  In the latter situation, the cause of action accrues at the\r\ntime of the injury.  See Unexcelled Chemical Corp. v. United\r\nStates, 345 U.S. 59, 65 (1953); Brighton Village Assoc. v. United\r\nStates, 52 F.3d 1056, 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  Trafalgar has\r\nthroughout its briefings consistently ignored this contrast, which\r\nwe specifically recognized in United States v. Meyer, 808 F.2d 912\r\n(1st Cir. 1987).\r\nThe district court correctly recognized this distinction\r\nin holding that Trafalgar's claim accrued before it began to seek\r\npermissive administrative remedies.  Trafalgar was entitled to\r\npursue administrative remedies, but its choice to do so did not\r\nstop the statute of limitations from running.\r\n                    III. Conclusion\r\nWe reverse the district court's determination that HUD\r\nacted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in excluding the pre-\r\nAHAP costs from the base rents and in maintaining the status quo\r\nwhen offsetting mistakes were made.  The district court, however,\r\ncorrectly concluded that HUD was arbitrary and capricious in\r\ntreating the SHARP funds as a grant instead of a loan.  Trafalgar's\r\nclaim to use a different year FMR was time-barred, as the district\r\ncourt appropriately found.  \r\nAccordingly, the district court's judgment is affirmed in\r\npart and reversed in part.  HUD to receive half its costs.\n",

Statutory Scheme\r\nHUD agreed to subsidize Trafalgar's project under the\r\nModerate Rehabilitation Program, 42 U.S.C.  1437f(e)(2), one of\r\nthe programs under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of\r\n1937, 42 U.S.C.  1437f (\"Section 8\").   The Moderate\r\nRehabilitation Program is designed to encourage private individuals\r\nto rehabilitate low and moderate income housing through the award\r\nof rent subsidies.  Under the program, HUD contracts with local\r\npublic housing agencies, which in turn contract with the project\r\nowners who rehabilitate the property.  Regulations require the\r\nlocal public housing agency to secure a preliminary contract with\r\nthe project owner prior to rehabilitation, and a permanent\r\nagreement once the rehabilitation is completed and the units are\r\nready for occupancy.  \r\nBoth the preliminary agreement, known as the \"AHAP,\" or\r\nAgreement to Enter into a Housing Assistance Payments contract, and\r\nthe permanent agreement, known as the \"HAP,\" or Housing Assistance\r\nPayments contract, set a \"contract rent\" based on the applicable\r\nregulations.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408 (1998).  Residents eligible\r\nfor Section 8 housing are required to pay rent based on their\r\nmonthly income.  See 42 U.S.C.  1437a(a).  HUD pays the owner the\r\ndifference between the \"contract rent\" and the amount the resident\r\npays.  See 42 U.S.C.  1437f(c)(3)(A). \r\nThe contract rent is based on two components: 1) the\r\n\"monthly rehabilitation debt service,\" which covers the cost of\r\nrehabilitation; and 2) the \"base rent,\" reflecting the cost of\r\nowning, managing, and maintaining the property independent of\r\nrehabilitation costs.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408(c)(2) (1998).  The\r\nbase rent is also allowed to incorporate a reasonable return on\r\ninvestment.  HUD Handbook 7420.3 (\"HUD Handbook\"), p. 2.  Both the\r\nbase rent component and the contract rent total are subject to\r\nmarket-based ceilings, and are adjusted annually.  See 42 U.S.C.\r\n1437f(c); 24 C.F.R.  882.410(a)(1) (1998).  The base rent is\r\nordinarily capped at the Existing Housing Fair Market Rent (\"FMR\"),\r\nand the contract rent has a ceiling of 120 percent of the relevant\r\nFMR.  See 42 U.S.C.  1437f(c); 24 C.F.R.  882.408(a) (1998). \r\nFMRs, published annually by HUD, are based on an analysis of the\r\nrents charged for similar standard units in the same general\r\ngeographic region. See 42 U.S.C.  1437f(c).\r\nIn certain situations HUD can approve increases for costs\r\nnot sufficiently taken into account in the contract rent\r\ncalculation.   An \"exception rent\" may be granted if the FMR does\r\nnot accurately reflect the actual rents charged in the project's\r\n\"specified area,\" meaning its more narrowly defined geographic\r\nregion.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408(b) (1998), HUD Handbook, Ch. 10,\r\n10-2(c)(1).  If HUD approves such an exception rent, the owner may\r\ncharge an additional 10 percent over the usual contract rent\r\nceiling.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408(b) (1998).\r\nB. Facts\r\nIn February 1984, Trafalgar filed its proposal with HUD\r\nto convert an abandoned furniture factory in Gardner, Massachusetts\r\ninto moderate income housing.  The preliminary AHAP for the project\r\nwas executed on April 30, 1986, with a retroactive effective date\r\nof February 8, 1986.  The rehabilitation proceeded in four stages. \r\nAfter the fourth stage was completed, the final portion of the\r\npermanent HAP was executed on April 17, 1990.\r\nTrafalgar also has a contract in connection with the same\r\nproject to receive more than $1.1 million in assistance over 15\r\nyears from a state program known as the Massachusetts State Housing\r\nAssistance for Rental Production (\"SHARP\") program.\r\nTrafalgar believed that HUD made several incorrect\r\ndecisions that had the effect of reducing the subsidies to which\r\nTrafalgar was entitled.  After lengthy correspondence and proposals\r\nto revise the HAP, Trafalgar brought this action under the\r\nAdministrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C.  551-59, 701-6,\r\nand the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.  2201.  Trafalgar's\r\ncomplaint charged four errors: (1) HUD erroneously excluded costs\r\nincurred before the AHAP; (2) HUD improperly refused to raise the\r\ncontract rent after offsetting errors were discovered; (3) HUD\r\nmistakenly characterized the Massachusetts SHARP assistance as a\r\ngrant rather than a loan; and (4) HUD incorrectly used the 1985 FMR\r\ninstead of the 1986 FMR.  Upon cross-motions for summary judgment,\r\nthe district court ruled that HUD's decisions on the first three\r\nissues were arbitrary and capricious, but that Trafalgar's claim on\r\nthe fourth was barred by the statute of limitations.  Both parties\r\nappealed.\r\nAdditional facts will be developed in subsequent sections \r\nas they become relevant.\r\n                     II.

Whether HUD improperly excluded costs incurred before February\r\n8, 1985 from the rent calculation.\r\nAlthough HUD regulations require that the parties execute\r\nan AHAP before the owner begins rehabilitation, see 42 C.F.R. \r\n882.505 (1998), Trafalgar started work before executing such an\r\nagreement.  When the public housing agency overseeing\r\nrehabilitation learned of Trafalgar's failure to enter into the\r\nAHAP, it ordered rehabilitation halted, and a meeting was called on\r\nFebruary 5, 1986.  At that meeting the parties agreed to execute an\r\nAHAP, which they finally did on April 30, 1986.  Because it was\r\nclear that the AHAP would be executed, and the parties wanted\r\nrehabilitation to continue, they agreed at the meeting to backdate\r\nthe AHAP to February 8, 1986, three days hence. \r\nBetween the date the proposal was submitted and February\r\n8, 1986, Trafalgar had spent about $1.6 million on rehabilitation.\r\nAt the February 5 meeting the parties discussed how these funds\r\nmight be incorporated into the amounts Trafalgar could recover from\r\nHUD, but they evidently did not settle the specific method for\r\ndoing so.  HUD, however, later determined that regulations barred\r\nincluding the $1.6 million in the subsidy calculations.  The\r\ndistrict court ruled that HUD's apparent reversal was arbitrary and\r\ncapricious.  Our review persuades us to the contrary.\r\nIt is undisputed that Trafalgar's pre-AHAP costs could\r\nonly be incorporated into the base rent section of the contract\r\nrent because the monthly rehabilitation debt service may include\r\nonly the rehabilitation costs incurred after the AHAP's effective\r\ndate.  Trafalgar argues that the amount should be allowed under\r\neither of two different sub-parts of base rent: the property debt\r\nservice or return on investment.  HUD argues that the structure and\r\nlanguage of the regulations prohibit it from including the disputed\r\ncosts in either category.  We consider each possibility in turn.\r\n1. Property Debt Service.  HUD denied Trafalgar's request\r\nthat the expenses be included in the property debt service on the\r\nground that that component is temporally limited to costs incurred\r\nbefore the project proposal is submitted to HUD.  Trafalgar argues\r\nthat the regulations and HUD Handbook impose no such limitation. \r\nEach side cites language in the HUD Handbook to support its\r\nposition.\r\nThe Handbook sets forth detailed guidelines to which HUD\r\nmust adhere in setting the terms of an AHAP and a HAP.  It includes\r\na form for calculating the base and contract rents, as well as\r\nextensive instructions on how to complete the form.  HUD points to\r\nthe \"property debt service\" instructions, which require the owner\r\nto \"[e]nter the annual principal and interest (P &amp; I) payments for\r\nloans related to purchase and improvement of the property at the\r\ndate of proposal submittal.\"  HUD Handbook, p. 9 (emphasis omitted\r\nand added).  \r\nTrafalgar, in response, looks to the general overview\r\nlanguage, which states that the base rent should reflect the\r\n\"[a]nnual expenses for property debt service, insurance, taxes,\r\nutilities, management, and maintenance, projected to the date of\r\nHAP contract execution.\"  HUD Handbook, p. 2 (emphasis added). \r\nHowever, Trafalgar neglects to mention that the Handbook describes\r\nthis overview as a \"brief summary,\" and notes that \"[d]etailed\r\ninstructions are contained in the rent calculation formats.\"  Id. \r\nThe fact that the overview language states that a variety of costs\r\nshould be calculated to the date of the HAP contract execution does\r\nnot alter Trafalgar's obligation to comply with the specific\r\ninstructions on how those calculations are to be performed.  As HUD\r\nrecognizes, the provision allowing for annual expenses to be\r\n\"projected to the date of HAP contract execution,\" is HUD's method\r\nof acknowledging that estimated increases in operating costs should\r\nbe included.  The provision does not authorize inclusion of\r\nrehabilitation costs, or any other costs not otherwise within the\r\ninstructions for property debt service.\r\nThe well-known canon of statutory construction that the\r\nspecific governs the general dictates the same result.  See Moralesv. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384-85 (1992); Lloydv. FDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337 (1st Cir. 1994).  The specific limitation\r\nthat property debt service includes only costs prior to proposal\r\nsubmission trumps the general language that the costs should be\r\ncalculated through the date of HAP execution.\r\nNot only the Handbook's language but also the logic of\r\nthe subsidy program supports HUD's position.  In essence Trafalgar\r\nargues that the $1.6 million is recoverable as part of the property\r\ndebt service regardless of when it was spent.  This approach would\r\njustify inclusion of the same costs in two parts of the contract\r\nrent.  If Trafalgar had followed the HUD regulations and executed\r\nan AHAP prior to beginning rehabilitation, the costs would have\r\nbeen includable in the monthly rehabilitation debt service\r\ncomponent.  Its argument here is that they are also recoverable\r\nunder the property debt service sub-part of base rent.  Trafalgar's\r\nargument assumes a redundancy in the Handbook, and deprives the\r\ndistinction between rehabilitation debt service and base rent of\r\nany sense.  The structure of the subsidy calculations confirms the\r\nconclusion that Trafalgar is not entitled to recover these pre-AHAP\r\nrehabilitation costs as part of the property debt service.\r\n2. Return on Investment.  The only other possible method\r\nfor recovering these costs is including them as part of \"an\r\nadequate return on the owner's investment.\"  HUD Handbook, p. 2. \r\nIn general, return on investment is limited in the same manner as\r\nthe property debt service: it is capped at \"the owner's actual cash\r\nequity in the property at the time of proposal submission.\"  HUD\r\nHandbook, p. 13 (emphasis added).  However, the notes detailing how\r\nto calculate return on investment create a narrow exception for\r\npost-proposal, pre-AHAP investment.\r\nUnder the Handbook the return on investment element may\r\ninclude post-proposal costs if two conditions are met: 1) a\r\n\"prolonged period [must have] elapsed between proposal submission\r\nand [AHAP] execution;\" and 2) consistent with other requests for\r\nreturn on investment, the costs must be expended from \"actual cash\r\nequity.\"  HUD Handbook, p. 13.  Actual cash equity is defined as\r\nthe cost of capital expenditures less the outstanding indebtedness. \r\nSee id.  Taking these provisions together, the owner may capture an\r\nadequate return on investment for rehabilitation undertaken only\r\nthrough capital expenditures, not through borrowed funds, and only \r\nif there was a prolonged delay between proposal and AHAP.  \r\nHUD determined that Trafalgar's post-proposal, pre-AHAP\r\ncosts could not be included in a return on investment request,\r\ndespite its meeting the prolonged period element, because Trafalgar\r\nfailed to meet the actual cash equity requirement.  The $1.6\r\nmillion was expended from borrowed funds, not owner capital. \r\nTrafalgar argues that differentiating between actual cash equity\r\nand financed funds for the purposes of return on investment is\r\narbitrary and capricious.  \r\nIn our view, limiting return on investment to capital\r\nexpenditures is fully supportable.  HUD recognizes that the larger\r\ncosts, such as the cost of acquiring the property, could either be\r\nfinanced or paid out of owner capital, and has established a scheme\r\nto deal with each scenario.  For financed costs, HUD allows the\r\nowner to be repaid the principal and interest through property debt\r\nservice.  For large costs paid from owner capital, HUD allows the\r\nowner to recoup the expenditure plus a reasonable \"return on\r\ninvestment.\"  In theory then, owners are repaid any borrowed costs\r\nthrough property debt service and any capital expenditures through\r\nreturn on investment.  Under this scheme, it is not arbitrary and\r\ncapricious to restrict property debt service to outstanding\r\nindebtedness, and limit return on investment to actual cash equity.\r\nThe problem for Trafalgar is that it incurred\r\nrehabilitation expenses earlier than it should have.  Had Trafalgar\r\ncomplied with HUD regulations and executed an AHAP before\r\ncommencing rehabilitation, see 24 C.F.R.  882.505 (1998), its\r\ncosts would have been incorporated into rehabilitation debt\r\nservice.  Although the parties discussed the possibility of\r\nincluding pre-AHAP costs in base rent, the HUD Handbook, available\r\nto Trafalgar at the time, provides for return on investment only if\r\nthe two conditions are met.  HUD's ultimate decision to follow its\r\nHandbook in dealing with the situation once it understood that\r\nTrafalgar could not comply with both conditions was \"reasoned and\r\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\"  Associate\r\nFisheries, 127 F.3d at 109.  In fact, a decision to allow Trafalgar\r\nto recover these costs, contrary to the regulations and the HUD\r\nHandbook, might have provoked criticism that HUD was acting\r\narbitrarily and capriciously by inconsistently applying its own\r\npolicies.\r\nWe therefore conclude that HUD appropriately denied\r\nTrafalgar's request to include the $1.6 million in base rent. \r\nHUD's regulations reasonably barred incorporating these costs in\r\neither the property debt service component or return on investment\r\nallowance, and the agency's decision to follow those regulations\r\ncannot be termed arbitrary or capricious.  The district court's\r\nfinding to the contrary must be reversed.\r\nB.  Whether HUD inappropriately refused to raise the contract rents\r\nafter two errors were discovered.\r\nIn the HAP, HUD made two errors in calculating the\r\ncontract rent, one to Trafalgar's detriment and the other to its\r\nbenefit.  HUD refused to remedy the error that disadvantaged\r\nTrafalgar because this error was more than offset by the mistake to\r\nTrafalgar's benefit.  The district court found HUD's decision to\r\nmaintain the status quo arbitrary and capricious.  We disagree.\r\nOn September 24, 1984, the public housing agency\r\nsponsoring the project requested an \"exception rent,\" allowing for\r\na 10 percent increase in the contract rent ceiling.  Under the\r\nregulations, an exception rent is appropriate only when the rate\r\notherwise applicable does not accurately reflect the rents being\r\ncharged in the project's specific geographic area.  See 24 C.F.R.\r\n882.408(b) (1998).  HUD's Boston Regional Office initially denied\r\nthe request, and Trafalgar appealed the denial to the Assistant\r\nSecretary for Housing.  Before HUD headquarters had decided the\r\nappeal, however, the Regional Administrator reassessed the\r\nsituation, reversed the earlier decision, and erroneously agreed to\r\nallow Trafalgar to charge an exception rent.  The very next day,\r\nHUD headquarters, unaware of the Regional Director's new decision,\r\naffirmed the earlier denial of an exception rent.  Since the\r\nRegional Administrator had approved the request, the HAP included\r\nthe erroneous exception rent, to Trafalgar's benefit.\r\nThe other error in the HAP stemmed from HUD's application\r\nof the wrong debt service constant, which had the effect of\r\nreducing the contract rent, thereby limiting how much Trafalgar\r\ncould recoup from HUD.  HUD has conceded it made this debt service\r\nerror and that it negatively impacted Trafalgar's payment from HUD. \r\nWhen the debt service error was discovered in 1992,\r\nTrafalgar requested a correction.  As a result of this request, HUD\r\nwas required to recalculate the contract rent, and, in the course\r\nof doing so, realized the error in allowing Trafalgar to charge an\r\nexception rent.  HUD decided that the most appropriate course of\r\naction would be to correct all errors.  \r\nThe exception rent error, accruing to Trafalgar's\r\nbenefit, was greater than the debt service error, to its detriment. \r\nCorrection of both errors would therefore end up lowering, rather\r\nthan raising, the contract rent, and would reduce the amounts\r\nTrafalgar would receive from HUD.  An amendment to the Moderate\r\nRehabilitation Program statute prohibits HUD from reducing the\r\ncontract rents in effect on or after April 15, 1987, see 42 U.S.C.\r\n1437f(c)(2)(C), except when the property is refinanced and the\r\nowner's debt costs are decreased.  Since the correction of both\r\nerrors would have resulted in reducing the contract rent in\r\nviolation of the statute, HUD chose to maintain the status quo with\r\nthe two errors.\r\nUpon cross-motions for summary judgment, the district\r\ncourt separated the two errors.  Addressing the debt service\r\nmistake first, the court found that HUD was required to make a\r\ncorrection.  In support of this decision, the court emphasized the\r\nlanguage of paragraph 1.5 of the HAP, which states that contract\r\nrents \"are subject to post-audit and change in accordance with HUD\r\nrequirements, including the correction of errors in computation.\" \r\nTrafalgar Capital Assoc., Inc. v. Cisneros, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  221\r\n(D. Mass. 1997) (quoting HAP,  1.5).  The district court found\r\nthis mistake to be an error in computation that had to be corrected\r\nin accordance with that paragraph's mandate.  See id.  Having found\r\nthat HUD was required to correct the debt service constant, the\r\ndistrict court went on to consider the exception rent mistake.  It\r\ndetermined that correcting that error would result in a reduction\r\ncontrary to  1437f(c)(2)(C)'s mandate.  The net result of the\r\ndistrict court's ruling left HUD correcting the debt service error,\r\nbut Trafalgar continuing to benefit from the exception rent error.\r\nHUD argues on appeal that it was entitled to offset the\r\nerrors and that, because the net result would disadvantage\r\nTrafalgar, it could maintain the status quo in order to comply with\r\nthe statutory prohibition against reducing the contract rents. \r\nTrafalgar argues that failure to correct the debt service error\r\ncauses a de facto reduction because using the correct debt service\r\nconstant would have produced a higher contract rent.\r\nTo determine whether HUD's decision to maintain the\r\nstatus quo was legitimate, we look to the anti-reduction provision\r\nof the statute.

We first must determine what contract\r\nrent was \"in effect,\" and then must assess whether HUD's decision\r\nto maintain the error-riddled status quo reduced that rent in\r\nviolation of the statute.\r\n1. Contract Rent In Effect.  The only contract rent used\r\nby the parties is the erroneous rent set in the HAP in 1990. \r\nTrafalgar argues that that contract rent was not \"in effect\" within\r\nthe meaning of the statute, because the regulations require HUD to\r\nraise the contract rent to correct the debt service error. \r\nTrafalgar maintains that, therefore, \"by law, the increased\r\n'contract rents' were 'in effect' and HUD's refusal to raise the\r\n[contract rents accordingly] constituted a de facto reduction . .\r\n. in violation of 42 U.S.C.A.  1437f(c)(2)(C).\"  (Brief for\r\nappellee/cross-appellant, p. 25).\r\nThe regulation on which Trafalgar relies provides that\r\nthe \"initial Contract Rents . . . will be the Contract Rents on the\r\neffective date of the [HAP] except . . . [w]hen necessary to\r\ncorrect errors in computation of the base and Contract Rents to\r\ncomply with the HUD requirements.\"  24 C.F.R.  882.408(d)(1)\r\n(1998).  Trafalgar invokes this language to correct one error, but\r\nnot the other.  If this regulation required the agency \"to correct\r\nerrors in computation. . . to comply with the HUD requirements,\"\r\nHUD would have to correct both errors.  Such an argument undermines\r\nTrafalgar's position because the contract rent \"in effect\" would\r\ncontain neither error.  The end result of this argument is that the\r\ncontract rent \"in effect\" would be lower than that under which the\r\nparties have been operating.  It is therefore to Trafalgar's\r\nadvantage that we view the contract rent \"in effect\" to be the rent\r\nunder which the parties have been operating.  Because HUD does not\r\ndispute this construction of the language, we accept it as\r\ngoverning here.\r\n2. Reduction of the Contract Rent.  Having identified the\r\nrent \"in effect\" as the status quo, we easily can dispose of the\r\ncontention that HUD violated  1437f(c)(2)(C) by reducing the\r\ncontract rent in effect.  The contract rent in effect has been\r\nneither reduced nor increased.  The plain language barring\r\nreductions does not require HUD to raise the contract rent in this\r\nsituation. \"[I]t is reductions in rent that are expressly\r\nproscribed by section [1437f](c)(2)(C).\"  Foxglenn, 35 F.3d at 950\r\n(emphasis added).  HUD's decision to keep the current contract\r\nrents complied with the statute's plain language, and consequently\r\ncannot be considered arbitrary and capricious.  The district\r\ncourt's decision to the contrary must be reversed.\r\nC.  Whether HUD inappropriately classified the SHARP funds as \r\ngrants.\r\nIn 1985 and 1987, Trafalgar entered into contracts to\r\nreceive more than $1 million over 15 years from the Massachusetts\r\nSHARP program.  In determining how the receipt of those funds\r\nimpacted Trafalgar's contract with HUD, HUD was required to\r\nclassify them as either a grant or a loan.  If the SHARP funds were\r\ngrants, the HUD regulations would require Trafalgar to subtract the\r\namount from the debt service calculations, and it therefore would\r\nnot be included in the base rent.  If the SHARP funds were loans,\r\nthe amounts would have been included in the debt service\r\ncalculation for the purposes of computing the base rents.\r\nThe SHARP contracts have many of the indicia of loans. \r\nIndeed, the SHARP program's enabling legislation provides that the\r\nfinancial assistance shall be \"in the form of a loan.\"  Mass. Gen.\r\nLaws ch. 23B,  27.  The Massachusetts Department of Housing and\r\nCommunity Development (\"DCHD\") is empowered to determine the\r\nappropriate annual amount of the \"loan proceeds\" to be distributed\r\nto each project.  Id.  One of the restrictions on the DCHD's\r\nauthority is that the disbursement decisions must be \"consistent\r\nwith the repayment of the loan as hereinafter provided.\"  Id.  The\r\nrepayment obligations may not be waived in whole or in part.  Seeid.  To guarantee that the loans are actually repaid, they are\r\nsecured by a lien on real or personal property, or both.  See id.\r\nThe contracts executed by Trafalgar and the Massachusetts\r\nHousing Finance Agency (\"MHFA\"), the body overseeing the SHARP\r\nprogram financing obligations, confirm these details.  The\r\ncontracts provide that Trafalgar would receive \"housing subsidy\r\nloans\" under the SHARP Program.  (App. at 50).  Paragraph 12 of the\r\ncontracts contains language highly relevant to the decision to\r\nclassify SHARP proceeds as a grant or loan:\r\nThe parties specifically understand and agree\r\nthat the SHARP funds provided by this Contract\r\nare considered to be a loan from the\r\n[Executive Office of Communities and\r\nDevelopment (\"EOCD\")] to the [MHFA] and not a\r\ngrant of money.  The loan provided hereunder\r\nshall be evidenced by a Subsidy Repayment\r\nNote. . . . This Subsidy Repayment Note shall\r\nbe, and hereby is, secured by the mortgage on\r\nthe Project.\r\n\n(App. at 55, 68).  Three statements in this paragraph are relevant:\r\n1) the parties acknowledged that this money was a loan \"and not a\r\ngrant\" from EOCD to MHFA, who then loaned it to Trafalgar; 2) the\r\nloan was  evidenced by a repayment note; and 3) the repayment\r\nobligation was secured by a mortgage.  \r\nThe attached \"Subsidy Repayment Notes\" stated that\r\nTrafalgar would repay the MHFA the principal amount of the notes,\r\n\"together with simple interest thereon.\"  (App. at 60, 74). \r\nTrafalgar was obliged to repay the principal and interest on\r\nDecember 1, 2016, unless Trafalgar had defaulted on the loans or\r\nsold the project prior to that date.  While the notes were\r\nexpressly secondary to any existing mortgage on the property,\r\nTrafalgar agreed to use any assets remaining after repaying the\r\nmortgage to repay the notes, and agreed \"to pay, in addition to\r\nother amounts due, all reasonable legal charges and expenses\r\nincurred for collecting the debt, including attorney's fees.\" \r\n(App. at 61, 75).\r\nDespite these indicators suggesting that the SHARP funds\r\nwere loans, HUD decided to classify them as grants for two reasons. \r\nFirst, HUD stated that the repayment obligations were not\r\nsufficiently imminent because Trafalgar was not required to repay\r\nany of the loan proceeds until December 1, 2016.  HUD took the\r\nposition that base rents should not reflect costs that will not\r\ncome due during the term of the HAP; the HAP expired in the year\r\n2002, fourteen years before the loan's due date.  Second, HUD\r\nstated that the SHARP obligations were not sufficiently certain to\r\njustify inclusion in the base rents.  Under the SHARP contracts,\r\nTrafalgar's obligation to repay the principal and interest might be\r\naltered.  Trafalgar could \"recycle\" the principal into the  project\r\nby, for instance, providing the tenants with rent subsidies or a\r\ncredit toward the purchase of project units.  Interest payments\r\ncould be forgiven if Trafalgar instituted a program to limit the\r\nimpact of the SHARP program termination on the low and moderate\r\nincome tenants.  Because the principal could be recycled and the\r\ninterest forgiven, HUD found that the repayment obligations were\r\ntoo uncertain to justify treatment as a loan and inclusion in the\r\ncontract rents.\r\nAt first blush, these reasons seem rational, and perhaps\r\nsufficient to survive review under the deferential arbitrary and\r\ncapricious standard.  However, neither basis for HUD's decision\r\nmakes rational sense to this court, as the arbitrary and capricious\r\nstandard requires.\r\n1. Costs due after HAP termination.  As stated earlier,\r\nthe base rent is designed to represent the cost of owning, managing\r\nand maintaining the unit.  In this case some of those costs have\r\nbeen advanced by a third party.  The fact that Trafalgar's\r\nrepayment obligations do not mature until after the conclusion of\r\nthe HAP contract does not mean that the principal and interest\r\npayments are not costs of owning, managing and maintaining the\r\nunit.  HUD's argument could be used to exclude other significant\r\ncosts.  For instance, Trafalgar might have purchased the property\r\nby a mortgage with a single balloon payment due after the HAP term. \r\nIn such a situation, HUD's argument would bar consideration of the\r\nmortgage obligation, even though it clearly represents a cost of\r\nowning, managing and maintaining the property.  As the district\r\ncourt stated, the fact that Trafalgar's repayment obligation\r\naccrues well after the conclusion of the HAP term does not mean\r\nthat Trafalgar has \"received a gift . . . and not a loan.\" \r\nTrafalgar Capital Assoc., 973 F. Supp. at  220. \r\nHUD has recognized that the rehabilitation debt service\r\nmay include amounts to be paid by the project owner after the\r\nconclusion of the HAP, specifically payment of a rehabilitation\r\nloan whose term might extend beyond the 15-year HAP period.  (SeeHUD Handbook, p. 17 (the proposal might include \"a loan term longer\r\nthan 15 years (e.g. 30 years if a 30-year loan is obtained)\").  The\r\nagency does not exclude the rehabilitation costs being paid by such\r\na loan even though some principal might not be repaid until years\r\nafter the HAP has terminated.  We see no basis for excluding from\r\nbase rent costs that are similarly financed in a long range manner. \r\nA balloon payment of principal and interest strikes us as\r\nmaterially equivalent to the extended loan payments that HUD\r\nroutinely views as appropriate costs.  HUD's argument that the\r\nSHARP funds are a grant because they are repaid after HAP\r\ntermination is thus inconsistent with its other practices and, as\r\na result, unconvincing.\r\n2. Costs not sufficiently certain.  The second reason HUD\r\ngives for classification of the SHARP funds as a grant is the\r\npossibility that the principal might be \"recycled\" into the\r\nproject, and the interest might be forgiven.  This rationale is\r\nequally unavailing.\r\nUnder the SHARP statute, Trafalgar is required to submit\r\na proposal to Massachusetts to limit the impact of SHARP assistance\r\ntermination on low and moderate income tenants.  As noted earlier,\r\nsuch a proposal might involve using the SHARP principal to\r\nsubsidize the tenants' rents, or it might feature a credit to the\r\ntenants toward the purchase of their unit.  Whatever the form of\r\nthe proposal, Trafalgar's receipts would be less than they\r\notherwise would have been.  Instead of paying the principal to\r\nMHFA, Trafalgar effectively would be paying that amount to the\r\ntenants.\r\nThe direct recipient of Trafalgar's \"repayment\" is\r\nimmaterial for determining whether the SHARP funds are a grant or\r\na loan; if \"recycling\" occurs, Trafalgar suffers the same financial\r\nloss as it would in repaying the loan directly to the MHFA.  The\r\ndistrict court was correct when it stated that \"[i]t is entirely\r\nunreasonable to suggest that, because the eventual recipients of\r\n[Trafalgar's] repayment are the tenants, . . . [Trafalgar] is not,\r\nin reality, paying back the loan's principal.\"  Trafalgar Capital\r\nAssoc., 973 F. Supp. at 220.\r\nThe fact that interest might be forgiven also does not\r\nautomatically mean that the SHARP funds become a grant rather than\r\na loan.  As HUD well knows, any decision to reduce or waive the\r\ninterest is in the sole and exclusive discretion of MHFA, and \"will\r\nonly be allowed if [Trafalgar] produces an exceptional plan for\r\nhelping low and moderate income families\" transition from receiving\r\nSHARP financial assistance to the termination of the SHARP program. \r\n(App. at 228)(emphasis added).  Any future decision by MHFA to\r\nwaive the interest does not alter Trafalgar's current obligation to\r\npay interest on the principal it has received.  In addition, even\r\nif interest on the SHARP funds is waived in part or in whole, the\r\nSHARP assistance would constitute either a low-interest or\r\ninterest-free loan, both of which are still loans.  (See id.)  If\r\nthe principal still must be repaid, the reduction or elimination of\r\ninterest does not convert a loan to a grant.\r\nIn sum, then, it was not rational for HUD to classify the\r\nSHARP funds as a grant rather than a loan.  The SHARP contracts\r\nhave all the indicia of loans.  They require repayment of the\r\nprincipal and interest.  They are secured by a lien on the\r\nproperty.  If Trafalgar does not fulfill its obligations, it agreed\r\nto pay all legal costs, including attorney's fees, associated with\r\ncollection efforts.  And the language in the contracts explicitly\r\nstates that they are loans and not grants.  HUD's reasons for\r\nclassifying them as grants are not reasonable.  The expense of\r\nrepaying the SHARP funds, although incurred after HAP termination,\r\nis a cost of owning, managing and maintaining the property. \r\nInterest is forgiven only under the state's discretion, and, even\r\nif it were forgiven, an interest-free loan is still a loan.  We\r\ntherefore affirm the district court's ruling that HUD's decision to\r\nclassify the SHARP funds as a grant was arbitrary and capricious. \r\nD.  Whether the statute of limitations bars Trafalgar's claim that\r\nthe 1986 FMR should have been used.\r\nThe Fair Market Rent, or FMR, used in the AHAP and HAP\r\nestablishes the ceiling for the contract rents and therefore has a\r\nsignificant impact on an owner's subsidy from HUD.  Trafalgar\r\nargues that HUD improperly used the 1985 FMR instead of the higher\r\n1986 FMR, thereby reducing the funds to which Trafalgar was\r\nentitled.  The district court found this claim to be barred by the\r\nstatute of limitations, and Trafalgar challenges this decision on\r\ncross-appeal.  Application of the statute of limitations by\r\ndefinition involves an appreciation of the dates involved, so our\r\nanalysis must start there.\r\nThe FMR is based on the rents actually charged for units\r\nin the same area, and the Secretary of HUD is required to establish\r\nFMRs \"periodically but not less than annually.\"  42 U.S.C. \r\n1437f(c)(1).  On July 5, 1984, HUD first published the 1985 FMRs as\r\nan interim rule with an effective date of October 1, 1984.  The\r\n1985 FMRs were published in final rule form on April 16, 1985.\r\nThe AHAP was executed on April 30, 1986.  In accordance\r\nwith the regulations, it specified that the initial contract rents\r\nwould be based on the FMRs then in effect, which were the 1985\r\nrates.  The 1986 FMR applicable to the project was published and\r\nmade effective on August 29, 1986, four months after AHAP\r\nexecution, and twenty-two months after the 1985 FMR had gone into\r\neffect.\r\nOn April 17, 1990, the parties executed the final stage\r\nof the HAP contract.  Trafalgar argued that the base and contract\r\nrent ceilings should be based on the 1986 FMR, but HUD insisted on\r\nusing the 1985 rate.  Trafalgar chose to pursue administrative\r\nremedies, which were exhausted with HUD's final denial on April 7,\r\n1995.  \r\nTrafalgar filed its claim in the district court on June\r\n15, 1995.  It argued that, consistent with the statutory\r\nrequirement, the 1986 FMRs should have been established by October\r\n1, 1985, one year after the 1985 FMRs went into effect.  Had HUD\r\nfollowed the statutory mandate to set the FMRs no less than\r\nannually, the AHAP and HAP would have used the 1986 FMRs.\r\nA complaint under the APA for review of an agency action\r\nis a civil action that must be filed within the six year\r\nlimitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C.  2401(a).

Appreciating this fact,\r\nTrafalgar argues that the claim did not accrue either until the HAP\r\nwas executed or until Trafalgar had exhausted its administrative\r\nremedies.  In its decision that Trafalgar's claim was barred by the\r\nstatute of limitations, the district court implicitly rejected\r\nTrafalgar's first argument, and explicitly rejected the second.\r\n1. HAP execution.  In general, \"[a] cause of action\r\nagainst an administrative agency 'first accrues,' within the\r\nmeaning of  2401(a), as soon as . . . the person challenging the\r\nagency action can institute and maintain a suit in court.\"  Spannusv.

To be a \"final agency\r\naction,\" it must be a \"definitive statement[ ] of [the agency's]\r\nposition\" with \"direct and immediate\" consequences.  FTC v.\r\nStandard Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110366\"><a href=\"/opinion/110366/ftc-v-standard-oil-co-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241 (1980).\r\nDetermining which HUD statement was the final agency\r\naction is a relatively straightforward exercise.  HUD regulations\r\nrequire that initial rents are capped at the FMR \"applicable to the\r\nunit on the date that the [AHAP] is executed.\"  24 C.F.R. \r\n882.408(c) (1998).  This limit applies to both the AHAP and HAP,\r\neven though payments do not commence until rehabilitation has been\r\ncompleted and the parties have executed the HAP, which may be well\r\nafter the date of the AHAP.  Therefore, the final agency action for\r\nthe purpose of commencing the statute of limitations was the final\r\nstatement by HUD setting the FMR that applied on the date of AHAP\r\nexecution.\r\nThe 1985 FMR was in effect at the time of AHAP execution\r\non April 30, 1986.  Although HUD should have promulgated the 1986\r\nFMRs by that time, HUD followed the regulation requirement to apply\r\nthe FMR then in effect.  A strong argument can be made that AHAP\r\nexecution was the final agency action for the purpose of commencing\r\nthe statute of limitations.\r\nHowever, one could also argue that the final agency\r\naction did not occur until HUD actually issued the 1986 FMR on\r\nAugust 29, 1986.  On that date, at the latest, Trafalgar learned\r\nthat HUD would not apply the new rate to its previously executed\r\nAHAP.  Prior to that date, Trafalgar had a possible argument that\r\nthe 1986 FMR, which reflected rates as of April 1, could be applied\r\nretroactively to the AHAP executed April 30.\r\nDeciding which of these decisions was the final agency\r\naction is unnecessary, because both occurred well outside the\r\nstatute of limitations.  Even if the issuance of the 1986 FMR were\r\nthe final agency action, rather than AHAP execution, Trafalgar\r\nwould have been required to file its action in court before August\r\n29, 1992, six years later.  Trafalgar's complaint was not filed\r\nuntil June 15, 1995, almost three years after the expiration of the\r\nstatute of limitations.\r\nTrafalgar argues that the HAP was the final agency\r\ndecision because HUD could change the terms of the contract between\r\nthe AHAP and HAP.  The relevant regulation allows HUD to change the\r\ncontract rent between the AHAP and HAP under certain limited\r\ncircumstances: unexpected changes in rehabilitation costs, changes\r\nin financing, changes in relocation payments to tenants, or to\r\ncorrect errors in computation.  See 24 C.F.R.  882.408(d)(1)\r\n(1998).  None of these situations applies.  Moreover, the\r\nregulations specifically require application of the FMR applicable\r\non the date of the execution of the AHAP.  HUD's issuance of the\r\n1986 FMR was therefore the final agency action with respect to\r\nTrafalgar's claim.\r\n2. Exhaustion of administrative remedies.  In the\r\nalternative, Trafalgar alleges that the cause of action did not\r\naccrue until it had exhausted all available administrative\r\nremedies.  The district court rejected this argument, ruling that\r\nTrafalgar's decision to pursue administrative remedies not\r\nexplicitly a prerequisite to suit did not affect the accrual of its\r\nclaim. \r\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"no one is entitled to\r\njudicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the\r\nprescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\" Myers v.\r\nBethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102952\"><a href=\"/opinion/102952/myers-v-bethlehem-shipbuilding-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50-51 (1938).  \"In\r\npractice, the doctrine has softer edges than this language\r\nimplies.\"  Portela-Gonzalez v.

Meyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481325\"><a href=\"/opinion/481325/united-states-v-robert-e-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1st Cir. 1987).\r\nThe district court correctly recognized this distinction\r\nin holding that Trafalgar's claim accrued before it began to seek\r\npermissive administrative remedies.  Trafalgar was entitled to\r\npursue administrative remedies, but its choice to do so did not\r\nstop the statute of limitations from running.\r\n                    III. Conclusion\r\nWe reverse the district court's determination that HUD\r\nacted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in excluding the pre-\r\nAHAP costs from the base rents and in maintaining the status quo\r\nwhen offsetting mistakes were made.  The district court, however,\r\ncorrectly concluded that HUD was arbitrary and capricious in\r\ntreating the SHARP funds as a grant instead of a loan.  Trafalgar's\r\nclaim to use a different year FMR was time-barred, as the district\r\ncourt appropriately found.  \r\nAccordingly, the district court's judgment is affirmed in\r\npart and reversed in part.  HUD to receive half its costs.\n</pre>",
