Euromotion, Inc.\r\n(\"Euromotion\") brought this diversity action against BMW of\r\nNorth America, Inc. (\"BMW\"), alleging that BMW had terminated\r\nEuromotion's dealership agreement without good cause in\r\nviolation of Puerto Rico's Law 75 of June 24, 1964, P.R. Laws\r\nAnn. tit. 10,  278 et seq. (\"Law 75\"), and that BMW had failed\r\nto negotiate with Euromotion in good faith concerning a\r\ndealership, thereby violating Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico\r\nCivil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  5141.  BMW moved for\r\nsummary judgment arguing, inter alia, that the undisputed facts\r\nestablished that Euromotion had never been a BMW dealer, and\r\nthat BMW had never in fact negotiated with Euromotion.  The\r\ndistrict court granted BMW's motion.  We affirm the district\r\ncourt's grant of summary judgment.\r\n                        I. BACKGROUND.\r\n         We state the facts in the light most favorable to\r\nEuromotion.  See Casas Office Machs., Inc. v. Mita Copystar\r\nAm., Inc., 42 F.3d 668, 684 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r\n         Beginning in 1991, Euromotion, an independent vendor\r\nof automobiles, without encouragement from BMW, began to\r\nperform many of the functions of a BMW dealer in Puerto Rico. \r\nIt bought BMW automobiles from independent dealers in Florida\r\nfor resale in Puerto Rico, maintained an extensive BMW\r\ninventory, acquired sales facilities, and advertised having BMW\r\nautomobiles for sale.\r\n         BMW had no authorized dealer of its own in Puerto\r\nRico, and in 1993 began to search for an establishment to serve\r\nas its exclusive dealer there.  Euromotion's president\r\ncorresponded with BMW about Euromotion's expressed desire to\r\nbecome the exclusive BMW dealer in Puerto Rico.  In October\r\n1993, BMW interviewed Euromotion's president and other\r\npotential candidates for the dealership position.\r\n         Around the same time, BMW instituted an export\r\nprohibition on its automobiles.  As a result of that\r\nprohibition, Tom Bush BMW, an independent BMW dealer in\r\nFlorida, informed BMW and Euromotion that it would not continue\r\nto sell cars to Euromotion.\r\n         Sometime in October or November of 1993, John\r\nCiontea, the area manager for BMW, met with Manuel Soltero,\r\nEuromotion's president (the \"1993 meeting\").  Also present at\r\nthis meeting were Luis Rios, an automobile dealer used by\r\nEuromotion, and Carlos Kirigin, a sales representative for a\r\nFlorida BMW dealership by the name of Fields BMW.  At this\r\nmeeting, Soltero expressed concern that BMW's newly implemented\r\nprohibition on exports would impede Euromotion's ability to\r\nobtain BMW's cars.  In response, Ciontea gave Kirigin (and\r\nthrough him, Fields BMW) the \"green light\" to sell cars and\r\nother paraphernalia to Euromotion.  According to Euromotion,\r\nBMW encouraged it to develop the Puerto Rican market and to\r\nkeep its inventories high.  BMW also told Euromotion's\r\npresident not to worry about the lack of a written dealer\r\napplication packet because \"everything would be put [i]n black\r\nand white\" eventually.\r\n         Euromotion contends that the 1993 meeting established\r\na dealer relationship with BMW.  After the meeting, Euromotion\r\nsold only BMW's cars and attempted to develop the Puerto Rican\r\nmarket for such cars.  Euromotion obtained these cars from\r\nFields BMW in Florida at a wholesale price.  Although it is\r\nclear from the record that BMW did not have the authority to\r\nimpose any terms or conditions on Fields BMW regarding its sale\r\nof automobiles to Euromotion, and although these sales were\r\nnegotiated between Fields BMW and Euromotion, Fields BMW would\r\nhave charged Euromotion a higher price if the 1993 meeting had\r\nnot taken place.  Euromotion also obtained brochures, T-shirts,\r\nand other BMW-related advertising materials from Fields BMW. \r\nFurther, the BMW-authorized service representative in Puerto\r\nRico gave full warranty service to cars sold by Euromotion.\r\n         The parties agree that Euromotion never bought a car\r\ndirectly from BMW, never placed a purchase order with BMW,\r\nnever received any promotional material directly from BMW,\r\nnever consulted or negotiated directly with BMW the prices or\r\nterms of its sales relationships with any of BMW's independent\r\ndealers, and never saw a copy of BMW's dealership agreement.\r\n         On December 13, 1993, Soltero acknowledged in a\r\nletter written to BMW that BMW had \"a lot of candidates for the\r\n[BMW dealership] franchise . . . [that] I understand you have\r\nto evaluate.\"  Soltero expressed the \"hope that before [BMW\r\npicked its] candidate [it] should come to Puerto Rico and give\r\n[Euromotion] a chance to show our business, meet our great\r\nstaff and finally demonstrate why we are the best choice to\r\nproudly represent the BMW franchise in Puerto Rico.\"  Soltero\r\nalso asked BMW to \"always remember that [Euromotion] already\r\ncontrol[s] the BMW market and everybody recognize[s] us as the\r\nBMW dealer in Puerto Rico.\"\r\n         On June 22, 1995, BMW announced in the Puerto Rican\r\npapers that it had chosen a company called \"Autogermana\" to\r\nserve as the exclusive BMW dealer for Puerto Rico.  Sometime\r\nafter Autogermana was appointed as BMW's authorized dealer in\r\nPuerto Rico, Fields BMW ceased to give Euromotion the benefit\r\nof advantageous prices and business terms.\r\n         On June 25, 1996, Euromotion filed the present action\r\nalleging that BMW had violated Law 75 and the duty of good\r\nfaith and fair dealing imposed by Article 1802 of the Puerto\r\nRican Civil Code.  Thereafter, Euromotion filed a motion for\r\npreliminary injunctive relief under Law 75, which the court\r\ndenied after discovery and a hearing.  On October 24, 1996, BMW\r\nfiled a motion for summary judgment on both of Euromotion's\r\nclaims.\r\n         On May 21, 1997, the district court allowed BMW's\r\nsummary judgment motion.  On the Law 75 claim, the district\r\ncourt found that Soltero's letter of December 13, 1993, wherein\r\nhe acknowledged that there were many contenders for BMW to\r\nevaluate for a possible Puerto Rican dealership, established\r\nconclusively that an actual dealer relationship did not then\r\nexist as a result of the prior meeting between Ciontea and\r\nSoltero.  On the good faith claim, the court found that none of\r\nthe interactions between BMW and Euromotion constituted\r\nnegotiations.  Since no negotiations took place, the court\r\nreasoned that BMW was not under a duty to negotiate in good\r\nfaith.  The court did not address BMW's statute-of-limitations\r\ndefense.  On May 22, 1997, the court dismissed the case with\r\nprejudice.  Euromotion has appealed.  We affirm.\r\n                   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW.\r\n         We review a grant of summary judgment de novo,\r\nviewing \"the entire record in the light most hospitable to the\r\nparty opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable\r\ninferences in that party's favor.\"  Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904\r\nF.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations omitted).  Summary\r\njudgment is appropriate only if \"the pleadings, depositions,\r\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\r\nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\r\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n56(c).    \r\n         Summary judgment is properly awarded against a party\r\nwho, \"after adequate time for discovery . . . fails to make a\r\nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\r\nessential to that party's case, and on which that party will\r\nbear the burden of proof at trial.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\r\n477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  Not all disputes preclude summary\r\njudgment, only those that relate to genuine issues of material\r\nfact.  \"The evidence manifesting the dispute must be\r\n'substantial,' going beyond the allegations of the complaint.\" \r\nHahn v. Sargent, 523 F.2d 461, 464 (1st Cir. 1975) (citations\r\nomitted).  Further, \"neither conclusory allegations, improbable\r\ninferences, and unsupported speculation, nor [b]rash \r\nconjecture coupled with earnest hope that something concrete\r\nwill materialize\" prevent us from awarding summary judgment. \r\nJ. Geils Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson,\r\nInc., 76 F.3d 1245, 1251 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation\r\nmarks and citations omitted).  Rather, to prevail over a\r\nproperly supported motion for summary judgment, a nonmoving\r\nparty must establish the existence of a trial-worthy issue by\r\npresenting \"enough competent evidence to enable a finding\r\nfavorable to the nonmoving party.\"  Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank\r\nof Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing Andersonv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)).\r\n                       III. DISCUSSION.\r\nA.  The Law 75 Claim.\r\n         Law 75 prohibits a principal from terminating its\r\nbusiness relationship with a dealer unless the principal has\r\n\"just cause.\"    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278a.  We interpret\r\nthe language of Law 75 \"in the light of the ends sought by the\r\nstatute,\" see Sudouest Import Sales Corp. v. Union Carbide\r\nCorp., 732 F.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1984), which are \"to protect\r\nPuerto Rico dealers from the harm caused when a supplier\r\narbitrarily terminates a distributorship once the dealer has\r\ncreated a favorable market for the supplier's products, 'thus\r\nfrustrating the legitimate expectations and interests of those\r\nwho so efficiently carried out their responsibilities,'\"  R.W.\r\nInt'l Corp. v. Welch Food, Inc., 13 F.3d 478, 482 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (citing Medina &amp; Medina v. Country Pride Foods, Ltd., 858\r\nF.2d 817, 820 (1st Cir. 1988)).\r\n         To that end, Law 75 is drafted in broad terms.  Law\r\n75 defines a dealer as a \"person actually interested in a\r\ndealer's contract.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278(a).  A\r\n\"dealer's contract\" includes any business relationship\r\n    established between a dealer and a principal or grantor\r\n    whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the\r\n    parties may call, characterize or execute such\r\n    relationship, the former actually and effectively takes\r\n    charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or the\r\n    rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the\r\n    market of Puerto Rico.\r\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278(b).\r\n         Euromotion argues that it succeeded in raising an\r\nissue of material fact regarding whether the 1993 meeting\r\ncreated a dealer-principal relationship.  Euromotion analogizes\r\nits relationship with BMW (through Fields BMW) to the dealer\r\nrelationship in a case decided by the Puerto Rican Supreme\r\nCourt, J. Soler Motors, Inc. v. Kaiser Jeep International\r\nCorp., 8 P.R. Offic. Trans. 138, 108 D.P.R. 134 (1978).  In J.\r\nSoler Motors, the defendant appointed the plaintiff as its\r\ndealer in Puerto Rico, then assigned the dealership contract to\r\nits general distributor in the area.  See id. at 141.  This\r\nmeant that the dealer had to place orders for cars and parts\r\nthrough the general distributor.  See id.  Despite the presence\r\nof this intermediary, the court applied Law 75 to cover the\r\ndealer.  See id. at 145.\r\n         We are not persuaded.  In J. Soler Motors, the\r\nplaintiff had signed a dealership contract setting out detailed\r\nterms to govern its business relationship with the defendant. \r\nNo such evidence appears in the present case.  Euromotion\r\nadmits that it never even saw the standard dealership agreement\r\nroutinely used by BMW much less became a party to such a\r\ncontract.\r\n         Perhaps sensing the weakness in its argument,\r\nEuromotion notes that we have defined the necessary dealer\r\nrelationship for Law 75 purposes quite generously.  We have\r\nheld that a party still in the process of negotiating the final\r\nterms of a dealer's contract may fall under the protective\r\naegis of Law 75 where, for some time, it had been acting de\r\nfacto as a dealer.  See Welch, 13 F.3d at 486.\r\n         But Welch was an altogether different case.  The\r\ndefendant in Welch had written to the plaintiff stating that it\r\nhad \"reached a decision to continue the frozen food\r\ndistribution . . . in Puerto Rico by transferring [its] account\r\nto [the plaintiff].\"  Id. at 480.  In that same letter, the\r\ndefendant agreed to \"draft an agreement\" that would establish\r\nthe plaintiff as an authorized dealer.  Id.  Shortly\r\nafterwards, while still in the process of negotiating the terms\r\nof a written dealership agreement, the parties began doing\r\nbusiness directly with one another as if a dealer relationship\r\nhad already been formalized.\r\n         The defendant in Welch conceded that the plaintiff\r\nwas \"performing the functions of a distributor within the\r\nmeaning of Law 75.\"  Id. at 482.  In the circumstances, we\r\nstated that Law 75 \"clearly incorporates within its reach any\r\narrangement between a supplier and dealer in which the dealer\r\nis actually in the process of distributing the suppliers'\r\nmerchandise in Puerto Rico.\"  Id. at 482-83.\r\n         Focusing only on the last statement quoted above,\r\nEuromotion argues that whenever \"parties are dealing, a\r\ndealership exists for purposes of the Act,\" quoting Welch, 13\r\nF.3d at 484.  We made that statement, however, in a context\r\nvery different from that at bar.  First, Euromotion never\r\nreached the point here of becoming engaged in negotiations with\r\nBMW regarding the terms of an actual dealership contract. \r\nSecond, there is no substantial evidence that BMW ever\r\ndesignated Euromotion, even informally, to act as its\r\nauthorized dealer as distinct from continuing to sell BMW cars\r\nindependently.  Third, the parties in Welch directly dealt with\r\none another for over a year in the manner of a de facto\r\ndealership arrangement.  Although the lack of direct dealings\r\nmay not always be determinative, see J. Soler Motors, 8 P.R.\r\nOffic. Trans. at 145, direct business relations as in Welch can\r\nprovide evidence of a dealer relationship.  Fourth,\r\nEuromotion's president wrote a letter to BMW after the dealer\r\nrelationship was supposedly established in which he\r\nacknowledged that BMW had \"a lot of candidates for the [BMW\r\ndealership] franchise . . . [that] I understand you have to\r\nevaluate.\"  This letter is clearly inconsistent with\r\nEuromotion's position that it had an understanding with BMW\r\nthat it was BMW's authorized dealer.  Welch, therefore, is in\r\nno sense dispositive.\r\n         Euromotion also argues that Law 75 allows recovery by\r\nany dealer, such as itself, who \"invest[s] time, effort, and\r\nexpense in the development of a market, . . . even where\r\ncertain other trappings of the typical dealership [are]\r\nmissing.\"  Sudouest Import Sales Corp., 732 F.2d at 16\r\n(citation omitted).  However, unilateral efforts to sell a\r\nproduct and develop a market are not sufficient, alone, to\r\ncreate a dealer relationship within the purview of Law 75.  SeeLneas Areas Costarricenses v. Caribbean Gen., Inc., 682 F.\r\nSupp. 117, 121 (D.P.R. 1988) (collecting cases).\r\n         It is true that there is evidence that BMW encouraged\r\nits independent dealer in Florida, Fields BMW, to continue its\r\nfavorable business relationship with Euromotion.  At that time,\r\nBMW may well have been pleased, and so expressed itself, by\r\nEuromotion's efforts to sell BMW automobiles in Puerto Rico. \r\nHowever, BMW's encouragement of Euromotion to proceed at that\r\ntime as an independent seller of BMW automobiles could not\r\ncreate a dealer relationship.\r\n         On this record, the only conclusion a reasonable fact\r\nfinder could reach is that Euromotion did not have a dealer\r\nrelationship within Law 75 with BMW.  The absence of such a\r\nrelationship is fatal to its claim.  See Welch, 13 F.3d at 483\r\n(declaring that Law 75 \"insists upon establishment of a\r\n'supplier/dealer' relationship\").  Accordingly, the district\r\ncourt correctly dismissed Euromotion's Law 75 claim.\r\nB.  Duty to Negotiate in Good Faith.\r\n         The Puerto Rican Supreme Court has held that,\r\nalthough parties generally may withdraw from negotiations at\r\nany time prior to forming a contract, parties once engaged in\r\na negotiation process have a duty to proceed in good faith.   \r\nSee Producciones Tommy Muiz, Inc. v. COPAN, 13 P.R. Offic.\r\nTrans. 660, 676, 113 P.R. Dec. 517 (1982).  Euromotion charges\r\nthat BMW violated that duty.  The district court did not\r\nexplore the question whether BMW had terminated negotiations\r\nwith Euromotion in bad faith because it found that Euromotion\r\nhad failed to demonstrate that Euromotion and BMW ever reached\r\nthe point of becoming involved in contract negotiations.  \r\n         Euromotion asserts that it is \"indisputable\" in light\r\nof the evidence that the court, in reaching its conclusion,\r\nimproperly weighed the credibility of the witnesses.  Since our\r\nreview is de novo, see Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 115, we need\r\nnot consider whether the specific reasoning set out by the\r\ndistrict court contained errors.  Rather, we ask whether the\r\nevidence presented by Euromotion was adequate to establish that\r\nnegotiations sufficient to be regarded as such ever took place\r\nbetween the parties.  Cf. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322\r\n(stating that, in order to avoid a properly supported motion\r\nfor summary judgment, a nonmoving party must make a \"showing\r\nsufficient to establish the existence of an element essential\r\nto that party's case, and on which that party will bear the\r\nburden of proof at trial\").  We find Euromotion's evidence\r\ninsufficient to establish that a course of negotiations looking\r\nto the creation of a dealer's contract ever occurred.  We\r\ntherefore affirm the district court.\r\n         According to Euromotion, the following facts\r\nconstituted negotiations between itself and BMW.  First,\r\nEuromotion's president was interviewed by BMW, along with other\r\ncandidates, to determine whether to select Euromotion for the\r\nposition of dealer.  Second, BMW encouraged Euromotion in 1993\r\nto continue to sell BMW automobiles, as it was then doing, and\r\ndevelop a market in Puerto Rico.  Third, BMW urged Fields BMW\r\nat that time to aid Euromotion in developing the Puerto Rican\r\nmarket, as it had been doing for a while.  Fourth, because\r\nEuromotion's president believed that Euromotion was being\r\nconsidered as a candidate for the Puerto Rican dealership,\r\nEuromotion took action to create a larger market for BMW's cars\r\nin Puerto Rico.  Fifth, Euromotion kept BMW informed of its\r\nprogress.\r\n         None of the above, in our view, were negotiations\r\nsuch as might trigger the duty of good faith in the Puerto\r\nRican Civil Code.  Rather they were preliminary activities and\r\ndealings reflecting, among other things, a modicum of initial\r\ninterest by BMW in Euromotion's activities as an independent\r\nsalesman of BMW vehicles, and also reflecting Euromotion's\r\nintense but unsuccessful efforts to become a finalist for the\r\ndealership position.  While BMW encouraged Euromotion to\r\nproceed with its independent sales of BMW cars and interviewed\r\nEuromotion's president along with others, BMW never selected\r\nEuromotion as someone with whom it intended to negotiate a\r\ndealership contract.  And, in fact, no contract negotiations\r\never took place.  None of the interactions between the parties\r\naddressed the concerns that parties looking to form a dealer\r\nrelationship would address.  BMW and Euromotion did not discuss\r\ninventory requirements, sales goals, promotional allowances,\r\nshowroom standards, trademark use, minimum service facilities,\r\nwarranty conditions, payment and credit arrangements, letters\r\nof credit, or personnel and staffing requirements.  Further,\r\nthe record establishes that Euromotion never submitted the\r\nrequired dealer application to BMW and never saw the BMW\r\nauthorized dealer standard agreement.  Lastly, Euromotion's\r\nletter to BMW in December of 1993 confirms that Euromotion\r\nunderstood itself to be just one candidate among several.  The\r\ndistrict court concluded that: \"None of this [evidence\r\npresented by Euromotion] constitutes contract 'negotiations' by\r\nany stretch of the imagination.\"  We agree.  \r\n         It is true, of course, that \"when the facts support\r\nplausible but conflicting inferences on a pivotal issue in the\r\ncase, the judge may not choose between those inferences at the\r\nsummary judgment stage.\"  Coyne v. Taber Partners I, 53 F.3d\r\n454, 460 (1st Cir. 1995); see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249\r\n(noting that a judge should not weigh the evidence when\r\nconsidering a motion for summary judgment).  Still, a court\r\nshould not indulge a nonmoving party's inferences if they do\r\nnot \"flow rationally from the underlying facts.\"  Rubinovitz v.\r\nRogato, 60 F.3d 906, 911 (1st Cir. 1995).  On the facts of this\r\ncase viewed in the light most favorable to Euromotion, no\r\nreasonable fact finder could conclude that BMW entered into\r\nnegotiations with Euromotion concerning the formation of a\r\ndealership contract.  It follows that BMW's refusal, for\r\nwhatever reason, to talk further with Euromotion could not\r\namount to a breach of Puerto Rico's doctrine requiring parties\r\nwho enter into contract negotiations to proceed in good faith. \r\nWe hold that summary judgment was appropriate on Euromotion's\r\ngood faith claim.\r\n         Affirmed.\n",

Euromotion's president\r\ncorresponded with BMW about Euromotion's expressed desire to\r\nbecome the exclusive BMW dealer in Puerto Rico.  In October\r\n1993, BMW interviewed Euromotion's president and other\r\npotential candidates for the dealership position.\r\n         Around the same time, BMW instituted an export\r\nprohibition on its automobiles.  As a result of that\r\nprohibition, Tom Bush BMW, an independent BMW dealer in\r\nFlorida, informed BMW and Euromotion that it would not continue\r\nto sell cars to Euromotion.\r\n         Sometime in October or November of 1993, John\r\nCiontea, the area manager for BMW, met with Manuel Soltero,\r\nEuromotion's president (the \"1993 meeting\").  Also present at\r\nthis meeting were Luis Rios, an automobile dealer used by\r\nEuromotion, and Carlos Kirigin, a sales representative for a\r\nFlorida BMW dealership by the name of Fields BMW.  At this\r\nmeeting, Soltero expressed concern that BMW's newly implemented\r\nprohibition on exports would impede Euromotion's ability to\r\nobtain BMW's cars.  In response, Ciontea gave Kirigin (and\r\nthrough him, Fields BMW) the \"green light\" to sell cars and\r\nother paraphernalia to Euromotion.  According to Euromotion,\r\nBMW encouraged it to develop the Puerto Rican market and to\r\nkeep its inventories high.  BMW also told Euromotion's\r\npresident not to worry about the lack of a written dealer\r\napplication packet because \"everything would be put [i]n black\r\nand white\" eventually.\r\n         Euromotion contends that the 1993 meeting established\r\na dealer relationship with BMW.  After the meeting, Euromotion\r\nsold only BMW's cars and attempted to develop the Puerto Rican\r\nmarket for such cars.  Euromotion obtained these cars from\r\nFields BMW in Florida at a wholesale price.  Although it is\r\nclear from the record that BMW did not have the authority to\r\nimpose any terms or conditions on Fields BMW regarding its sale\r\nof automobiles to Euromotion, and although these sales were\r\nnegotiated between Fields BMW and Euromotion, Fields BMW would\r\nhave charged Euromotion a higher price if the 1993 meeting had\r\nnot taken place.  Euromotion also obtained brochures, T-shirts,\r\nand other BMW-related advertising materials from Fields BMW. \r\nFurther, the BMW-authorized service representative in Puerto\r\nRico gave full warranty service to cars sold by Euromotion.\r\n         The parties agree that Euromotion never bought a car\r\ndirectly from BMW, never placed a purchase order with BMW,\r\nnever received any promotional material directly from BMW,\r\nnever consulted or negotiated directly with BMW the prices or\r\nterms of its sales relationships with any of BMW's independent\r\ndealers, and never saw a copy of BMW's dealership agreement.\r\n         On December 13, 1993, Soltero acknowledged in a\r\nletter written to BMW that BMW had \"a lot of candidates for the\r\n[BMW dealership] franchise . . . [that] I understand you have\r\nto evaluate.\"  Soltero expressed the \"hope that before [BMW\r\npicked its] candidate [it] should come to Puerto Rico and give\r\n[Euromotion] a chance to show our business, meet our great\r\nstaff and finally demonstrate why we are the best choice to\r\nproudly represent the BMW franchise in Puerto Rico.\"  Soltero\r\nalso asked BMW to \"always remember that [Euromotion] already\r\ncontrol[s] the BMW market and everybody recognize[s] us as the\r\nBMW dealer in Puerto Rico.\"\r\n         On June 22, 1995, BMW announced in the Puerto Rican\r\npapers that it had chosen a company called \"Autogermana\" to\r\nserve as the exclusive BMW dealer for Puerto Rico.  Sometime\r\nafter Autogermana was appointed as BMW's authorized dealer in\r\nPuerto Rico, Fields BMW ceased to give Euromotion the benefit\r\nof advantageous prices and business terms.\r\n         On June 25, 1996, Euromotion filed the present action\r\nalleging that BMW had violated Law 75 and the duty of good\r\nfaith and fair dealing imposed by Article 1802 of the Puerto\r\nRican Civil Code.  Thereafter, Euromotion filed a motion for\r\npreliminary injunctive relief under Law 75, which the court\r\ndenied after discovery and a hearing.  On October 24, 1996, BMW\r\nfiled a motion for summary judgment on both of Euromotion's\r\nclaims.\r\n         On May 21, 1997, the district court allowed BMW's\r\nsummary judgment motion.  On the Law 75 claim, the district\r\ncourt found that Soltero's letter of December 13, 1993, wherein\r\nhe acknowledged that there were many contenders for BMW to\r\nevaluate for a possible Puerto Rican dealership, established\r\nconclusively that an actual dealer relationship did not then\r\nexist as a result of the prior meeting between Ciontea and\r\nSoltero.  On the good faith claim, the court found that none of\r\nthe interactions between BMW and Euromotion constituted\r\nnegotiations.  Since no negotiations took place, the court\r\nreasoned that BMW was not under a duty to negotiate in good\r\nfaith.  The court did not address BMW's statute-of-limitations\r\ndefense.  On May 22, 1997, the court dismissed the case with\r\nprejudice.  Euromotion has appealed.  We affirm.\r\n                   II.

Law\r\n75 defines a dealer as a \"person actually interested in a\r\ndealer's contract.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278(a).  A\r\n\"dealer's contract\" includes any business relationship\r\n    established between a dealer and a principal or grantor\r\n    whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the\r\n    parties may call, characterize or execute such\r\n    relationship, the former actually and effectively takes\r\n    charge of the distribution of a merchandise, or the\r\n    rendering of a service, by concession or franchise, on the\r\n    market of Puerto Rico.\r\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278(b).\r\n         Euromotion argues that it succeeded in raising an\r\nissue of material fact regarding whether the 1993 meeting\r\ncreated a dealer-principal relationship.  Euromotion analogizes\r\nits relationship with BMW (through Fields BMW) to the dealer\r\nrelationship in a case decided by the Puerto Rican Supreme\r\nCourt, J. Soler Motors, Inc. v. Kaiser Jeep International\r\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 D.P.R. 134 (1978).  In J.\r\nSoler Motors, the defendant appointed the plaintiff as its\r\ndealer in Puerto Rico, then assigned the dealership contract to\r\nits general distributor in the area.  See id. at 141.  This\r\nmeant that the dealer had to place orders for cars and parts\r\nthrough the general distributor.  See id.  Despite the presence\r\nof this intermediary, the court applied Law 75 to cover the\r\ndealer.  See id. at 145.\r\n         We are not persuaded.  In J. Soler Motors, the\r\nplaintiff had signed a dealership contract setting out detailed\r\nterms to govern its business relationship with the defendant. \r\nNo such evidence appears in the present case.  Euromotion\r\nadmits that it never even saw the standard dealership agreement\r\nroutinely used by BMW much less became a party to such a\r\ncontract.\r\n         Perhaps sensing the weakness in its argument,\r\nEuromotion notes that we have defined the necessary dealer\r\nrelationship for Law 75 purposes quite generously.  We have\r\nheld that a party still in the process of negotiating the final\r\nterms of a dealer's contract may fall under the protective\r\naegis of Law 75 where, for some time, it had been acting de\r\nfacto as a dealer.  See Welch, 13 F.3d at 486.\r\n         But Welch was an altogether different case.  The\r\ndefendant in Welch had written to the plaintiff stating that it\r\nhad \"reached a decision to continue the frozen food\r\ndistribution . . . in Puerto Rico by transferring [its] account\r\nto [the plaintiff].\"  Id. at 480.  In that same letter, the\r\ndefendant agreed to \"draft an agreement\" that would establish\r\nthe plaintiff as an authorized dealer.  Id.  Shortly\r\nafterwards, while still in the process of negotiating the terms\r\nof a written dealership agreement, the parties began doing\r\nbusiness directly with one another as if a dealer relationship\r\nhad already been formalized.\r\n         The defendant in Welch conceded that the plaintiff\r\nwas \"performing the functions of a distributor within the\r\nmeaning of Law 75.\"  Id. at 482.  In the circumstances, we\r\nstated that Law 75 \"clearly incorporates within its reach any\r\narrangement between a supplier and dealer in which the dealer\r\nis actually in the process of distributing the suppliers'\r\nmerchandise in Puerto Rico.\"  Id. at 482-83.\r\n         Focusing only on the last statement quoted above,\r\nEuromotion argues that whenever \"parties are dealing, a\r\ndealership exists for purposes of the Act,\" quoting Welch, 13\r\nF.3d at 484.  We made that statement, however, in a context\r\nvery different from that at bar.  First, Euromotion never\r\nreached the point here of becoming engaged in negotiations with\r\nBMW regarding the terms of an actual dealership contract. \r\nSecond, there is no substantial evidence that BMW ever\r\ndesignated Euromotion, even informally, to act as its\r\nauthorized dealer as distinct from continuing to sell BMW cars\r\nindependently.  Third, the parties in Welch directly dealt with\r\none another for over a year in the manner of a de facto\r\ndealership arrangement.  Although the lack of direct dealings\r\nmay not always be determinative, see J. Soler Motors, 8 P.R.\r\nOffic. Trans. at 145, direct business relations as in Welch can\r\nprovide evidence of a dealer relationship.  Fourth,\r\nEuromotion's president wrote a letter to BMW after the dealer\r\nrelationship was supposedly established in which he\r\nacknowledged that BMW had \"a lot of candidates for the [BMW\r\ndealership] franchise . . . [that] I understand you have to\r\nevaluate.\"  This letter is clearly inconsistent with\r\nEuromotion's position that it had an understanding with BMW\r\nthat it was BMW's authorized dealer.  Welch, therefore, is in\r\nno sense dispositive.\r\n         Euromotion also argues that Law 75 allows recovery by\r\nany dealer, such as itself, who \"invest[s] time, effort, and\r\nexpense in the development of a market, . . . even where\r\ncertain other trappings of the typical dealership [are]\r\nmissing.\"  Sudouest Import Sales Corp., 732 F.2d at 16\r\n(citation omitted).  However, unilateral efforts to sell a\r\nproduct and develop a market are not sufficient, alone, to\r\ncreate a dealer relationship within the purview of Law 75.  SeeLneas Areas Costarricenses v. Caribbean Gen., Inc., 682 F.\r\nSupp. 117, 121 (D.P.R. 1988) (collecting cases).\r\n         It is true that there is evidence that BMW encouraged\r\nits independent dealer in Florida, Fields BMW, to continue its\r\nfavorable business relationship with Euromotion.  At that time,\r\nBMW may well have been pleased, and so expressed itself, by\r\nEuromotion's efforts to sell BMW automobiles in Puerto Rico. \r\nHowever, BMW's encouragement of Euromotion to proceed at that\r\ntime as an independent seller of BMW automobiles could not\r\ncreate a dealer relationship.\r\n         On this record, the only conclusion a reasonable fact\r\nfinder could reach is that Euromotion did not have a dealer\r\nrelationship within Law 75 with BMW.  The absence of such a\r\nrelationship is fatal to its claim.  See Welch, 13 F.3d at 483\r\n(declaring that Law 75 \"insists upon establishment of a\r\n'supplier/dealer' relationship\").  Accordingly, the district\r\ncourt correctly dismissed Euromotion's Law 75 claim.\r\nB.  Duty to Negotiate in Good Faith.\r\n         The Puerto Rican Supreme Court has held that,\r\nalthough parties generally may withdraw from negotiations at\r\nany time prior to forming a contract, parties once engaged in\r\na negotiation process have a duty to proceed in good faith.   \r\nSee Producciones Tommy Muiz, Inc. v. COPAN, 13 P.R. Offic.\r\nTrans. 660, 676, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982).  Euromotion charges\r\nthat BMW violated that duty.  The district court did not\r\nexplore the question whether BMW had terminated negotiations\r\nwith Euromotion in bad faith because it found that Euromotion\r\nhad failed to demonstrate that Euromotion and BMW ever reached\r\nthe point of becoming involved in contract negotiations.  \r\n         Euromotion asserts that it is \"indisputable\" in light\r\nof the evidence that the court, in reaching its conclusion,\r\nimproperly weighed the credibility of the witnesses.  Since our\r\nreview is de novo, see Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 115, we need\r\nnot consider whether the specific reasoning set out by the\r\ndistrict court contained errors.  Rather, we ask whether the\r\nevidence presented by Euromotion was adequate to establish that\r\nnegotiations sufficient to be regarded as such ever took place\r\nbetween the parties.  Cf. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322\r\n(stating that, in order to avoid a properly supported motion\r\nfor summary judgment, a nonmoving party must make a \"showing\r\nsufficient to establish the existence of an element essential\r\nto that party's case, and on which that party will bear the\r\nburden of proof at trial\").  We find Euromotion's evidence\r\ninsufficient to establish that a course of negotiations looking\r\nto the creation of a dealer's contract ever occurred.  We\r\ntherefore affirm the district court.\r\n         According to Euromotion, the following facts\r\nconstituted negotiations between itself and BMW.  First,\r\nEuromotion's president was interviewed by BMW, along with other\r\ncandidates, to determine whether to select Euromotion for the\r\nposition of dealer.  Second, BMW encouraged Euromotion in 1993\r\nto continue to sell BMW automobiles, as it was then doing, and\r\ndevelop a market in Puerto Rico.  Third, BMW urged Fields BMW\r\nat that time to aid Euromotion in developing the Puerto Rican\r\nmarket, as it had been doing for a while.  Fourth, because\r\nEuromotion's president believed that Euromotion was being\r\nconsidered as a candidate for the Puerto Rican dealership,\r\nEuromotion took action to create a larger market for BMW's cars\r\nin Puerto Rico.  Fifth, Euromotion kept BMW informed of its\r\nprogress.\r\n         None of the above, in our view, were negotiations\r\nsuch as might trigger the duty of good faith in the Puerto\r\nRican Civil Code.  Rather they were preliminary activities and\r\ndealings reflecting, among other things, a modicum of initial\r\ninterest by BMW in Euromotion's activities as an independent\r\nsalesman of BMW vehicles, and also reflecting Euromotion's\r\nintense but unsuccessful efforts to become a finalist for the\r\ndealership position.  While BMW encouraged Euromotion to\r\nproceed with its independent sales of BMW cars and interviewed\r\nEuromotion's president along with others, BMW never selected\r\nEuromotion as someone with whom it intended to negotiate a\r\ndealership contract.  And, in fact, no contract negotiations\r\never took place.  None of the interactions between the parties\r\naddressed the concerns that parties looking to form a dealer\r\nrelationship would address.  BMW and Euromotion did not discuss\r\ninventory requirements, sales goals, promotional allowances,\r\nshowroom standards, trademark use, minimum service facilities,\r\nwarranty conditions, payment and credit arrangements, letters\r\nof credit, or personnel and staffing requirements.  Further,\r\nthe record establishes that Euromotion never submitted the\r\nrequired dealer application to BMW and never saw the BMW\r\nauthorized dealer standard agreement.  Lastly, Euromotion's\r\nletter to BMW in December of 1993 confirms that Euromotion\r\nunderstood itself to be just one candidate among several.  The\r\ndistrict court concluded that: \"None of this [evidence\r\npresented by Euromotion] constitutes contract 'negotiations' by\r\nany stretch of the imagination.\"  We agree.  \r\n         It is true, of course, that \"when the facts support\r\nplausible but conflicting inferences on a pivotal issue in the\r\ncase, the judge may not choose between those inferences at the\r\nsummary judgment stage.\"  Coyne v. Taber Partners I, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695146\"><a href=\"/opinion/695146/john-p-coyne-v-taber-partners-i-dba-ambassador-plaza-hotel-casino/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1st Cir. 1995); see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249\r\n(noting that a judge should not weigh the evidence when\r\nconsidering a motion for summary judgment).  Still, a court\r\nshould not indulge a nonmoving party's inferences if they do\r\nnot \"flow rationally from the underlying facts.\"  Rubinovitz v.\r\nRogato, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196213\"><a href=\"/opinion/196213/rubinovitz-v-rogato/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 911 (1st Cir. 1995).  On the facts of this\r\ncase viewed in the light most favorable to Euromotion, no\r\nreasonable fact finder could conclude that BMW entered into\r\nnegotiations with Euromotion concerning the formation of a\r\ndealership contract.  It follows that BMW's refusal, for\r\nwhatever reason, to talk further with Euromotion could not\r\namount to a breach of Puerto Rico's doctrine requiring parties\r\nwho enter into contract negotiations to proceed in good faith. \r\nWe hold that summary judgment was appropriate on Euromotion's\r\ngood faith claim.\r\n         Affirmed.\n</pre>",
