Daniel R. Dominguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nEdward E. Parson on brief for appellant.\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, and Jose A. Quiles-Espinosa, Senior Litigation\r\nCounsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       March 17, 1998\r\n                                         \r\n             Per Curiam.  Defendant-appellant Carmelo Ramirez-Vega\r\nappeals from his sentence imposed following a guilty plea to\r\npossession with intent to distribute (with two co-defendants)\r\nof two kilograms of cocaine.  Appellant's sole issue on appeal\r\nis that the court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for\r\nhis supervisory role in the offense under Section 3B1.1(c) of\r\nthe United States Sentencing Guidelines.  He seeks to have his\r\nsentence vacated and remanded for a hearing on his role in the\r\noffense.\r\n         The guilty plea was entered pursuant to a plea\r\nagreement under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(B).  Appellant\r\nspecifically agreed that he \"had an aggravating role as a\r\nsupervisor within the meaning of the Guidelines Section\r\n3B1.1(c) and that, therefore, the base offense level shall be\r\nincreased by an additional TWO (2) levels.\"  At his sentencing\r\nhearing, appellant clearly stated that he did not wish to\r\nwithdraw his plea.  Nor does he attack the validity of the plea\r\non appeal.  Our careful review of the record reveals that there\r\nis ample support for the district court's finding that Ramirez\r\nhad a supervisory role within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \r\n3B1.1(c).\r\n         Under these circumstances, the district court did not\r\nerr in imposing a two-level enhancement for appellant's role in\r\nthe offense.  Contrary to appellant's contentions, the district\r\ncourt clearly set forth the reasons for imposing the\r\nenhancement:  1) the plea agreement under which the sentence\r\nwas imposed specifically provided for the enhancement and 2)\r\nthere was factual support for the finding that appellant's role\r\nwas supervisory.\r\n    The information contained in the Presentence Report\r\n(\"PSR\") supported a finding that Ramirez \"exercised control\r\nover, or was otherwise responsible for organizing the\r\nactivities of, at least one other individual in committing the\r\ncrime.\"  United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).  The PSR provided that Ramirez \"was accompanied by\r\n[Acevedo] on more than one of the former's drug negotiations.\" \r\nPSR, p. 6.  It further reported that \r\n    [a]ccording to the Assistant U.S. Attorney, [co-\r\n    defendant Acevedo] was the one who either helped\r\n    carry the cocaine, gave same to the buyer, and on\r\n    other occasions, delivered or accepted payments for\r\n    [Ramirez].  He had no decision making authority, nor\r\n    was he knowledgeable as to the details of the\r\n    negotiations or transactions.\r\n\nPSR, p. 7.  The PSR noted that Ramirez was \"described as a\r\nleader.\"  Ramirez was often accompanied by Acevedo, but the\r\nlatter \"exercised no role other than that of helper.\" PSR, p.\r\n7.  \"[F]actual averments contained in the PSI Report usually\r\nare deemed reliable enough to be used for sentencing purposes.\" \r\nUnited States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    The district court did not err in relying -- in part --\r\nupon information from a co-defendant's guilty plea and\r\nsentencing hearings, where appellant had the opportunity to\r\nrespond to that information before his sentence was imposed. \r\nCompare United States v. Berzon, 941 F.2d 8, 21 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).  Nor, under these circumstances, did the court abuse its\r\nwide discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing to\r\nconsider statements that appellant indicated would be provided\r\nby his co-defendants regarding his role in the offense.  \"[T]he\r\ndecision to hold an evidentiary hearing at the time of\r\nsentencing or, alternatively, to eschew such a hearing, lies\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the sentencing court.\"  United\r\nStates v. Robles-Torres, 109 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n         Appellant's conviction and sentence are summarily\r\naffirmed. See Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
