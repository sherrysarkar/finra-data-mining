Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Ramon Torres-Gonzalez on brief pro se.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Miguel A. Fernandez,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Jose Javier Santos Mimoso,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 28, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  The district court, adopting the\r\nrecommendation of the magistrate-judge, dismissed this Bivens\r\naction on the ground that it was barred by the applicable\r\nstatute of limitations.  On appeal, plaintiff attempts to\r\nrevise his equitable-tolling argument--contending that he did\r\nnot learn of the alleged improprieties surrounding his removal\r\nfrom Venezuela until February 1998 (rather than August 1996, as\r\nhe alleged below).  This argument, having been advanced for the\r\nfirst time on appeal, has been waived.  See, e.g., Malave v.\r\nCarney Hosp., 170 F.3d 217, 222 (1st Cir. 1999).  It would fail\r\nin any event, particularly given that plaintiff voiced similar\r\nfactual allegations as far back as November 1995 in connection\r\nwith his request for habeas relief.  For these reasons, as well\r\nas those enumerated below, the judgment is summarily affirmed.\r\n          Defendants, noting that service of process was never\r\neffected below, suggest that this court's jurisdiction is\r\ntherefore lacking.  This argument overlooks the fact that the\r\ncomplaint here was screened, and the sua sponte dismissal\r\nentered, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1915A.  This provision \"does\r\nnot require that process be served.\"  Carr v. Dvorin, 171 F.3d\r\n115, 116 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam).  Appellate jurisdiction\r\nis thus unaffected by the lack of service.\r\n          The motions to strike are denied, the motion to\r\nclarify is allowed, and the judgment is summarily affirmed. \r\nSee Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
