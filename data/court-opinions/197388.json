Millipore Corporation  was one  of the  sources of\r\n\nwaste  at the sites, and  was a defendant  in several actions\r\n\nalleging violations  of federal and state environmental laws.\r\n\nMillipore defended  these suits and incurred  liability as to\r\n\nsome  of the  sites.   It may  ultimately be  responsible for\r\n\ncontributing  to the remediation costs of  the other sites as\r\n\nwell.\r\n\n          The  primary issue  here  is whether  the  district\r\n\ncourt  erred in  entering summary  judgment for  the insurers\r\n\n(and then denying reconsideration) on the ground that none of\r\n\nMillipore's  CERCLA liability  is  covered under  any of  the\r\n\ncomprehensive  general  liability (\"CGL\")  policies Millipore\r\n\ncarried  during the  relevant periods.   In  considering this\r\n\nquestion, we must address, among other things, the \"pollution\r\n\nexclusion\"  provisions  of   the  insurance  policies,  which\r\n\npreclude  coverage  for pollution-related  claims  unless the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nrelease of pollutants was \"sudden and  accidental.\"  Based on\r\n\nrecent developments in Massachusetts  environmental insurance\r\n\nlaw, we vacate in part the grant of summary judgment.\r\n\n          We  also conclude  that New  Jersey law  applies to\r\n\nclaims  under policies  issued  to a  New Jersey  corporation\r\n\nlater acquired  by Millipore,  and that summary  judgment was\r\n\nproperly  entered in  favor of  one of  Millipore's insurers,\r\n\nTravelers  Indemnity  Company,  because  Millipore  failed to\r\n\nproduce evidence of an occurrence within the Travelers policy\r\n\nperiod.    Finally, we  hold that  Millipore was  entitled to\r\n\nsummary  judgment   on   the  insurers'   counterclaims   for\r\n\nreimbursement for defense costs paid to Millipore.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          The insurance coverage issues involved in this case\r\n\nare best understood in context.  CERCLA, which was enacted in\r\n\n1980, is  the  primary federal  statutory  scheme  regulating\r\n\nhazardous waste cleanups.  Some states have enacted their own\r\n\nregimes as well.   CERCLA imposes liability for the  costs of\r\n\ncleaning up hazardous waste sites and for the loss of natural\r\n\nresources due to pollution on three categories of potentially\r\n\nresponsible  parties (\"PRPs\"):  past and  present owners  and\r\n\noperators  of  hazardous  waste  sites, some  companies  that\r\n\ntransported   waste  to  these   sites,  and  companies  that\r\n\ngenerated waste  disposed  of  at  these sites.    42  U.S.C.\r\n\n  9607(a).

It is,  in general, a  strict liability\r\n\nregime.    St. Paul Fire &amp;  Marine Ins. Co. v.

The  CERCLA\r                 \r\n\ncost allocation  scheme may operate retroactively  as well: a\r\n\nPRP may be held  responsible for actions taken  before CERCLA\r\n\nwas enacted and  before the  PRP was aware  that its  actions\r\n\nmight lead to  environmental liability.

CERCLA allows joint  and several liability  when\r\n\nspecific  damage cannot  be  attributed  to particular  PRPs,\r\n\nwhich is often the case at  hazardous waste sites.

The provision in general use from 1970 until\r\n\n1985 excludes coverage for:\r\n\n          bodily injury or property  damage arising\r\n          out of the discharge,  dispersal, release\r\n          or escape of  smoke, vapors, soot, fumes,\r\n          acids, alkalis,  toxic chemicals, liquids\r\n          or  gases,  waste   materials  or   other\r\n          irritants,  contaminants   or  pollutants\r\n          into or upon land, the atmosphere or  any\r\n          water course or body of water . . . .\r\n\nNote, supra, at 167.  However, the pollution exclusion clause\r                       \r\n\ngenerally  \"does  not  apply  if  such discharge,  dispersal,\r\n\nrelease or escape is sudden or accidental.\"  Id.2\r                                                            \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Beginning  in  1970, the  pollution exclusion  clause was\r\nincluded in CGL  policies as a mandatory  endorsement, and in\r\n1973,  the clause was inserted  into the body  of the policy.\r\nId.   In  1986,  the  insurance industry  replaced  the  1970\r              \r\npollution  exclusion  clause  with  an   \"absolute  pollution\r\nexclusion.\"  Jerry, supra,   65, at 468.\r                                     \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Based  on  the  language  of  their  CGL  policies,\r\n\ninsurers  developed  a  three-step  process  for  determining\r\n\nwhether  environmental liability  was  covered: \"(1)  did  an\r\n\n'occurrence' occur? . . .  If  so,  (2)  does  the  pollution\r\n\nexclusion apply, i.e., was the injury or damage caused by one\r\n\nof the named  materials in  connection with one  of the  four\r\n\nevents ('discharge,' etc.) in the exclusion? . . . If so, (3)\r\n\ndoes the  exception  to the  exclusion apply,  i.e., was  the\r\n\nevent 'sudden  and accidental'?\"  Jerry, supra,   65, at 463-\r                                                          \r\n\n64.   The insurers often  argued that claims  based on CERCLA\r\n\nliability were  precluded from coverage due  to the pollution\r\n\nexclusion clause.3  As a result, the meaning of the exception\r\n\nto the  pollution clause, and particularly  the definition of\r\n\nthe term \"sudden and accidental,\" has been hotly contested.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Against this backdrop, the facts are recited in the\r\n\nlight  most favorable  to Millipore,  the party  against whom\r\n\nsummary judgment  was granted.  Soileau v. Guilford of Maine,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 105 F.3d 12, 13 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Commentators  have  suggested  that  insurers  were  ill-\r\nequipped  to deal with claims based on CERCLA liability.  The\r\ninsurance industry did not  foresee the enactment of CERCLA's\r\nretroactive  strict  liability regime;  accordingly, insurers\r\ndid not  allocate  financial  resources  for  CERCLA  claims.\r\nNote, supra, at 174-75.  The problem, however, was not merely\r                       \r\nCERCLA's retroactivity.   The risk of  liability under CERCLA\r\nis difficult to ascertain because environmental  damage often\r\ndoes not  become evident until many years  after the end of a\r\npolicy  period.

Millipore has its\r\n\ncorporate headquarters as well as a manufacturing facility in\r\n\nBedford,    Massachusetts,     with    other    Massachusetts\r\n\nmanufacturing facilities  in Milford and Taunton.   Millipore\r\n\ndisposed  of its  manufacturing wastes  at several  different\r\n\nsites   in  Massachusetts,   including  the   Silresim  Waste\r\n\nReclamation and  Disposal  Facility in  Lowell,  the  Charles\r\n\nGeorge  Landfill   in  Tyngsboro,  and   the  Re-Solve  Waste\r\n\nReclamation and Disposal Facility in North Dartmouth.\r\n\n          Between  December 1975  and  March 1982,  Millipore\r\n\nowned  the  Worthington Biochemical  Corporation,  located in\r\n\nFreehold,  New Jersey,  which produced  research enzymes  and\r\n\nrelated  chemicals.   The  Worthington manufacturing  process\r\n\ninvolved   the  use  of   substances  defined  as  hazardous,\r\n\nincluding trichloroethylene and freons.  Worthington disposed\r\n\nof much of  its waste materials at the  Lone Pine Landfill in\r\n\nFreehold.\r\n\n          All  four  of  these   sites  where  Millipore  and\r\n\nWorthington  disposed  of  their  wastes have  a  history  of\r\n\ncontaminating  neighboring  land and  water.   These troubled\r\n\nsites  share numerous similarities  involving poor design and\r\n\nsloppy operations.   At  the Silresim site,  chemicals dumped\r\n\ninto the  disposal pit regularly seeped  through the concrete\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nlining of the pit into the ground.  In 1973, the Commonwealth\r\n\nof Massachusetts required the operators of the site to find a\r\n\nsolution to the problem of contaminated runoff.  The landfill\r\n\noperators  failed  to  do  so, and  also  committed  numerous\r\n\nviolations of state  regulations between 1973 and  1975.  The\r\n\nCommonwealth  made   continued  operation  of   the  facility\r\n\ncontingent upon  regulatory compliance.  The  operators filed\r\n\nfor bankruptcy, leading to  the revocation of their operating\r\n\npermit in 1977.   They  abandoned the site  later that  year.\r\n\nRaging chemical fires swept the site  in October 1977, August\r\n\n1978, and again in April 1983.\r\n\n          In 1983,  Millipore received notification  from the\r\n\nEPA that  it was  a PRP  with respect to  the Silresim  site.\r\n\nLater that year, in December, Massachusetts initiated a legal\r\n\naction  in  federal  court  under CERCLA  and  various  state\r\n\nenvironmental laws.  See  Commonwealth v. Pace, No. 83-3883-G\r                                                          \r\n\n(complaint filed in District of Massachusetts).  It sought to\r\n\nrecover cleanup costs from  more than 200 companies that  had\r\n\nused  the  Silresim  site,  including  Millipore  and  Waters\r\n\nAssociates,  which  Millipore  had  purchased in  1980.    In\r\n\nDecember 1983, Millipore was  also named as a defendant  in a\r\n\nsimilar  case  brought by  the  federal  government.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  General  Chem. Corp.,  No.  92-10923-T  (complaint\r                                           \r\n\nfiled  in District  of  Massachusetts).   Shortly thereafter,\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nMillipore  and others  paid  the Commonwealth  $2 million  in\r\n\nsettlement,andenteredinto aconsentdecreeinthe federalaction.4\r\n\n          The operators  of the Charles  George Landfill also\r\n\ncommitted   numerous   infractions  of   state  environmental\r\n\nregulations.  During inspections of  the landfill in 1971 and\r\n\n1975,  the Commonwealth  discovered leachate5  emanating from\r\n\nthe landfill.   By September 1976,  leachate had contaminated\r\n\nthree of the  four groundwater  basins at the  site, and  the\r\n\nsurrounding  wetlands  were  polluted  by  runoff   from  the\r\n\nfacility.  The  situation was exacerbated  when, on June  12,\r\n\n1980, a  fire broke out and burned until July 9.  Millions of\r\n\ngallons of water were poured  onto the landfill to extinguish\r\n\nthe  fire, generating  toxic leachate  and causing  the water\r\n\ntable to  rise temporarily.   In June 1983,  the Commonwealth\r\n\nfiled  suit in state court to  bring landfill operations into\r\n\ncompliance  with  state law.    The  landfill was  ultimately\r\n\nclosed by court order later in 1983.\r\n\n          The  United  States   and  the  Commonwealth  filed\r\n\nseparate suits  in 1985  against the Charles  George Trucking\r\n\nCompany,  an owner-operator of the landfill, and others.

Indeed, one of the two cases recently  decided\r\nby  the Supreme  Judicial Court clarifying  the scope  of the\r\npollution  exclusion  under  Massachusetts law  involved  the\r\nSilresim site.  See Nashua Corp. v. First State Ins. Co., 648\r                                                                    \r\nN.E.2d 1272 (Mass. 1995).  The case is discussed below.\r\n\n5.  Leachate  consists of  liquid  byproducts of  the natural\r\ndecomposition process of trash in a landfill environment.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ncomplaints alleged violation of  CERCLA and other federal and\r\n\nstate laws, and  sought, among other things, past  and future\r\n\ncosts of cleaning up the landfill.  In 1986, the EPA notified\r\n\nMillipore  that  it was  a PRP  with  respect to  the Charles\r\n\nGeorge site, and in  1989 Millipore was added as  a defendant\r\n\nin two  consolidated cases  in the District  of Massachusetts\r\n\nentitled United  States v.  Charles George Trucking  Co., No.\r                                                                    \r\n\n85-2463-WD, and Commonwealth v.

A  consent decree was ultimately entered  into,\r\n\nand was upheld  in United States  v. Charles George  Trucking\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo., 34 F.3d 1081 (1st Cir. 1994).6\r               \r\n\n          The Re-Solve site operated  as a waste  reclamation\r\n\nfacility from 1956 to 1980 and handled a variety of hazardous\r\n\nsubstances.   In October  1958, an explosive  blaze destroyed\r\n\nmuch  of the facility.  It eventually re-opened, but from the\r\n\nearly    1970's   on,   the   Massachusetts   Department   of\r\n\nEnvironmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) (now  the Department\r\n\nof  Environmental   Protection)  was  actively   involved  in\r\n\nmonitoring  the  site.   The  EPA  also  eventually began  an\r\n\ninvestigation.    The  site   was  a  significant  source  of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The Charles George site has been at the center of a great\r\ndeal of  environmental litigation, both in  federal and state\r\ncourt.   See, e.g., United States v.  Charles George Trucking\r                                                                         \r\nCo., 823 F.2d  685 (1st  Cir. 1987); Hussey  Plastics Co.  v.\r                                                                     \r\nContinental  Cas.

The sides of the  waste lagoons at the site were\r\n\nnot effectively sealed, which allowed pollutants to seep out.\r\n\nIn addition,  rain routinely  caused the lagoons  to overflow\r\n\ninto the neighboring  wetlands.  Millipore  was named a  PRP,\r\n\nand  the United States filed  a CERCLA action  to recover the\r\n\ncosts  of cleaning up the site, naming as defendants some 225\r\n\ncompanies, including  Millipore, which had sent  waste to the\r\n\nfacility.  In 1988, Millipore entered into a consent decree.7\r\n\n          At  the  Lone Pine  Landfill  in  New Jersey,  rain\r\n\nregularly caused  contaminated runoff to  drain directly into\r\n\nthe  nearby  Marasquan River.    Toxic  waste  was buried  in\r\n\nunlined  pits,  which  allowed seepage  into  the surrounding\r\n\nsoil.   In  addition,  decomposing  garbage routinely  caused\r\n\nfires  and even  explosions.   After  a particularly  harmful\r\n\nchemical  fire  in 1978,  New Jersey  environmental officials\r\n\nissued an administrative order to mitigate the damage.  After\r\n\nnon-compliance  with  the  order,  the  landfill  was ordered\r\n\nclosed the  following year.   Millipore and  Worthington were\r\n\neach designated as a  PRP, in 1985 and 1990 respectively.  In\r\n\n1989, Millipore  and the  EPA entered into  a consent  decree\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.

Aerovox is\r                                                                      \r\ndiscussed later in this opinion.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ninvolving on-site remediation, and in 1991, Millipore and the\r\n\nEPA entered  into a second consent  decree involving off-site\r\n\nremediation.\r\n\n          There  were  also  environmental  problems  at  the\r\n\nWorthington  plant itself.  In  1976 or 1977,  a freeze drier\r\n\nline at the plant  ruptured, causing no more than  60 gallons\r\n\nof trichloroethylene to be released into drains leading to an\r\n\non-site  wastewater  treatment  facility.   From  there,  the\r\n\ntrichloroethylene evidently  made its  way into the  soil and\r\n\ngroundwater and migrated off site.\r\n\n          Millipore sold Worthington's assets in 1982 to Flow\r\n\nGeneral, which in 1983 sold  the assets to Cooper BioMedical,\r\n\nInc.   In 1986, Cooper performed  an environmental assessment\r\n\nwhich disclosed trichloroethylene contamination.  Cooper took\r\n\nremedial  measures, and  in 1990  instituted a  CERCLA action\r\n\nagainst Millipore, seeking reimbursement for costs associated\r\n\nwith the cleanup.\r\n\n          As   to  each  of  these  sites,  Millipore  sought\r\n\ncoverage under its CGL policies and  those of Worthington and\r\n\nWaters, two potentially liable subsidiaries.  Where, as here,\r\n\nCERCLA liability  arises out of  a PRP's operations  over the\r\n\ncourse of  many years, it often  implicates general liability\r\n\npolicies issued  by several  different insurers.   Ostrager &amp;\r\n\nNewman, supra,     10.01,  at  404.   A  Travelers  Indemnity\r                         \r\n\nCompany policy issued  to Millipore covered  damage occurring\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nbetween  April 1975 and July  1976.  A  Hartford Accident and\r\n\nIndemnity  Company policy issued  to Millipore covered damage\r\n\noccurring  between July  1976 and  May 1977.   Hartford  also\r\n\nissued a general liability policy covering the period between\r\n\nAugust  1974   and  May   1977  to  Worthington   Biochemical\r\n\nCorporation; Millipore  purchased Worthington  in 1975.   And\r\n\nHartford issued two one-year  liability policies covering the\r\n\nperiod  between  January  1975  and January  1977  to  Waters\r\n\nAssociates, a Massachusetts company purchased by Millipore in\r\n\n1980.   Finally, Insurance Company of  North America (\"INA\")8\r\n\nissued eight general liability policies to Millipore covering\r\n\nthe period between May 1977 and January 1986.\r\n\n          The  Hartford  and   INA  policies  contained   the\r\n\nstandard pollution clause, quoted above,  generally contained\r\n\nin CGL  policies between 1970 and 1985.   The language of the\r\n\npollution exclusion  provision  in the  Travelers  policy  is\r\n\nsomewhat  different  in  ways  we need  not  address  at this\r\n\njuncture.9\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Century Indemnity is  the successor to  INA, but in  this\r\nopinion we refer to the company as INA.\r\n\n9.  The Travelers  policy states that the  insurance does not\r\napply:\r\n\n          to bodily injury or  property damage arising out of\r                                                          \r\n          any emission, discharge, seepage, release or escape\r\n          of any  liquid, solid, gaseous or  thermal waste or\r\n          pollutant\r\n\n               (i)  if  such  emission,  discharge,  seepage,\r\n               release   or  escape  is  either  expected  or\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          Millipore sent notice to the insurers regarding the\r\n\nSilresim site in 1983, the Re-Solve site in 1984, the Charles\r\n\nGeorge and  Lone Pine sites in  1989, and the Cooper  site in\r\n\n1990.     The  insurers   responded  that  they   planned  to\r\n\ninvestigate whether Millipore's claims were covered under its\r\n\nCGL policies.  In September 1990, INA acknowledged receipt of\r\n\nMillipore's notice of loss  for the Cooper facility (formerly\r\n\nthe Worthington  plant)  and paid  Millipore a  share of  the\r\n\ndefense costs  in  the underlying  litigation, but  expressly\r\n\nreserved all rights  under the policy.10   Millipore and  its\r\n\ninsurers then  disagreed about payment of  the costs incurred\r\n\nby Millipore  in litigating  the underlying action  involving\r\n\nthe Charles  George site.   After lengthy  negotiations, they\r\n\nentered  into an  interim  agreement in  January 1993,  under\r\n\nwhich  the insurers would pay the  defense costs but reserved\r\n\nthe right to  seek reimbursement if  it was later  determined\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n               intended from the standpoint of any insured or\r                                                                      \r\n               any person or organization  for whose acts  or\r\n               omissions any insured is liable, or\r                                                \r\n\n               (ii) resulting  from or contributed  to by any\r\n               condition  in  violation of  or non-compliance\r\n               with  any governmental rule, regulation or law\r\n               applicable thereto . . . .\r\n\n10.  INA forwarded $3,682 to  Millipore to pay for  its share\r\nof the  cost  of  defending  the suit  involving  the  Cooper\r\nfacility; the  payment was accompanied by  a letter reserving\r\nthe right to reimbursement.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nthat they had  no duty  to defend  or indemnify  Millipore.11\r\n\nApparently, the  insurers paid  no defense costs  relating to\r\n\nthe other three sites.\r\n\n          Millipore brought suit against the insurers in five\r\n\nseparate federal  court actions,  one for each  site, seeking\r\n\nthe  full   costs  of   defending  the   underlying  actions,\r\n\nindemnification for its liability, and damages for unfair and\r\n\ndeceptive insurance practices.  All three insurers were named\r\n\nas defendants in the cases involving the Silresim and Charles\r\n\nGeorge  sites.  INA and Hartford were the named defendants in\r\n\nthe cases involving the Lone Pine and Cooper sites, while INA\r\n\nwas  the only defendant named  in the case  involving the Re-\r\n\nSolve site.  Otherwise,  the pleadings in all five  cases are\r\n\nsubstantially identical.12\r\n\n          The insurers responded that the pollution exclusion\r\n\nprovisions  in the insurance  policies defeated  coverage and\r\n\ncounterclaimed for reimbursement of the defense costs already\r\n\npaid to  Millipore for the  Charles George and  Cooper sites.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  Under this agreement, INA sent $115,192.10  to Millipore\r\nfor  its share  of Millipore's  defense costs,  along  with a\r\nletter  reserving  the  right  to  reimbursement.    INA  had\r\npreviously sent $40,844.15   Travelers paid Millipore a total\r\nof $97,922.42  for defense  fees;  accompanying each  payment\r\nwere  letters  in which  Travelers specifically  reserved the\r\nright to seek reimbursement.\r\n\n12.    In  each  complaint,  Count  I  asks  for  declaratory\r\njudgment,  Count II asserts claims under Mass. Gen. Laws chs.\r\n93A and 176D, and Count III alleges breach of contract.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nThe cases were  consolidated before  Judge Rya  Zobel in  the\r\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.\r\n\n          In  April 1994,  following  the close  of extensive\r\n\ndiscovery, the insurers  moved for partial  summary judgment,\r\n\nseeking  dismissal  of  Millipore's  claims  for  declaratory\r\n\nrelief.   Judge Zobel granted  the insurers' motion  in March\r\n\n1995.    She first  rejected  Millipore's  argument that  New\r\n\nJersey substantive  law  should apply  to  the sites  in  New\r\n\nJersey.  She noted that \"[t]he Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\r\n\nCourt has articulated a  clear preference for the law  of one\r\n\nstate to interpret multistate comprehensive general liability\r\n\npolicies,\" and reasoned that,  \"[a]s the place of plaintiff's\r\n\nincorporation   and  its   principal   place   of   business,\r\n\nMassachusetts  has  the  most significant  interest  in  this\r\n\nlawsuit.\"\r\n\n          Judge Zobel also agreed with the insurers' argument\r\n\nthat the pollution exclusion  clauses preclude coverage.  She\r\n\nstated that \"a survey of the current caselaw suggests that it\r\n\nis the initial release, not subsequent leakage or damage from\r                          \r\n\nthat release which  determines the  issue.\"  She  went on  to\r\n\nconclude that  \"the initial  releases of pollutants  into the\r\n\nlandfills . . . do not fall within the meaning of 'sudden and\r\n\naccidental'  as defined in  the caselaw,\" because Millipore's\r\n\n\"waste disposal  practices were a routine  aspect of business\r\n\nactivity.\"   The case  subsequently was transferred  to Judge\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nGeorge O'Toole when  Judge Zobel became  head of the  Federal\r\n\nJudicial Center.\r\n\n          Millipore moved for reconsideration on May 5,  1995\r\n\nin light  of new Massachusetts caselaw.   On May 2, 1995, the\r\n\nSupreme  Judicial Court  handed  down Nashua  Corp. v.  First\r                                                                         \r\n\nState Insurance Co., 648 N.E.2d 1272 (Mass. 1995), construing\r                               \r\n\na pollution exclusion clause in a case involving an insurance\r\n\ndispute between another company that disposed of waste at the\r\n\nSilresim facility  and its  liability insurer.   Nashua Corp.\r                                                                         \r\n\nheld that,  notwithstanding the history  of routine polluting\r\n\nactivities by the operator of the Silresim site, the evidence\r\n\npresented  of a  fire  and subsequent  explosion at  Silresim\r\n\ndefeated the  insurer's motion for summary  judgment based on\r\n\nthe pollution exclusion.  Id. at 1275-76.  The court reasoned\r                                         \r\n\nthat the fire and explosion caused the sudden  and accidental\r\n\nrelease of pollutants into  the environment, thus placing the\r\n\nresulting  damage   into  the  exception   to  the  pollution\r\n\nexclusion clause.   Millipore argued  that the same  fire and\r\n\nexplosion at Silresim placed  its resulting CERCLA  liability\r\n\nwithin the exception to the exclusion as well.\r\n\n          The   district   court   denied  the   motion   for\r\n\nreconsideration in  November 1995.   Judge O'Toole  held that\r\n\nNashua  Corp. did  not  represent a  change in  Massachusetts\r                         \r\n\nsubstantive law  and therefore that  reconsideration was  not\r\n\nwarranted.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          The  insurers  then moved  for summary  judgment on\r\n\nMillipore's remaining  claims  and on  the counterclaims  for\r\n\nreimbursement for  Millipore's defense costs.   The  district\r\n\ncourt  dismissed  the  breach   of  contract  and  bad  faith\r\n\ninsurance practices claims.13\r\n\n          However,  the  district  court  ruled  against  the\r\n\ninsurers on their counterclaims, granting summary judgment in\r\n\nfavor  of Millipore, on the theory that the insurers' duty to\r\n\ndefend is more expansive  than their duty to indemnify.   The\r\n\ncourt  reasoned  that  a  finding  that  an  insurer  is  not\r\n\ncontractually  obligated  to indemnify  an  insured does  not\r\n\nnecessarily relieve the  insurer of its duty  to shoulder the\r\n\nburden of defense, concluding  that the insurers incurred the\r\n\ndefense costs in fulfilling their contractual obligations and\r\n\nwere thus not entitled to reimbursement.\r\n\n          Millipore now appeals, arguing that New  Jersey law\r\n\ngoverns the  two  New Jersey  sites,  and that  under  Nashua\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp., the  evidence that  fires and other  accidental events\r                 \r\n\ncaused  the  sudden  and  accidental  release  of  pollutants\r\n\ncreated a genuine issue  of material fact, making a  grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment  inappropriate.  INA and  Travelers (but not\r\n\nHartford)  cross-appeal  from the  district court's  entry of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The bad  faith insurance practices claims were dismissed\r\nwithout  prejudice to  their  reinstatement if  the grant  of\r\npartial  summary  judgment  for   the  insurers  were  to  be\r\nreversed;  the   court  evidently  viewed   these  claims  as\r\nderivative of the declaratory judgment action.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\njudgment   for   Millipore   on   their   counterclaims   for\r\n\nreimbursement for defense costs.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\nChoice of Law\r                         \r\n\n          The parties dispute which state's law applies as to\r\n\nCounts I and II,14 so we turn  to Massachusetts choice of law\r\n\nprinciples.

Millipore argues that the law\r\n\nof New Jersey  should govern  the dispute  involving the  New\r\n\nJersey  sites, while  the insurers  contend  that the  law of\r\n\nMassachusetts  should be  applied to  the entire  case.   Our\r\n\nreview of the district court's choice of law determination is\r\n\nde novo.  In re  San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire  Litig., 45\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 569, 576 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          The  first  step  in  performing a  choice  of  law\r\n\nanalysis is to determine whether there is  a conflict between\r\n\nthe substantive  laws of  the interested jurisdictions.   New\r\n\nJersey insurance  law recognizes  the doctrine of  regulatory\r\n\nestoppel, which  in this context limits  the applicability of\r\n\nthe   pollution    exclusion   clause   as   a    result   of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  Count   II  alleges   unfair  and   deceptive  insurance\r\npractices  under  Mass.  Gen. Laws  chs.  93A  and  176D, and\r\ntherefore the question is not  which state's law applies, but\r\nwhether  plaintiff has  created a  genuine issue  of material\r\nfact as to whether  the Massachusetts statutes are applicable\r\nhere.   Cf. Roche v. Royal Bank of Canada, 109 F.3d 820, 829-\r                                                     \r\n32 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nmisrepresentations allegedly made  by the insurance  industry\r\n\nto  insurance regulators about  the purpose and  scope of the\r\n\nclause.  Under New  Jersey law, the meaning of  the pollution\r\n\nexclusion clause  is  limited  by  the  insurance  industry's\r\n\nofficial explanation  for its 1970 revisions  to the standard\r\n\nCGL policy.  Consequently,  the pollution exclusion clause is\r\n\nconstrued to  \"provide coverage identical with  that provided\r\n\nunder  the  prior occurrence-based  policy,  except  that the\r\n\nclause  [is] interpreted  to  preclude coverage  in cases  in\r\n\nwhich the insured intentionally discharges a known pollutant,\r\n\nirrespective of  whether the  resulting  property damage  was\r\n\nintended  or  expected.\"    Morton  Int'l,  Inc.  v.

Under\r\n\nthe  Massachusetts interpretation of  the pollution exclusion\r\n\nclause, Millipore  would need to  make a stronger  showing to\r\n\nsurvive a motion for  summary judgment.  There is  a conflict\r\n\nbetween   New   Jersey  and   Massachusetts   law  over   the\r\n\ninterpretation of the pollution exclusion clause.\r\n\n          The  question  becomes whether  the  district court\r\n\ncorrectly applied Massachusetts law to the disputes involving\r\n\nthe  New  Jersey  sites.   This  determination  involves  two\r\n\ndistinct analyses,  one for  the policies issued  by Hartford\r\n\nand INA to Millipore  and the other for the policy  issued by\r\n\nHartford   to   Worthington  before   it   was  acquired   by\r\n\nMillipore.15\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  All  of Millipore's potential  CERCLA liability  for the\r\nNew  Jersey sites arises out of the actions of Worthington, a\r\nwholly  owned  subsidiary.    A  Hartford  policy  issued  to\r\nWorthington covers these two sites.   INA policies issued  to\r\nMillipore  also provide  coverage  to the  New Jersey  sites,\r\nbecause these  policies by their terms  extended to Millipore\r\nsubsidiaries.   Hartford  also  issued a  policy directly  to\r\nMillipore  during  the  relevant  period.    It  is  unclear,\r\nhowever, whether  Millipore sought coverage for  liability at\r\nthe New Jersey sites  under this policy as well  as under the\r\npolicy  issued to  Worthington.

Here, the state with  the strongest\r\n\ninterest  in seeing its substantive law applied to all of the\r\n\nsites is  Massachusetts.  Massachusetts  is Millipore's state\r\n\nof incorporation and its  principal place of business.   Most\r\n\nof  the  policies were  negotiated  and  administered in  and\r\n\naround Boston.  Three of the five sites are in Massachusetts.\r\n\nWe   affirm   the   district  court's   decision   to   apply\r\n\nMassachusetts law to  the disputes  involving coverage  under\r\n\nmultistate  CGL  policies  issued  directly  to Millipore  of\r\n\nliability at the New  Jersey as well as at  the Massachusetts\r\n\nsites.\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\n          The policy Hartford issued to Worthington before it\r\n\nwas acquired by  Millipore is not, however, a  multistate CGL\r\n\npolicy  and so is not  necessarily governed by  the choice of\r\n\nlaw rules  set forth by the SJC  for such policies.  Instead,\r\n\nwe  look  again to  Massachusetts  choice  of law  rules  for\r\n\nguidance  on  the  issue of  what  law  should  apply to  the\r\n\ninsurance disputes involving this policy.\r\n\n          An  important consideration  is the  expectation of\r\n\nthe parties  at  the time  the  policy  was issued.    It  is\r\n\nsignificant  that Millipore  only acquired  Worthington after\r\n\nHartford  had  issued  the  policy under  which  coverage  is\r\n\ndisputed.  At  the time the policy  was issued, Worthington's\r\n\nprincipal place of  business was  in New Jersey,  as are  the\r\n\ncovered  sites.     Both   Worthington  and   Hartford  would\r\n\nreasonably have expected New Jersey law to govern the policy.\r\n\n          In addition,  New Jersey  has a strong  interest in\r\n\nthe  integrity  of  its  insurance regulatory  process.    In\r\n\nMorton, the  highest court of  New Jersey evinced  its belief\r                  \r\n\nthat  limiting the  scope of  the pollution  exclusion clause\r\n\nadvances that interest.   Morton,  629 A.2d at  875.   Morton\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso  indicates  that New  Jersey  public  policy favors  the\r\n\nprotection of New Jersey  insureds, id.; Worthington was such\r                                                   \r\n\nan  insured at the time the  Hartford policy was issued.  New\r\n\nJersey thus has a  strong interest in seeing its  law applied\r\n\nto this controversy.\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\n          It is true  that applying  New Jersey  law in  this\r\n\ninstance  would not advance  the interest in  uniformity.  At\r\n\nfirst blush it may  seem somewhat anomalous to have  the laws\r\n\nof  different  states   govern  very  similar   CGL  policies\r\n\nproviding coverage  to the same sites.   However, Worthington\r\n\nand  Millipore  were  unrelated  entities  at  the  time  the\r\n\nHartford policy  was issued; the expectations  of the parties\r\n\nand the  legitimate  interests of  New Jersey  should not  be\r\n\ndefeated by  the fortuity  of the  subsequent  purchase.   We\r\n\nreverse the district court's decision to apply  Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw to the  disputes involving the policy Hartford  issued to\r\n\nWorthington,  and we hold that New Jersey law applies to that\r\n\npolicy.  Thus, as to  the New Jersey sites covered  under the\r\n\npolicy  Hartford issued  to Worthington,  we remand,  without\r\n\nfurther discussion  of the  facts concerning the  releases or\r\n\nthe policy language, for consideration of liability on Counts\r\n\nI and III under New Jersey law.\r\n\nTravelers' Coverage Argument\r                                        \r\n\n          Travelers'  primary  argument  in  support  of  its\r\n\nmotion  for summary  judgment is  distinct  from that  of the\r\n\nother two insurers.  This argument involves the first step in\r\n\ndetermining whether  CERCLA liability is covered  under a CGL\r\n\npolicy, that is, whether there was an \"occurrence\" within the\r\n\nmeaning  of the policy.  That  determination is distinct from\r\n\nthe  determination   of  whether  there  was   a  sudden  and\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\naccidental  event  within   the  meaning  of  the   pollution\r\n\nexclusion clause:  the  focus in  the  former inquiry  is  on\r\n\nwhether there  was property damage during  the policy period,\r\n\nwhile  in  the  latter it  is  on  the  circumstances of  the\r\n\nrelease.    Belleville I,  555  N.E.2d  at 571  (noting  that\r                                    \r\n\nfailure to appreciate this  distinction has led to analytical\r\n\nconfusion).\r\n\n          The language of the  policy states that coverage is\r\n\nprovided for damages  as a result of \"bodily injury  or . . .\r\n\nproperty damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an\r\n\noccurrence.\"   The  policy limits  property damage  to damage\r\n\noccurring within  the policy  period.  Travelers  argues that\r\n\nthere was no property damage during its policy period.\r\n\n          The Travelers policy only  insured the Silresim and\r\n\nCharles George  sites, and only  for the period  lasting from\r\n\nApril 1975  until  July  1976.   Travelers  points  out  that\r\n\nMillipore seeks  coverage for  damages arising out  of events\r\n\ntaking  place at the Silresim site between 1977 and 1983, and\r\n\nat  the  Charles  George site  in  1980.   These  occurrences\r\n\npostdated  the  end  of  the  Travelers  policy  period,  and\r\n\nTravelers argues that there could  have been no damage during\r\n\nthe policy period.\r\n\n          The issue is complicated  somewhat by the fact that\r\n\nMassachusetts has  not yet ruled  on the  proper approach  to\r\n\ntake in  determining whether  there has been  actual property\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\ndamage  during  the  policy period.    This  was  one of  the\r\n\nquestions  certified to  the SJC  in  Belleville I,  but that\r                                                              \r\n\ncourt declined to answer the  question due to an insufficient\r\n\nfactual record, and  the issue remains  open.  Belleville  I,\r                                                                        \r\n\n555  N.E.2d at 575  &amp; n.9.   The Belleville I  court did note\r                                                         \r\n\nthat there  are five  viable approaches: the  release theory,\r\n\nthe  injury-in-fact theory,  the  manifestation  theory,  the\r\n\nfirst discovery theory,  and the  continuous trigger  theory.\r\n\nId.  at 575-76.   Here,  we need  not predict  which approach\r               \r\n\nMassachusetts would adopt, as Millipore has not  demonstrated\r\n\nthat there  were any occurrences during  the Travelers policy\r\n\nperiod under any of the possible approaches.\r\n\n          The insured  bears the burden of  proving coverage,\r\n\nsee,  e.g., United States Liab.  Ins. Co. v.  Selman, 70 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n684, 688 (1st Cir.  1995), and Millipore essentially conceded\r\n\nat oral argument  that it had not  met its burden  of proving\r\n\nthat any damage occurred  during the Travelers policy period.\r\n\nInstead, Millipore argued that it should be allowed on remand\r\n\nto  put  in  additional  evidence of  abrupt  and  unexpected\r\n\nevents, such  as fires,  that occurred before  or during  the\r\n\npolicy  period and  that could  have caused  harm during  the\r\n\npolicy period.16   Millipore, however, had ample  opportunity\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  Due to  the retroactive  strict liability nature  of the\r\nCERCLA  regime,  a company  may  be  responsible for  damages\r\noccurring before  it began shipping waste to  a site.  As the\r\nSJC explained in Aerovox:\r                                    \r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nto  create  a  record,  and  there has  been  no  intervening\r\n\nclarification of  the governing law.   Travelers first raised\r\n\nthe  \"occurrence\" argument  in its  answer to  the complaint,\r\n\nputting Millipore  on notice  that it was  contesting whether\r\n\nthere was harm  during the policy period.17   Accordingly, we\r\n\naffirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Travelers.\r\n\nThe Pollution Exclusion Clauses Under Massachusetts Law\r                                                                   \r\n\n          To analyze INA and  Hartford's argument, we turn to\r\n\nthe  pollution  exclusion  clause  under  Massachusetts  law,\r\n\nparticularly in light of the recently decided cases of Nashua\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp.  v.

Aerovox Inc., 676 N.E.2d\r                                                             \r\n\n801 (Mass. 1997).  Nashua Corp. was decided after Judge Zobel\r                                           \r\n\ngranted summary  judgment against  Millipore;   Aerovox while\r                                                                   \r\n\nthis  appeal was pending.  Prior to Nashua Corp. and Aerovox,\r                                                                        \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          [Under CERCLA,] the allocation of damages\r\n          is not differentiated by the time  when a\r\n          particular PRP sent contaminated waste to\r\n          the site or by  the waste of a particular\r\n          PRP.   Thus, the fact that  [the insured]\r\n          did not ship  waste to [the  site] before\r\n          1973,  fifteen years after the fire, does\r\n          not  preclude  the possibility  that some\r\n          fraction of the damages [the insured] was\r\n          asked to pay resulted from the 1958 fire.\r\n\nAerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806.\r                   \r\n\n17.  While it is true  that Travelers erroneously termed this\r\nargument an affirmative defense,  suggesting that it bore the\r\nburden of  proof  on the  issue,  this  area of  the  law  is\r\nsufficiently well  settled that  Millipore should  have known\r\nthat  it would have to bear the burden of proving that damage\r\noccurred during the policy period.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nthe  SJC  had issued  several decisions  construing pollution\r\n\nexclusion  clauses  in   insurance  contracts,   establishing\r\n\ngeneral  principles.   However,  it  was  unclear under  what\r\n\ncircumstances  damage due  to  the release  of pollutants  on\r\n\nparticular occasions  would be  covered under the  sudden and\r\n\naccidental exception to the pollution exclusion clause if the\r\n\ninsured had also  engaged in pollution-generating  activities\r\n\nnot subject to the exception over a longer period.\r\n\n          The SJC had ruled that \"[t]he sudden event to which\r\n\nthe  exception  in  the  pollution  exclusion  clause applies\r\n\nconcerns  neither the cause of the release of a pollutant nor\r\n\nthe  damage caused  by  the release.   It  is the  release of\r\n\npollutants itself  that must  have occurred suddenly,  if the\r\n\nexception is to apply . . .  .\"  Belleville I, 555 N.E.2d  at\r                                                         \r\n\n571.18   The focus is  therefore on the  circumstances of the\r\n\nrelease.  Id.\r                         \r\n\n          As to the meaning of the term \"sudden\" the word has\r\n\na  temporal element, and so the release of pollutants must be\r\n\nabrupt (as well as accidental) for there to be coverage.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.  The  SJC   later   clarified  that   the   circumstances\r\nsurrounding the event causing  the release may be informative\r\nin  determining whether  the  release itself  was sudden  and\r\naccidental.

This court  later held  that, when\r\nwaste is poured directly into the ground (as opposed to first\r\nbeing placed  in a  container), \"the relevant  discharge from\r\nwhich  the  damage arose  is  clearly the  disposal  of waste\r\ncontaining hazardous substances into  the landfill.\"  Warwick\r                                                                         \r\nDyeing, 26 F.3d at 1204;  cf.

The insurers\r                                                         \r\n\nrely  on the fact  that in Aerovox,  the SJC, as  a matter of\r                                              \r\n\nstate law, granted summary judgment against the insured, even\r\n\nthough the record  was compiled before  that parties had  the\r\n\nbenefit  of the Nashua  Corp. decision.   The  insurers argue\r                                         \r\n\nwith some  merit that  the affidavits submitted  by Millipore\r\n\nrelating to the three Massachusetts sites are no more precise\r\n\nthan  those found wanting by  the SJC in  Aerovox; they argue\r                                                             \r\n\nwith less merit that affidavits Millipore submitted as to the\r\n\nNew Jersey sites suffer from similar weaknesses.\r\n\n          We   decline  the  insurers'   invitation  for  two\r\n\nreasons.  The first is that these initial judgments as to the\r\n\nadequacy of a record  on summary judgment are better  made by\r\n\nthe trial court in  the first instance.

INA\r\n\nand Travelers  contend that the district  court's decision to\r\n\nenter judgment in favor of Millipore on the counterclaims was\r\n\nbased  on the  erroneous assumption  that the insurers  had a\r\n\nduty to defend Millipore until the  district court issued its\r\n\nopinion stating that the pollution exclusion clause precluded\r\n\ncoverage here.  The insurers argue that, since they never had\r\n\na  duty  to defend  or  indemnify Millipore,  and  since they\r\n\nreserved  the right  to reimbursement  for any  defense costs\r\n\npaid to Millipore, they  are entitled to recover in  full the\r\n\nsums they paid to Millipore.\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\n          Under  Massachusetts  law,  an  insurer's  duty  to\r\n\ndefend  an  insured  is  more  expansive  than  its  duty  to\r\n\nindemnify.

The  duty to\r                    \r\n\ndefend  is antecedent  to, and  independent of,  the duty  to\r\n\nindemnify; the  obligation of the  insurer to  defend is  not\r\n\ndetermined  \"by  reference  to  the facts  proven  at  trial.\r\n\nRather,  the duty to defend is based  on the facts alleged in\r\n\nthe complaint . . . .\"  Id.\r                                       \r\n\n          The test  for determining whether an  insurer has a\r\n\nduty  to defend is well-established.  Whether there is such a\r\n\nduty is decided by:\r\n\n          matching  the third-party  complaint with\r\n          the policy provisions: if the allegations\r\n          of   the    complaint   are   'reasonably\r\n          susceptible'  of  an interpretation  that\r\n          they state  or adumbrate a  claim covered\r\n          by the  policy  terms, the  insurer  must\r\n          undertake the defense . . . .\r\n\nLiberty  Mut.

The complaints allege claims\r\n\npursuant  to  CERCLA and  other  federal  and state  statutes\r\n\narising  out of  Millipore's generation  of hazardous  wastes\r\n\ndisposed  of at the Charles  George site and  the spillage of\r\n\ntrichloroethylene  at  the Cooper  site.    These events  are\r\n\nclearly  occurrences under  the INA  policies, and  while the\r\n\nresulting damage  is pollution related, it  at least arguably\r\n\nfalls under the exception  to the pollution exclusion clause.\r\n\nThis  conclusion is a corollary of our decision to vacate the\r\n\ngrant of  summary judgment and remand to  the district court.\r\n\nThe possibility of coverage is sufficient to trigger the duty\r\n\nto defend.

The  amended complaints\r\n\nfiled  by  the United  States  and  the  Commonwealth in  the\r\n\nunderlying  Charles George  action  allege  that between,  at\r\n\nleast 1971 and 1983,  a landfill was operated at  the Charles\r\n\nGeorge  site,  and that,  between  at  least 1973  and  1976,\r\n\nhazardous wastes  were disposed  of there.   Millipore, among\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\nothers,  is  alleged to  have generated  hazardous substances\r\n\nthat were disposed of at the site.\r\n\n          The  Travelers  policy  provides coverage  for  the\r\n\nperiod between April 1975 and July 1976, and thus,  according\r\n\nto the complaints of the  United States and the Commonwealth,\r\n\ncovers part  of the time  during which hazardous  wastes were\r\n\nshipped  to the landfill.  The facts alleged in the complaint\r\n\nraised  the possibility that  some of the  property damage at\r\n\nthe Charles  George site  occurred within the  policy period.\r\n\nThe later determination that Millipore has not met its burden\r\n\nof  showing an occurrence  during the policy  period does not\r\n\nnegate the duty to defend, which grows out of the allegations\r\n\nin  the  complaint  against  the insured.

In considering this question, we must address, among other things, the \"pollution exclusion\" provisions of the insurance policies, which preclude coverage for pollution-related claims unless the release of pollutants was \"sudden and accidental.\"   Based on recent developments in Massachusetts environmental insurance law, we vacate in part the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that New Jersey law applies to claims under policies issued to a New Jersey corporation later acquired by Millipore, and that summary judgment was properly entered in favor of one of Millipore's insurers, Travelers Indemnity Company, because Millipore failed to produce evidence of an occurrence within the Travelers policy period.  Finally, we hold that Millipore was entitled to summary judgment on the insurers' counterclaims for reimbursement for defense costs paid to Millipore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurance coverage issues involved in this case are best understood in context.  CERCLA, which was enacted in 1980, is the primary federal statutory scheme regulating hazardous waste cleanups.  Some states have enacted their own regimes as well.  CERCLA imposes liability for the costs of cleaning up hazardous waste sites and for the loss of natural resources due to pollution on three categories of potentially responsible parties (\"PRPs\"):  past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, some companies that transported waste to these sites, and companies that generated waste disposed of at these sites.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 9607(a).

The CERCLA cost allocation scheme may operate retroactively as well:  a PRP may be held responsible for actions taken before CERCLA was enacted and before the PRP was aware that its actions might lead to environmental liability.  Jerry, supra, &#167; 65, at 459-60.  CERCLA allows joint and several liability when specific damage cannot be attributed to particular PRPs, which is often the case at hazardous waste sites.

Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 13 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore is a Massachusetts corporation primarily engaged in manufacturing products and providing services for the analysis and purification of liquids.  Millipore has its corporate headquarters as well as a manufacturing facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, with other Massachusetts manufacturing facilities in Milford and Taunton.  Millipore disposed of its manufacturing wastes at several different sites in Massachusetts, including the Silresim Waste Reclamation and Disposal Facility in Lowell, the Charles George Landfill in Tyngsboro, and the Re-Solve Waste Reclamation and Disposal Facility in North Dartmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between December 1975 and March 1982, Millipore owned the Worthington Biochemical Corporation, located in Freehold, New Jersey, which produced research enzymes and related chemicals.  The Worthington manufacturing process involved the use of substances defined as hazardous, including trichloroethylene and freons.  Worthington disposed of much of its waste materials at the Lone Pine Landfill in Freehold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All four of these sites where Millipore and Worthington disposed of their wastes have a history of contaminating neighboring land and water.  These troubled sites share numerous similarities involving poor design and sloppy operations.  At the Silresim site, chemicals dumped into the disposal pit regularly seeped through the concrete lining of the pit into the ground.  In 1973, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts required the operators of the site to find a solution to the problem of contaminated runoff.  The landfill operators failed to do so, and also committed numerous violations of state regulations between 1973 and 1975.  The Commonwealth made continued operation of the facility contingent upon regulatory compliance.  The operators filed for bankruptcy, leading to the revocation of their operating permit in 1977.  They abandoned the site later that year.  Raging chemical fires swept the site in October 1977, August 1978, and again in April 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, Millipore received notification from the EPA that it was a PRP with respect to the Silresim site.  Later that year, in December, Massachusetts initiated a legal action in federal court under CERCLA and various state environmental laws.  See Commonwealth v. Pace, No. 83-3883-G (complaint filed in District of Massachusetts).  It sought to recover cleanup costs from more than 200 companies that had used the Silresim site, including Millipore and Waters Associates, which Millipore had purchased in 1980.  In December 1983, Millipore was also named as a defendant in a similar case brought by the federal government.  United States v. General Chem.  Corp., No. 92-10923-T (complaint filed in District of Massachusetts).  Shortly thereafter, Millipore and others paid the Commonwealth $2 million in settlement, and entered into a consent decree in the federal action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The operators of the Charles George Landfill also committed numerous infractions of state environmental regulations.  During inspections of the landfill in 1971 and 1975, the Commonwealth discovered leachate<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> emanating from the landfill.  By September 1976, leachate had contaminated three of the four groundwater basins at the site, and the surrounding wetlands were polluted by runoff from the facility.  The situation was exacerbated when, on June 12, 1980, a fire broke out and burned until July 9. Millions of gallons of water were poured onto the landfill to extinguish the fire, generating toxic leachate and causing the water table to rise temporarily.  In June 1983, the Commonwealth filed suit in state court to bring landfill operations into compliance with state law.  The landfill was ultimately closed by court order later in 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States and the Commonwealth filed separate suits in 1985 against the Charles George Trucking Company, an owner-operator of the landfill, and others.  The complaints alleged violation of CERCLA and other federal and state laws, and sought, among other things, past and future costs of cleaning up the landfill.  In 1986, the EPA notified Millipore that it was a PRP with respect to the Charles George site, and in 1989 Millipore was added as a defendant in two consolidated cases in the District of Massachusetts entitled United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., No. 85-2463-WD, and Commonwealth v.  Charles George Trucking Co., No. 85-2714.   A consent decree was ultimately entered into, and was upheld in United States v. Charles George Trucking, Inc., 34 F.3d 1081 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Re-Solve site operated as a waste reclamation facility from 1956 to 1980 and handled a variety of hazardous substances.  In October 1958, an explosive blaze destroyed much of the facility.  It eventually re-opened, but from the early 1970's on, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) (now the Department of Environmental Protection) was actively involved in monitoring the site.  The EPA also eventually began an investigation.  The site was a significant source of pollution.  The sides of the waste lagoons at the site were not effectively sealed, which allowed pollutants to seep out.  In addition, rain routinely caused the lagoons to overflow into the neighboring wetlands.  Millipore was named a PRP, and the United States filed a CERCLA action to recover the costs of cleaning up the site, naming as defendants some 225 companies, including Millipore, which had sent waste to the facility.  In 1988, Millipore entered into a consent decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the Lone Pine Landfill in New Jersey, rain regularly caused contaminated runoff to drain directly into the nearby Marasquan River.  Toxic waste was buried in unlined pits, which allowed seepage into the surrounding soil.  In addition, decomposing garbage routinely caused fires and even explosions.  After a particularly harmful chemical fire in 1978, New Jersey environmental officials issued an administrative order to mitigate the damage.  After noncompliance with the order, the landfill was ordered closed the following year.  Millipore and Worthington were each designated as a PRP, in 1985 and 1990 respectively.  In 1989, Millipore and the EPA entered into a consent decree involving on-site remediation, and in 1991, Millipore and the EPA entered into a second consent decree involving off-site remediation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were also environmental problems at the Worthington plant itself.  In 1976 or 1977, a freeze drier line at the plant ruptured, causing no more than 60 gallons of trichloroethylene to be released into drains leading to an onsite wastewater treatment facility.  From there, the trichloroethylene evidently made its way into the soil and groundwater and migrated off site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore sold Worthington's assets in 1982 to Flow General, which in 1983 sold the assets to Cooper BioMedical, Inc. In 1986, Cooper performed an environmental assessment which disclosed trichloroethylene contamination.  Cooper took remedial measures, and in 1990 instituted a CERCLA action against Millipore, seeking reimbursement for costs associated with the cleanup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to each of these sites, Millipore sought coverage under its CGL policies and those of Worthington and Waters, two potentially liable subsidiaries.  Where, as here, CERCLA liability arises out of a PRP's operations over the course of many years, it often implicates general liability policies issued by several different insurers.  Ostrager &amp; Newman, supra, &#167; 10.01, at 404.  A Travelers Indemnity Company policy issued to Millipore covered damage occurring between April 1975 and July 1976.  A Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company policy issued to Millipore covered damage occurring between July 1976 and May 1977.  Hartford also issued a general liability policy covering the period between August 1974 and May 1977 to Worthington Biochemical Corporation;  Millipore purchased Worthington in 1975.  And Hartford issued two one-year liability policies covering the period between January 1975 and January 1977 to Waters Associates, a Massachusetts company purchased by Millipore in 1980.  Finally, Insurance Company of North America (\"INA\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> issued eight general liability policies to Millipore covering the period between May 1977 and January 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hartford and INA policies contained the standard pollution clause, quoted above, generally contained in CGL policies between 1970 and 1985.  The language of the pollution exclusion provision in the Travelers policy is somewhat different in ways we need not address at this juncture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore sent notice to the insurers regarding the Silresim site in 1983, the Re-Solve site in 1984, the Charles George and Lone Pine sites in 1989, and the Cooper site in 1990.  The insurers responded that they planned to investigate whether Millipore's claims were covered under its CGL policies.  In September 1990, INA acknowledged receipt of Millipore's notice of loss for the Cooper facility (formerly the Worthington plant) and paid Millipore a share of the defense costs in the underlying litigation, but expressly reserved all rights under the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Millipore and its insurers then disagreed about payment of the costs incurred by Millipore in litigating the underlying action involving the Charles George site.  After lengthy negotiations, they entered into an interim agreement in January 1993, under which the insurers would pay the defense costs but reserved the right to seek reimbursement if it was later determined that they had no duty to defend or indemnify Millipore.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Apparently, the insurers paid no defense costs relating to the other three sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore brought suit against the insurers in five separate federal court actions, one for each site, seeking the full costs of defending the underlying actions, indemnification for its liability, and damages for unfair and deceptive insurance practices.  All three insurers were named as defendants in the cases involving the Silresim and Charles George sites.  INA and Hartford were the named defendants in the cases involving the Lone Pine and Cooper sites, while INA was the only defendant named in the case involving the Re-Solve site.  Otherwise, the pleadings in all five cases are substantially identical.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurers responded that the pollution exclusion provisions in the insurance policies defeated coverage and counterclaimed for reimbursement of the defense costs already paid to Millipore for the Charles George and Cooper sites.  The cases were consolidated before Judge Rya Zobel in the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1994, following the close of extensive discovery, the insurers moved for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of Millipore's claims for declaratory relief.  Judge Zobel granted the insurers' motion in March 1995.  She first rejected Millipore's argument that New Jersey substantive law should apply to the sites in New Jersey.  She noted that \"[t]he Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has articulated a clear preference for the law of one state to interpret multistate comprehensive general liability policies,\" and reasoned that, \"[a]s the place of plaintiff's incorporation and its principal place of business, Massachusetts has the most significant interest in this lawsuit.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Zobel also agreed with the insurers' argument that the pollution exclusion clauses preclude coverage.  She stated that \"a survey of the current caselaw suggests that it is the initial release, not subsequent leakage or damage from that release which determines the issue.\"   She went on to conclude that \"the initial releases of pollutants into the landfills ... do not fall within the meaning of 'sudden and accidental' as defined in the caselaw,\" because Millipore's \"waste disposal practices were a routine aspect of business activity.\"   The case subsequently was transferred to Judge George O'Toole when Judge Zobel became head of the Federal Judicial Center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore moved for reconsideration on May 5, 1995 in light of new Massachusetts caselaw.  On May 2, 1995, the Supreme Judicial Court handed down Nashua Corp. v. First State Insurance Co., 420 Mass. 196, 648 N.E.2d 1272 (1995), construing a pollution exclusion clause in a case involving an insurance dispute between another company that disposed of waste at the Silresim facility and its liability insurer.  Nashua Corp. held that, notwithstanding the history of routine polluting activities by the operator of the Silresim site, the evidence presented of a fire and subsequent explosion at Silresim defeated the insurer's motion for summary judgment based on the pollution exclusion.  Id., 648 N.E.2d at 1275-76.   The court reasoned that the fire and explosion caused the sudden and accidental release of pollutants into the environment, thus placing the resulting damage into the exception to the pollution exclusion clause.  Millipore argued that the same fire and explosion at Silresim placed its resulting CERCLA liability within the exception to the exclusion as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion for reconsideration in November 1995.  Judge O'Toole held that Nashua Corp. did not represent a change in Massachusetts substantive law and therefore that reconsideration was not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurers then moved for summary judgment on Millipore's remaining claims and on the counterclaims for reimbursement for Millipore's defense costs.  The district court dismissed the breach of contract and bad faith insurance practices claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court ruled against the insurers on their counterclaims, granting summary judgment in favor of Millipore, on the theory that the insurers' duty to defend is more expansive than their duty to indemnify.  The court reasoned that a finding that an insurer is not contractually obligated to indemnify an insured does not necessarily relieve the insurer of its duty to shoulder the burden of defense, concluding that the insurers incurred the defense costs in fulfilling their contractual obligations and were thus not entitled to reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore now appeals, arguing that New Jersey law governs the two New Jersey sites, and that under Nashua Corp., the evidence that fires and other accidental events caused the sudden and accidental release of pollutants created a genuine issue of material fact, making a grant of summary judgment inappropriate.  INA and Travelers (but not Hartford) cross-appeal from the district court's entry of judgment for Millipore on their counterclaims for reimbursement for defense costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Choice of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute which state's law applies as to Counts I and II,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> so we turn to Massachusetts choice of law principles.  Spurlin v. Merchants Ins. Co., 57 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir.1995) (forum choice of law rules govern federal courts sitting in diversity).  Millipore argues that the law of New Jersey should govern the dispute involving the New Jersey sites, while the insurers contend that the law of Massachusetts should be applied to the entire case.  Our review of the district court's choice of law determination is de novo.  In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 45 F.3d 569, 576 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first step in performing a choice of law analysis is to determine whether there is a conflict between the substantive laws of the interested jurisdictions.  New Jersey insurance law recognizes the doctrine of regulatory estoppel, which in this context limits the applicability of the pollution exclusion clause as a result of misrepresentations allegedly made by the insurance industry to insurance regulators about the purpose and scope of the clause.  Under New Jersey law, the meaning of the pollution exclusion clause is limited by the insurance industry's official explanation for its 1970 revisions to the standard CGL policy.  Consequently, the pollution exclusion clause is construed to \"provide coverage identical with that provided under the prior occurrence-based policy, except that the clause [is] interpreted to preclude coverage in cases in which the insured intentionally discharges a known pollutant, irrespective of whether the resulting property damage was intended or expected.\"  Morton Int'l, Inc. v. General Accident Ins. Co. of Am., 134 N.J. 1, 629 A.2d 831, 875 (1993).  Within this legal framework, Millipore would be entitled to coverage for its CERCLA liability if it could prove that it never intentionally discharged a known pollutant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the pollution exclusion clause is interpreted much more expansively under Massachusetts law.  The SJC has never recognized New Jersey's doctrine of regulatory estoppel in this context, and there is no indication that Massachusetts would adopt the doctrine.  Indeed, in Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Belleville Industries, Inc., 407 Mass. 675, 555 N.E.2d 568 (1990) (\"Belleville I \"), the SJC refused to consider the drafting history of the pollution exclusion clause in determining the meaning of the term 'sudden' in the clause.  The court reasoned that the term is unambiguous and therefore that no extrinsic evidence is necessary to understand its meaning.  Belleville I, 555 N.E.2d at 573;  see also Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 414 Mass. 747, 610 N.E.2d 912, 916 n. 7 (1993) (striking amici curiae briefs solely devoted to discussing the drafting and regulatory history of the pollution exclusion clause).  Under the Massachusetts interpretation of the pollution exclusion clause, Millipore would need to make a stronger showing to survive a motion for summary judgment.  There is a conflict between New Jersey and Massachusetts law over the interpretation of the pollution exclusion clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question becomes whether the district court correctly applied Massachusetts law to the disputes involving the New Jersey sites.  This determination involves two distinct analyses, one for the policies issued by Hartford and INA to Millipore and the other for the policy issued by Hartford to Worthington before it was acquired by Millipore.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts courts take a flexible interest-based approach to conflict of laws issues and will consider a wide variety of factors in choosing the applicable law.  Cosme v. Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., 417 Mass. 643, 632 N.E.2d 832, 834 (1994).  These factors include those listed in the Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws:  (1) the needs of the interstate and international system, (2) the policies of the forum, (3) the policies of other interested jurisdictions, (4) the protection of justified expectations, (5) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law, (6) certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and (7) ease of applicability.  Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 393 Mass. 622, 473 N.E.2d 662, 669 (1985) (citing Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws &#167; 6 (1971)).  They also include factors proposed by conflict of laws commentators:  (1) predictability, (2) maintaining interstate and international order, (3) simplifying the judicial task, (4) advancing the interests of the forum, and (5) applying the better legal rule.  Bushkin Assocs., 473 N.E.2d at 670 n. 7 (citing Leflar, American Conflicts Law &#167; 109, at 195 (3d ed.1977)).  The SJC has indicated that it \"feel[s] free ... to borrow from any of the various lists to help focus ... attention on the considerations particularly relevant to the case....\"  Bushkin Assocs., 473 N.E.2d at 670.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The polices issued by Hartford and INA to Millipore are multistate CGL policies.  In addressing the choice of law issue with respect to such policies, the SJC has articulated a clear preference for looking to the law of one state to govern the interpretation of such multistate policies.  United Techs.  Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 407 Mass. 591, 555 N.E.2d 224, 227 (1990);  W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., 407 Mass. 572, 555 N.E.2d 214, 221 (1990).  The SJC reasoned that the expectations of the parties as well as commercial realities require that the language in a single set of insurance policies should mean the same thing in every state.  United Techs., 555 N.E.2d at 227 &amp; n. 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, one jurisdiction's rules of decision must be applied to all of the sites covered under multistate CGL policies.  Here, the state with the strongest interest in seeing its substantive law applied to all of the sites is Massachusetts.  Massachusetts is Millipore's state of incorporation and its principal place of business.  Most of the policies were negotiated and administered in and around Boston.  Three of the five sites are in Massachusetts.  We affirm the district court's decision to apply Massachusetts law to the disputes involving coverage under multistate CGL policies issued directly to Millipore of liability at the New Jersey as well as at the Massachusetts sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy Hartford issued to Worthington before it was acquired by Millipore is not, however, a multistate CGL policy and so is not necessarily governed by the choice of law rules set forth by the SJC for such policies.  Instead, we look again to Massachusetts choice of law rules for guidance on the issue of what law should apply to the insurance disputes involving this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An important consideration is the expectation of the parties at the time the policy was issued.  It is significant that Millipore only acquired Worthington after Hartford had issued the policy under which coverage is disputed.  At the time the policy was issued, Worthington's principal place of business was in New Jersey, as are the covered sites.  Both Worthington and Hartford would reasonably have expected New Jersey law to govern the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, New Jersey has a strong interest in the integrity of its insurance regulatory process.  In Morton, the highest court of New Jersey evinced its belief that limiting the scope of the pollution exclusion clause advances that interest.  Morton, 629 A.2d at 875.  Morton also indicates that New Jersey public policy favors the protection of New Jersey insureds, id.;   Worthington was such an insured at the time the Hartford policy was issued.  New Jersey thus has a strong interest in seeing its law applied to this controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that applying New Jersey law in this instance would not advance the interest in uniformity.  At first blush it may seem somewhat anomalous to have the laws of different states govern very similar CGL policies providing coverage to the same sites.  However, Worthington and Millipore were unrelated entities at the time the Hartford policy was issued;  the expectations of the parties and the legitimate interests of New Jersey should not be defeated by the fortuity of the subsequent purchase.  We reverse the district court's decision to apply Massachusetts law to the disputes involving the policy Hartford issued to Worthington, and we hold that New Jersey law applies to that policy.  Thus, as to the New Jersey sites covered under the policy Hartford issued to Worthington, we remand, without further discussion of the facts concerning the releases or the policy language, for consideration of liability on Counts I and III under New Jersey law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Travelers' Coverage Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers' primary argument in support of its motion for summary judgment is distinct from that of the other two insurers.  This argument involves the first step in determining whether CERCLA liability is covered under a CGL policy, that is, whether there was an \"occurrence\" within the meaning of the policy.  That determination is distinct from the determination of whether there was a sudden and accidental event within the meaning of the pollution exclusion clause:  the focus in the former inquiry is on whether there was property damage during the policy period, while in the latter it is on the circumstances of the release.  Belleville I, 555 N.E.2d at 571 (noting that failure to appreciate this distinction has led to analytical confusion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the policy states that coverage is provided for damages as a result of \"bodily injury or ... property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\"   The policy limits property damage to damage occurring within the policy period.  Travelers argues that there was no property damage during its policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Travelers policy only insured the Silresim and Charles George sites, and only for the period lasting from April 1975 until July 1976.  Travelers points out that Millipore seeks coverage for damages arising out of events taking place at the Silresim site between 1977 and 1983, and at the Charles George site in 1980.  These occurrences postdated the end of the Travelers policy period, and Travelers argues that there could have been no damage during the policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is complicated somewhat by the fact that Massachusetts has not yet ruled on the proper approach to take in determining whether there has been actual property damage during the policy period.  This was one of the questions certified to the SJC in Belleville I, but that court declined to answer the question due to an insufficient factual record, and the issue remains open.  Belleville I, 555 N.E.2d at 575 &amp; n. 9. The Belleville I court did note that there are five viable approaches:  the release theory, the injury-in-fact theory, the manifestation theory, the first discovery theory, and the continuous trigger theory.  Id. at 575-76.   Here, we need not predict which approach Massachusetts would adopt, as Millipore has not demonstrated that there were any occurrences during the Travelers policy period under any of the possible approaches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insured bears the burden of proving coverage, see, e.g., United States Liab.  Ins. Co. v. Selman, 70 F.3d 684, 688 (1st Cir.1995), and Millipore essentially conceded at oral argument that it had not met its burden of proving that any damage occurred during the Travelers policy period.  Instead, Millipore argued that it should be allowed on remand to put in additional evidence of abrupt and unexpected events, such as fires, that occurred before or during the policy period and that could have caused harm during the policy period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Millipore, however, had ample opportunity to create a record, and there has been no intervening clarification of the governing law.  Travelers first raised the \"occurrence\" argument in its answer to the complaint, putting Millipore on notice that it was contesting whether there was harm during the policy period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Travelers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>The Pollution Exclusion Clauses Under Massachusetts Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To analyze INA and Hartford's argument, we turn to the pollution exclusion clause under Massachusetts law, particularly in light of the recently decided cases of Nashua Corp. v. First State Insurance Co., 420 Mass. 196, 648 N.E.2d 1272 (1995) and Highlands Insurance Co. v. Aerovox Inc., 424 Mass. 226, 676 N.E.2d 801 (1997).  Nashua Corp. was decided after Judge Zobel granted summary judgment against Millipore;  Aerovox while this appeal was pending.  Prior to Nashua Corp. and Aerovox, the SJC had issued several decisions construing pollution exclusion clauses in insurance contracts, establishing general principles.  However, it was unclear under what circumstances damage due to the release of pollutants on particular occasions would be covered under the sudden and accidental exception to the pollution exclusion clause if the insured had also engaged in pollution-generating activities not subject to the exception over a longer period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC had ruled that \"[t]he sudden event to which the exception in the pollution exclusion clause applies concerns neither the cause of the release of a pollutant nor the damage caused by the release.  It is the release of pollutants itself that must have occurred suddenly, if the exception is to apply....\" ....\"  Belleville I, 555 N.E.2d at 571.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  The focus is therefore on the circumstances of the release.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the meaning of the term \"sudden\" the word has a temporal element, and so the release of pollutants must be abrupt (as well as accidental) for there to be coverage.  Id., 555 N.E.2d at 572.   The SJC further explained that a discharge continuing over an extended period of time would likely cease to be sudden.  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. SCA Servs., Inc., 412 Mass. 330, 588 N.E.2d 1346, 1350 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the word \"accidental,\" the SJC ruled that, even if the insured did not intend the discharge of pollutants, releases of pollutants are not sudden and accidental when the insured turned the waste over to a waste processor who intentionally discharged the pollutants.  Polaroid Corp., 610 N.E.2d at 915-16.   This court held that, under Massachusetts law, events \"not clearly beyond ... long-range reasonable expectation[s]\" cannot be considered accidental.  Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Belleville Indus., Inc., 938 F.2d 1423, 1427 (1st Cir.1991) (Belleville II ).   The Belleville II court raised but declined to answer the question at the heart of this case:  \"When, in the case of an insured whose operations involve a likelihood of continuing polluting releases, a court might properly identify a sudden release so beyond the pale of reasonable expectability as to be considered 'accidental,' we need not decide.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on this body of caselaw, Judge Zobel sensibly concluded that the exception to the pollution exclusion clause is not applicable if the harm is caused by waste intentionally sent to a landfill.  However, Nashua Corp. and Aerovox, decided after her decision, make clear that the exception to the pollution exclusion clause may have some force even in the context of a \"pollution-prone industry.\"  Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806 n. 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Nashua Corp., the SJC ruled that, notwithstanding a company's history of routinely delivering hazardous waste to a landfill, evidence of a subsequent unexpected and abrupt release of a significant amount of pollutants into the environment may sometimes defeat the insurer's motion for summary judgment based on the pollution exclusion clause.  Nashua Corp., 648 N.E.2d at 1276.   The test set forth in Nashua Corp. draws on the reasoning in Belleville II and focuses on the whether the triggering event is common or uncommon.  Id. Specifically, the Nashua Corp. court found that evidence of a burst tank seal at one site and a fire and subsequent explosion at another site (Silresim) created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the relevant releases were sudden and accidental.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court in Aerovox reaffirmed the principles set forth in Nashua Corp., explaining that the test is whether the triggering event is \"so beyond the pale of reasonable expectability as to be considered 'accidental.' \"  Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806 n. 10.  Aerovox further held that \"the insured must bear the burden of proving that the contamination was caused by a sudden and accidental release.\"  Id. at 805.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aerovox focused on whether the damage resulting from a release which might meet Nashua Corp.'s sudden and accidental test in fact led to any identifiable damages that were more than de minimis.  After Aerovox, an insured, to survive a motion for summary judgment, must \"raise a factual issue as to whether the sudden and accidental release caused an appreciable amount of the damage for which it is being held liable.\"  Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these intervening cases, we think there was error in the denial of the motion for reconsideration.  Nashua Corp. and Aerovox are significant decisions, raising the possibility of at least partial insurance recovery where many thought, based on prior law, that no such possibility existed.  Aerovox arguably requires a new level of precision in proving a causal connection between a particular event and particular damages.  The parties are entitled to have their arguments viewed in this new light.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurers ask that we nevertheless affirm the grant of summary judgment based on the factual record which was submitted to Judge Zobel before the clarification of the law occasioned by Nashua Corp. and Aerovox.   The insurers rely on the fact that in Aerovox, the SJC, as a matter of state law, granted summary judgment against the insured, even though the record was compiled before that parties had the benefit of the Nashua Corp. decision.  The insurers argue with some merit that the affidavits submitted by Millipore relating to the three Massachusetts sites are no more precise than those found wanting by the SJC in Aerovox;  they argue with less merit that affidavits Millipore submitted as to the New Jersey sites suffer from similar weaknesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline the insurers' invitation for two reasons.  The first is that these initial judgments as to the adequacy of a record on summary judgment are better made by the trial court in the first instance.  See, e.g., Vicknair v. Formosa Plastics Corp., 98 F.3d 837, 839 (5th Cir.1996) (vacating and remanding for prudential reasons in light of changed law to afford the trial court the first opportunity to apply new law to the facts of the case);  Satcher v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., 993 F.2d 56, 57 (5th Cir.1993) (\"The district court, with its extensive knowledge of the facts and proceedings in this case, is in a far better position than are we to address and to first apply\" new caselaw.);   cf. Thomas v. American Home Prods., Inc., --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 282, 136 L.Ed.2d 201 (1996) (mem.)  (explaining the Court's practice of vacating and remanding in light of changed state law).  The second reason for remand is that we think the better, fairer outcome is to permit the parties to make new submissions, if they wish, in light of the significant intervening clarification of the law.  See, e.g., Naturist Society, Inc. v. Fillyaw, 958 F.2d 1515, 1524 (11th Cir.1992) (finding it \"inappropriate\" to consider parties claims' without further factfinding in light of newly amended state regulations);  Brinley v. Commissioner, 782 F.2d 1326 (5th Cir.1986) (\"justice requires\" remand to allow submission of additional evidence in light of newly announced legal standard).  The district court may wish to keep the parties on a short leash as to the timing of any further submissions.  We do not suggest that the parties are entitled to any more discovery:  after almost six years of litigation, they should know their cases and be prepared to make their best showings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We wish to be clear.  To survive the motions for summary judgment, Millipore must present specific evidence creating a genuine issue as to whether the incidents at the sites were sudden and accidental and caused more than a de minimis release of pollutants into the environment.  See Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806.   To the extent that Millipore chooses to rely on expert opinions, they must be more than \"conclusory assertion[s] about ultimate legal issues.\"  Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., 8 F.3d 88, 92 (1st Cir.1993).  We are \"not willing to allow the reliance on a bare ultimate expert conclusion to become a free pass to trial.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this partial victory proves Pyrrhic for Millipore remains to be seen--the costs of insurance coverage litigation may sometimes outstrip the small amount of damages that an insured may be able to prove lie outside the pollution exclusion clause.  The parties may wish to consider whether their best interests lie in a solution by agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Reimbursement for Defense Costs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there are the insurers' counterclaims for reimbursement for money paid to Millipore for its defense costs in the underlying Charles George and Cooper suits.  INA and Travelers contend that the district court's decision to enter judgment in favor of Millipore on the counterclaims was based on the erroneous assumption that the insurers had a duty to defend Millipore until the district court issued its opinion stating that the pollution exclusion clause precluded coverage here.  The insurers argue that, since they never had a duty to defend or indemnify Millipore, and since they reserved the right to reimbursement for any defense costs paid to Millipore, they are entitled to recover in full the sums they paid to Millipore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, an insurer's duty to defend an insured is more expansive than its duty to indemnify.  Boston Symphony Orchestra v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 406 Mass. 7, 545 N.E.2d 1156, 1158 (1989).  The duty to defend is antecedent to, and independent of, the duty to indemnify;  the obligation of the insurer to defend is not determined \"by reference to the facts proven at trial.  Rather, the duty to defend is based on the facts alleged in the complaint....\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test for determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend is well-established.  Whether there is such a duty is decided by:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>matching the third-party complaint with the policy provisions:  if the allegations of the complaint are 'reasonably susceptible' of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. SCA Servs., 412 Mass. 330, 588 N.E.2d 1346, 1347 (1992) (quoting Sterilite Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co., 17 Mass.App.Ct. 316, 458 N.E.2d 338, 340 (1983)).  Another way of putting the point is that there is no duty to defend if, at the time the claims were advanced, the insurer \"could reasonably have concluded that no aspect of the ... claims\" fell within the scope of coverage.  Polaroid Corp., 610 N.E.2d at 916.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the complaints against Millipore involving the Charles George and Cooper sites are reasonably interpreted as stating claims covered under the INA policies.  The complaints allege claims pursuant to CERCLA and other federal and state statutes arising out of Millipore's generation of hazardous wastes disposed of at the Charles George site and the spillage of trichloroethylene at the Cooper site.  These events are clearly occurrences under the INA policies, and while the resulting damage is pollution related, it at least arguably falls under the exception to the pollution exclusion clause.  This conclusion is a corollary of our decision to vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand to the district court.  The possibility of coverage is sufficient to trigger the duty to defend.  Sterilite Corp., 458 N.E.2d at 341.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers' counterclaim presents a more difficult question, but on balance we agree with the district court's finding that Travelers had a duty to defend Millipore in the underlying Charles George action.  The amended complaints filed by the United States and the Commonwealth in the underlying Charles George action allege that between, at least 1971 and 1983, a landfill was operated at the Charles George site, and that, between at least 1973 and 1976, hazardous wastes were disposed of there.  Millipore, among others, is alleged to have generated hazardous substances that were disposed of at the site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Travelers policy provides coverage for the period between April 1975 and July 1976, and thus, according to the complaints of the United States and the Commonwealth, covers part of the time during which hazardous wastes were shipped to the landfill.  The facts alleged in the complaint raised the possibility that some of the property damage at the Charles George site occurred within the policy period.  The later determination that Millipore has not met its burden of showing an occurrence during the policy period does not negate the duty to defend, which grows out of the allegations in the complaint against the insured.  Boston Symphony Orchestra, 545 N.E.2d at 1158;  Nashua Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 1997 WL 89163 (Mass.Super.Ct. Feb. 18, 1997) (\"[W]here a complaint is susceptible on its face of a reading that brings the claim within the policy, the insurer cannot rely on facts outside the complaint to justify a unilateral refusal to defend.\").  And the complaints are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation under which the releases of pollutants were not, in the language of the Travelers policy, \"either expected or intended from the standpoint of any insured, or any person or organization for whose acts or omissions any insured is liable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Travelers pollution exclusion clause also precludes coverage for damage \"resulting from or contributed to by any condition in violation of or noncompliance with any governmental rule, regulation, or law applicable thereto.\"   The government complaints refer to the Commonwealth's action against the operators of the Charles George Landfill for violations of state environmental laws and regulations, and to improper disposal of waste at the site.  This raises the distinct possibility that some of the claims would be precluded from coverage on this basis.  However, although the question is a close one, we do not believe that the complaints could reasonably have led Travelers to conclude that no aspect of the claims fell within the scope of coverage.  See Polaroid Corp., 610 N.E.2d at 916.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Note, supra, at 174-75.   The problem, however, was not merely CERCLA's retroactivity.

That is the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Underlying this lawsuit is the cleanup of five hazardous waste sites, three in Massachusetts and two in New Jersey.  Millipore Corporation was one of the sources of waste at the sites, and was a defendant in several actions alleging violations of federal and state environmental laws.  Millipore defended these suits and incurred liability as to some of the sites.  It may ultimately be responsible for contributing to the remediation costs of the other sites as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary issue here is whether the district court erred in entering summary judgment for the insurers (and then denying reconsideration) on the ground that none of Millipore's CERCLA liability is covered under any of the comprehensive general liability (\"CGL\") policies Millipore carried during the relevant periods.  In considering this question, we must address, among other things, the \"pollution exclusion\" provisions of the insurance policies, which preclude coverage for pollution-related claims unless the release of pollutants was \"sudden and accidental.\"   Based on recent developments in Massachusetts environmental insurance law, we vacate in part the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that New Jersey law applies to claims under policies issued to a New Jersey corporation later acquired by Millipore, and that summary judgment was properly entered in favor of one of Millipore's insurers, Travelers Indemnity Company, because Millipore failed to produce evidence of an occurrence within the Travelers policy period.  Finally, we hold that Millipore was entitled to summary judgment on the insurers' counterclaims for reimbursement for defense costs paid to Millipore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurance coverage issues involved in this case are best understood in context.  CERCLA, which was enacted in 1980, is the primary federal statutory scheme regulating hazardous waste cleanups.  Some states have enacted their own regimes as well.  CERCLA imposes liability for the costs of cleaning up hazardous waste sites and for the loss of natural resources due to pollution on three categories of potentially responsible parties (\"PRPs\"):  past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, some companies that transported waste to these sites, and companies that generated waste disposed of at these sites.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 9607(a).

Millipore has its corporate headquarters as well as a manufacturing facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, with other Massachusetts manufacturing facilities in Milford and Taunton.  Millipore disposed of its manufacturing wastes at several different sites in Massachusetts, including the Silresim Waste Reclamation and Disposal Facility in Lowell, the Charles George Landfill in Tyngsboro, and the Re-Solve Waste Reclamation and Disposal Facility in North Dartmouth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between December 1975 and March 1982, Millipore owned the Worthington Biochemical Corporation, located in Freehold, New Jersey, which produced research enzymes and related chemicals.  The Worthington manufacturing process involved the use of substances defined as hazardous, including trichloroethylene and freons.  Worthington disposed of much of its waste materials at the Lone Pine Landfill in Freehold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All four of these sites where Millipore and Worthington disposed of their wastes have a history of contaminating neighboring land and water.  These troubled sites share numerous similarities involving poor design and sloppy operations.  At the Silresim site, chemicals dumped into the disposal pit regularly seeped through the concrete lining of the pit into the ground.  In 1973, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts required the operators of the site to find a solution to the problem of contaminated runoff.  The landfill operators failed to do so, and also committed numerous violations of state regulations between 1973 and 1975.  The Commonwealth made continued operation of the facility contingent upon regulatory compliance.  The operators filed for bankruptcy, leading to the revocation of their operating permit in 1977.  They abandoned the site later that year.  Raging chemical fires swept the site in October 1977, August 1978, and again in April 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, Millipore received notification from the EPA that it was a PRP with respect to the Silresim site.  Later that year, in December, Massachusetts initiated a legal action in federal court under CERCLA and various state environmental laws.  See Commonwealth v. Pace, No. 83-3883-G (complaint filed in District of Massachusetts).  It sought to recover cleanup costs from more than 200 companies that had used the Silresim site, including Millipore and Waters Associates, which Millipore had purchased in 1980.  In December 1983, Millipore was also named as a defendant in a similar case brought by the federal government.  United States v. General Chem.  Corp., No. 92-10923-T (complaint filed in District of Massachusetts).  Shortly thereafter, Millipore and others paid the Commonwealth $2 million in settlement, and entered into a consent decree in the federal action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The operators of the Charles George Landfill also committed numerous infractions of state environmental regulations.  During inspections of the landfill in 1971 and 1975, the Commonwealth discovered leachate<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> emanating from the landfill.  By September 1976, leachate had contaminated three of the four groundwater basins at the site, and the surrounding wetlands were polluted by runoff from the facility.  The situation was exacerbated when, on June 12, 1980, a fire broke out and burned until July 9. Millions of gallons of water were poured onto the landfill to extinguish the fire, generating toxic leachate and causing the water table to rise temporarily.  In June 1983, the Commonwealth filed suit in state court to bring landfill operations into compliance with state law.  The landfill was ultimately closed by court order later in 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States and the Commonwealth filed separate suits in 1985 against the Charles George Trucking Company, an owner-operator of the landfill, and others.  The complaints alleged violation of CERCLA and other federal and state laws, and sought, among other things, past and future costs of cleaning up the landfill.  In 1986, the EPA notified Millipore that it was a PRP with respect to the Charles George site, and in 1989 Millipore was added as a defendant in two consolidated cases in the District of Massachusetts entitled United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., No. 85-2463-WD, and Commonwealth v.  Charles George Trucking Co., No. 85-2714.   A consent decree was ultimately entered into, and was upheld in United States v.

In October 1958, an explosive blaze destroyed much of the facility.  It eventually re-opened, but from the early 1970's on, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) (now the Department of Environmental Protection) was actively involved in monitoring the site.  The EPA also eventually began an investigation.  The site was a significant source of pollution.  The sides of the waste lagoons at the site were not effectively sealed, which allowed pollutants to seep out.  In addition, rain routinely caused the lagoons to overflow into the neighboring wetlands.  Millipore was named a PRP, and the United States filed a CERCLA action to recover the costs of cleaning up the site, naming as defendants some 225 companies, including Millipore, which had sent waste to the facility.  In 1988, Millipore entered into a consent decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the Lone Pine Landfill in New Jersey, rain regularly caused contaminated runoff to drain directly into the nearby Marasquan River.  Toxic waste was buried in unlined pits, which allowed seepage into the surrounding soil.  In addition, decomposing garbage routinely caused fires and even explosions.  After a particularly harmful chemical fire in 1978, New Jersey environmental officials issued an administrative order to mitigate the damage.  After noncompliance with the order, the landfill was ordered closed the following year.  Millipore and Worthington were each designated as a PRP, in 1985 and 1990 respectively.  In 1989, Millipore and the EPA entered into a consent decree involving on-site remediation, and in 1991, Millipore and the EPA entered into a second consent decree involving off-site remediation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were also environmental problems at the Worthington plant itself.  In 1976 or 1977, a freeze drier line at the plant ruptured, causing no more than 60 gallons of trichloroethylene to be released into drains leading to an onsite wastewater treatment facility.  From there, the trichloroethylene evidently made its way into the soil and groundwater and migrated off site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore sold Worthington's assets in 1982 to Flow General, which in 1983 sold the assets to Cooper BioMedical, Inc. In 1986, Cooper performed an environmental assessment which disclosed trichloroethylene contamination.  Cooper took remedial measures, and in 1990 instituted a CERCLA action against Millipore, seeking reimbursement for costs associated with the cleanup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to each of these sites, Millipore sought coverage under its CGL policies and those of Worthington and Waters, two potentially liable subsidiaries.  Where, as here, CERCLA liability arises out of a PRP's operations over the course of many years, it often implicates general liability policies issued by several different insurers.  Ostrager &amp; Newman, supra, &#167; 10.01, at 404.  A Travelers Indemnity Company policy issued to Millipore covered damage occurring between April 1975 and July 1976.  A Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company policy issued to Millipore covered damage occurring between July 1976 and May 1977.  Hartford also issued a general liability policy covering the period between August 1974 and May 1977 to Worthington Biochemical Corporation;  Millipore purchased Worthington in 1975.  And Hartford issued two one-year liability policies covering the period between January 1975 and January 1977 to Waters Associates, a Massachusetts company purchased by Millipore in 1980.  Finally, Insurance Company of North America (\"INA\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> issued eight general liability policies to Millipore covering the period between May 1977 and January 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hartford and INA policies contained the standard pollution clause, quoted above, generally contained in CGL policies between 1970 and 1985.  The language of the pollution exclusion provision in the Travelers policy is somewhat different in ways we need not address at this juncture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore sent notice to the insurers regarding the Silresim site in 1983, the Re-Solve site in 1984, the Charles George and Lone Pine sites in 1989, and the Cooper site in 1990.  The insurers responded that they planned to investigate whether Millipore's claims were covered under its CGL policies.  In September 1990, INA acknowledged receipt of Millipore's notice of loss for the Cooper facility (formerly the Worthington plant) and paid Millipore a share of the defense costs in the underlying litigation, but expressly reserved all rights under the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Millipore and its insurers then disagreed about payment of the costs incurred by Millipore in litigating the underlying action involving the Charles George site.  After lengthy negotiations, they entered into an interim agreement in January 1993, under which the insurers would pay the defense costs but reserved the right to seek reimbursement if it was later determined that they had no duty to defend or indemnify Millipore.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Apparently, the insurers paid no defense costs relating to the other three sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore brought suit against the insurers in five separate federal court actions, one for each site, seeking the full costs of defending the underlying actions, indemnification for its liability, and damages for unfair and deceptive insurance practices.  All three insurers were named as defendants in the cases involving the Silresim and Charles George sites.  INA and Hartford were the named defendants in the cases involving the Lone Pine and Cooper sites, while INA was the only defendant named in the case involving the Re-Solve site.  Otherwise, the pleadings in all five cases are substantially identical.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurers responded that the pollution exclusion provisions in the insurance policies defeated coverage and counterclaimed for reimbursement of the defense costs already paid to Millipore for the Charles George and Cooper sites.

Judge Zobel granted the insurers' motion in March 1995.  She first rejected Millipore's argument that New Jersey substantive law should apply to the sites in New Jersey.  She noted that \"[t]he Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has articulated a clear preference for the law of one state to interpret multistate comprehensive general liability policies,\" and reasoned that, \"[a]s the place of plaintiff's incorporation and its principal place of business, Massachusetts has the most significant interest in this lawsuit.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Zobel also agreed with the insurers' argument that the pollution exclusion clauses preclude coverage.  She stated that \"a survey of the current caselaw suggests that it is the initial release, not subsequent leakage or damage from that release which determines the issue.\"   She went on to conclude that \"the initial releases of pollutants into the landfills ... do not fall within the meaning of 'sudden and accidental' as defined in the caselaw,\" because Millipore's \"waste disposal practices were a routine aspect of business activity.\"   The case subsequently was transferred to Judge George O'Toole when Judge Zobel became head of the Federal Judicial Center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore moved for reconsideration on May 5, 1995 in light of new Massachusetts caselaw.  On May 2, 1995, the Supreme Judicial Court handed down Nashua Corp. v. First State Insurance Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></span> (1995), construing a pollution exclusion clause in a case involving an insurance dispute between another company that disposed of waste at the Silresim facility and its liability insurer.  Nashua Corp. held that, notwithstanding the history of routine polluting activities by the operator of the Silresim site, the evidence presented of a fire and subsequent explosion at Silresim defeated the insurer's motion for summary judgment based on the pollution exclusion.  Id., 648 N.E.2d at 1275-76.   The court reasoned that the fire and explosion caused the sudden and accidental release of pollutants into the environment, thus placing the resulting damage into the exception to the pollution exclusion clause.  Millipore argued that the same fire and explosion at Silresim placed its resulting CERCLA liability within the exception to the exclusion as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion for reconsideration in November 1995.  Judge O'Toole held that Nashua Corp. did not represent a change in Massachusetts substantive law and therefore that reconsideration was not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurers then moved for summary judgment on Millipore's remaining claims and on the counterclaims for reimbursement for Millipore's defense costs.  The district court dismissed the breach of contract and bad faith insurance practices claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court ruled against the insurers on their counterclaims, granting summary judgment in favor of Millipore, on the theory that the insurers' duty to defend is more expansive than their duty to indemnify.  The court reasoned that a finding that an insurer is not contractually obligated to indemnify an insured does not necessarily relieve the insurer of its duty to shoulder the burden of defense, concluding that the insurers incurred the defense costs in fulfilling their contractual obligations and were thus not entitled to reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Millipore now appeals, arguing that New Jersey law governs the two New Jersey sites, and that under Nashua Corp., the evidence that fires and other accidental events caused the sudden and accidental release of pollutants created a genuine issue of material fact, making a grant of summary judgment inappropriate.  INA and Travelers (but not Hartford) cross-appeal from the district court's entry of judgment for Millipore on their counterclaims for reimbursement for defense costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Choice of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute which state's law applies as to Counts I and II,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> so we turn to Massachusetts choice of law principles.

Millipore argues that the law of New Jersey should govern the dispute involving the New Jersey sites, while the insurers contend that the law of Massachusetts should be applied to the entire case.  Our review of the district court's choice of law determination is de novo.  In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195866\"><a href=\"/opinion/195866/in-re-san-juan-v-lyon/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 576 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first step in performing a choice of law analysis is to determine whether there is a conflict between the substantive laws of the interested jurisdictions.  New Jersey insurance law recognizes the doctrine of regulatory estoppel, which in this context limits the applicability of the pollution exclusion clause as a result of misrepresentations allegedly made by the insurance industry to insurance regulators about the purpose and scope of the clause.  Under New Jersey law, the meaning of the pollution exclusion clause is limited by the insurance industry's official explanation for its 1970 revisions to the standard CGL policy.  Consequently, the pollution exclusion clause is construed to \"provide coverage identical with that provided under the prior occurrence-based policy, except that the clause [is] interpreted to preclude coverage in cases in which the insured intentionally discharges a known pollutant, irrespective of whether the resulting property damage was intended or expected.\"  Morton Int'l, Inc. v.

Within this legal framework, Millipore would be entitled to coverage for its CERCLA liability if it could prove that it never intentionally discharged a known pollutant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the pollution exclusion clause is interpreted much more expansively under Massachusetts law.  The SJC has never recognized New Jersey's doctrine of regulatory estoppel in this context, and there is no indication that Massachusetts would adopt the doctrine.  Indeed, in Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Belleville Industries, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088788\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088788/lumbermens-mutual-casualty-v-belleville-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088788\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088788/lumbermens-mutual-casualty-v-belleville-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span> (1990) (\"Belleville I \"), the SJC refused to consider the drafting history of the pollution exclusion clause in determining the meaning of the term 'sudden' in the clause.  The court reasoned that the term is unambiguous and therefore that no extrinsic evidence is necessary to understand its meaning.  Belleville I, 555 N.E.2d at 573;  see also Polaroid Corp. v.

The SJC reasoned that the expectations of the parties as well as commercial realities require that the language in a single set of insurance policies should mean the same thing in every state.  United Techs., 555 N.E.2d at 227 &amp; n. 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, one jurisdiction's rules of decision must be applied to all of the sites covered under multistate CGL policies.  Here, the state with the strongest interest in seeing its substantive law applied to all of the sites is Massachusetts.  Massachusetts is Millipore's state of incorporation and its principal place of business.  Most of the policies were negotiated and administered in and around Boston.  Three of the five sites are in Massachusetts.  We affirm the district court's decision to apply Massachusetts law to the disputes involving coverage under multistate CGL policies issued directly to Millipore of liability at the New Jersey as well as at the Massachusetts sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy Hartford issued to Worthington before it was acquired by Millipore is not, however, a multistate CGL policy and so is not necessarily governed by the choice of law rules set forth by the SJC for such policies.  Instead, we look again to Massachusetts choice of law rules for guidance on the issue of what law should apply to the insurance disputes involving this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An important consideration is the expectation of the parties at the time the policy was issued.  It is significant that Millipore only acquired Worthington after Hartford had issued the policy under which coverage is disputed.  At the time the policy was issued, Worthington's principal place of business was in New Jersey, as are the covered sites.  Both Worthington and Hartford would reasonably have expected New Jersey law to govern the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, New Jersey has a strong interest in the integrity of its insurance regulatory process.  In Morton, the highest court of New Jersey evinced its belief that limiting the scope of the pollution exclusion clause advances that interest.  Morton, 629 A.2d at 875.  Morton also indicates that New Jersey public policy favors the protection of New Jersey insureds, id.;   Worthington was such an insured at the time the Hartford policy was issued.  New Jersey thus has a strong interest in seeing its law applied to this controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that applying New Jersey law in this instance would not advance the interest in uniformity.  At first blush it may seem somewhat anomalous to have the laws of different states govern very similar CGL policies providing coverage to the same sites.  However, Worthington and Millipore were unrelated entities at the time the Hartford policy was issued;  the expectations of the parties and the legitimate interests of New Jersey should not be defeated by the fortuity of the subsequent purchase.  We reverse the district court's decision to apply Massachusetts law to the disputes involving the policy Hartford issued to Worthington, and we hold that New Jersey law applies to that policy.  Thus, as to the New Jersey sites covered under the policy Hartford issued to Worthington, we remand, without further discussion of the facts concerning the releases or the policy language, for consideration of liability on Counts I and III under New Jersey law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Travelers' Coverage Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers' primary argument in support of its motion for summary judgment is distinct from that of the other two insurers.  This argument involves the first step in determining whether CERCLA liability is covered under a CGL policy, that is, whether there was an \"occurrence\" within the meaning of the policy.  That determination is distinct from the determination of whether there was a sudden and accidental event within the meaning of the pollution exclusion clause:  the focus in the former inquiry is on whether there was property damage during the policy period, while in the latter it is on the circumstances of the release.  Belleville I, 555 N.E.2d at 571 (noting that failure to appreciate this distinction has led to analytical confusion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the policy states that coverage is provided for damages as a result of \"bodily injury or ... property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\"   The policy limits property damage to damage occurring within the policy period.  Travelers argues that there was no property damage during its policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Travelers policy only insured the Silresim and Charles George sites, and only for the period lasting from April 1975 until July 1976.  Travelers points out that Millipore seeks coverage for damages arising out of events taking place at the Silresim site between 1977 and 1983, and at the Charles George site in 1980.  These occurrences postdated the end of the Travelers policy period, and Travelers argues that there could have been no damage during the policy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is complicated somewhat by the fact that Massachusetts has not yet ruled on the proper approach to take in determining whether there has been actual property damage during the policy period.  This was one of the questions certified to the SJC in Belleville I, but that court declined to answer the question due to an insufficient factual record, and the issue remains open.  Belleville I, 555 N.E.2d at 575 &amp; n. 9. The Belleville I court did note that there are five viable approaches:  the release theory, the injury-in-fact theory, the manifestation theory, the first discovery theory, and the continuous trigger theory.  Id. at 575-76.   Here, we need not predict which approach Massachusetts would adopt, as Millipore has not demonstrated that there were any occurrences during the Travelers policy period under any of the possible approaches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insured bears the burden of proving coverage, see, e.g., United States Liab.

Nashua Corp. was decided after Judge Zobel granted summary judgment against Millipore;  Aerovox while this appeal was pending.  Prior to Nashua Corp. and Aerovox, the SJC had issued several decisions construing pollution exclusion clauses in insurance contracts, establishing general principles.  However, it was unclear under what circumstances damage due to the release of pollutants on particular occasions would be covered under the sudden and accidental exception to the pollution exclusion clause if the insured had also engaged in pollution-generating activities not subject to the exception over a longer period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC had ruled that \"[t]he sudden event to which the exception in the pollution exclusion clause applies concerns neither the cause of the release of a pollutant nor the damage caused by the release.

Polaroid Corp., 610 N.E.2d at 915-16.   This court held that, under Massachusetts law, events \"not clearly beyond ... long-range reasonable expectation[s]\" cannot be considered accidental.

The Belleville II court raised but declined to answer the question at the heart of this case:  \"When, in the case of an insured whose operations involve a likelihood of continuing polluting releases, a court might properly identify a sudden release so beyond the pale of reasonable expectability as to be considered 'accidental,' we need not decide.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on this body of caselaw, Judge Zobel sensibly concluded that the exception to the pollution exclusion clause is not applicable if the harm is caused by waste intentionally sent to a landfill.  However, Nashua Corp. and Aerovox, decided after her decision, make clear that the exception to the pollution exclusion clause may have some force even in the context of a \"pollution-prone industry.\"  Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806 n. 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Nashua Corp., the SJC ruled that, notwithstanding a company's history of routinely delivering hazardous waste to a landfill, evidence of a subsequent unexpected and abrupt release of a significant amount of pollutants into the environment may sometimes defeat the insurer's motion for summary judgment based on the pollution exclusion clause.  Nashua Corp., 648 N.E.2d at 1276.   The test set forth in Nashua Corp. draws on the reasoning in Belleville II and focuses on the whether the triggering event is common or uncommon.  Id. Specifically, the Nashua Corp. court found that evidence of a burst tank seal at one site and a fire and subsequent explosion at another site (Silresim) created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the relevant releases were sudden and accidental.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court in Aerovox reaffirmed the principles set forth in Nashua Corp., explaining that the test is whether the triggering event is \"so beyond the pale of reasonable expectability as to be considered 'accidental.' \"  Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806 n. 10.  Aerovox further held that \"the insured must bear the burden of proving that the contamination was caused by a sudden and accidental release.\"  Id. at 805.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aerovox focused on whether the damage resulting from a release which might meet Nashua Corp.'s sudden and accidental test in fact led to any identifiable damages that were more than de minimis.  After Aerovox, an insured, to survive a motion for summary judgment, must \"raise a factual issue as to whether the sudden and accidental release caused an appreciable amount of the damage for which it is being held liable.\"  Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these intervening cases, we think there was error in the denial of the motion for reconsideration.  Nashua Corp. and Aerovox are significant decisions, raising the possibility of at least partial insurance recovery where many thought, based on prior law, that no such possibility existed.  Aerovox arguably requires a new level of precision in proving a causal connection between a particular event and particular damages.  The parties are entitled to have their arguments viewed in this new light.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insurers ask that we nevertheless affirm the grant of summary judgment based on the factual record which was submitted to Judge Zobel before the clarification of the law occasioned by Nashua Corp. and Aerovox.   The insurers rely on the fact that in Aerovox, the SJC, as a matter of state law, granted summary judgment against the insured, even though the record was compiled before that parties had the benefit of the Nashua Corp. decision.  The insurers argue with some merit that the affidavits submitted by Millipore relating to the three Massachusetts sites are no more precise than those found wanting by the SJC in Aerovox;  they argue with less merit that affidavits Millipore submitted as to the New Jersey sites suffer from similar weaknesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline the insurers' invitation for two reasons.  The first is that these initial judgments as to the adequacy of a record on summary judgment are better made by the trial court in the first instance.  See, e.g., Vicknair v. Formosa Plastics Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728102\"><a href=\"/opinion/728102/dalton-vicknair-francis-ann-vicknair-v-formosa-plastics-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 839 (5th Cir.1996) (vacating and remanding for prudential reasons in light of changed law to afford the trial court the first opportunity to apply new law to the facts of the case);  Satcher v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></span> (1996) (mem.)  (explaining the Court's practice of vacating and remanding in light of changed state law).  The second reason for remand is that we think the better, fairer outcome is to permit the parties to make new submissions, if they wish, in light of the significant intervening clarification of the law.  See, e.g., Naturist Society, Inc. v. Fillyaw, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579474\"><a href=\"/opinion/579474/the-naturist-society-inc-ta-wyner-v-john-fillyaw-individually-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1515</span></a></span>, 1524 (11th Cir.1992) (finding it \"inappropriate\" to consider parties claims' without further factfinding in light of newly amended state regulations);  Brinley v.

The district court may wish to keep the parties on a short leash as to the timing of any further submissions.  We do not suggest that the parties are entitled to any more discovery:  after almost six years of litigation, they should know their cases and be prepared to make their best showings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We wish to be clear.  To survive the motions for summary judgment, Millipore must present specific evidence creating a genuine issue as to whether the incidents at the sites were sudden and accidental and caused more than a de minimis release of pollutants into the environment.  See Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806.   To the extent that Millipore chooses to rely on expert opinions, they must be more than \"conclusory assertion[s] about ultimate legal issues.\"  Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656105\"><a href=\"/opinion/656105/prodliabrep-cch-p-13686-mary-hayes-administrator-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.1993).  We are \"not willing to allow the reliance on a bare ultimate expert conclusion to become a free pass to trial.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this partial victory proves Pyrrhic for Millipore remains to be seen--the costs of insurance coverage litigation may sometimes outstrip the small amount of damages that an insured may be able to prove lie outside the pollution exclusion clause.  The parties may wish to consider whether their best interests lie in a solution by agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Reimbursement for Defense Costs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there are the insurers' counterclaims for reimbursement for money paid to Millipore for its defense costs in the underlying Charles George and Cooper suits.  INA and Travelers contend that the district court's decision to enter judgment in favor of Millipore on the counterclaims was based on the erroneous assumption that the insurers had a duty to defend Millipore until the district court issued its opinion stating that the pollution exclusion clause precluded coverage here.  The insurers argue that, since they never had a duty to defend or indemnify Millipore, and since they reserved the right to reimbursement for any defense costs paid to Millipore, they are entitled to recover in full the sums they paid to Millipore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, an insurer's duty to defend an insured is more expansive than its duty to indemnify.

Another way of putting the point is that there is no duty to defend if, at the time the claims were advanced, the insurer \"could reasonably have concluded that no aspect of the ... claims\" fell within the scope of coverage.

The complaints allege claims pursuant to CERCLA and other federal and state statutes arising out of Millipore's generation of hazardous wastes disposed of at the Charles George site and the spillage of trichloroethylene at the Cooper site.  These events are clearly occurrences under the INA policies, and while the resulting damage is pollution related, it at least arguably falls under the exception to the pollution exclusion clause.  This conclusion is a corollary of our decision to vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand to the district court.  The possibility of coverage is sufficient to trigger the duty to defend.

The amended complaints filed by the United States and the Commonwealth in the underlying Charles George action allege that between, at least 1971 and 1983, a landfill was operated at the Charles George site, and that, between at least 1973 and 1976, hazardous wastes were disposed of there.  Millipore, among others, is alleged to have generated hazardous substances that were disposed of at the site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Travelers policy provides coverage for the period between April 1975 and July 1976, and thus, according to the complaints of the United States and the Commonwealth, covers part of the time during which hazardous wastes were shipped to the landfill.  The facts alleged in the complaint raised the possibility that some of the property damage at the Charles George site occurred within the policy period.  The later determination that Millipore has not met its burden of showing an occurrence during the policy period does not negate the duty to defend, which grows out of the allegations in the complaint against the insured.  Boston Symphony Orchestra, 545 N.E.2d at 1158;  Nashua Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins.

Feb. 18, 1997) (\"[W]here a complaint is susceptible on its face of a reading that brings the claim within the policy, the insurer cannot rely on facts outside the complaint to justify a unilateral refusal to defend.\").  And the complaints are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation under which the releases of pollutants were not, in the language of the Travelers policy, \"either expected or intended from the standpoint of any insured, or any person or organization for whose acts or omissions any insured is liable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Travelers pollution exclusion clause also precludes coverage for damage \"resulting from or contributed to by any condition in violation of or noncompliance with any governmental rule, regulation, or law applicable thereto.\"   The government complaints refer to the Commonwealth's action against the operators of the Charles George Landfill for violations of state environmental laws and regulations, and to improper disposal of waste at the site.  This raises the distinct possibility that some of the claims would be precluded from coverage on this basis.  However, although the question is a close one, we do not believe that the complaints could reasonably have led Travelers to conclude that no aspect of the claims fell within the scope of coverage.

Gen.

Cf. Roche v. Royal Bank of Canada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197279\"><a href=\"/opinion/197279/roche-v-royal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, 829-32 (1st Cir.1997)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> All of Millipore's potential CERCLA liability for the New Jersey sites arises out of the actions of Worthington, a wholly owned subsidiary.  A Hartford policy issued to Worthington covers these two sites.  INA policies issued to Millipore also provide coverage to the New Jersey sites, because these policies by their terms extended to Millipore subsidiaries.  Hartford also issued a policy directly to Millipore during the relevant period.  It is unclear, however, whether Millipore sought coverage for liability at the New Jersey sites under this policy as well as under the policy issued to Worthington.  No Travelers policies were involved in the suits involving the New Jersey sites</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Due to the retroactive strict liability nature of the CERCLA regime, a company may be responsible for damages occurring before it began shipping waste to a site.  As the SJC explained in Aerovox:</p>\n        <p>[Under CERCLA,] the allocation of damages is not differentiated by the time when a particular PRP sent contaminated waste to the site or by the waste of a particular PRP. Thus, the fact that [the insured] did not ship waste to [the site] before 1973, fifteen years after the fire, does not preclude the possibility that some fraction of the damages [the insured] was asked to pay resulted from the 1958 fire.</p>\n        <p>Aerovox, 676 N.E.2d at 806.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> While it is true that Travelers erroneously termed this argument an affirmative defense, suggesting that it bore the burden of proof on the issue, this area of the law is sufficiently well settled that Millipore should have known that it would have to bear the burden of proving that damage occurred during the policy period</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The SJC later clarified that the circumstances surrounding the event causing the release may be informative in determining whether the release itself was sudden and accidental.

This court later held that, when waste is poured directly into the ground (as opposed to first being placed in a container), \"the relevant discharge from which the damage arose is clearly the disposal of waste containing hazardous substances into the landfill.\"  Warwick Dyeing, 26 F.3d at 1204;  cf.
