The plaintiff, Frontier\n\nFishing Corporation (\"Frontier\"), brought suit in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts claiming\n\nthat the action of the defendant, the National Marine Fisheries\n\nService    (\"NMFS\"),   was    arbitrary,        capricious,   an    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, or without\n\nobservance of its own procedure.            The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendant and the plaintiff\n\nappeals.    For the reasons set forth below, we find that the\n\nplaintiff's claim is without merit and we affirm the district\n\ncourt.\n\n                              I.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Frontier    is    the   owner   of    the   fishing     vessel   F/V\n\nSettler.   The NMFS issues and regulates fishing permits pursuant\n\nto the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act,\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1801.      The NMFS issued two permits to Frontier for\n\nthe F/V Settler: a full-time limited access scallop permit and\n\na   full-time   multispecies       fleet-days-at-sea      fishing     permit.\n\nThese permits were renewed annually from 1994 until 1997.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f             On May 28, 1997, Patricia A. Kurkul of the NMFS wrote\n\na   letter    to   Frontier   explaining   that   the    F/V   Settler's\n\n\"multispecies limited access permit was issued in error\" because\n\nof amendments made to the NMFS' regulations which effectively\n\nprecluded the F/V Settler from holding dual permits.            The NMFS\n\noffered Frontier the option of choosing one of the two permits.\n\nThe letter indicated that if Frontier did not make a choice, the\n\nNMFS would cancel the multispecies limited access permit.\n\n             On August 8, 1997, Frontier wrote a letter to Dr.\n\nAndrew Rosenberg, Regional Director of the NMFS, requesting\n\nreconsideration of the agency's determination that the issuance\n\nof both permits was an error.           On September 9, 1997, Kurkul\n\nresponded to Frontier's letter to Rosenberg.            In essence, this\n\nletter informed Frontier that the agency's decision to terminate\n\none of the permits would stand, but Frontier would have the\n\nright to present its claim to a hearing officer for further\n\nreview.      The letter concluded:      \"A NMFS Hearing Officer will\n\ncontact you so that you may present evidence that your vessel\n\nused a scallop dredge and a multispecies otter trawl in 1988,\n\n1989 or 1990.\"1\n\n\n\n\n     1    This would enable the F/V Settler to hold both permits\nsimultaneously because it would be classified as a \"combination\nvessel.\" See 50 C.F.R. § 648.2 (1997).\n\n                                  -3-\n\f             Joel G. MacDonald, Regional Counsel for the NMFS, was\n\nselected to serve as the hearing officer.                             Frontier made a\n\nwritten submission to him and submitted documentary evidence.\n\nOn January 12, 1998, MacDonald prepared a written recommendation\n\nfor the regional director which was favorable to Frontier:                             he\n\nrecommended that the F/V Settler be given a dual permit, finding\n\nthat   it    met    the   criteria       for    a    combination       vessel     permit.\n\nRegional Director Rosenberg noted on MacDonald's recommendation\n\nthat he did not concur.               Frontier did not receive a copy of\n\nMacDonald's recommendation.\n\n             On     March      23,   1998,      Rosenberg          wrote   to    Frontier\n\nindicating that he had not yet reached a final decision, but\n\nthat he did not expect to grant its request.                         Rosenberg offered\n\nvarious other options to Frontier and indicated that Frontier\n\nhad    thirty      days   to    select    one       of   the   options.         Frontier,\n\nhowever, persisted that it be granted combination status.                              On\n\nMay 6, 1998, Rosenberg issued his final decision.                               He denied\n\nFrontier's appeal, and determined that the F/V Settler did not\n\nmeet the criteria for a combination vessel permit.                              He found\n\nthat   the    vessel      was   eligible       only      for   a    full-time     scallop\n\npermit.\n\n             Frontier sought judicial review in the district court,\n\nalleging that the NMFS did not follow its own appeal procedure\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fand    that   the        issuance      of   only     one   permit     \"was    arbitrary,\n\ncapricious,         an    abuse     of      discretion     and    otherwise         not    in\n\naccordance         with    the    law.\"       Both    parties     moved      for    summary\n\njudgment.      The district court found that \"Frontier's claim that\n\nNMFS failed to comply substantially with [its] procedure for\n\nreview of permit denials is without merit.\"                      (Footnote omitted).\n\nIn a well-reasoned decision, the district court entered judgment\n\nin favor of the NMFS, holding that \"[n]o substantial error in\n\nthe process is apparent, and there is consequently no basis for\n\noverturning the agency's lawfully arrived at determination.\"\n\nFrontier now appeals the district court's decision, and persists\n\nwith its claim that the agency failed to follow its own appeal\n\nprocedure.\n\n                                    II.      DISCUSSION\n\n              We    review       the   grant    of    summary     judgment         de   novo.\n\nAssoc. Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).         In reviewing an agency's determination, we apply\n\nthe same standards as the district court.                         Id.     We give great\n\ndeference to the agency and cannot substitute our judgment for\n\nthat of the agency, even if we disagree.                        Id.     In fact, we can\n\nonly    set    aside       an    agency's      action      if    it     is   \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or otherwise contrary to law.\"                       Id. (citing 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 706(2)(A)-(D)).\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f          Frontier argues that the NMFS did not follow its own\n\nappeal   procedure 2 and, therefore, its action was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious and contrary to law.     The appeal procedure is set\n\nforth in 50 C.F.R. § 648.4(a)(1)(H)(2) (1997):\n\n          The Regional Administrator will appoint a\n          designee who will make the initial decision\n          on the appeal.   The appellant may request\n          review of the initial decision by the\n          Regional Administrator by so requesting in\n          writing within 30 days of the notice of the\n          initial decision. If the appellant does not\n          request a review of the initial decision\n          within 30 days, the initial decision shall\n          become the final administrative action of\n          the Department of Commerce.     Such review\n          will be conducted by a hearing officer\n          appointed by the Regional Administrator.\n          The hearing officer shall make findings and\n          a    recommendation    to   the     Regional\n          Administrator [whi]ch shall be advisory\n\n\n    2     The right to appeal the denial of a permit is created\nby 50 C.F.R. § 648.4(a)(1)(H)(1) (1997):\n\n          Any applicant eligible to apply for an\n          initial limited access multispecies hook-\n          gear permit who is denied such permit may\n          appeal   the    denial   to   the   Regional\n          Administrator within 30 days of the notice\n          of denial. Any such appeal must be based on\n          one or more of the following grounds, must\n          be in writing, and must state the grounds\n          for the appeal:\n               (i)    The information used by the\n          Regional Administrator was based on mistaken\n          or incorrect data.\n               (ii) The applicant was prevented by\n          circumstances beyond his/her control from\n          meeting relevant criteria.\n               (iii)   The   applicant   has  new   or\n          additional information.\n\n                              -6-\n\f            only.   Upon receiving the findings and a\n            recommendation, the Regional Administrator\n            will issue a final decision on the appeal.\n            The Regional Administrator's decision is the\n            final   administrative    action   of    the\n            Department of Commerce.\n\nFrontier claims that the NMFS failed to substantially comply\n\nwith this procedure.      This argument is without merit.\n\n            Frontier mischaracterizes the \"initial decision\" as the\n\nrecommendation of the hearing officer and argues that because\n\nFrontier was satisfied with that \"decision,\" and did not appeal\n\nit further, that \"decision\" became the final agency action.\n\nFrontier makes much of the fact that it never received a copy of\n\nMacDonald's report.      Frontier, however, was not entitled to it.\n\nThe   recommendation    of   MacDonald     was   an   internal   memorandum\n\nwritten to Regional Director Rosenberg.                In fact, the NMFS\n\ndenied Frontier's request for that document on the grounds that\n\nit fell within an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act\n\n(\"FOIA\").     See   5   U.S.C.   §   552(b)(5).3      MacDonald,    as   the\n\n\n      3   Frontier, pursuant to the FOIA, requested \"[a]ll\ndecisions and/or recommendations made by Joel MacDonald,\nEsquire, hearing officer for the National Marine Fisheries\nService related to the appeal by the Frontier Fishing\nCorporation of the limited access multispecies and scallop\ncombination status for the F/V Settler.\" The NMFS denied the\nrequest by letter to plaintiff's counsel, and stated, in\npertinent part:\n\n            This   information    is   protected    from\n            disclosure under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). This\n            FOIA   exemption   protects    predecisional\n\n                                     -7-\n\fappointed hearing officer, did exactly what was specified by the\n\nregulation:   he   made   \"findings   and   a   recommendation   to   the\n\nRegional Administrator.\" This recommendation was advisory only;\n\nit was not a \"decision\" of the agency.\n\n          A proper characterization of the appeal procedure used\n\nby the agency is as follows: The sequence of events began on May\n\n28, 1997, when Kurkal, on behalf of the NMFS, wrote a letter to\n\nFrontier indicating that the F/V Settler's \"multispecies limited\n\naccess permit was issued in error\" and it could no longer hold\n\ntwo permits simultaneously.     The NMFS invited Frontier to choose\n\nwhich permit (scallop or multispecies) it wished to hold.             The\n\nletter concluded that if no selection was made within thirty\n\ndays, the NMFS would cancel the limited access multispecies\n\npermit.   This letter, in effect, served as the denial of the\n\ndual permits.\n\n\n\n\n          documents that are part of the deliberative\n          process.      This   deliberative    process\n          privilege is intended to prevent injury to\n          the quality of agency decision making. Mr.\n          MacDonald's recommendation to the Regional\n          Administrator regarding the disposition of\n          the appeal involving the F/V Settler was\n          made as part of the deliberative process\n          outlined in 50 C.F.R. § 648.4 and was\n          formulated prior to the agency's decision on\n          this appeal.   Thus, it falls within this\n          exemption.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Frontier was unsatisfied with this \"denial\" of the dual\n\npermits and initiated the appeal process.                      Frontier wrote a\n\nletter to the Regional Director of the NMFS on August 8, 1997,\n\nand requested review of that decision.                 Kurkal, on behalf of the\n\nNMFS, responded to Frontier.           This was the \"initial decision\"\n\nmade by a \"designee\" of the Regional Administrator.                     The letter\n\nbegins:   \"This responds to your recent letter to Dr. Rosenberg\n\n[the Regional Administrator] concerning your limited access\n\nmultispecies permit.\"        The logical inference is that Kurkul was\n\nwriting as the \"designee\" of the Regional Administrator.                           She\n\nindicated that she reviewed the record, but reached the same\n\nresult.      This    \"initial    decision     on       the   appeal\"    made      by   a\n\n\"designee\" of the Regional Administrator concluded:                          \"A NMFS\n\nHearing   Officer     will   contact    you    so       that   you     may   present\n\nevidence [to bolster your claim].\"\n\n           Following the language of the regulations, the appeal\n\nprocess continued:        Frontier requested review of the initial\n\ndecision of the agency.         Review was conducted by hearing officer\n\nMacDonald.      He    made   findings   and        a    recommendation       to    the\n\nRegional Administrator.          The memorandum was advisory only and\n\ncould not be characterized as a \"decision\" of the agency.\n\n           Upon receiving the findings and recommendation of the\n\nhearing   officer,     the   Regional   Administrator           issued       a   final\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fdecision on the appeal.       He disagreed with the recommendation of\n\nthe hearing officer, as was within his discretion, and denied\n\nFrontier's    appeal.          This   decision      became      the   final\n\nadministrative action of the Department of Commerce.\n\n                             III.   CONCLUSION\n\n         We    hold   that    the   NMFS   did   follow   its   own   appeal\n\nprocedure.    We find no error in the process used by the NMFS and\n\nhold that its decision was in accordance with law, and was not\n\narbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.            Therefore, we\n\nfind no reason to set aside the agency's decision and hold that\n\nthe district court's decision is affirmed.           No costs to either\n\nparty.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f",

The letter concluded:      \"A NMFS Hearing Officer will\n\ncontact you so that you may present evidence that your vessel\n\nused a scallop dredge and a multispecies otter trawl in 1988,\n\n1989 or 1990.\"1\n\n\n\n\n     1    This would enable the F/V Settler to hold both permits\nsimultaneously because it would be classified as a \"combination\nvessel.\" See 50 C.F.R. § 648.2 (1997).\n\n                                  -3-\n\f             Joel G. MacDonald, Regional Counsel for the NMFS, was\n\nselected to serve as the hearing officer.                             Frontier made a\n\nwritten submission to him and submitted documentary evidence.\n\nOn January 12, 1998, MacDonald prepared a written recommendation\n\nfor the regional director which was favorable to Frontier:                             he\n\nrecommended that the F/V Settler be given a dual permit, finding\n\nthat   it    met    the   criteria       for    a    combination       vessel     permit.\n\nRegional Director Rosenberg noted on MacDonald's recommendation\n\nthat he did not concur.               Frontier did not receive a copy of\n\nMacDonald's recommendation.\n\n             On     March      23,   1998,      Rosenberg          wrote   to    Frontier\n\nindicating that he had not yet reached a final decision, but\n\nthat he did not expect to grant its request.                         Rosenberg offered\n\nvarious other options to Frontier and indicated that Frontier\n\nhad    thirty      days   to    select    one       of   the   options.         Frontier,\n\nhowever, persisted that it be granted combination status.                              On\n\nMay 6, 1998, Rosenberg issued his final decision.                               He denied\n\nFrontier's appeal, and determined that the F/V Settler did not\n\nmeet the criteria for a combination vessel permit.                              He found\n\nthat   the    vessel      was   eligible       only      for   a    full-time     scallop\n\npermit.\n\n             Frontier sought judicial review in the district court,\n\nalleging that the NMFS did not follow its own appeal procedure\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fand    that   the        issuance      of   only     one   permit     \"was    arbitrary,\n\ncapricious,         an    abuse     of      discretion     and    otherwise         not    in\n\naccordance         with    the    law.\"       Both    parties     moved      for    summary\n\njudgment.      The district court found that \"Frontier's claim that\n\nNMFS failed to comply substantially with [its] procedure for\n\nreview of permit denials is without merit.\"                      (Footnote omitted).\n\nIn a well-reasoned decision, the district court entered judgment\n\nin favor of the NMFS, holding that \"[n]o substantial error in\n\nthe process is apparent, and there is consequently no basis for\n\noverturning the agency's lawfully arrived at determination.\"\n\nFrontier now appeals the district court's decision, and persists\n\nwith its claim that the agency failed to follow its own appeal\n\nprocedure.\n\n                                    II.      DISCUSSION\n\n              We    review       the   grant    of    summary     judgment         de   novo.\n\nAssoc. Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197563\"><a href=\"/opinion/197563/associated-fisheries-v-us-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).         In reviewing an agency's determination, we apply\n\nthe same standards as the district court.                         Id.     We give great\n\ndeference to the agency and cannot substitute our judgment for\n\nthat of the agency, even if we disagree.                        Id.     In fact, we can\n\nonly    set    aside       an    agency's      action      if    it     is   \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or otherwise contrary to law.\"                       Id. (citing 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 706(2)(A)-(D)).\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f          Frontier argues that the NMFS did not follow its own\n\nappeal   procedure 2 and, therefore, its action was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious and contrary to law.     The appeal procedure is set\n\nforth in 50 C.F.R. § 648.4(a)(1)(H)(2) (1997):\n\n          The Regional Administrator will appoint a\n          designee who will make the initial decision\n          on the appeal.   The appellant may request\n          review of the initial decision by the\n          Regional Administrator by so requesting in\n          writing within 30 days of the notice of the\n          initial decision. If the appellant does not\n          request a review of the initial decision\n          within 30 days, the initial decision shall\n          become the final administrative action of\n          the Department of Commerce.     Such review\n          will be conducted by a hearing officer\n          appointed by the Regional Administrator.\n          The hearing officer shall make findings and\n          a    recommendation    to   the     Regional\n          Administrator [whi]ch shall be advisory\n\n\n    2     The right to appeal the denial of a permit is created\nby 50 C.F.R. § 648.4(a)(1)(H)(1) (1997):\n\n          Any applicant eligible to apply for an\n          initial limited access multispecies hook-\n          gear permit who is denied such permit may\n          appeal   the    denial   to   the   Regional\n          Administrator within 30 days of the notice\n          of denial. Any such appeal must be based on\n          one or more of the following grounds, must\n          be in writing, and must state the grounds\n          for the appeal:\n               (i)    The information used by the\n          Regional Administrator was based on mistaken\n          or incorrect data.\n               (ii) The applicant was prevented by\n          circumstances beyond his/her control from\n          meeting relevant criteria.\n               (iii)   The   applicant   has  new   or\n          additional information.\n\n                              -6-\n\f            only.   Upon receiving the findings and a\n            recommendation, the Regional Administrator\n            will issue a final decision on the appeal.\n            The Regional Administrator's decision is the\n            final   administrative    action   of    the\n            Department of Commerce.\n\nFrontier claims that the NMFS failed to substantially comply\n\nwith this procedure.      This argument is without merit.\n\n            Frontier mischaracterizes the \"initial decision\" as the\n\nrecommendation of the hearing officer and argues that because\n\nFrontier was satisfied with that \"decision,\" and did not appeal\n\nit further, that \"decision\" became the final agency action.\n\nFrontier makes much of the fact that it never received a copy of\n\nMacDonald's report.      Frontier, however, was not entitled to it.\n\nThe   recommendation    of   MacDonald     was   an   internal   memorandum\n\nwritten to Regional Director Rosenberg.                In fact, the NMFS\n\ndenied Frontier's request for that document on the grounds that\n\nit fell within an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act\n\n(\"FOIA\").     See   5   U.S.C.   §   552(b)(5).3      MacDonald,    as   the\n\n\n      3   Frontier, pursuant to the FOIA, requested \"[a]ll\ndecisions and/or recommendations made by Joel MacDonald,\nEsquire, hearing officer for the National Marine Fisheries\nService related to the appeal by the Frontier Fishing\nCorporation of the limited access multispecies and scallop\ncombination status for the F/V Settler.\" The NMFS denied the\nrequest by letter to plaintiff's counsel, and stated, in\npertinent part:\n\n            This   information    is   protected    from\n            disclosure under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). This\n            FOIA   exemption   protects    predecisional\n\n                                     -7-\n\fappointed hearing officer, did exactly what was specified by the\n\nregulation:   he   made   \"findings   and   a   recommendation   to   the\n\nRegional Administrator.\" This recommendation was advisory only;\n\nit was not a \"decision\" of the agency.\n\n          A proper characterization of the appeal procedure used\n\nby the agency is as follows: The sequence of events began on May\n\n28, 1997, when Kurkal, on behalf of the NMFS, wrote a letter to\n\nFrontier indicating that the F/V Settler's \"multispecies limited\n\naccess permit was issued in error\" and it could no longer hold\n\ntwo permits simultaneously.     The NMFS invited Frontier to choose\n\nwhich permit (scallop or multispecies) it wished to hold.             The\n\nletter concluded that if no selection was made within thirty\n\ndays, the NMFS would cancel the limited access multispecies\n\npermit.   This letter, in effect, served as the denial of the\n\ndual permits.\n\n\n\n\n          documents that are part of the deliberative\n          process.      This   deliberative    process\n          privilege is intended to prevent injury to\n          the quality of agency decision making. Mr.\n          MacDonald's recommendation to the Regional\n          Administrator regarding the disposition of\n          the appeal involving the F/V Settler was\n          made as part of the deliberative process\n          outlined in 50 C.F.R. § 648.4 and was\n          formulated prior to the agency's decision on\n          this appeal.   Thus, it falls within this\n          exemption.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Frontier was unsatisfied with this \"denial\" of the dual\n\npermits and initiated the appeal process.                      Frontier wrote a\n\nletter to the Regional Director of the NMFS on August 8, 1997,\n\nand requested review of that decision.                 Kurkal, on behalf of the\n\nNMFS, responded to Frontier.           This was the \"initial decision\"\n\nmade by a \"designee\" of the Regional Administrator.                     The letter\n\nbegins:   \"This responds to your recent letter to Dr. Rosenberg\n\n[the Regional Administrator] concerning your limited access\n\nmultispecies permit.\"        The logical inference is that Kurkul was\n\nwriting as the \"designee\" of the Regional Administrator.                           She\n\nindicated that she reviewed the record, but reached the same\n\nresult.      This    \"initial    decision     on       the   appeal\"    made      by   a\n\n\"designee\" of the Regional Administrator concluded:                          \"A NMFS\n\nHearing   Officer     will   contact    you    so       that   you     may   present\n\nevidence [to bolster your claim].\"\n\n           Following the language of the regulations, the appeal\n\nprocess continued:        Frontier requested review of the initial\n\ndecision of the agency.         Review was conducted by hearing officer\n\nMacDonald.      He    made   findings   and        a    recommendation       to    the\n\nRegional Administrator.          The memorandum was advisory only and\n\ncould not be characterized as a \"decision\" of the agency.\n\n           Upon receiving the findings and recommendation of the\n\nhearing   officer,     the   Regional   Administrator           issued       a   final\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fdecision on the appeal.       He disagreed with the recommendation of\n\nthe hearing officer, as was within his discretion, and denied\n\nFrontier's    appeal.          This   decision      became      the   final\n\nadministrative action of the Department of Commerce.\n\n                             III.   CONCLUSION\n\n         We    hold   that    the   NMFS   did   follow   its   own   appeal\n\nprocedure.    We find no error in the process used by the NMFS and\n\nhold that its decision was in accordance with law, and was not\n\narbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.            Therefore, we\n\nfind no reason to set aside the agency's decision and hold that\n\nthe district court's decision is affirmed.           No costs to either\n\nparty.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f</pre>",
