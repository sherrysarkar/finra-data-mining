Upon careful  review  of the  briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nrecord, we conclude that this  appeal is suitable for summary\r\n\ndisposition.   The record shows that the  September 27, 1996,\r\n\norder  allowed plaintiffs  to file  an  amended complaint  to\r\n\ncorrect the  name of one  of the defendants, and  the amended\r\n\ncomplaint  filed in November  1996 complied with  that order.\r\n\nWhen defendants answered  that amended complaint and  did not\r\n\nraise any  jurisdictional defense, they waived  any objection\r\n\nbased on lack of service of the summons.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\r                                                         \r\n\n12(h)(1).  Accordingly, the amended complaint should not have\r\n\nbeen   dismissed  for  failure   to  serve  the   summons  on\r\n\ndefendants. \r\n\n     The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the\r                                        \r\n\ndistrict court for reinstatement of the amended complaint and\r\n\nfurther  proceedings consistent with  this opinion.   See 1st\r                                                                     \r\n\nCir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
