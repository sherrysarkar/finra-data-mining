Williamson  Dickie  Manufacturing   Co.\r                            \r\n\n(\"Williamson Dickie\") has filed both a notice of appeal and a\r\n\npetition for  writ of  mandamus from  a district  court order\r\n\nremanding  a case to a Commonwealth of Puerto Rico court from\r\n\nwhich it had been removed.  We conclude that this court lacks\r\n\njurisdiction  to review the order of remand, either by way of\r\n\nappeal  or  mandamus,  and therefore  summarily  dismiss  the\r\n\nappeal and deny the petition for mandamus.  Because the issue\r\n\nis a recurring one, a brief opinion explaining our result may\r\n\nbe useful for guidance in the future.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     In 1993, Williamson Dickie dismissed some employees when\r\n\nit  decided to close its  plants in Puerto  Rico and transfer\r\n\nits operations outside of Puerto Rico.  In November 1994, 117\r\n\ndismissed  employees  filed  suit  in a  Commonwealth  Court,\r\n\nclaiming entitlement  to  severance pay  in  accordance  with\r\n\nPuerto  Rico Severance Law Statute,  Law 80 of  May 30, 1976,\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 29,    185 et  seq. (1985)  (hereinafter\r\n\n\"Law 80\").  They also claimed that, in retaining only younger\r\n\nemployees  until the  operations were  completely shut  down,\r\n\nWilliamson Dickie violated the Commonwealth's law against age\r\n\ndiscrimination.\r\n\n     Williamson  Dickie  removed  the  suit  to  the  federal\r\n\ndistrict  court  on the  ground that  it  was a  civil action\r\n\narising  under the laws of  the United States,  i.e., that it\r                                                                \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\npresented  a  federal  question.    Specifically,  Williamson\r\n\nDickie  alleged that, although  the plaintiffs' complaint did\r\n\nnot mention  the Employee  Retirement Income Security  Act of\r\n\n1974 (\"ERISA\"), the suit,  in fact, was a claim  for benefits\r\n\nunder an ERISA plan,  falling under ERISA's civil enforcement\r\n\nprovision, 29 U.S.C.    1132(a)(1)(B), and thus was removable\r\n\nto federal court.\r\n\n     Plaintiffs responded with a motion to remand back to the\r\n\nCommonwealth Court, contending that their complaint was not a\r\n\nclaim  for benefits  under an  ERISA plan,  but rather  was a\r\n\nclaim for \"indemnity for  wrongful discharge\" pursuant to Law\r\n\n80.  Williamson Dickie then  moved to dismiss the plaintiffs'\r\n\nseverance pay claim, arguing that this claim was preempted by\r\n\nERISA.   Plaintiffs  filed an  opposition to  this motion  to\r\n\ndismiss, reiterating their  contention that  their claim  for\r\n\nseverance pay was not ERISA-based.\r\n\n     In April 1996, the district court issued  an opinion, in\r\n\nwhich  it concluded that Law  80 was not  an employee benefit\r                                                    \r\n\nplan  under  ERISA.   It  opined  that  Law  80 more  closely\r\n\nresembled  the \"one-time,  lump-sum  payment  triggered by  a\r\n\nsingle event requir[ing] no administrative scheme,\" found not\r\n\npreempted  by ERISA in Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 1, 12 (1987), rather than the more extensive and complex\r\n\nadministrative obligations imposed  by the Massachusetts \"tin\r\n\nparachute\" statute  that this court found  preempted by ERISA\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nin Simas  v. Quaker Fabric  Corp. of Fall  River, 6  F.3d 849\r                                                            \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1993).   The district court  concluded, therefore,\r\n\nthat the  cause of action under  Law 80 was not  preempted by\r\n\nERISA.   It  determined  that Williamson  Dickie's motion  to\r\n\ndismiss the  plaintiff's Law 80  claim as preempted  by ERISA\r\n\nwas  moot.   And, it  remanded the  case to  the Commonwealth\r\n\nCourt.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     Section  1447(d) of  Title  28 provides,  subject to  an\r\n\nexception  for civil  rights  cases not  relevant here,  that\r\n\n\"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it\r\n\nwas  removed  is  not  reviewable on  appeal  or  otherwise.\"\r\n\nSection  1447(d) applies only if the case is remanded for the\r                                         \r\n\nreasons stated in 28 U.S.C.   1447(c)--a timely raised defect\r\n\nin removal procedure or  lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\nThings  Remembered, Inc.  v. Petrarca,  116 S.  Ct.  494, 497\r                                                 \r\n\n(1995).  But where  the district court order of  remand rests\r\n\non  lack of  subject matter  jurisdiction, that order  is not\r\n\nreviewable  by  appeal  or   mandamus,  even  if   erroneous.\r                                                                        \r\n\nThermtron Products, Inc. v.  Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 343\r                                                      \r\n\n(1976); Gravitt v.  Southwestern Bell Tel. Co.,  430 U.S. 723\r                                                          \r\n\n(1977) (per curiam).\r\n\n     Contrary to Williamson Dickie's contention, we interpret\r\n\nthe district court's order of remand as a  determination that\r\n\nit lacked  subject matter jurisdiction over  the removed case\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nbecause no federal  claim had  been presented  to invoke  the\r\n\ncourt's   federal  question   jurisdiction.     Rejection  of\r\n\nWilliamson  Dickie's preemption  defense  was a  link in  the\r\n\nchain of reasoning.  But the preemption ruling, \"rather  than\r\n\nbeing apart from the question of subject matter jurisdiction,\r\n\n[is]  necessary   to  determine  whether   such  jurisdiction\r\n\nexisted.\"  Hansen v. Blue Cross of California, 891 F.2d 1384,\r                                                         \r\n\n1388 (9th Cir. 1989); Nutter v.

See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nNutter v.

Section 1447(d) recites that \"[a]n order\r\n\nremanding a case to the State court from which it was removed\r\n\nis not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\"  Thus, a number of\r\n\ncircuits have considered mandamus as a vehicle for review and\r\n\nrejected  it as well.  See, e.g., Nutter v. Monongahela Power\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo., 4 F.3d at 320-23; Soley v.

Co.,  857 F.2d 1190 (8th  Cir. 1988), the\r                                   \r\n\nEighth  Circuit considered  mandamus appropriate  in somewhat\r\n\ncomparable circumstances and gave as its reason the otherwise\r\n\nlack of  appellate review  and the  preclusive effect  of the\r\n\ndistrict court's  ruling on  the  state court.   Because  the\r\n\ndistrict   court's   preemption   finding  is   unreviewable,\r\n\nprinciples of collateral estoppel would not apply to preclude\r\n\nrelitigation of the issue in state court.  As for the lack of\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nappellate  review, this  is  just what  Congress directed  in\r\n\nsection 1447(d).\r\n\n     In Tingley v. Pixley-Richards  West, Inc., 953 F.2d 1124\r                                                          \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1992), the  Ninth Circuit regarded appellate review\r\n\nof a  remand order, substantially  identical to the  order at\r\n\nissue in the  case before  us, as  not barred  by    1447(d).\r\n\nThis approach  taken by  the Tingley panel,  however, appears\r                                                \r\n\ninconsistent with the Ninth Circuit's own case  law in Hansen\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

(\"Williamson Dickie\") has filed both a notice of appeal and a petition for writ of mandamus from a district court order remanding a case to a Commonwealth of Puerto Rico court from which it had been removed.  We conclude that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the order of remand, either by way of appeal or mandamus, and therefore summarily dismiss the appeal and deny the petition for mandamus.  Because the issue is a recurring one, a brief opinion explaining our result may be useful for guidance in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Williamson Dickie dismissed some employees when it decided to close its plants in Puerto Rico and transfer its operations outside of Puerto Rico.  In November 1994, 117 dismissed employees filed suit in a Commonwealth Court, claiming entitlement to severance pay in accordance with Puerto Rico Severance Law Statute, Law 80 of May 30, 1976, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 185 et seq.  (1985) (hereinafter \"Law 80\").  They also claimed that, in retaining only younger employees until the operations were completely shut down, Williamson Dickie violated the Commonwealth's law against age discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Williamson Dickie removed the suit to the federal district court on the ground that it was a civil action arising under the laws of the United States, i.e., that it presented a federal question.  Specifically, Williamson Dickie alleged that, although the plaintiffs' complaint did not mention the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), the suit, in fact, was a claim for benefits under an ERISA plan, falling under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B), and thus was removable to federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs responded with a motion to remand back to the Commonwealth Court, contending that their complaint was not a claim for benefits under an ERISA plan, but rather was a claim for \"indemnity for wrongful discharge\" pursuant to Law 80.  Williamson Dickie then moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' severance pay claim, arguing that this claim was preempted by ERISA.  Plaintiffs filed an opposition to this motion to dismiss, reiterating their contention that their claim for severance pay was not ERISA-based.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1996, the district court issued an opinion, in which it concluded that Law 80 was not an employee benefit plan under ERISA.  It opined that Law 80 more closely resembled the \"one-time, lump-sum payment triggered by a single event requir[ing] no administrative scheme,\" found not preempted by ERISA in Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 12, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 2218, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987), rather than the more extensive and complex administrative obligations imposed by the Massachusetts \"tin parachute\" statute that this court found preempted by ERISA in Simas v. Quaker Fabric Corp. of Fall River, 6 F.3d 849 (1st Cir.1993).  The district court concluded, therefore, that the cause of action under Law 80 was not preempted by ERISA.  It determined that Williamson Dickie's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's Law 80 claim as preempted by ERISA was moot.  And, it remanded the case to the Commonwealth Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1447(d) of Title 28 provides, subject to an exception for civil rights cases not relevant here, that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\"  Section 1447(d) applies only if the case is remanded for the reasons stated in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(c)--a timely raised defect in removal procedure or lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 494, 497, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995).  But where the district court order of remand rests on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, that order is not reviewable by appeal or mandamus, even if erroneous.  Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 343, 96 S.Ct. 584, 589, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976);  Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Tel.

Rejection of Williamson Dickie's preemption defense was a link in the chain of reasoning.  But the preemption ruling, \"rather than being apart from the question of subject matter jurisdiction, [is] necessary to determine whether such jurisdiction existed.\"  Hansen v. Blue Cross of California, 891 F.2d 1384, 1388 (9th Cir.1989);  Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d 319, 321 (4th Cir.1993) (\"The preemption findings were merely 'subsidiary legal step[s] on the way to its determination that the case was not properly removed.' \")  (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After remand, the district court's ruling that the plaintiff's claim is not completely preempted by federal law \"has no preclusive effect on the state court's consideration of the substantive preemption defense.\"  Whitman v. Raley's Inc., 886 F.2d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.1989);  Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d at 321-22 (same);  Soley v. First Nat'l Bank of Commerce, 923 F.2d 406, 409 (5th Cir.1991) (same);  Glasser v. Amalgamated Workers Union Local 88, 806 F.2d 1539, 1540 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (same).  Because the district court's preemption finding is unreviewable, principles of collateral estoppel would not apply to preclude relitigation of the issue in state court.  Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d at 321-22;  Whitman v. Raley's Inc., 886 F.2d at 1181.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approach we take in declining to review the remand order is supported by at least four circuits.  See, e.g., Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d at 320-23;   Soley v. First Nat'l Bank of Commerce, 923 F.2d at 407-10;  Hansen v. Blue Cross of California, 891 F.2d at 1387-90;  Glasser v. Amalgamated Workers Union Local 88, 806 F.2d 1539 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam).  Section 1447(d) recites that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\"   Thus, a number of circuits have considered mandamus as a vehicle for review and rejected it as well.  See, e.g., Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d at 320-23;  Soley v. First Nat'l Bank of Commerce, 923 F.2d at 407-10;  In re Business Men's Assurance Co. of Am., 992 F.2d 181, 182-83 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuit court opinions point in the other direction.  In In re Life Ins. Co., 857 F.2d 1190 (8th Cir.1988), the Eighth Circuit considered mandamus appropriate in somewhat comparable circumstances and gave as its reason the otherwise lack of appellate review and the preclusive effect of the district court's ruling on the state court.  Because the district court's preemption finding is unreviewable, principles of collateral estoppel would not apply to preclude relitigation of the issue in state court.  As for the lack of appellate review, this is just what Congress directed in section 1447(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Tingey v. Pixley-Richards West, Inc., 953 F.2d 1124 (9th Cir.1992), the Ninth Circuit regarded appellate review of a remand order, substantially identical to the order at issue in the case before us, as not barred by &#167; 1447(d).  This approach taken by the Tingey panel, however, appears inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit's own case law in Hansen v. Blue Cross of California, 891 F.2d at 1388-89, and Whitman v. Raley's Inc., 886 F.2d at 1178, neither of which was cited, nor appears to have been considered, by the Tingey panel.  We agree with the Fourth Circuit, see Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d at 322-23, that the Tingey opinion therefore ought not be given weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal in No. 96-1728 is summarily dismissed.

Pixley-Richards West, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575885\"><a href=\"/opinion/575885/bradley-d-tingey-husband-amy-e-tingey-wife-bradley-d-tingey-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1992), the Ninth Circuit regarded appellate review of a remand order, substantially identical to the order at issue in the case before us, as not barred by &#167; 1447(d).  This approach taken by the Tingey panel, however, appears inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit's own case law in Hansen v. Blue Cross of California, 891 F.2d at 1388-89, and Whitman v. Raley's Inc., 886 F.2d at 1178, neither of which was cited, nor appears to have been considered, by the Tingey panel.  We agree with the Fourth Circuit, see Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d at 322-23, that the Tingey opinion therefore ought not be given weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal in No. 96-1728 is summarily dismissed.
