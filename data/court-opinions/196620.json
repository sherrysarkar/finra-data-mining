For the reasons\r\n\nstated below, we affirm the district court's sentence.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          On December 17, 1991, a  federal grand jury returned an\r\n\nindictment against  Patricia C. Harrison and  her husband Stephen\r\n\nG.  Harrison, charging them with one hundred counts of bank fraud\r\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.   1344 and with one count of bankruptcy\r\n\nfraud  in  violation of  18 U.S.C.     152.   Appellant  moved to\r\n\ndismiss  the indictment on  May 18, 1992, on  the ground that the\r\n\nbank fraud  counts were  multiplicitous.   Six  months later,  on\r\n\nNovember 16,  1992, the district court  denied Appellant's motion\r\n\nand  on  January 12,  1993,  a  federal  grand  jury  returned  a\r\n\nsuperseding indictment, which  merged a number of  the bank fraud\r\n\ncounts  from  the original  indictment  into a  lesser  number of\r\n\ncounts.    The  superseding  indictment  alleged  three  separate\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  This section provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\n            Whoever knowingly executes . . . a scheme\r\n            or artifice -- (1) to defraud a financial\r\n            institution;  or (2) to obtain any of the\r\n            moneys   .   .   .

[shall  be\r\n            guilty of a crime].\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   1344 (1988) &amp; Supp. II (1990).\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nschemes by which  Appellant and her  husband defrauded the  banks\r\n\ninvolved.  On  April 10, 1995, Appellant pled  guilty to seventy-\r\n\nseven of the  seventy-nine counts  of bank fraud  charged in  the\r\n\nsuperseding indictment.  \r\n\n          In the plea agreement, Appellant acknowledged that  she\r\n\nwas  subject  to  separate  punishments  of  up  to  five  years'\r\n\nimprisonment  on each  of the counts  but one, for  which she was\r\n\nsubject to  a maximum penalty of  up to thirty years.   Appellant\r\n\nalso agreed  to pay a  special assessment of  $50 on each  of the\r\n\nseventy-seven counts to which she pled guilty.  The  pre-sentence\r\n\nreport (\"PSR\") calculated Appellant's offense level in accordance\r\n\nwith the plea agreement,  with two exceptions, only one  of which\r\n\nis relevant to this  appeal.  The PSR calculated  the appropriate\r\n\nloss  range  under  U.S.S.G.    2F1.1(b)(1)(K)  to  be  more than\r\n\n$5,000,000 because the victim  bank lost principal in the  amount\r\n\nof $10,998,072.67.  This differed from  the plea agreement, which\r\n\nprovided for a loss of between $2-$5 million.  In her pre-hearing\r\n\nsentencing memorandum,  Appellant  asked the  district  court  to\r\n\ndepart  from the applicable guideline range for two reasons:  (i)\r\n\nthe amount of loss overstated the seriousness of her offense; and\r\n\n(ii)  her  husband's  illness.     Apart  from  these  arguments,\r\n\nAppellant did not object to the PSR's amount of loss or guideline\r\n\ncalculation, or to any of the offense conduct detailed in the PSR\r\n\nthat was the basis for those findings.\r\n\n          At  the sentencing hearing,  and after hearing argument\r\n\nfrom  the  parties regarding  the  appropriate  loss amount,  the\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court found  the loss  for  purposes of    2F1.1  to be\r\n\nbetween $2-5 million.  In addition, the district court found that\r\n\nthe total  offense level was  18, with a  corresponding guideline\r\n\nsentencing   range  of   twenty-seven  to   thirty-three  months'\r\n\nimprisonment.   The  district court  made a  three-level downward\r\n\ndeparture,  on the  basis  of circumstances  surrounding the  ill\r\n\nhealth  of  Appellant's  husband,  bringing the  total  to  level\r\n\nfifteen, with  a corresponding  range of eighteen  to twenty-four\r\n\nmonths.  Appellant's total  offense level of fifteen was  made up\r\n\nof  the following elements:  a base  offense level of six under  \r\n\n2F1.1(a); a ten-level enhancement under   2F1.1(b)(1)  to reflect\r\n\nthe  amount of loss,  found to be  between $2-$5 million;  a two-\r\n\nlevel  enhancement  for  more   than  minimal  planning  under   \r\n\n2F1.1(b)(2)(A); a two-level enhancement for supervising others in\r\n\nthe commission of the offense under   3B1.1(c); and a three-level\r\n\ndownward  departure  based  on  the  ill  health  of  Appellant's\r\n\nhusband.   Combined  with  a  criminal  history  category  of  I,\r\n\nAppellant's resulting total offense level was fifteen.  \r\n\n          On  August  7,  1995,  the  district  court   sentenced\r\n\nAppellant  to  24  months  in  prison  and  ordered  her  to  pay\r\n\nrestitution  in the amount of $10,998,072.67,  the amount lost by\r\n\nthe victim bank as  found in the PSR by the  district court.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court also imposed  a three  year period  of supervised\r\n\nrelease and a special assessment of $3,850.  \r\n\n          This appeal followed.  We have jurisdiction pursuant to\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3742(a) (1994).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \r\n\n          We  review   for  clear  error  factbound   matters  in\r\n\nsentencing,  mindful  that such  factual  findings  need only  be\r\n\nsupported  by a preponderance of the evidence, and review de novo\r                                                                           \r\n\nquestions  of  law, including  the  applicability  of a  relevant\r\n\nguideline.

Appellant does not challenge her conviction but, rather,\r\n\nchallenges the sentence imposed by the district court.  Appellant\r\n\ncontends that the seventy-seven counts of bank fraud are facially\r\n\nmultiplicitous  because the  superseding indictment  supports, at\r\n\nmost, only three counts of bank fraud.  See,  e.g., United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Lilly,\r                                                                          \r\n\n983  F.2d 300, 302-04 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that an indictment\r\n\nfor bank fraud is multiplicitous when it charges a defendant with\r\n\nmultiple counts for each \"single execution of a unitary scheme\").\r\n\nBecause  the seventy-seven counts  were multiplicitous, Appellant\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nargues,  she was prejudiced in  the view of  the sentencing court\r\n\nand her sentence violates Double Jeopardy principles. \r\n\n          While our review  of the  district court's  application\r\n\nand  interpretation  of  the  Sentencing  Guidelines is  plenary,\r\n\nMart nez-Mart nez, 69 F.3d at  1224, \"[w]e have repeatedly stated\r                           \r\n\nin the sentencing context, as well as in other areas, that issues\r\n\nnot presented to the district court will not be addressed for the\r\n\nfirst time  on appeal.\"  United States v. Haggert, 980 F.2d 8, 10\r                                                           \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1992).   We have  also  stated that  \"[a]rguments not\r\n\nraised below will  be entertained on  appeal only in  'horrendous\r\n\ncases where a gross  miscarriage of justice would occur'  and, in\r\n\naddition, where  the newly asserted  ground 'is so  compelling as\r\n\nvirtually to insure appellant's success.'\"  Id. (quoting Johnston\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Holiday Inns, 595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1979)).  Here, these\r                         \r\n\nstraightforward rules  leave Appellant's  sails flapping  idly in\r\n\nthe wind.\r\n\n          Although \"a defendant's unconditional guilty  plea does\r\n\nnot automatically waive  the right to appeal  matters incident to\r\n\nsentencing  as opposed  to guilt,\" United  States v.  Cordero, 42\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 697,  699 (1st Cir.  1994), we nonetheless  find Appellant's\r\n\nmultiplicity  argument waived.  Even though  she only raises this\r\n\nargument  as to her sentencing, we find controlling the fact that\r\n\nAppellant had ample opportunity to challenge the sentence imposed\r\n\nand raise her multiplicity  argument as to sentencing before  the\r\n\ndistrict court.  \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          The record before us clearly shows that Appellant never\r\n\nobjected  on  grounds of  multiplicity  or  raised this  argument\r\n\nduring the  change of plea  hearing, in her  pre-hearing sentence\r\n\nmemorandum, or during the sentencing hearing.  The PSR calculated\r\n\nAppellant's  offense level to  be twenty-one.   Appellant did not\r\n\nfile  any objections to the PSR.  In her pre-sentence memorandum,\r\n\nAppellant argued on  two grounds that  the district court  depart\r\n\nfrom the  applicable guideline  sentencing range, but  neither of\r\n\nthem concerned the  multiplicity of the counts.   Indeed, besides\r\n\nsupporting a finding of Appellant's failure to object, the record\r\n\nshows  that  the  district  court  specifically drew  Appellant's\r\n\nattention  to  the  government's  evidence  regarding  the counts\r\n\ncharged, pointed out the portion of the agreement identifying the\r\n\nmaximum  penalties to which  defendant could  be subject  on each\r\n\ncount,  and   notified  Appellant  of  the   possibility  of  the\r\n\nimposition of restitution.  \r\n\n          Appellant insists, however, that  she did not waive her\r\n\nmultiplicity challenge, arguing that  it was preserved for appeal\r\n\nbecause she  challenged the original  indictment on  multiplicity\r\n\ngrounds.    Appellant  relies  on two  cases,  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nMolinaro, 11 F.3d 853, 858 n.9 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 115\r                                                                      \r\n\nS. Ct. 668  (1994), and United States  v. Fuesting, 845 F.2d  664\r                                                            \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1988), for the proposition that she was not required to\r\n\nchallenge the superseding indictment  after her motion to dismiss\r\n\nthe  original indictment was  denied.   We need  not rule  on the\r\n\nmerit  of   Appellant's  argument,  because   what  controls   is\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nAppellant's  subsequent  act  of  voluntarily  and  intelligently\r\n\npleading  guilty to  all seventy-seven  counts, coupled  with her\r\n\nfailure  to make any objection to  the superseding indictment, to\r\n\nthe seventy-seven counts, to the offense conduct contained in the\r\n\nPSR, or  to the sentence imposed.   Thus, we decline  to consider\r\n\nthis argument.2  \r\n\n          Appellant also argues that  the district court's  fraud\r\n\nloss  calculation was  erroneous under    2F1.1(b)(1)(K),   which\r\n\nincreases  the level  of punishment  according to  the amount  of\r\n\n\"loss\" caused by  the fraud.   We find,  however, that  Appellant\r\n\nwaived  any claim  of error  in the  court's calculation  of loss\r\n\nunder   2F1.1,  because no objection was made  to the accuracy of\r\n\nthe facts set forth in the offense conduct section of the PSR, to\r\n\nthe amount  of  loss found  by  the  district court,  or  to  the\r\n\ndistrict court's guideline calculation.  Because Appellant failed\r\n\nto  object to the district court's determination as to the amount\r\n\nof loss  for purposes of   2F1.1, her sentence can be reversed on\r\n\nthis basis  only upon a  showing of \"plain  error.\"  See  Fed. R.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCrim. P.  52(b).3  To  meet the  plain error standard  there must\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   We note that  even if the  counts were multiplicitous, remand\r\nfor  resentencing would not be an  appropriate remedy.  Appellant\r\nreceived identical sentences on each of the seventy-seven counts,\r\nand it is undisputed that all of the offense conduct that was the\r\nbasis  for   those  sentences   would  be  equally   relevant  to\r\nresentencing on the remaining  counts.  Accordingly, remand would\r\nbe an  empty and needless exercise.   See Lilly, 983  F.2d at 305\r                                                         \r\nn.11. \r\n\n3  This rule provides, in pertinent part, that \"[p]lain errors or\r\ndefects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they\r\nwere not brought to the  attention of the court.\"  Fed.

At the  hearing,  the  court was  therefore\r\n\nprepared  to adopt the PSR's determination that loss for purposes\r\n\nof   2F1.1 was more than $5,000,000.  According to the transcript\r\n\nof the  sentencing hearing, the district court  adopted the lower\r\n\n$2,000,000  to $5,000,000  loss range  \"in light  of the  need to\r\n\ncalibrate  the loss  attributable to  [Appellant's]  actions more\r\n\nfairly.\"  Contrary to Appellant's claim, nowhere in our review of\r\n\nthe  record do  we find  any evidence  that the  district court's\r\n\nfinding  was based  on  \"speculation.\"    We  note  further  that\r\n\nAppellant fully conceded  the accuracy  of these  figures at  her\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nchange of plea hearing  and at sentencing.  Accordingly,  we find\r\n\nno \"clear\"  or \"obvious\" error by the district court.  Even if we\r\n\nwere  to find any,  there is no  evidence that  the alleged error\r\n\naffected her \"substantial rights\" or her sentence. \r\n\n          Finally, Appellant argues that the district court erred\r\n\nin ordering restitution under 18 U.S.C.   3664, which establishes\r\n\nthe factors to be considered by the court in determining an order\r\n\nof restitution,  in  excess  of  $10  million,  an  amount  which\r\n\nexceeded the loss range  used by the district court  for purposes\r\n\nof   2F1.1.   We find, however,  that Appellant waived  her claim\r\n\nregarding the restitution  order because she failed  to object to\r\n\nthe  PSR's  calculation  of  the  victim  bank's  actual loss  as\r\n\n$10,998,072.67  in  principal, to  the  PSR's determination  that\r\n\nrestitution  in that amount  was appropriate, or  to the district\r\n\ncourt's  order of restitution in that amount.  As with the amount\r\n\nof  loss, we  can reverse  the restitution  order only  for plain\r\n\nerror.  Olivier-D az, 13 F.3d at 5.  Appellant conceded below and\r                              \r\n\ndoes  not deny  on  appeal  that the  actual  amount of  loss  in\r\n\nprincipal  to the  victim  bank was  in  excess of  $10  million.\r\n\nAccordingly, the  district court's  order of restitution  in that\r\n\namount was fully appropriate, and, because it is  fully supported\r\n\nby the  record, it does not  constitute plain error.   We find no\r\n\nevidence  of  harm to  Appellant's  \"substantial  rights\" by  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  decision to hold Appellant  responsible for the\r\n\nentire loss resulting from her fraud.  \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  the sentence imposed by the\r\n\ndistrict court is Affirmed.\r                                    \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n",

For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1991, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Patricia C. Harrison and her husband Stephen G. Harrison, charging them with one hundred counts of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 and with one count of bankruptcy fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 152.   Appellant moved to dismiss the indictment on May 18, 1992, on the ground that the bank fraud counts were multiplicitous.   Six months later, on November 16, 1992, the district court denied Appellant's motion and on January 12, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment, which merged a number of the bank fraud counts from the original indictment into a lesser number of counts.   The superseding indictment alleged three separate schemes by which Appellant and her husband defrauded the banks involved.   On April 10, 1995, Appellant pled guilty to seventy-seven of the seventy-nine counts of bank fraud charged in the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the plea agreement, Appellant acknowledged that she was subject to separate punishments of up to five years' imprisonment on each of the counts but one, for which she was subject to a maximum penalty of up to thirty years.   Appellant also agreed to pay a special assessment of $50 on each of the seventy-seven counts to which she pled guilty.   The pre-sentence report (\"PSR\") calculated Appellant's offense level in accordance with the plea agreement, with two exceptions, only one of which is relevant to this appeal.   The PSR calculated the appropriate loss range under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1)(K) to be more than $5,000,000 because the victim bank lost principal in the amount of $10,998,072.67.   This differed from the plea agreement, which provided for a loss of between $2-$5 million.   In her pre-hearing sentencing memorandum, Appellant asked the district court to depart from the applicable guideline range for two reasons:  (i) the amount of loss overstated the seriousness of her offense;  and (ii) her husband's illness.   Apart from these arguments, Appellant did not object to the PSR's amount of loss or guideline calculation, or to any of the offense conduct detailed in the PSR that was the basis for those findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, and after hearing argument from the parties regarding the appropriate loss amount, the district court found the loss for purposes of &#167; 2F1.1 to be between $2-5 million.   In addition, the district court found that the total offense level was 18, with a corresponding guideline sentencing range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months' imprisonment.   The district court made a three-level downward departure, on the basis of circumstances surrounding the ill health of Appellant's husband, bringing the total to level fifteen, with a corresponding range of eighteen to twenty-four months.   Appellant's total offense level of fifteen was made up of the following elements:  a base offense level of six under &#167; 2F1.1(a);  a ten-level enhancement under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1) to reflect the amount of loss, found to be between $2-$5 million;  a two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2)(A);  a two-level enhancement for supervising others in the commission of the offense under &#167; 3B1.1(c);  and a three-level downward departure based on the ill health of Appellant's husband.   Combined with a criminal history category of I, Appellant's resulting total offense level was fifteen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 7, 1995, the district court sentenced Appellant to 24 months in prison and ordered her to pay restitution in the amount of $10,998,072.67, the amount lost by the victim bank as found in the PSR by the district court.   The district court also imposed a three year period of supervised release and a special assessment of $3,850.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for clear error factbound matters in sentencing, mindful that such factual findings need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and review de novo questions of law, including the applicability of a relevant guideline.   United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1224 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant entered into an unconditional plea agreement, whereby she agreed to plead guilty to the seventy-seven counts of bank fraud, to subject herself to separate punishment on each of these counts, and to pay a special assessment on each of those counts.   Appellant does not challenge her conviction but, rather, challenges the sentence imposed by the district court.   Appellant contends that the seventy-seven counts of bank fraud are facially multiplicitous because the superseding indictment supports, at most, only three counts of bank fraud.  See, e.g., United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 574 (1989) (establishing the principle that a defendant who pleads guilty to a criminal charge may subsequently assert a claim of multiple punishment in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause only if the violation is apparent on the face of the indictment itself);  United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 302-04 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that an indictment for bank fraud is multiplicitous when it charges a defendant with multiple counts for each \"single execution of a unitary scheme\").   Because the seventy-seven counts were multiplicitous, Appellant argues, she was prejudiced in the view of the sentencing court and her sentence violates Double Jeopardy principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While our review of the district court's application and interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is plenary, Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d at 1224, \"[w]e have repeatedly stated in the sentencing context, as well as in other areas, that issues not presented to the district court will not be addressed for the first time on appeal.\"  United States v. Haggert, 980 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir.1992).   We have also stated that \"[a]rguments not raised below will be entertained on appeal only in 'horrendous cases where a gross miscarriage of justice would occur' and, in addition, where the newly asserted ground 'is so compelling as virtually to insure appellant's success.' \"   Id. (quoting Johnston v. Holiday Inns, 595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.1979)).   Here, these straightforward rules leave Appellant's sails flapping idly in the wind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"a defendant's unconditional guilty plea does not automatically waive the right to appeal matters incident to sentencing as opposed to guilt,\" United States v. Cordero, 42 F.3d 697, 699 (1st Cir.1994), we nonetheless find Appellant's multiplicity argument waived.   Even though she only raises this argument as to her sentencing, we find controlling the fact that Appellant had ample opportunity to challenge the sentence imposed and raise her multiplicity argument as to sentencing before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record before us clearly shows that Appellant never objected on grounds of multiplicity or raised this argument during the change of plea hearing, in her pre-hearing sentence memorandum, or during the sentencing hearing.   The PSR calculated Appellant's offense level to be twenty-one.   Appellant did not file any objections to the PSR. In her pre-sentence memorandum, Appellant argued on two grounds that the district court depart from the applicable guideline sentencing range, but neither of them concerned the multiplicity of the counts.   Indeed, besides supporting a finding of Appellant's failure to object, the record shows that the district court specifically drew Appellant's attention to the government's evidence regarding the counts charged, pointed out the portion of the agreement identifying the maximum penalties to which defendant could be subject on each count, and notified Appellant of the possibility of the imposition of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant insists, however, that she did not waive her multiplicity challenge, arguing that it was preserved for appeal because she challenged the original indictment on multiplicity grounds.   Appellant relies on two cases, United States v. Molinaro, 11 F.3d 853, 858 n. 9 (9th Cir.1993), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 668 (1994), and United States v. Fuesting, 845 F.2d 664 (7th Cir.1988), for the proposition that she was not required to challenge the superseding indictment after her motion to dismiss the original indictment was denied.   We need not rule on the merit of Appellant's argument, because what controls is Appellant's subsequent act of voluntarily and intelligently pleading guilty to all seventy-seven counts, coupled with her failure to make any objection to the superseding indictment, to the seventy-seven counts, to the offense conduct contained in the PSR, or to the sentence imposed.   Thus, we decline to consider this argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that the district court's fraud loss calculation was erroneous under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1)(K), which increases the level of punishment according to the amount of \"loss\" caused by the fraud.   We find, however, that Appellant waived any claim of error in the court's calculation of loss under &#167; 2F1.1, because no objection was made to the accuracy of the facts set forth in the offense conduct section of the PSR, to the amount of loss found by the district court, or to the district court's guideline calculation.   Because Appellant failed to object to the district court's determination as to the amount of loss for purposes of &#167; 2F1.1, her sentence can be reversed on this basis only upon a showing of \"plain error.\"   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  To meet the plain error standard there must be:  (i) a reviewable error (ii) that is \"clear\" or \"obvious\" and (iii) affects \"substantial rights.\"  United States v. Benjamin, 30 F.3d 196, 197 (1st Cir.1994).   We retain the discretion not to correct an error, however plain, unless the error \" 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"   United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779 (1993) (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160 (1936));  see United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting same language).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from constituting plain error, the district court's finding as to the amount of loss attributable to Appellant's conduct under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1)(K) was fully supported by the record.   The PSR found that the actual loss to the victim bank was $10,998,072.67 in principal and $7,858,292.69 in interest on Appellant's loan.   At the hearing, the court was therefore prepared to adopt the PSR's determination that loss for purposes of &#167; 2F1.1 was more than $5,000,000.   According to the transcript of the sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the lower $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 loss range \"in light of the need to calibrate the loss attributable to [Appellant's] actions more fairly.\"   Contrary to Appellant's claim, nowhere in our review of the record do we find any evidence that the district court's finding was based on \"speculation.\"   We note further that Appellant fully conceded the accuracy of these figures at her change of plea hearing and at sentencing.   Accordingly, we find no \"clear\" or \"obvious\" error by the district court.   Even if we were to find any, there is no evidence that the alleged error affected her \"substantial rights\" or her sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Appellant argues that the district court erred in ordering restitution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664, which establishes the factors to be considered by the court in determining an order of restitution, in excess of $10 million, an amount which exceeded the loss range used by the district court for purposes of &#167; 2F1.1.  We find, however, that Appellant waived her claim regarding the restitution order because she failed to object to the PSR's calculation of the victim bank's actual loss as $10,998,072.67 in principal, to the PSR's determination that restitution in that amount was appropriate, or to the district court's order of restitution in that amount.   As with the amount of loss, we can reverse the restitution order only for plain error.  Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d at 5.  Appellant conceded below and does not deny on appeal that the actual amount of loss in principal to the victim bank was in excess of $10 million.   Accordingly, the district court's order of restitution in that amount was fully appropriate, and, because it is fully supported by the record, it does not constitute plain error.   We find no evidence of harm to Appellant's \"substantial rights\" by the district court's decision to hold Appellant responsible for the entire loss resulting from her fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed by the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever knowingly executes ... a scheme or artifice--(1) to defraud a financial institution;  or (2) to obtain any of the moneys ...

The pre-sentence report (\"PSR\") calculated Appellant's offense level in accordance with the plea agreement, with two exceptions, only one of which is relevant to this appeal.   The PSR calculated the appropriate loss range under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1)(K) to be more than $5,000,000 because the victim bank lost principal in the amount of $10,998,072.67.

In her pre-hearing sentencing memorandum, Appellant asked the district court to depart from the applicable guideline range for two reasons:  (i) the amount of loss overstated the seriousness of her offense;  and (ii) her husband's illness.   Apart from these arguments, Appellant did not object to the PSR's amount of loss or guideline calculation, or to any of the offense conduct detailed in the PSR that was the basis for those findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, and after hearing argument from the parties regarding the appropriate loss amount, the district court found the loss for purposes of &#167; 2F1.1 to be between $2-5 million.   In addition, the district court found that the total offense level was 18, with a corresponding guideline sentencing range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months' imprisonment.   The district court made a three-level downward departure, on the basis of circumstances surrounding the ill health of Appellant's husband, bringing the total to level fifteen, with a corresponding range of eighteen to twenty-four months.   Appellant's total offense level of fifteen was made up of the following elements:  a base offense level of six under &#167; 2F1.1(a);  a ten-level enhancement under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1) to reflect the amount of loss, found to be between $2-$5 million;  a two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2)(A);  a two-level enhancement for supervising others in the commission of the offense under &#167; 3B1.1(c);  and a three-level downward departure based on the ill health of Appellant's husband.   Combined with a criminal history category of I, Appellant's resulting total offense level was fifteen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 7, 1995, the district court sentenced Appellant to 24 months in prison and ordered her to pay restitution in the amount of $10,998,072.67, the amount lost by the victim bank as found in the PSR by the district court.   The district court also imposed a three year period of supervised release and a special assessment of $3,850.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.

United States v. Martinez-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707600\"><a href=\"/opinion/707600/united-states-v-olivia-martinez-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>, 1224 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant entered into an unconditional plea agreement, whereby she agreed to plead guilty to the seventy-seven counts of bank fraud, to subject herself to separate punishment on each of these counts, and to pay a special assessment on each of those counts.   Appellant does not challenge her conviction but, rather, challenges the sentence imposed by the district court.   Appellant contends that the seventy-seven counts of bank fraud are facially multiplicitous because the superseding indictment supports, at most, only three counts of bank fraud.  See, e.g., United States v. Broce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112177\"><a href=\"/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 574 (1989) (establishing the principle that a defendant who pleads guilty to a criminal charge may subsequently assert a claim of multiple punishment in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause only if the violation is apparent on the face of the indictment itself);  United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 302-04 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that an indictment for bank fraud is multiplicitous when it charges a defendant with multiple counts for each \"single execution of a unitary scheme\").   Because the seventy-seven counts were multiplicitous, Appellant argues, she was prejudiced in the view of the sentencing court and her sentence violates Double Jeopardy principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While our review of the district court's application and interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is plenary, Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d at 1224, \"[w]e have repeatedly stated in the sentencing context, as well as in other areas, that issues not presented to the district court will not be addressed for the first time on appeal.\"  United States v.

We have also stated that \"[a]rguments not raised below will be entertained on appeal only in 'horrendous cases where a gross miscarriage of justice would occur' and, in addition, where the newly asserted ground 'is so compelling as virtually to insure appellant's success.' \"   Id. (quoting Johnston v. Holiday Inns, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364881\"><a href=\"/opinion/364881/alfred-m-johnston-individually-alfred-m-johnston-trustee-and-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 894 (1st Cir.1979)).   Here, these straightforward rules leave Appellant's sails flapping idly in the wind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"a defendant's unconditional guilty plea does not automatically waive the right to appeal matters incident to sentencing as opposed to guilt,\" United States v. Cordero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195801\"><a href=\"/opinion/195801/united-states-v-cordero-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span>, 699 (1st Cir.1994), we nonetheless find Appellant's multiplicity argument waived.   Even though she only raises this argument as to her sentencing, we find controlling the fact that Appellant had ample opportunity to challenge the sentence imposed and raise her multiplicity argument as to sentencing before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record before us clearly shows that Appellant never objected on grounds of multiplicity or raised this argument during the change of plea hearing, in her pre-hearing sentence memorandum, or during the sentencing hearing.   The PSR calculated Appellant's offense level to be twenty-one.   Appellant did not file any objections to the PSR. In her pre-sentence memorandum, Appellant argued on two grounds that the district court depart from the applicable guideline sentencing range, but neither of them concerned the multiplicity of the counts.   Indeed, besides supporting a finding of Appellant's failure to object, the record shows that the district court specifically drew Appellant's attention to the government's evidence regarding the counts charged, pointed out the portion of the agreement identifying the maximum penalties to which defendant could be subject on each count, and notified Appellant of the possibility of the imposition of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant insists, however, that she did not waive her multiplicity challenge, arguing that it was preserved for appeal because she challenged the original indictment on multiplicity grounds.   Appellant relies on two cases, United States v. Molinaro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658614\"><a href=\"/opinion/658614/united-states-v-john-lee-molinaro-united-states-of-america-v-donald-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 858 n. 9 (9th Cir.1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></span> (1994), and United States v. Fuesting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504906\"><a href=\"/opinion/504906/united-states-v-ronald-fuesting/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1988), for the proposition that she was not required to challenge the superseding indictment after her motion to dismiss the original indictment was denied.   We need not rule on the merit of Appellant's argument, because what controls is Appellant's subsequent act of voluntarily and intelligently pleading guilty to all seventy-seven counts, coupled with her failure to make any objection to the superseding indictment, to the seventy-seven counts, to the offense conduct contained in the PSR, or to the sentence imposed.   Thus, we decline to consider this argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that the district court's fraud loss calculation was erroneous under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1)(K), which increases the level of punishment according to the amount of \"loss\" caused by the fraud.   We find, however, that Appellant waived any claim of error in the court's calculation of loss under &#167; 2F1.1, because no objection was made to the accuracy of the facts set forth in the offense conduct section of the PSR, to the amount of loss found by the district court, or to the district court's guideline calculation.   Because Appellant failed to object to the district court's determination as to the amount of loss for purposes of &#167; 2F1.1, her sentence can be reversed on this basis only upon a showing of \"plain error.\"   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  To meet the plain error standard there must be:  (i) a reviewable error (ii) that is \"clear\" or \"obvious\" and (iii) affects \"substantial rights.\"  United States v.

We retain the discretion not to correct an error, however plain, unless the error \" 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"   United States v.

Olivier-Diaz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195103\"><a href=\"/opinion/195103/united-states-v-olivier/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting same language).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from constituting plain error, the district court's finding as to the amount of loss attributable to Appellant's conduct under &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1)(K) was fully supported by the record.   The PSR found that the actual loss to the victim bank was $10,998,072.67 in principal and $7,858,292.69 in interest on Appellant's loan.   At the hearing, the court was therefore prepared to adopt the PSR's determination that loss for purposes of &#167; 2F1.1 was more than $5,000,000.   According to the transcript of the sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the lower $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 loss range \"in light of the need to calibrate the loss attributable to [Appellant's] actions more fairly.\"   Contrary to Appellant's claim, nowhere in our review of the record do we find any evidence that the district court's finding was based on \"speculation.\"   We note further that Appellant fully conceded the accuracy of these figures at her change of plea hearing and at sentencing.   Accordingly, we find no \"clear\" or \"obvious\" error by the district court.   Even if we were to find any, there is no evidence that the alleged error affected her \"substantial rights\" or her sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Appellant argues that the district court erred in ordering restitution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664, which establishes the factors to be considered by the court in determining an order of restitution, in excess of $10 million, an amount which exceeded the loss range used by the district court for purposes of &#167; 2F1.1.  We find, however, that Appellant waived her claim regarding the restitution order because she failed to object to the PSR's calculation of the victim bank's actual loss as $10,998,072.67 in principal, to the PSR's determination that restitution in that amount was appropriate, or to the district court's order of restitution in that amount.   As with the amount of loss, we can reverse the restitution order only for plain error.  Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d at 5.  Appellant conceded below and does not deny on appeal that the actual amount of loss in principal to the victim bank was in excess of $10 million.   Accordingly, the district court's order of restitution in that amount was fully appropriate, and, because it is fully supported by the record, it does not constitute plain error.   We find no evidence of harm to Appellant's \"substantial rights\" by the district court's decision to hold Appellant responsible for the entire loss resulting from her fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed by the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever knowingly executes ... a scheme or artifice--(1) to defraud a financial institution;  or (2) to obtain any of the moneys ...
