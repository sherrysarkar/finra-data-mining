This appeal demands that we mull\r                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.\r                                        \r\n\nthe  prerequisites for liability under  the Ku Klux  Klan Act, 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1985(3) (1994).  We hold that (1) the class-based animus\r\n\nrequired  to ground a private  right of action  under the statute\r\n\napplies to  conspiracies allegedly involving  public officials in\r\n\nthe same way as it applies to all other conspiracies; and (2) the\r\n\nrequirement  is not  satisfied  where, as  here, no  sufficiently\r\n\ndefined  class  appears.   Accordingly,  we  affirm the  district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of the action.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Whether or not it  is true that all politics  is local,\r\n\nthis  case  bears  witness  that  local  politics,  no less  than\r\n\nnational  politics, can become meanspirited.   From 1984 to 1990,\r\n\nplaintiff-appellant  Alan  Aulson  served   as  a  selectman   in\r\n\nGeorgetown, Massachusetts.  In his complaint, he alleges that the\r\n\ndefendants   (a  cadre   of  elected   and  appointed   municipal\r\n\nofficeholders)  are members of  an incumbent group  of \"old guard\r\n\npoliticians\"  who more  or  less  run things  in  the town.    In\r\n\ncontrast, he is a  \"member[] of a political group  which supports\r\n\ncandidates  who oppose  the politics  of the  `old guard.'\"   The\r\n\ncomplaint  charges  that  Aulson  paid  a  stiff  price  for  his\r\n\nopposition:  the members  of the old guard collogued  against him\r\n\nand wreaked their vengeance by such nefarious means as conducting\r\n\nillegal searches pursuant to  sham prosecutions.  This course  of\r\n\nconduct,  he asserts, gives  rise to a  cause of  action under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1985(3).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          Aulson originally  brought his suit in  a state venue.1\r\n\nRemarking the federal question, the  defendants removed it to the\r\n\ndistrict  court and then sought  dismissal under Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r\n\n12(b)(6).  Despite the  plaintiff's objection, the district court\r\n\ngranted the motion to dismiss.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          Inasmuch as the trial judge dismissed the complaint for\r\n\nfailure to state an  actionable claim, we review his  decision de\r\n\nnovo, accepting  as true  all well-pleaded factual  averments and\r\n\nindulging  all  reasonable inferences  in the  plaintiff's favor.\r\n\nSee  Leatherman v. Tarrant County N. I. &amp; C. Unit, 507 U.S.  163,\r                                                           \r\n\n164 (1993);  Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,  903 F.2d 49,\r                                                            \r\n\n52  (1st  Cir.  1990).   We  hasten  to add,  however,  that this\r\n\ndeferential standard does not force an appellate court to swallow\r\n\nthe   plaintiff's  invective   hook,  line,   and  sinker;   bald\r\n\nassertions,      unsupportable      conclusions,     periphrastic\r\n\ncircumlocutions,  and the like need not be credited.  See Correa-\r                                                                           \r\n\nMartinez, 903  F.2d at 52;  Dartmouth Review v.  Dartmouth Coll.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n889  F.2d 13,  16 (1st  Cir. 1989).   It is  only when  the facts\r\n\nalleged,  if proven, will not  justify recovery that  an order of\r\n\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) may stand.  See Gooley v. Mobil Oil\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp., 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).\r               \r\n\n                                A\r                                          A\r\n\n          Section    1985(3)   proscribes    certain   enumerated\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Technically there are two plaintiffs (Aulson and his wife).\r\nSince Mrs.  Aulson's presence  does not affect  the legal  issues\r\nbefore us, we omit further reference to her.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nconspiracies.2   To  state a  claim under    1985(3)  a plaintiff\r\n\nmust  allege   the  existence   of  (1)   a  conspiracy,   (2)  a\r\n\nconspiratorial  purpose to deprive a person  or class of persons,\r\n\ndirectly or indirectly, of the equal protection of the laws or of\r\n\nequal  privileges and immunities under the laws, (3) an overt act\r\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) either (a) an injury to\r\n\nperson or property,  or (b) a  deprivation of a  constitutionally\r\n\nprotected right or  privilege.  See Griffin v.  Breckenridge, 403\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  88, 102  (1971).  In  Griffin, the  Supreme Court  placed a\r                                             \r\n\ngloss  on  these  four   elements,  effectively  adding  a  fifth\r\n\nrequirement.   It  construed the  statute's references  to \"equal\r\n\nprotection\" and \"equal privileges  and immunities under the laws\"\r\n\nto  signify that a plaintiff may recover thereunder only when the\r\n\nconspiratorial  conduct of  which  he complains  is propelled  by\r\n\n\"some  racial,  or  perhaps  otherwise  class-based,  invidiously\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus.\"  Id.\r                                      \r\n\n                                B\r                                          B\r\n\n          This  added  requirement  looms  as  an  insurmountable\r\n\nobstacle to the plaintiff's  attempted embrace of   1985(3).   He\r\n\nseeks  to ameliorate this difficulty  in two different  ways:  he\r\n\nstrives first  to detour around  the obstacle,  and, failing,  he\r\n\nthen tries to climb over it.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The statute  confers a private right of action for injuries\r\noccasioned when \"two or more persons . . . conspire . . . for the\r\npurpose of  depriving, either directly or  indirectly, any person\r\nor class  of persons of the  equal protection of the  laws, or of\r\nequal  privileges and  immunities under  the laws  . .  . .\"   42\r\nU.S.C.   1985(3).\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          1.    Public/Private  Conspiracies.    The  plaintiff's\r                    1.    Public/Private  Conspiracies.\r                                                      \r\n\neffort to bypass the point entirely centers around his insistence\r\n\nthat  the  requirement  of  a class-based  discriminatory  animus\r\n\napplies  only   to   wholly  private   conspiracies   (that   is,\r\n\nconspiracies  that  do not  involve  public  officials acting  as\r\n\nsuch),  and that he need  neither allege nor  prove a class-based\r\n\nanimus in this  action (which  is directed at  a conspiracy  that\r\n\nallegedly involves public officials doing the public's business).\r\n\n          This gambit  has been  tried in several  other circuits\r\n\nand has uniformly been found wanting.  See Bisbee v. Bey, 39 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n1096,  1102 (10th  Cir.  1994), cert.  denied,  115 S.

Military Coll.,  970 F.2d  785, 794  (11th Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1992),  cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1018 (1993); Munson v. Friske, 754\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 683,  694-95 &amp; n.8 (7th Cir. 1985).  Although this court has\r\n\nnever squarely repudiated  the gambit,  we have on  at least  two\r\n\noccasions required  (albeit without substantive  comment) that  a\r\n\nclass-based animus be shown notwithstanding that public officials\r\n\nwere  alleged  to  be   active  participants  in  the  particular\r\n\nconspiracies there  at issue.   See Romero-Barcelo  v. Hernandez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nAgosto, 75  F.3d 23, 34  (1st Cir.  1996); Daley v.  Town of  New\r                                                                           \r\n\nDurham, 733 F.2d 4, 7 (1st  Cir. 1984).  Thus, following the path\r                \r\n\ndown which the plaintiff beckons not only would set us apart from\r\n\nour sister circuits but also would undermine our own precedents.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          In all events, an unforced reading of   1985(3) affords\r\n\nno principled basis for distinguishing between public and private\r\n\nconspiracies.    Griffin   neither  supports  nor  suggests   the\r                                  \r\n\nexistence of such a distinction, and, at any rate, it  is not the\r\n\nproper province of a federal court to rewrite a statute under the\r\n\nguise  of  interpretation.    Thus, we  decline  the  plaintiff's\r\n\ninvitation  to create by judicial  fiat two classes  of   1985(3)\r\n\nconspiracies along a public/private axis.\r\n\n          So ends this phase of our inquiry.  To the  extent that\r\n\nwe  have  not  previously  made  the  scope  of  the  requirement\r\n\nexplicit, we  now hold that to  state a claim under    1985(3) in\r\n\nrespect  to  conspiracies  involving  public  officials,  private\r\n\nactors,  or  both,  plaintiffs   must  allege  that  the  conduct\r\n\ncomplained of  resulted from an invidiously discriminatory class-\r\n\nbased animus.\r\n\n          2.   Cognizable Classes.  The  plaintiff next struggles\r                    2.   Cognizable Classes.\r                                           \r\n\nto surmount the  obstacle instead  of skirting it.   He  contends\r\n\nthat he is a member of a class protected by  1985(3), and that he\r\n\nhas  alleged  as much.   His  contention  does not  withstand the\r\n\nmildest scrutiny.\r\n\n          The complaint  is a lengthy, somewhat prolix narrative.\r\n\nIn  regard to  the  class-based animus  requirement, however,  it\r\n\nstates nothing more than that Alan Aulson and a named confederate\r\n\n(not  a  party to  the suit)  are  \"representative members\"  of a\r\n\n\"class\" that is composed solely of persons who support candidates\r\n\nopposed  to the  politics  of  the  \"old  guard,\"  and  that  the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ndefendants  are members  of  the \"old  guard.\"   On  this  skimpy\r\n\npredicate,  the  plaintiff posits  that  the  ad hoc  \"opposition\r                                                              \r\n\ngroup\"  is a  class,  and that  the  defendants' supposed  animus\r\n\nagainst it  is class-based  within the  meaning ascribed to  that\r\n\nadjectival term by the Griffin Court.  We do not agree.\r                                        \r\n\n          We have  previously interpreted  the  Griffin gloss  to\r                                                                 \r\n\ndenote that plaintiffs  must allege  facts showing  that (1)  the\r\n\ndefendants conspired against them  because of their membership in\r\n\na class, and (2)  the criteria defining the class  are invidious.\r\n\nSee Hahn  v.

The  first component  focuses  on the\r\n\nsubstantive  characteristic defining  the  class, e.g.,  race  or\r\n\ngender  or  political  affiliation.    While  it  is  universally\r\n\nacknowledged  that  racial  classes are  within  the  ambit of   \r\n\n1985(3), see, e.g., Griffin,  403 U.S. at 102, no  such consensus\r                                     \r\n\nexists anent political classes.   Some courts have concluded that\r\n\npolitical  classes are  within the protective  pale of    1985(3)\r\n\nbecause  reference  to  political  characteristics  comprises  an\r\n\ninvidious   method  for   subjecting   persons  to   differential\r\n\ntreatment.  See, e.g.,  Conklin v. Lovely, 834 F.2d 543, 549 (6th\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1987) (holding that   1985(3) may shield a political class);\r\n\nKeating v.

We  emphasize\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthat  this inquiry  is distinct  from the  question of  whether a\r\n\ngroup  denominated by  a particular  characteristic is  sheltered\r\n\nfrom discrimination by    1985(3).   No matter  what the  alleged\r\n\nbasis  for  discrimination,  the  allegation  of  a  \"class-based\r\n\nanimus\" naturally presumes that there is a specific, identifiable\r\n\nclass   against  whom  the  defendants  can  have  discriminated.\r\n\nAccepting for the sake  of argument that political  classes enjoy\r\n\nthe prophylaxis of   1985(3), the present plaintiffs nevertheless\r\n\nstumble over this second prong.\r\n\n          Though  there  is no  comprehensive  set  of rules  for\r\n\ndetermining when individuals constitute a class for purposes of  \r\n\n1985(3), there are certain inescapable minimum requirements.  For\r\n\ninstance, it is clear that at the very least a class must be more\r\n\nthan  just a  group of  persons who  bear the  brunt of  the same\r\n\nallegedly  tortious behavior.  If  a class could  be defined from\r\n\nnothing more than a  shared characteristic that happened  to form\r\n\nthe basis of  the defendants' actions, the requirement  of class-\r\n\nbased animus would be drained of all meaningful content.  Justice\r\n\nScalia put the proposition in these terms:\r\n\n          Whatever  may  be the  precise  meaning of  a\r\n          \"class\" for purposes of Griffin's speculative\r                                                   \r\n          extension of    1985(3) beyond race, the term\r\n          unquestionably connotes something more than a\r\n          group of  individuals who  share a  desire to\r\n          engage   in  conduct   that  the      1985(3)\r\n          defendant disfavors.   Otherwise, innumerable\r\n          tort  plaintiffs  would  be  able  to  assert\r\n          causes of action  under    1985(3) by  simply\r\n          defining the aggrieved class as those seeking\r\n          to  engage in the  activity the defendant has\r\n          interfered with. \r\n\nBray, 506 U.S. at 269.\r              \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n          Our  own case  law  confirms  that  a class  cannot  be\r\n\ndefined  solely  on the  basis of  harm  inflicted.   In Creative\r                                                                           \r\n\nEnvironments,  Inc. v. Estabrook, 680 F.2d  822 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied,  459 U.S.  989 (1982),  we considered  a    1985(3) claim\r                \r\n\nbrought by a developer, alleging that a  municipal planning board\r\n\ndiscriminated against  a class of future homeowners in the course\r\n\nof rejecting  a proposed subdivision.   We held that  even if the\r\n\ndeveloper could sue  on behalf of this class, no    1985(3) claim\r\n\nwould lie because the class was no more than \"an  undefined group\r\n\nof  people  with unknown  income,  racial,  political and  social\r\n\ncharacteristics.\"  Id. at  834.  The only thing that  the members\r                                \r\n\nof  this  group  had  in  common  was  that  they  stood  to   be\r\n\ndisadvantaged  by  the defendants'  actions.   Consequently,  the\r\n\ncomplaint  \"failed to  identify  any definite  class which  would\r\n\nsatisfy section 1985(3)'s requirement.\"  Id.\r                                                      \r\n\n          The principle that emerges  from these cases is  that a\r\n\nclass, to  be cognizable,  must be identifiable  by reference  to\r\n\n\"something  more than  . . .  [the members'] desire  to engage in\r\n\nconduct  that the   1985(3) defendant disfavors.\"  Bray, 506 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  269.   In  other  words, the  line  drawn by  the substantive\r\n\ncharacteristic must  divide individuals into  distinct, separate,\r\n\nand identifiable  groups.   This means,  for example, \"white\"  as\r\n\nopposed  to \"non-white,\" see,  e.g., Stevens  v. Tillman,  568 F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp. 289, 293 (N.D.

Welch,  53 F.3d 428,  449 (1st Cir. 1995)\r                                       \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n(holding  that  women  constitute   a  protected  class  under   \r\n\n1985(3)), or, if political  classes are includable   a  matter on\r\n\nwhich  we do not opine    \"registered Republicans\"  as opposed to\r\n\nother voters, see, e.g.,  Keating, 706 F.2d at 379  (holding that\r                                           \r\n\nRepublicans constitute a protected class under   1985(3)).\r\n\n          We  hold, therefore,  that  a class  is cognizable  for\r\n\npurposes of   1985(3)'s  class-based animus requirement only when\r\n\nit is comprised  of a  distinctive and identifiable  group.   For\r\n\nthis purpose,  distinctiveness connotes that a  reasonable person\r\n\ncan readily determine by  means of an objective criterion  or set\r\n\nof  criteria who is  a member of the  group and who  is not.

The\r\n\nplaintiff  defines the group  only as  persons who  support other\r\n\npersons  \"opposed to the politics  of the old  guard,\" and offers\r\n\nhimself  and  one  other  former  selectmen   as  \"representative\r\n\nmembers.\"   As far  as anybody  can  tell, aside  from these  two\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n\"members\" this  group is wholly indeterminate.

There is simply no way to characterize this group as\r\n\nan  identifiable  segment of  the community  by reference  to any\r\n\nobjective criteria, and,  hence, it cannot serve as  a cognizable\r\n\nclass within  the purview of   1985(3).   See Gleason v.

To put  it bluntly, membership in both the\r\n\nplaintiff's  proposed class  and  the antagonist  class (the  old\r\n\nguard)  is, like  beauty, almost  exclusively in  the eye  of the\r\n\nbeholder.  This is not the stuff of cognizability.\r\n\n          To sum up, the lone criterion that the plaintiff offers\r\n\nto define the suggested  class is opposition to the  \"politics of\r\n\nthe old guard.\"  This description will not do because it draws no\r\n\nreadily identifiable  line.  Objectively speaking,  a third party\r\n\nat most can observe that the putative class  is comprised of some\r\n\n(unknown) persons who support  some (unknown) political aspirants\r\n\nwho object to some  (unknown) aspect of some  (unknown) political\r\n\nviews or  practices  of some  other  (unknown) persons  who  have\r\n\nenjoyed some (unknown) degree  of political success in Georgetown\r\n\nfor some (unknown) period of time.\r\n\n          We have said  enough on  this score.   By not  alleging\r\n\ndiscrimination against a  distinctive, readily identifiable class\r\n\nof persons, the plaintiff has failed to state an actionable claim\r\n\nunder   1985(3).

At one  point, the\r\n\nplaintiff  asked  the  district  court  for leave  to  amend  the\r\n\ncomplaint  by naming one or two additional defendants.  The court\r\n\ndenied  the  motion without  prejudice  to  renewal if  the  case\r\n\nsurvived  a   dispositive  motion  on  behalf   of  the  existing\r\n\ndefendants.     The  district   court  subsequently  granted  the\r\n\ndefendants' motion  to dismiss  without granting leave  to amend.\r\n\nOn  appeal, the plaintiff makes an oblique reference in the reply\r\n\nbrief that suggests he  should have been given an  opportunity to\r\n\nreplead.\r\n\n          We rebuff  this suggestion  for three reasons.   First,\r\n\nrelief from an appellate court, requested for the first time in a\r\n\nreply  brief, is  ordinarily denied  as a  matter of  course, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nSandstrom v.

Second, to\r\n\nthe extent the request for leave to amend is before this court at\r\n\nall,  the   plaintiff  has   advanced  absolutely   no  developed\r\n\nargumentation in  support of it, and  so we deem it  to have been\r\n\nabandoned.   See Ryan v. Royal  Ins. Co., 916 F.2d  731, 734 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1990); United States v.

Thus,  the proposed amendment\r\n\nwould have been futile  and the district court therefore  did not\r\n\nerr in neglecting to  authorize an amended complaint.   See Foman\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Relatedly,  if  what the  plaintiff  now  has  in mind  is\r\n\nsomething other  than adding  defendants, he has  not so  stated,\r\n\nand, in all events, we find nothing in the record which indicates\r\n\nthat he  could possibly delineate a cognizable  class and thereby\r\n\nstate  an actionable  claim under    1985(3).   Mindful  of these\r\n\ncircumstances, we  will not permit  the plaintiff to  string this\r\n\nlitigation  out further by attempting to replead in hopes that he\r\n\ncan  resuscitate a case  that, by  all appearances,  is terminal.\r\n\nSee  Correa-Martinez,   903  F.2d  at  59   (counselling  against\r                              \r\n\n\"needlessly  prolong[ing] matters\"  when \"an  amendment would  be\r\n\nfutile or would serve  no legitimate purpose\"); Dartmouth Review,\r                                                                          \r\n\n889 F.2d at 23 (similar).\r\n\nIII.

This appeal demands that we mull\r                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.\r                                        \r\n\nthe  prerequisites for liability under  the Ku Klux  Klan Act, 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1985(3) (1994).  We hold that (1) the class-based animus\r\n\nrequired  to ground a private  right of action  under the statute\r\n\napplies to  conspiracies allegedly involving  public officials in\r\n\nthe same way as it applies to all other conspiracies; and (2) the\r\n\nrequirement  is not  satisfied  where, as  here, no  sufficiently\r\n\ndefined  class  appears.   Accordingly,  we  affirm the  district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of the action.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Whether or not it  is true that all politics  is local,\r\n\nthis  case  bears  witness  that  local  politics,  no less  than\r\n\nnational  politics, can become meanspirited.   From 1984 to 1990,\r\n\nplaintiff-appellant  Alan  Aulson  served   as  a  selectman   in\r\n\nGeorgetown, Massachusetts.  In his complaint, he alleges that the\r\n\ndefendants   (a  cadre   of  elected   and  appointed   municipal\r\n\nofficeholders)  are members of  an incumbent group  of \"old guard\r\n\npoliticians\"  who more  or  less  run things  in  the town.    In\r\n\ncontrast, he is a  \"member[] of a political group  which supports\r\n\ncandidates  who oppose  the politics  of the  `old guard.'\"   The\r\n\ncomplaint  charges  that  Aulson  paid  a  stiff  price  for  his\r\n\nopposition:  the members  of the old guard collogued  against him\r\n\nand wreaked their vengeance by such nefarious means as conducting\r\n\nillegal searches pursuant to  sham prosecutions.  This course  of\r\n\nconduct,  he asserts, gives  rise to a  cause of  action under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1985(3).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          Aulson originally  brought his suit in  a state venue.1\r\n\nRemarking the federal question, the  defendants removed it to the\r\n\ndistrict  court and then sought  dismissal under Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r\n\n12(b)(6).  Despite the  plaintiff's objection, the district court\r\n\ngranted the motion to dismiss.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          Inasmuch as the trial judge dismissed the complaint for\r\n\nfailure to state an  actionable claim, we review his  decision de\r\n\nnovo, accepting  as true  all well-pleaded factual  averments and\r\n\nindulging  all  reasonable inferences  in the  plaintiff's favor.\r\n\nSee  Leatherman v.

It  construed the  statute's references  to \"equal\r\n\nprotection\" and \"equal privileges  and immunities under the laws\"\r\n\nto  signify that a plaintiff may recover thereunder only when the\r\n\nconspiratorial  conduct of  which  he complains  is propelled  by\r\n\n\"some  racial,  or  perhaps  otherwise  class-based,  invidiously\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus.\"  Id.\r                                      \r\n\n                                B\r                                          B\r\n\n          This  added  requirement  looms  as  an  insurmountable\r\n\nobstacle to the plaintiff's  attempted embrace of   1985(3).

Thus, following the path\r                \r\n\ndown which the plaintiff beckons not only would set us apart from\r\n\nour sister circuits but also would undermine our own precedents.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          In all events, an unforced reading of   1985(3) affords\r\n\nno principled basis for distinguishing between public and private\r\n\nconspiracies.    Griffin   neither  supports  nor  suggests   the\r                                  \r\n\nexistence of such a distinction, and, at any rate, it  is not the\r\n\nproper province of a federal court to rewrite a statute under the\r\n\nguise  of  interpretation.    Thus, we  decline  the  plaintiff's\r\n\ninvitation  to create by judicial  fiat two classes  of   1985(3)\r\n\nconspiracies along a public/private axis.\r\n\n          So ends this phase of our inquiry.  To the  extent that\r\n\nwe  have  not  previously  made  the  scope  of  the  requirement\r\n\nexplicit, we  now hold that to  state a claim under    1985(3) in\r\n\nrespect  to  conspiracies  involving  public  officials,  private\r\n\nactors,  or  both,  plaintiffs   must  allege  that  the  conduct\r\n\ncomplained of  resulted from an invidiously discriminatory class-\r\n\nbased animus.\r\n\n          2.

We  emphasize\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthat  this inquiry  is distinct  from the  question of  whether a\r\n\ngroup  denominated by  a particular  characteristic is  sheltered\r\n\nfrom discrimination by    1985(3).   No matter  what the  alleged\r\n\nbasis  for  discrimination,  the  allegation  of  a  \"class-based\r\n\nanimus\" naturally presumes that there is a specific, identifiable\r\n\nclass   against  whom  the  defendants  can  have  discriminated.\r\n\nAccepting for the sake  of argument that political  classes enjoy\r\n\nthe prophylaxis of   1985(3), the present plaintiffs nevertheless\r\n\nstumble over this second prong.\r\n\n          Though  there  is no  comprehensive  set  of rules  for\r\n\ndetermining when individuals constitute a class for purposes of  \r\n\n1985(3), there are certain inescapable minimum requirements.  For\r\n\ninstance, it is clear that at the very least a class must be more\r\n\nthan  just a  group of  persons who  bear the  brunt of  the same\r\n\nallegedly  tortious behavior.  If  a class could  be defined from\r\n\nnothing more than a  shared characteristic that happened  to form\r\n\nthe basis of  the defendants' actions, the requirement  of class-\r\n\nbased animus would be drained of all meaningful content.  Justice\r\n\nScalia put the proposition in these terms:\r\n\n          Whatever  may  be the  precise  meaning of  a\r\n          \"class\" for purposes of Griffin's speculative\r                                                   \r\n          extension of    1985(3) beyond race, the term\r\n          unquestionably connotes something more than a\r\n          group of  individuals who  share a  desire to\r\n          engage   in  conduct   that  the      1985(3)\r\n          defendant disfavors.   Otherwise, innumerable\r\n          tort  plaintiffs  would  be  able  to  assert\r\n          causes of action  under    1985(3) by  simply\r\n          defining the aggrieved class as those seeking\r\n          to  engage in the  activity the defendant has\r\n          interfered with. \r\n\nBray, 506 U.S. at 269.\r              \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n          Our  own case  law  confirms  that  a class  cannot  be\r\n\ndefined  solely  on the  basis of  harm  inflicted.

We leave\r\nthose headaches for another day.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nthis negative definition compound  the problem of identifying the\r\n\nmembers  of the  class since  there is  no way  for  an objective\r\n\nobserver to identify the members of the other  class.

To put  it bluntly, membership in both the\r\n\nplaintiff's  proposed class  and  the antagonist  class (the  old\r\n\nguard)  is, like  beauty, almost  exclusively in  the eye  of the\r\n\nbeholder.  This is not the stuff of cognizability.\r\n\n          To sum up, the lone criterion that the plaintiff offers\r\n\nto define the suggested  class is opposition to the  \"politics of\r\n\nthe old guard.\"  This description will not do because it draws no\r\n\nreadily identifiable  line.  Objectively speaking,  a third party\r\n\nat most can observe that the putative class  is comprised of some\r\n\n(unknown) persons who support  some (unknown) political aspirants\r\n\nwho object to some  (unknown) aspect of some  (unknown) political\r\n\nviews or  practices  of some  other  (unknown) persons  who  have\r\n\nenjoyed some (unknown) degree  of political success in Georgetown\r\n\nfor some (unknown) period of time.\r\n\n          We have said  enough on  this score.   By not  alleging\r\n\ndiscrimination against a  distinctive, readily identifiable class\r\n\nof persons, the plaintiff has failed to state an actionable claim\r\n\nunder   1985(3).

Consequently, the lower court did\r                \r\n\nnot err in dismissing the action.\r\n\n                                C\r                                          C\r\n\n          We must  attend to a  last detail.   At one  point, the\r\n\nplaintiff  asked  the  district  court  for leave  to  amend  the\r\n\ncomplaint  by naming one or two additional defendants.  The court\r\n\ndenied  the  motion without  prejudice  to  renewal if  the  case\r\n\nsurvived  a   dispositive  motion  on  behalf   of  the  existing\r\n\ndefendants.     The  district   court  subsequently  granted  the\r\n\ndefendants' motion  to dismiss  without granting leave  to amend.\r\n\nOn  appeal, the plaintiff makes an oblique reference in the reply\r\n\nbrief that suggests he  should have been given an  opportunity to\r\n\nreplead.\r\n\n          We rebuff  this suggestion  for three reasons.   First,\r\n\nrelief from an appellate court, requested for the first time in a\r\n\nreply  brief, is  ordinarily denied  as a  matter of  course, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nSandstrom v.

Second, to\r\n\nthe extent the request for leave to amend is before this court at\r\n\nall,  the   plaintiff  has   advanced  absolutely   no  developed\r\n\nargumentation in  support of it, and  so we deem it  to have been\r\n\nabandoned.
