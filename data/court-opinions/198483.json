Raymond L. Acosta, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\n              Kravitch,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n   Timothy C. Blank, Barry S. Pollack, and Dechert Price &amp; Rhoads\non brief for appellant.\n   Camille Velez-Rive, Assistant United States Attorney, Jorge E.\nVega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Guillermo Gil,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\nMay 18, 1999\n\n                   \n*Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.  Per curiam.  A jury convicted defendant Julio Ramirez-\nBurgos of aiding and abetting two armed carjackings, see 18 U.S.C.\n2119 and 2, and using a firearm during the commission of a\nviolent crime, see 18 U.S.C.  924(c).  Initially, the district\ncourt sentenced defendant to concurrent 360-month terms on the\ncounts of conviction pertaining to the carjackings (Counts One and\nTwo), and a consecutive 60-month term on the firearm count (Count\nThree).  On May 21, 1997, we affirmed Ramirez's convictions and\nsentences in all respects except insofar as the sentences for\nCounts One and Two exceeded the respective statutory maximums of\n300 months and 180 months.  See United States v. Ramirez-Burgos,\n114 F.3d 1170 (table), 1997 WL 268695, at ** 2-8 (1st Cir. 1997)\n(unpublished decision).  In doing so, we vacated \"so much of the\nsentence as reflects a higher [than the statutory maximum] term for\nCounts One and Two\" and \"remanded to the district court with\ndirections that the court enter a sentence in accordance with [our]\ndecision.\"  Id. at ** 8.\nOn remand, the district court entered an \"Order\nCorrecting Sentence on Remand.\"  In the order, the court committed\ndefendant \"to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned\nfor a term of three-hundred (300) months as to Counts One and Two,\nto be served concurrently with each other . . . .\"  The order made\nclear the district court's intention to sentence defendant at the\nstatutory maximums on Counts One and Two, but overlooked the fact\nthat the statutory maximum on Count Two is 180 months, and not the\n300-month statutory maximum applicable to Count One. \nDefendant appeals again, challenging the 300-month\nsentence imposed on Count Two and asserting that the district court\nerred in failing to hold a post-remand sentencing proceeding at\nwhich his lawyer could appear and present arguments on his behalf. \nDefendant also advances three challenges to his sentences and\nconvictions that are either new or were addressed in our earlier\nopinion: (1) the government violated defendant's due process rights\nby taking inconsistent factual positions at his sentencing and at\nthe sentencing of a cooperating co-defendant with respect to the\n\"serious bodily injury\" and \"reckless endangerment for flight\"\nenhancements defendant received; (2) defendant's convictions are\nunlawfully tainted because the government provided his co-defendant\nwith things of value in exchange for his cooperation; and (3) the\ncourt abused its discretion by failing to specify the extent of its\ntwo upward departures from the guideline sentencing ranges\napplicable to defendant's convictions.\nAs our remand was solely for the purpose of correcting\ndefendant's sentences on Counts One and Two to the extent they\nexceeded the applicable statutory maximums, the court did not err\nin simply issuing a written order without convening a separate\nsentencing proceeding.  Nor was defendant entitled to have the\ncourt entertain the three attacks on his convictions and sentences\nthat he now advances and readvances.  See United States v.\nTicchiarelli, 171 F.3d 24, 30-33 (1st Cir. 1999) (when resentencing\nafter a remand, district court should consider only new arguments\nor new facts made newly-relevant by the intervening decision of the\ncourt of appeals).  In so ruling, we reject as insufficiently\nelaborated   in light of defendant's failure to meet head-on the\ngovernment's assertion that defendant knew at his original\nsentencing that his co-defendant had not received \"serious\" bodily\ninjury or \"reckless endangerment for flight\" enhancements   \ndefendant's suggestion that he previously was prevented from\nraising his \"inconsistent factual positions argument\" because his\nco-defendant's sentencing was conducted under seal.  Finally,\nbecause there is absolutely no doubt that the district court\nintends to sentence defendant at the statutory maximum on Count Two\n(with the sentence on Count Two to run concurrent to the lawful\n300-month sentence on Count One), and because we already have\nconfirmed that such sentences are lawful, we exercise our statutory\ndiscretion to \"modify . . . any judgment, decree, or order of a\ncourt lawfully brought before [us] for review,\" 28 U.S.C.  2106,\nand order that the district court's sentencing judgment be modified\nso as to commit defendant \"to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons\nto be imprisoned for a term of three-hundred (300) months as to\nCount One, one-hundred and eighty (180) months as to Count Two, to\nbe served concurrently with each other, and sixty (60) months on\nCount Three, to be served consecutively to Count One.\"\nAffirmed as modified.\n",
