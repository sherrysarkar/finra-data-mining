Zenaida García-Ayala appeals an order\n\ngranting summary judgment for her former employer, Lederle Parenterals,\n\nInc., in a suit that alleges wrongful termination and demands\n\ninjunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages under the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act.       See García-Ayala v. Lederle\n\nParentals, Inc., 20 F. Supp. 2d 312, 313 (D.P.R. 1998). The district\n\ncourt held that García was not a \"qualified individual\" under the Act\n\nbecause the accommodation she requested from her employer was not\n\n\"reasonable.\" See id. at 315. We reverse and direct entry of judgment\n\nfor the plaintiff.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The parties stipulated to the following facts. García worked\n\nfor Lederle Parenterals, Inc. as a secretary from October 1983 to June\n\n13, 1996, when her employment was terminated. Most recently, she was\n\nthe only clerical employee in the company's Validation Department.\n\n          Lederle's disability benefits program provides that an\n\nemployee may receive up to fourteen continuous weeks of salary\n\ncontinuation and then short-term disability benefits (STD) at sixty\n\npercent of full salary. Under the plan, an employee could be absent\n\nfrom work for a twenty-six week period, work another two weeks, and\n\nthen be out for an additional twenty-six weeks for the same disability.\n\nDuring her employment at Lederle, García used the salary continuation\n\nand short-term disability benefits on fourteen separate occasions, in\n\naddition to her sick leave. Lederle had a policy of reserving a job\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffor one year when employees had been out on STD.     It applied that\n\npolicy and terminated García's employment after her one-year\n\nreservation period ended.\n\n          Since 1986, García has been stricken with breast cancer and\n\nhas undergone several rounds of surgery and chemotherapy. From March\n\n15, 1987 to September 16, 1987, she was absent from work for 184 days\n\nas a result of a modified radical mastectomy. During this period, she\n\nreceived salary continuation benefits for fourteen weeks, and then\n\nshort-term disability for the remainder. From September 1987 until\n\n1993 she was back at work. Six years later, in August 1993, a biopsy\n\nrevealed adenocarcinoma of the breast, infiltrating duct type,\n\npersistent, and, as a result, García was absent for 115 days. She then\n\nreturned to work.\n\n          In December 1994, García was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma\n\nof the breast, metastatic. On March 17, 1995, she underwent surgery to\n\nremove a nodule in her neck. Before that surgery, García used up her\n\nsick leave and was absent from work for a total of eighty-eight and a\n\nhalf hours. Following surgery, she received short-term disability\n\nbenefits for thirty-four consecutive days.       In May, she took an\n\nadditional forty-six hours of leave. From June 9 through 25, 1995, she\n\nreceived salary continuation benefits in relation to the medical\n\ncondition.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Sometime after her surgery, García saw a television report\n\non a bone marrow transplant procedure that offered a treatment for her\n\ncancer.   She was interviewed by doctors in June 1995 and García\n\ninformed Lederle in July that she needed to undergo this procedure,\n\nwhich was only available at a Chicago hospital. From August 7 through\n\n20, 1995, she was absent due to chemotherapy (for which she took\n\nnineteen hours sick leave and short-term disability). From September\n\n13 through 27, 1995, she was again absent due to treatment (eight hours\n\nsick leave/fifteen days of short-term disability). In October 1995,\n\nGarcía took eleven and one-half hours of sick leave.\n\n          García was hospitalized for the bone marrow treatment on\n\nNovember 14, 1995. She received STD payments until March 19, 1996. As\n\nof that date, she started receiving long-term disability (LTD).\n\nLederle did not consider her to be an employee once she was on LTD. On\n\nApril 9, 1996, doctors certified to Lederle that García would be able\n\nto return to work on July 30, 1996.\n\n          On June 10, 1996, Lederle's Human Resources Director, Aida\n\nMargarita Rodríguez, called García at home and asked her to come to\n\nwork to meet with her. García complied and Rodríguez notified her that\n\nthe company deemed her disability to have begun in March 1995, that her\n\none-year period for job reservation had elapsed in March 1996, and that\n\nher employment was terminated. García asked that her job be reserved\n\nuntil July 30th, when her doctors expected her to return to work, but\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fto no avail. On June 13th, Lederle sent García a letter confirming her\n\nconversation with Rodríguez and denying her request for additional\n\nleave.\n\n          As it turned out, although García had requested an\n\naccommodation until July 30th, it was on August 22, 1996 that García's\n\ndoctors released her for work, though they did not notify Lederle of\n\nthis and García did not re-apply for employment.\n\n          García's essential job functions did not go unfilled. At\n\nleast three different temporary employees provided by agencies\n\nperformed García's tasks at Lederle during her medical leave and after\n\nher dismissal. Indeed, from June 13, 1996, to January 31, 1997, a\n\nperiod of over seven months from García's dismissal, the company chose\n\nto use temporary employees. The company says her position was never\n\nfilled by a permanent employee.        There was no evidence that the\n\ntemporary employees cost Lederle any more than García would have or\n\nthat their performance was in any way unsatisfactory.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          On May 16, 1997, García brought suit against Lederle, its\n\nparent companies, American Home Products Corp. and American Cynamid\n\nCo., and others for alleged violations of the ADA and Puerto Rico Act\n\nNo. 44 of July 2, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, §§ 501 et seq., as a\n\nresult of the termination of her employment following surgery for\n\nbreast cancer. She seeks back pay, reinstatement (or \"front pay\"),\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\finjunctive relief from future discrimination, compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages, and attorney's fees. On March 30, 1998, the parties submitted\n\na stipulation of material facts together with a Motion Submitting\n\nStipulation of Uncontested Material Facts and Legal Controversies. On\n\nSeptember 28, 1998, the court granted Lederle's cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment, denied García's motion for summary judgment, declined\n\nto exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over García's claim under Act\n\n44, and dismissed the case. See García-Ayala, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 313.1\n\nGarcía appeals.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          There is some disagreement as to what happened at the trial\n\ncourt and, resultantly, as to the standard of review to be applied by\n\nthis court on an appeal from summary judgment entered after cross-\n\nmotions. Citing Reich v. John Alden Life Insurance Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 1997), and United Paperworkers International Union, Local 14\n\nv. International Paper Co., 64 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1995), both\n\nLederle and García have argued that clear-error review should apply to\n\nthe factual inferences made by the district court since the decision\n\nbelow was based on stipulated facts and made on cross-motions for\n\n\n\n\n     1    The correct name of the lead defendant in this case is\n\"Lederle Parenterals, Inc.\" and not \"Lederle Parentals, Inc.,\" as the\ndistrict court opinion is captioned.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fsummary judgment.2 But see Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 100\n\nF.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"Cross motions for summary judgment\n\nneither alter the basic Rule 56 standard, nor warrant the grant of\n\nsummary judgment per se.\").\n\n           The EEOC, appearing as amicus curiae urges de novo review,\n\nthe customary standard for appellate review of summary judgment. The\n\ndistrict court opinion in this jury-claimed case does not discuss\n\nwhether there was a waiver of jury trial rights or a stipulation under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(a)(1),3 or whether it was resolving\n\nthe matter on a jury-waived and a \"case stated\" basis or on\n\nconventional summary judgment; the order entered was for summary\n\njudgment (although the opinion once used the phrase \"The Court finds\").\n\nOut of the confusion, we think it wise to reiterate a few basics.\n\n           For the purposes of standard of appellate review in these\n\ncircumstances, there is usually a distinction between non-jury and jury\n\ncases. This circuit, in United Paperworkers, held that:\n\n\n\n     2     The parties made a joint \"Motion Submitting Stipulation of\nUncontested Material Facts and Legal Controversies,\" and claimed\n\"[t]here being no genuine controversy as to the material facts in this\nmatter, the parties stipulate the same, and submit the material facts\nto the Court for adjudication on the merits of the legal controversies\nin this matter.\"\n     3     At oral argument on appeal, counsel for García disavowed any\nintent not to have a jury trial. But that may have been a statement as\nto trial on damages, once the district court ruled on liability, and\nthus consistent with the position in counsel's brief on the standard of\nreview.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f          [i]n a nonjury case, when the basic dispute between the\n          parties concerns only the factual inferences that one might\n          draw from the more basic facts to which the parties have\n          agreed, and where neither party has sought to introduce\n          additional factual evidence or asked to present witnesses,\n          the parties are, in effect, submitting their dispute to the\n          court as a case stated.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). We have\n\nreached the same result in other non-jury cases. See Reich, 126 F.3d\n\nat 6; EEOC v. Steamship Clerks Union 1066, 48 F.3d 594, 603 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); Continental Grain Co. v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth.,\n\n972 F.2d 426, 429-30 & n.7 (1st Cir. 1992); Boston Five Cents Savings\n\nBank v. Secretary of the Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev., 768 F.2d 5, 11-\n\n12 (1st Cir. 1985); Federación de Empleados del Tribunal Gen. de\n\nJusticia v. Torres, 747 F.2d 35, 36 (1st Cir. 1984); cf. Posadas de\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc. v. Radin, 856 F.2d 399, 400-01 (1st Cir. 1988) (same\n\nwhere only one side moved for summary judgment). In such cases, \"[t]he\n\nstandard for appellate review . . . shifts from de novo review to\n\nclear-error review; that is, the district court's factual inferences\n\nshould be set aside only if they are clearly erroneous.\"        United\n\nPaperworkers, 64 F.3d at 31.\n\n          This rule evolved from -- and makes sense in -- bench trial\n\ncases. See 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 2720, at 338-39 (1998) (referring to\n\nthis practice in non-jury cases). Instead of expending time and money\n\non a trial, the parties may decide that the pre-trial record\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\festablishes all the necessary grounds upon which a judge may enter a\n\nfinal ruling on one or all of the issues in dispute. See, e.g., Allen\n\nv. United Mine Workers 1979 Benefit Plan & Trust, 726 F.2d 352, 353\n\n(7th Cir. 1984). They are, in essence, skipping trial and proceeding\n\ndirectly to judgment, submitting the case to the judge as stated.4\n\n          When determining whether this was the path taken by the\n\nparties in non-jury cases, this circuit and others inquire into the\n\nintentions of the parties and the district court judge, as evidenced by\n\nthe record on appeal.5 See United Paperworkers, 64 F.3d at 31-32 & n.2;\n\nsee also, e.g., Sherwood v. Washington Post, 871 F.2d 1144, 1147 n.4\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1989); Wolfe v. United States, 798 F.2d 1241, 1243 n.2 (9th\n\nCir.), amended on other grounds, 806 F.2d 1410, 1411 (9th Cir. 1986);\n\nDonovan v. Dialamerica Marketing, Inc., 757 F.2d 1376, 1381-82 (3d Cir.\n\n1985); EEOC v. Maricopa County Community College Dist., 736 F.2d 510,\n\n512-13 (9th Cir. 1984); Satellite Television & Associated Resources,\n\n\n\n     4     In these non-jury cases, problems arise for appellate courts\nwhen the record is unclear that this is what the parties and the trial\njudge meant to do. Consequently, when a claim is made on appeal that\nthe case below was decided as a \"case stated,\" appellate courts\ninvariably look quite carefully at the proceedings in the trial court\nto make sure that the parties had \"willingly foregone their right to a\nfull trial.\" Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. v. Jostens, Inc., 155 F.3d 140,\n143 (2d Cir. 1998).\n     5     Some circuits require \"explicit waiver\" of trial. Acuff-Rose\nMusic, Inc. v. Jostens, Inc., 155 F.3d 140, 142-43 (2d Cir. 1998); see\nalso Miller v. LeSea Broad., Inc., 87 F.3d 224, 230 (7th Cir. 1996);\nMay v. Evansville-Vanderburgh Sch. Corp., 787 F.2d 1105, 1115-16 (7th\nCir. 1986).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fInc. v. Continental Cablevision of Va., Inc., 714 F.2d 351, 354 (4th\n\nCir. 1983); Wilson v.

Reiter, Summary Judgment: Federal Law\n\nand Practice § 8.01, at 232-34 (1994); William W. Schwarzer, Alan\n\nHirsch, & David J. Barrans, The Analysis and Decision of Summary\n\nJudgment Motions 40-41 (1991).\n\n          Jury trial cases are treated differently. This court, like\n\nnearly all other courts, has refused to make the \"case stated\" inquiry\n\nwhen one of the parties has requested trial by jury. See        United\n\nPaperworkers, 64 F.3d at 31 (specifying that the case stated inquiry is\n\nlimited to non-jury cases); see also Winter v. Minnesota Mutual Life\n\nIns. Co., 199 F.3d 399, 405-08 (7th Cir. 1999) (same); Colan v. Mesa\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fPetroleum Co., 951 F.2d 1512, 1517-18 (9th Cir. 1991) (same); Satellite\n\nTelevision, 714 F.2d at 354 (same); Tripp, 189 F.2d at 200 (same); cf.\n\nTransworld Airlines, Inc. v. American Coupon Exch., Inc., 913 F.2d 676,\n\n684-85 (9th Cir. 1990) (similar where only one side moved for summary\n\njudgment); Nunez v. Superior Oil Co., 572 F.2d 1119, 1124 (5th Cir.\n\n1978) (same).6 Thus, unsurprisingly, we have reviewed judgments based\n\non cross-motions for summary judgment in jury trial cases de novo.\n\nSee, e.g., Den norske Bank AS v. First Nat'l Bank, 75 F.3d 49, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n          The distinction between bench and jury trials is appropriate\n\nsince the right to a jury trial is constitutionally protected and\n\ncasual waivers are not to be presumed. See U.S. Const. amend. VII;\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 38(d); Winter, 199 F.3d at 407 n.11; Indiana Lumbermens\n\nMutual Ins. Co. v. Timberland Pallet & Lumber Co., 195 F.3d 368, 374\n\n(8th Cir. 1999); Jennings v. McCormick, 154 F.3d 542, 545 (5th Cir.\n\n1998); LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1526, 1544 (11th Cir. 1993); Tray-\n\n     6    We note that cross-motions for summary judgment, in and of\nthemselves, do not constitute waiver of jury trial. See Winter, 199\nF.3d at 407-08; Miller, 87 F.3d at 230; Market St. Assocs. Ltd.\nPartnership v. Frey, 941 F.2d 588, 590 (7th Cir. 1991); John v.\nLouisiana, 757 F.2d 698, 705 (5th Cir. 1985).\n     We have found only two cases that have applied the clearly\nerroneous standard of review to jury trial cases decided on cross-\nmotions for summary judgment. See Southwest Forest Indus., Inc. v.\nWestinghouse Elec. Corp., 422 F.2d 1013, 1017-18 (9th Cir. 1970);\nGillespie v. Norris, 231 F.2d 881, 883-84 (9th Cir. 1956). But cf.\nPage v. Work, 290 F.2d 323, 334 (9th Cir. 1961) (per curiam) (upon\nrehearing, reversing, in a jury trial case, earlier finding that the\ncase had been submitted on the record).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fWrap, Inc. v. Six L's Packing Co., 984 F.2d 65, 67-68 (2d Cir. 1993);\n\nMondor v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the Cent. Dist. of Cal., 910 F.2d 585, 587\n\n(9th Cir. 1990).\n\n          But application of these principles to this case is not\n\nstraightforward, and we decide the issue of standard of review here\n\nunder two different doctrines: Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(a)(1)\n\nand waiver.   We determine that García agreed, pursuant to Rule\n\n39(a)(1), that the issues of liability presented for the purposes of\n\nthe summary judgment cross-motions could be determined by the court, in\n\nlight of the stipulation filed that \"the parties . . . submit the\n\nmaterial facts in this matter to the Court for adjudication on the\n\nmerits on the legal controversies in this matter.\" Further, plaintiff\n\nhas urged upon us a clear error standard of review. Although at oral\n\nargument plaintiff's counsel said she did not intend to waive her jury\n\ntrial right, she did not brief this issue on appeal and so she is\n\nbound. See Piazza v. Aponte Roque, 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1990);\n\nFed. R. App. P. 28(a). In light of the wording of the stipulation,\n\ntogether with the fact that García, on appeal, has said that review is\n\nfor clear error (and not de novo), we treat this, for present purposes,\n\nas an appeal from a determination after a Rule 39(a)(1) consent.\n\nConsequently, we proceed as if the parties submitted the case to the\n\ndistrict court judge as stated, and review of the determination of the\n\ndistrict court is for clear error.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f                                 IV.\n\n           García claims that Lederle violated the ADA when the company\n\nfired her after she requested additional leave supplemental to her sick\n\nand disability leave. Section 102(a) of the ADA states: \"No covered\n\nentity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a\n\ndisability because of the disability of such individual in regard to .\n\n. . discharge of employees . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Lederle's\n\nprimary defense at summary judgment was that García was not a qualified\n\nindividual because the accommodation she sought was not reasonable.7\n\nLederle offered no evidence or argument that the requested\n\naccommodation was an undue hardship. In fact, Lederle's appellate\n\nargument is inconsistent with its factual stipulation that García's\n\nposition was terminated because her one-year period of leave had\n\nexpired.   That was the reason the company gave in its letter of\n\ntermination to García.8 The company's apparent position that the ADA\n\ncan never impose an obligation on a company to grant an accommodation\n\nbeyond the leave allowed under the company's own leave policy is flatly\n\n\n\n     7     Lederle's argument ignores our case law that \"[a]lthough the\nqualification analysis could be understood to subsume the concept of\nreasonable accommodation, we think it analytically sounder to treat the\ntwo topics separately.\" EEOC v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 141 (1st\nCir. 1997).\n     8    Citing Duckworth v. Pratt & Whitney, Inc., 152 F.3d 1 (1st\nCir. 1998), Lederle claims that no relief may be granted to García\nbecause she did not seek reinstatement. As is evident from a reading\nof that opinion, Duckworth does not stand for that proposition.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fwrong under our precedent. See, e.g., Ralph v. Lucent Techs., Inc.,\n\n135 F.3d 166, 171-72 (1st Cir. 1998). The district court order ignored\n\nthe position stated in the record by the company and went instead to\n\nthe issue of the reasonableness of the accommodation.\n\n          To establish an ADA claim, a plaintiff must prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence: first, \"that she was disabled within the\n\nmeaning of the Act; second, . . . that with or without reasonable\n\naccommodation she was a qualified individual able to perform the\n\nessential functions of the job; and third, . . . that the employer\n\ndischarged her because of her disability.\" Criado v. IBM Corp., 145\n\nF.3d 437, 441 (1st Cir. 1998); accord Feliciano v. Rhode Island, 160\n\nF.3d 780, 784 (1st Cir. 1998); Soto-Ocasio v. Federal Express Corp.,\n\n150 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1998).9 The parties focus on the second of\n\nthese three elements. Both the EEOC and García argue that the district\n\ncourt erroneously shifted the burden as to this factor.\n\n          In order to be a \"qualified individual\" under the Act, the\n\nburden is on the employee10 to show: first, that she \"possess[es] 'the\n\n\n     9     Lederle's argument that there was no intent to discriminate\nbased on disability misses the important point that the ADA does more\nthan prohibit disparate treatment. It also imposes an affirmative\nobligation to provide reasonable accommodation to disabled employees.\nSee Soileau v. Guilford of Me., Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 14-15 (1st Cir.\n1997).\n     10   In Feliciano, we said that \"[t]he plaintiff, as the party who\nmust prove that he or she can perform the essential functions of the\nposition with or without reasonable accommodation, bears the burden of\nshowing the existence of a reasonable accommodation.\" Feliciano, 160\n\n                                 -15-\n\frequisite skill, experience, education and other job-related\n\nrequirements' for the position, and second, [that she is] able to\n\nperform the essential functions of the position with or without\n\nreasonable accommodation.\" Criado, 145 F.3d at 443 (quoting 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1630.2(m)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt.\n\nSys. Corp., 119 S. Ct. 1597, 1603 (1999). There is no question here as\n\nto the first of these two prerequisites. The court correctly stated\n\nthat \"it is [the] plaintiff's burden to prove that, at the time she\n\nsought to resume her job, she had the ability to perform the essential\n\nfunctions of secretary to the Validation Department.\" García-Ayala, 20\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 314. But the statute also places the burden on the\n\ndefendant to show that an accommodation would be an undue hardship.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (stating that the term \"discriminate\"\n\nincludes \"not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or\n\nmental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a\n\ndisability who is an . . . employee, unless such covered entity can\n\ndemonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on\n\nthe operation of the business of such covered identity\").\n\n          The court also went on to say, \"[o]f course, an essential\n\nfunction of any job is the ability to appear for work.\" Id. (citations\n\nomitted). The court then held that García's request for additional\n\n\n\nF.3d at 786 (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 157 F.3d 744, 748-49\n(9th Cir. 1998)).\n\n                                 -16-\n\fleave   (until   July   30,   1996)   \"was   not   reasonable   under   the\n\ncircumstances\" because \"defendants had no guarantee that the additional\n\nleave requested was for a definite period of time and '[n]othing in the\n\ntext of the reasonable accommodation provision requires an employer to\n\nwait an indefinite period for an accommodation to achieve its intended\n\neffect.'\" Id. at 315 (quoting Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 283 (4th\n\nCir. 1995)). The court also found that, although \"some situations\n\nmight mandate unpaid leave of absence as an appropriate accommodation,\"\n\na five-month job reservation, \"in excess of established policy[,]\n\nplace[s] the employer in an untenable business position.\" García-\n\nAyala, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 315.         The district court, in our view,\n\ncommitted two types of errors.\n\nA. Individualized Assessment\n\n           It appears from the court's statements that it was applying\n\nper se rules, and not giving the type of individual assessment of the\n\nfacts that the Act and the case law requires. The Supreme Court has\n\ndeemed \"essential\" individualized attention to disability claims. See\n\nSchool Bd. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 (1987). As we said in Criado,\n\n\"[w]hether [a] leave request is reasonable turns on the facts of the\n\ncase.\" Criado, 145 F.3d at 443; see also Kennedy v. Dresser Rand Co.,\n\n193 F.3d 120, 122 (2d Cir. 1999). It is simply not the case, under\n\nour precedent that an employee's request for an extended medical leave\n\nwill necessarily mean, as the district court suggested, that the\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\femployee is unable to perform the essential functions of her job.\n\n          First, the court did not focus on the employer's statement\n\nthat the reason that it terminated García was because her medical leave\n\nperiod, under company policy, had expired. The court essentially found\n\nthat a requested accommodation of an extension of a leave on top of a\n\nmedical leave of fifteen months was per se unreasonable.           But\n\nreasonable accommodations may include \"job restructuring, part-time or\n\nmodified work schedules, . . . and other similar accommodations for\n\nindividuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). This court\n\nand others have held that a medical leave of absence -- García's\n\nproposed accommodation -- is a reasonable accommodation under the Act\n\nin some circumstances. See Criado, 145 F.3d at 443-44; Nunes v. Wal-\n\nMart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 1999); Cehrs, 155 F.3d\n\nat 782 (citing Criado); Haschmann v. Time Warner Entertainment Co., 151\n\nF.3d 591, 601 (7th Cir. 1998); Rascon v. U S West Communications, Inc.,\n\n143 F.3d 1324, 1333-34 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n          Our concern that the court applied per se rules -- rather\n\nthan an individualized assessment of the facts -- is heightened by\n\nother statements. Here, the leave that García requested on June 10 was\n\nfor less than two months. The district court viewed the request as\n\nbeing for five months, since Rodriguez had advised García, albeit in\n\nJune, that a one-year period for job reservation had lapsed in March.\n\nEven if the request were for an additional five months of unpaid leave,\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fwe see no reason to adopt a rule on these facts that the additional\n\nmedical leave sought would be per se an unreasonable accommodation.\n\nWell after her termination, as well as during her medical leave,\n\nLederle filled García's secretarial position with individuals hired\n\nfrom temporary agencies. Lederle had no business need apparent from\n\nthis record to replace García with an in-house hire, and hence would\n\nnot have suffered had it waited for several more months until García's\n\nreturn. In Ralph v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 135 F.3d 166, 171-72\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), the court held that a four-week additional\n\naccommodation, beyond a fifty-two week leave period for mental\n\nbreakdown, was reasonable for purpose of a preliminary injunction. The\n\ndistrict court's statement that the employer was left in an \"untenable\n\nbusiness position\" also reinforces the sense of the use of per se rules\n\nand the lack of focus on the facts of this case, given that the\n\nemployer put on no evidence of undue hardship.11\n\n          Similarly, the court viewed García's requested accommodation\n\n-- additional leave time with a specific date for return -- as a\n\nrequest that her job be held open indefinitely. Lederle had argued\n\nthat since García's doctor could not give absolute assurances that she\n\nwould be fit to return to work on July 30th, the request was per se for\n\nan indefinite leave and so was unreasonable.       García specified,\n\nhowever, when she would return, and her doctor released her for return\n\n     11   Perhaps, alternatively, the statement was only hyperbole.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fseveral weeks thereafter. There is no evidence that either July 30th or\n\nthe August 22nd date of medical release, would have imposed any\n\nspecific hardship on Lederle. Some employees, by the nature of their\n\ndisability, are unable to provide an absolutely assured time for their\n\nreturn to employment, but that does not necessarily make a request for\n\nleave to a particular date indefinite. Each case must be scrutinized\n\non its own facts. An unvarying requirement for definiteness again\n\ndeparts from the need for individual factual evaluation.12         See\n\nHaschmann, 151 F.3d at 599-600; Criado, 145 F.3d at 443-44; Rascon, 143\n\nF.3d at 1333-34; Kimbro v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 889 F.2d 869, 878-79\n\n(9th Cir. 1989) (interpreting analogous state statute). Of course,\n\nthat a leave is not indefinite does not make it reasonable. Even short\n\nleaves may inflict undue hardship in a given employment situation, and\n\nthere may be requested leaves so lengthy or open-ended as to be an\n\n\n\n     12    The approach urged by Lederle on the district court also\nignores \"[t]he duty to provide reasonable accommodation is a continuing\none . . . and not exhausted by one effort.\" Ralph v. Lucent\nTechnologies, Inc., 135 F.3d 166, 171-72 (1st Cir. 1998). It is an\ninteractive process that \"requires a great deal of communication\nbetween the employee and employer.\" Criado, 145 F.3d at 444 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also Hendricks-Robinson v.\nExcel Corp., 154 F.3d 685, 693 (7th Cir. 1998) (describing the\ninteractive process); Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 515\n(1st Cir. 1996) (\"There may well be situations in which the employer's\nfailure to engage in an informal interactive process would constitute\na failure to provide reasonable accommodation that amounts to a\nviolation of the ADA.\"). Here, Lederle failed to engage in the\ninformal, interactive process. It simply rejected the request for the\naccommodation without further discussion and it did so without pointing\nto any facts making the accommodation harmful to its business needs.\n\n                                 -20-\n\funreasonable accommodation in any situation.\n\nB. Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship\n\n           The parties requested that the court determine the issue of\n\nliability on the basis of the facts before it. While the burden of\n\nshowing reasonable accommodation is on the plaintiff,13 this is a case\n\nin which the employer did not contest the reasonableness of the\n\naccommodation except to embrace a per se rule that any leave beyond its\n\none-year reservation period was too long. The employer, Lederle, has\n\nthe burden of proof on the issue of undue hardship, and it did not put\n\non any evidence of undue hardship from García's proposed accommodation.\n\nSee Ward v. Massachusetts Health Research Institute, Inc., No. 99-1651,\n\n2000 WL 361660 (1st Cir. Apr. 12, 2000) (reversing summary judgment in\n\nan ADA case where the employer had produced no evidence of undue\n\nhardship).\n\n\n\n     13    We are aware of, but see no reason to join, the debate in the\ncircuits on the relationship between the two concepts of undue hardship\nand reasonable accommodation. Compare Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch.\nDist., 63 F.3d 131, 138-39 (2d Cir. 1995); Walton v. Mental Health\nAssoc., 168 F.3d 661, 670 (3d Cir. 1999); and Stone v. City of Mount\nVernon, 118 F.3d 92, 98-99 (2d Cir. 1997); with Benson v. Northwest\nAirlines, Inc., 62 F.3d 1108, 1112 (8th Cir. 1995); and White v. York\nInt'l Corp., 45 F.3d 357, 361 (10th Cir. 1995); and with Barth v. Gelb,\n2 F.3d 1180, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d\n282, 285-86 (11th Cir. 1997); Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 157 F.3d 744,\n748-49 (9th Cir. 1998), amended by 196 F.3d 979, 989 (9th Cir. 1999),\nand withdrawn pending en banc review, 201 F.3d 1256 (9th Cir. 2000);\nRiel v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp., 99 F.3d 678, 682-83 (5th Cir.\n1996); Monette v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1183, 1186\nn.12 (6th Cir. 1996); and Vande Zande v. Wisconsin Dept. of Admin., 44\nF.3d 538, 542-43 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                 -21-\n\f          While on different facts, a request for an extended leave\n\ncould indeed be too long to be a reasonable accommodation and no\n\nreasonable factfinder could conclude otherwise, that is not this case\n\nfor a number of reasons. It does not appear that García expected to be\n\npaid for the additional weeks away from work beyond those allowed under\n\nthe employer's disability benefits program and while her job functions\n\nwere being performed by temporary help. There is no evidence that the\n\ntemporary employees were paid more than García or were less effective\n\nat her job than she. Indeed, Lederle's continued use of temporary\n\nemployees and Lederle's failure to replace García indicates the\n\ncontrary. There was, therefore, no financial burden on the employer\n\nfrom paying an employee who was not performing. It is true that an\n\nemployer usually needs to have the functions of a job filled, and the\n\nfact that essential functions have gone unfilled for a lengthy period\n\ncould well warrant judgment for an employer. But here, the essential\n\nfunctions of the job were filled, to all indications satisfactorily, by\n\ntemporary employees. The use of temporary employees is not, of course,\n\nalways a satisfactory or even a possible solution. But here, there is\n\nno evidence that Lederle was under business pressure to fill the slot\n\nwith another permanent employee (indeed, it never did). In other\n\nsituations, temporary replacements may be unavailable or unsuited to\n\nthe position; here, the available evidence is all to the contrary. In\n\naddition, as said, there is no evidence that the cost of the temporary\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fhelp was greater than the cost of a permanent employee; one might\n\nsuppose it was less.    Thus, the requested accommodation of a few\n\nadditional months of unsalaried leave, with the job functions being\n\nsatisfactorily performed in the meantime, is reasonable.\n\n          The employer presented the court with no evidence of any\n\nhardship, much less undue hardship. On this record, we see no basis\n\nfor the court to do other than enter judgment for García. Under the\n\nEEOC guidelines, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(p), factors to be considered as to\n\nundue hardship include the cost of the accommodation, the effect on\n\nexpenses and resources, the impact of the accommodation on the\n\noperation of the facility (including on other employees' ability to do\n\ntheir jobs) and the impact on the facility's ability to conduct\n\nbusiness. On this record there is no discernible negative impact on\n\nany of these factors; indeed, the record shows hardly any discernable\n\nimpact at all on the employer from the requested accommodation. As it\n\nwas the employer's burden to produce evidence of hardship, we hold that\n\nit must bear the responsibility for the absence of such evidence here.\n\n          We stress that the Act does not require employers to retain\n\ndisabled employees who cannot perform the essential functions of their\n\njobs without reasonable accommodation. Applying this rule to the\n\nprolonged disability leave situation is tricky, however. An absent\n\nemployee obviously cannot himself or herself perform; still, the\n\nemployer may in some instances, such as here, be able to get temporary\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fhelp or find some other alternative that will enable it to proceed\n\nsatisfactorily with its business uninterrupted while a disabled\n\nemployee is recovering. In situations like that, retaining the ailing\n\nemployee's slot while granting unsalaried leave may be a reasonable\n\naccommodation required by the ADA. If, however, allowing the sick\n\nemployee to retain his or her job places the employer in a hardship\n\nsituation where it cannot secure in some reasonable alternative way the\n\nservices for which it hired the ailing employee, and yet is blocked\n\nfrom effecting a rehire, the ADA does not require the retention of the\n\ndisabled person. Hence, where it is unrealistic to expect to obtain\n\nsomeone to perform those essential functions temporarily until the sick\n\nemployee returns, the employer may be entitled to discharge the ill\n\nemployee and hire someone else. An exception to this might be if the\n\nrequested disability leave was so brief that no undue business harm\n\ncould reasonably be expected to occur from not filling the vacancy. We\n\nadd that our analysis, while applicable to these facts, may not be\n\napplicable in other cases. Undue hardships are not limited to financial\n\nimpacts; the term includes accommodations that are unduly extensive,\n\nsubstantially disruptive, or that would fundamentally alter the nature\n\nor operation of the business.      See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App.\n\n          Other factors to be considered as to whether requests for\n\nleaves of absence unreasonable include, for example: where the employee\n\ngave no indication as to when she might be able to return to work, and,\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\finstead, she simply demanded that her job be held open indefinitely,\n\nsee, e.g., Taylor v. Pepsi-Cola Co., 196 F.3d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.\n\n1999); Watkins v. J & S Oil Co., 164 F.3d 55, 62 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(citing Myers); Corder v. Lucent Techs. Inc., 162 F.3d 924, 928 (7th\n\nCir. 1998); Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th\n\nCir. 1997) (per curiam); Rogers v. International Marine Terminals,\n\nInc., 87 F.3d 755, 759-60 (5th Cir. 1996); where the employee's\n\nabsences from work were \"erratic\" and \"unexplained,\" see, e.g.,\n\nWaggoner v. Olin Corp., 169 F.3d 481, 484-85 (7th Cir. 1999); where,\n\nupon the employee's return to work, she would be unqualified, see,\n\ne.g., Tyndall v. National Educ. Ctrs., Inc., 31 F.3d 209, 213-14 (4th\n\nCir. 1994); and where the employee was hired to complete a specific\n\ntask, see, e.g., Stubbs v. Marc Ctr., 950 F. Supp. 889, 893-95 (C.D.\n\nIll. 1997). Cf. generally Micari v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 43 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 275, 281-82 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (collecting cases); Powers v.\n\nPolygram Holding, Inc., 40 F. Supp. 2d 195, 199-201 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)\n\n(same). In addition, this court has inquired into whether the company\n\nhad made earlier policy decisions that it was more profitable to permit\n\nan employee additional leave than to hire and train a new employee.\n\nSee Criado, 145 F.3d at 444.\n\n          These are difficult, fact intensive, case-by-case analyses,\n\nill-served by per se rules or stereotypes. We emphasize that the\n\nstipulated record here contains no evidence whatever of any form of\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fhardship to Lederle as a result of the requested accommodation. Were\n\nthis not so, we would feel obligated to return the case to a factfinder\n\nfor further evaluation. But given the employer's failure to meet, even\n\nminimally, its burden of proof on the issue of hardship, we award\n\njudgment to García as a matter of law.\n\n                                  V.\n\n          We reverse the entry of judgment in favor of Lederle, direct\n\nentry of judgment on liability under the ADA for García, and remand the\n\ncase for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n          So ordered.    Costs to appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\f- Dissent Follows -\n\n\n\n\n       -27-\n\f           O'TOOLE, District Judge, dissenting. After criticizing the\n\ndistrict court for deciding this case as a matter of law, the majority\n\nthen does exactly the same thing. Holding that, on the facts presented\n\nto the district court, the plaintiff's request for leave from her job1\n\nwas a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., the court directs the entry of\n\na judgment as to liability in favor of the party with the burden of\n\nproof. Besides invading the province of fact-finding without warrant,\n\nthe court's ruling expands the reach of the ADA beyond what its\n\nlanguage should properly be understood to authorize. I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           The plaintiff's illness caused her to have several\n\nsubstantial periods of absence from work over the course of her\n\nemployment with the defendant.     She was able to be absent and yet\n\nremain employed by taking advantage of a combination of employee\n\nbenefits, including sick leave and short-term disability leave.\n\n           It appears from the record that the last time she actually\n\nworked was in November, 1995. Beginning in late November, in order to\n\nundergo a bone marrow transplant, she began a period of short-term\n\ndisability leave which apparently expired in March, 1996.        Still\n\n\n     1     The court describes the plaintiff's request as one for a\nperiod of leave. I have some doubt as to whether that is the best way\nto describe her request that her job reservation rights be extended\nlonger than the normal period. I am content, however, to accept the\ncourt's characterization for the purposes of this discussion.\n\n                                 -28-\n\frecuperating, she then began to receive long-term disability benefits\n\nunder her employer's plan. In June, the employer notified her that the\n\none-year period for reservation of her job -- that is, her right to\n\nreturn to her job from disability status -- had also expired in March.2\n\nShe asked for a further extension of the reservation of her right to\n\nreturn to work for a few weeks, but her request was denied and her\n\nemployment was formally terminated.\n\n          The court now holds that her request for an extension must\n\nbe considered a \"reasonable accommodation\" of her disability which the\n\nemployer was bound to afford her under the ADA unless the employer\n\ncould demonstrate that doing so would cause it undue hardship. Since\n\nthe employer proffered no evidence of undue hardship, the court\n\nconcludes that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in her favor as to\n\nliability.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          The plaintiff may be entitled to a remedy under the ADA if\n\nshe is a \"qualified individual with a disability.\" She is a \"qualified\n\nindividual with a disability\" if she has the requisite skill and\n\nexperience for the position, which is undisputed here, and if she is\n\nable to \"perform the essential functions of the employment position\"\n\n\n\n     2    It does not appear that the plaintiff challenged that\ncalculation either at the time or in her suit. The employer asserts\nwithout contradiction that its one-year job reservation period was\nequal to the period guaranteed under Puerto Rican law.\n\n                                 -29-\n\f\"with or without reasonable accommodation.\" See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8);\n\nsee also Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 443 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          There is no dispute that when García's employment was\n\nterminated, she was not able to perform her job without an\n\naccommodation. She was not then performing it, and had not performed\n\nit for some months.    Nonetheless, the court concludes that the\n\nplaintiff would have been \"qualified\" to perform her job with the\n\naccommodation she requested: that she be excused from performing the\n\njob until she had recovered sufficiently to be able to return to work\n\nonce again.\n\n          When a period of leave from a job may appropriately be\n\nconsidered an accommodation that enables an employee to perform that\n\njob presents a troublesome problem, partly because of the oxymoronic\n\nanomaly it harbors, but also because of the daunting challenge of line-\n\ndrawing it presents. The prevailing view among the Courts of Appeals,\n\nand the law of this Circuit, is that a period of leave can in some\n\ncircumstances be a reasonable accommodation required of an employer\n\nunder the ADA. See Criado, 145 F.3d at 443. Put another way, it is\n\nwrong to say categorically that leave can never be a reasonable\n\naccommodation.\n\n          The term \"leave\" is a capacious one, however, and the cases\n\ndo not hold that any leave will qualify as a reasonable accommodation.\n\nSee Walsh v. United Parcel Serv., 201 F.3d 718, 726-27 (6th Cir. 2000)\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f(finding leave requested by plaintiff \"objectively unreasonable\").\n\n\"Reasonable accommodation\" is also a capacious term, purposefully broad\n\nso as to permit appropriate case-by-case flexibility.       Whether a\n\nparticular proposed leave is a reasonable accommodation must be\n\nanswered in the factual context of the case at hand.       See, e.g.,\n\nCriado, 145 F.3d at 443 (\"Whether the leave request is reasonable turns\n\non the facts of the case.\"). Where many interrelated considerations\n\nbear on an assessment of what is \"reasonable,\" prudence cautions\n\nagainst too ready a resort to summary dispositions as a matter of law.\n\nSee Ward v. Massachusetts Health Research Inst., No. 99-1651, 2000 WL\n\n361660, at *6 (1st Cir. Apr. 12, 2000) (reversing summary judgment;\n\ndeclining to hold accommodation unreasonable per se); Nunes v. Wal-Mart\n\nStores, 164 F.3d 1243, 1248 (9th Cir. 1999) (reversing summary judgment\n\nbecause reasonableness of leave was jury question); Cehrs v. Northeast\n\nOhio Alzheimer's Research Ctr., 155 F.3d 775, 782-85 (6th Cir. 1998)\n\n(following Criado and reversing summary judgment for employer); Criado,\n\n145 F.3d at 444 (affirming denial of employer's motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law).    In any context, however, to be a \"reasonable\n\naccommodation\" a measure must be both an \"accommodation\" and\n\n\"reasonable.\"\n\n          In the first place, an \"accommodation\" must serve a\n\nfunctional purpose; it is a means to a desired end. An accommodation\n\nas contemplated by the ADA is a measure that enables the performance of\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fa job by a person who, without the measure, is disabled from performing\n\nthe job.   See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9).    It effectively transforms a\n\ndisabled person into an enabled person for the purposes of the job.\n\n           The converse follows. If the measure does not enable the\n\notherwise disabled person to perform the essential functions of the\n\njob, it loses its functional quality and consequently fails to operate\n\nas an accommodation.\n\n           An accommodation must not only be functionally effective; it\n\nmust also be reasonable.3 Again, whether a proposed accommodation is\n\nreasonable or not will ordinarily be judged on the peculiar facts of a\n\ngiven case.    In most cases, it will be a matter to be left to\n\nassessment and evaluation by the trier of fact.\n\n           Nonetheless, judges may sometimes be called upon to decide\n\nwhat circumstances might make a proposed measure a reasonable\n\naccommodation, or not, as a matter of law. See Walsh, 201 F.3d at 726-\n\n27 (affirming grant of summary judgment in favor of employer because\n\nplaintiff's requested accommodation was \"objectively unreasonable\");\n\nsee also Evans v. Federal Express Corp., 133 F.3d 137, 139-40 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (affirming summary judgment, and holding that, under state law,\n\n\n     3     The EEOC as amicus argues that a reasonable accommodation is\none that is \"feasible\" and \"effective.\" EEOC Br. at 14, 16. It seems\nto me that view gives short shrift to the modifier. \"Feasible and\neffective\" could be a shorthand way of expressing the functionality\nnecessary to make the measure an accommodation. The inclusion of the\nmodifier indicates that the measure must not only be \"feasible and\neffective,\" i.e. functional, but \"reasonable\" to boot.\n\n                                 -32-\n\faccommodation not shown likely to be successful was not reasonable).\n\nThere is hazard in trying to speak too broadly or too categorically,\n\nespecially   in   this   area   where    the   varieties   of   potential\n\naccommodations, and the reasons why any given accommodation might or\n\nmight not be reasonable, are myriad. Still, there will be cases in\n\nwhich a court may appropriately take the question away from the trier\n\nof fact and decide it as a matter of law.\n\n                                  III.\n\n          As the court's opinion points out, there is some ambiguity\n\nin this record as to whether the parties presented the case to the\n\ndistrict court for judgment as a matter of law or for decision on the\n\ncourt's fact-finding. They presented a stipulation of undisputed facts\n\nand cross-moved for summary judgment. If nothing else appeared, one\n\nwould conclude that they were seeking only a ruling of law.\n\n          But the parties' stipulation indicated that they were\n\nsubmitting the liability portion of the case \"to the Court for\n\nadjudication on the merits of the legal controversies in this matter.\"\n\n\"Adjudication on the merits\" ordinarily suggests more than summary\n\njudgment. Unlike a full consideration of a case after trial, summary\n\njudgment does not always end in an adjudication, because even on cross-\n\nmotions based on stipulated facts, a court might conclude that neither\n\nside is entitled to win as a matter of law and that the dispute must be\n\nsubmitted to the fact-finder. The full job of the fact-finder, after\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fall, includes not only settling conflicts in the \"basic\" facts, but\n\nalso drawing appropriate inferences from those facts. By praying for\n\nadjudication on the merits, the parties indicated that they expected\n\nthe district court to resolve the factual, as well as legal, issues\n\npertinent to the issue of liability.\n\n          Any lingering doubt as to what the parties intended is\n\ndispelled by what they have told us. Both sides asserted in their\n\nbriefs to us that the applicable standard of appellate review is \"clear\n\nerror,\" the standard used to review fact-finding by a district court.\n\nThus, both before the district court and before this court, the parties\n\npresented the matter as having been submitted as a \"case stated\" for\n\nfull \"adjudication\" by the district court.\n\n          Moreover,    the   district   court's   opinion   indicates,\n\nconsistently with the parties' characterization, that the judge thought\n\nhe was not merely policing the fact-finding function under Rule 56, but\n\ninstead was performing it. In posing the issue he was presented with,\n\nhe said,\"[T]he Court must therefore determine whether plaintiff's\n\nrequested accommodation was reasonable under the circumstances . . . .\"\n\nGarcía-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 20 F. Supp. 2d 312, 315\n\n(D.P.R. 1998). He then went on, \"The Court finds that plaintiff's\n\nrequest was not reasonable under the circumstances.\" Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n          Accordingly, I am in agreement with the court's conclusion\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fstated in Part III of its opinion that the parties submitted the matter\n\nas a \"case stated\" and that review of the district court's fact-finding\n\nis for clear error.4 Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 1997); EEOC v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, 48 F.3d\n\n594, 603 (1st Cir. 1995). The \"clear error\" standard applies not only\n\nto resolution of factual disputes, but also to the factual inferences\n\ndrawn by the district court on the basis of the stipulated facts. Id.\n\n          On the record presented and under an appropriate application\n\nof the statute's terms, a fact-finder's inference-based conclusion\n\nthat the plaintiff's request for an extension of her right to return to\n\nwork was not a reasonable accommodation cannot be called clearly\n\nerroneous. The clearly erroneous standard does not permit an appellate\n\ncourt to substitute its own evaluative judgment of what was or was not\n\nreasonable, unless the district court's conclusion was unquestionably,\n\nnot just arguably, wrong. If the same facts that were presented to the\n\njudge below had been presented to a jury, and if the jury had returned\n\na verdict that the requested leave was not a reasonable accommodation,\n\nI cannot imagine that this court would disturb that finding.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          Rather than challenging the district court's fact-finding as\n\nclearly erroneous, the majority identifies two legal errors it says the\n\n\n\n     4    Of course, any purely legal rulings are subject to de novo\nreview.\n\n                                 -35-\n\fdistrict court committed. First, the court says the district court\n\nfailed to give individualized consideration to the plaintiff's case,\n\nbut instead decided that the plaintiff's request for additional leave\n\nwas per se unreasonable. Second, the court says that the district\n\ncourt improperly shifted the burden of proof as to \"undue hardship\" by\n\nrequiring the plaintiff to disprove it, rather than requiring the\n\nemployer to establish it.\n\n          The second purported error, I think, stems from an incorrect\n\nreading of the district court opinion.      The issue argued by the\n\nparties, and the issue decided by the district court, was whether the\n\nplaintiff was a qualified person with a disability. In particular,\n\nresolution of that issue depended on whether the plaintiff's request\n\nfor further leave was a reasonable accommodation. The employer did not\n\nargue undue hardship. Though the district court opinion does state\n\nthat granting the accommodation would place the employer \"in an\n\nuntenable business position,\" García-Ayala, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 315, in\n\ncontext that phrase was used not as an elaboration of the \"undue\n\nhardship\" affirmative defense, but as part of the court's explication\n\nof why, in the district court's judgment, the requested accommodation\n\nwas not reasonable. I do not think it is accurate to say that the\n\ndistrict court was giving the employer the benefit of the \"undue\n\nhardship\" affirmative defense, or shifting to the plaintiff the burden\n\nto disprove that affirmative defense.\n\n\n                                -36-\n\f          The other error the majority finds is that the district court\n\napplied a per se rule about the permissible length of a leave and,\n\ntherefore, failed to make an individualized assessment of the case. I\n\nmust say I do not quite understand this criticism. I do not find any\n\nindication in the district court's opinion that it failed to give\n\nattention to the particulars of the case.       To the contrary, the\n\ndistrict court discussed in detail the facts of the case as presented\n\nby the parties; it gave no less attention to the \"individualized\" facts\n\nof the case than the parties did.\n\n          The majority cannot mean that the need for individualized\n\nassessment of an ADA case necessarily precludes a disposition as a\n\nmatter of law, because this court has affirmed dispositions of ADA\n\ncases as a matter of law. See, e.g., Tardie v. Rehabilitation Hosp.,\n\n168 F.3d 538 (1st Cir. 1999); Feliciano v. Rhode Island, 160 F.3d 780\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). And the majority certainly cannot mean that the need\n\nfor individualized assessment always requires submission of the matter\n\nfor decision by the trier of fact, because, after all, the court's\n\ndisposition now orders entry of judgment for the plaintiff as a matter\n\nof law, without submission to the trier of fact.\n\n          The more pertinent question is, if the district court decided\n\nthe case by making a pure ruling of law as the majority apparently\n\nasserts, rather than by applying the law to the facts and the\n\npermissible inferences it drew from them, was its ruling incorrect?\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fSpecifically, did the district court err in holding (if it did) that no\n\nrational fact-finder could conclude that the extension of leave\n\nrequested by García was a reasonable accommodation under the ADA?5 I\n\nwould conclude that on the particular facts of this case, such a ruling\n\nwould not have been an error.\n\n          The leave extension requested by the plaintiff was not a\n\nreasonable accommodation as a matter of law because it was not an\n\naccommodation at all as that term ought to be understood. To be an\n\naccommodation, the requested leave would have to do what an\n\naccommodation under the ADA must do -- enable the employee to perform\n\nthe essential functions of her job. To put it in terms of the EEOC's\n\nproposed definition of \"reasonable accommodation,\" García's requested\n\nleave would not have been \"effective.\"\n\n          It seems to me that the following proposition can be\n\nextrapolated from the cases:     For a proposed period of leave to\n\nconstitute an effective accommodation, it must meet at least two\n\nconditions. First, it must be instrumental to effect or advance a\n\nchange in the employee's disabled status with respect to the job, so\n\nthat the employee is enabled to do it. A period of leave would meet\n\n\n\n     5     The district court expressly recognized that a leave may\nqualify as a reasonable accommodation in some circumstances. García-\nAyala, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 315. It is clear, therefore, that it did not\nrule that a period of leave could never be a reasonable accommodation,\nand thus the ruling is not in direct conflict with any of our\nprecedents.\n\n                                 -38-\n\fthis criterion if it permitted the employee to receive therapy or\n\ntreatment that would succeed in removing the obstacle to employment the\n\nparticular disability posed. In Criado, for example, the court noted\n\nthat the employee's physician believed that \"the leave would ameliorate\n\nher disability.\" 145 F.3d at 444. Similarly, an EEOC interpretive\n\nguideline suggests that leave \"for necessary treatment\" could be a\n\nreasonable accommodation, 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app., and the Department\n\nof Labor advises that leave might be a reasonable accommodation \"when\n\nthe disability is of a nature that it is likely to respond to\n\ntreatment.\" 29 C.F.R. pt. 32, app. A(b). Simply the possibility of\n\nimprovement is not enough, however; the recovery must be reasonably\n\nlikely. See Evans, 133 F.3d at 140 (construing similar state statute).\n\nFurther, the prospect of recovery (or enablement) should be judged not\n\nby hindsight, but by what reasonably appears at the time the leave is\n\nrequested.   Id.\n\n          Second, the employee's return to work must be relatively\n\nproximate in a temporal sense. The cases do not speak with one voice\n\non this subject, and some give little attention to it, except to imply\n\nthat the temporal element will figure in the jury's assessment of\n\nreasonableness. Although there seems to be general agreement that a\n\nleave period cannot be indefinite, the leave periods that have been\n\nexplicitly or implicitly approved vary in length. Some variation is\n\nnot inappropriate; that is consistent with the need to evaluate each\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\fcase on its particular facts.\n\n          In the end, however, the leave must not only be one that\n\nserves a proper medical purpose; it must also be one that serves the\n\nstatutory purpose, which is to enable the employee to perform the\n\nessential functions of her job. Cf. Evans, 133 F.3d at 140 (construing\n\nsimilar state statute). It cannot be overlooked that the statute\n\nspeaks in the present tense, indicative mood. A \"qualified individual\n\nwith a disability\" entitled to the statute's protection is a person who\n\n\"can perform the essential functions of the employment position\" with\n\nreasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) (emphasis added). \" Can\n\nperform,\" as in \" now.\" I would not contend that the statute requires\n\nliterally instantaneous effectiveness of an accommodation.          By\n\napproving the idea that some leaves might qualify as reasonable\n\naccommodations, courts, including this one, have properly rejected such\n\na cramped and unrealistic reading of the statute. However, fidelity to\n\nboth the language and purpose of the statute requires that the time\n\nwithin which the proposed accommodation accomplishes its intended\n\npurpose -- enabling the employee to perform the job -- must be such\n\nthat the accommodation is tolerably consistent with the statutory\n\nwords, \"can perform.\"\n\n          I would conclude that the plaintiff did not carry her burden\n\nof proffering evidence that the leave she requested was \"effective\" in\n\nthese two essential ways.    She asked that the employer abide her\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\fcontinued recuperation for an additional period, but she offered little\n\n-- essentially an unelaborated prognostic estimate -- that would enable\n\nan objective assessment either of the realistic prospect of recovery as\n\nof the time of the request or of the likely duration of her absence.\n\nFurther, I do not think the requested leave could legitimately be said\n\nto be an accommodation enabling her, more or less contemporaneously, to\n\nperform the essential functions of the job. It may have given her an\n\nopportunity to become able again a couple of months down the road, but\n\nthat is something that this statute, properly construed, does not\n\naddress.\n\n           Before she began her most recent disability leave in\n\nNovember, 1995, García was performing her job without accommodation.\n\nAs of late August, 1996, she had apparently recovered and was able\n\nagain to perform her job without accommodation. Between November and\n\nlate August, she was not able to work. The requested leave would not\n\nhave changed that. It would not have made her able to work when she\n\nwas unable, and when she was able again, it was unnecessary. In point\n\nof fact, it would have had no effect on her actual ability to work.\n\nWhat it would have affected was the employer's ability to terminate her\n\nemployment because she could not work. Restricting an employer's\n\nability to terminate an employee who is unable to work can be a\n\n\n\n\n                                 -41-\n\flegitimate object of legislative regulation,6 but that is not the\n\nobjective of the statute we are considering. It does not diminish the\n\nimportance or value of the ADA to conclude that it does not solve all\n\nproblems, and in particular that it does not solve the problem of\n\nprotecting job security for employees who need an extended absence from\n\nthe workplace for medical reasons.\n\n           Our obligation is to construe and apply the statute as it was\n\nwritten, sensibly and consistently, so that, among other things, both\n\nemployers and employees will understand what it requires and what it\n\ndoes not. Discharging that obligation will occasionally call for\n\nrulings that deny relief to plaintiffs such as García who have endured\n\nextraordinary personal hardship. We make such rulings when necessary\n\nin every area of the law, and if called on we should not shy from the\n\nobligation in this area as well, without regard to our views as to\n\nwhether the plaintiff was not treated particularly well by her long-\n\ntime employer or whether the ADA ought to contain a provision it does\n\nnot.\n\n                                  V.\n\n           Even if I were to agree with the majority that the district\n\ncourt had not reached its conclusion as an adjudicator of fact and law,\n\nbut rather had improperly ruled that García's requested accommodation\n\n       6  Congress has addressed the problem in the Family and Medical\nLeave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq. Whether it has done so\nsufficiently is not for our consideration, at least on this occasion.\n\n                                 -42-\n\fwas unreasonable as a matter of law, I would nevertheless disagree with\n\nthe court's disposition.\n\n          First, it should be plain from what I have already said that\n\nI do not agree that the requested leave was so clearly a reasonable\n\naccommodation that no rational fact-finder could conclude otherwise.\n\nWhether the opinion says it in so many words or not, that is certainly\n\nthe substance of its disposition. If the district court erroneously\n\nruled as a matter of law, the proper disposition of this case would be\n\nto vacate the judgment for the employer and send the case back for\n\ntrial by a fact-finder. (I would not hold either side to the waiver of\n\njury trial made previously.)\n\n          Second, the court's opinion gives inappropriate weight to the\n\nemployer's ability to replace García with a temporary employee during\n\nher absence from the workplace. I have two problems with it. To begin\n\nwith, it is an inquiry more pertinent to the affirmative defense of\n\n\"undue hardship,\" which was not argued by the employer or considered by\n\nthe district court. As the court notes, ante, at 19 n.13, there is\n\nconsiderable debate about the relationship between the concepts of\n\nreasonable accommodation and undue hardship, and I eagerly agree with\n\nthe court that this case does not call for us to weigh in on that\n\nsubject. Since the \"undue hardship\" defense was not argued or resolved\n\nbelow, I would leave it alone.\n\n          More fundamentally, the court's opinion morphs the meaning\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\fof the statute by suggesting that an accommodation that permits the\n\nemployer, without hardship, to hire someone else to perform the\n\nessential functions of the job is equivalent to an accommodation that\n\npermits the disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the\n\njob. Again, such a provision might be an appropriate feature of a\n\nstatute mandating leave policies, but it is not a fitting part of a\n\nstatute that forbids job discrimination against disabled persons by\n\nrequiring employers to accept them as workers when -- preconceptions,\n\nstereotypes, and \"usual\" business practices aside -- they are able to\n\ndo the job.\n\n                                 VI.\n\n           For these reasons, except as to the court's conclusion about\n\nthe nature of the proceedings below, I respectfully disagree with the\n\nreasoning and dissent from the disposition set forth in the court's\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\f",

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313 (D.P.R. 1998). The district\n\ncourt held that García was not a \"qualified individual\" under the Act\n\nbecause the accommodation she requested from her employer was not\n\n\"reasonable.\" See id. at 315. We reverse and direct entry of judgment\n\nfor the plaintiff.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The parties stipulated to the following facts. García worked\n\nfor Lederle Parenterals, Inc. as a secretary from October 1983 to June\n\n13, 1996, when her employment was terminated. Most recently, she was\n\nthe only clerical employee in the company's Validation Department.\n\n          Lederle's disability benefits program provides that an\n\nemployee may receive up to fourteen continuous weeks of salary\n\ncontinuation and then short-term disability benefits (STD) at sixty\n\npercent of full salary. Under the plan, an employee could be absent\n\nfrom work for a twenty-six week period, work another two weeks, and\n\nthen be out for an additional twenty-six weeks for the same disability.\n\nDuring her employment at Lederle, García used the salary continuation\n\nand short-term disability benefits on fourteen separate occasions, in\n\naddition to her sick leave. Lederle had a policy of reserving a job\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffor one year when employees had been out on STD.     It applied that\n\npolicy and terminated García's employment after her one-year\n\nreservation period ended.\n\n          Since 1986, García has been stricken with breast cancer and\n\nhas undergone several rounds of surgery and chemotherapy. From March\n\n15, 1987 to September 16, 1987, she was absent from work for 184 days\n\nas a result of a modified radical mastectomy. During this period, she\n\nreceived salary continuation benefits for fourteen weeks, and then\n\nshort-term disability for the remainder. From September 1987 until\n\n1993 she was back at work. Six years later, in August 1993, a biopsy\n\nrevealed adenocarcinoma of the breast, infiltrating duct type,\n\npersistent, and, as a result, García was absent for 115 days. She then\n\nreturned to work.\n\n          In December 1994, García was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma\n\nof the breast, metastatic. On March 17, 1995, she underwent surgery to\n\nremove a nodule in her neck. Before that surgery, García used up her\n\nsick leave and was absent from work for a total of eighty-eight and a\n\nhalf hours. Following surgery, she received short-term disability\n\nbenefits for thirty-four consecutive days.       In May, she took an\n\nadditional forty-six hours of leave. From June 9 through 25, 1995, she\n\nreceived salary continuation benefits in relation to the medical\n\ncondition.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Sometime after her surgery, García saw a television report\n\non a bone marrow transplant procedure that offered a treatment for her\n\ncancer.   She was interviewed by doctors in June 1995 and García\n\ninformed Lederle in July that she needed to undergo this procedure,\n\nwhich was only available at a Chicago hospital. From August 7 through\n\n20, 1995, she was absent due to chemotherapy (for which she took\n\nnineteen hours sick leave and short-term disability). From September\n\n13 through 27, 1995, she was again absent due to treatment (eight hours\n\nsick leave/fifteen days of short-term disability). In October 1995,\n\nGarcía took eleven and one-half hours of sick leave.\n\n          García was hospitalized for the bone marrow treatment on\n\nNovember 14, 1995. She received STD payments until March 19, 1996. As\n\nof that date, she started receiving long-term disability (LTD).\n\nLederle did not consider her to be an employee once she was on LTD. On\n\nApril 9, 1996, doctors certified to Lederle that García would be able\n\nto return to work on July 30, 1996.\n\n          On June 10, 1996, Lederle's Human Resources Director, Aida\n\nMargarita Rodríguez, called García at home and asked her to come to\n\nwork to meet with her. García complied and Rodríguez notified her that\n\nthe company deemed her disability to have begun in March 1995, that her\n\none-year period for job reservation had elapsed in March 1996, and that\n\nher employment was terminated. García asked that her job be reserved\n\nuntil July 30th, when her doctors expected her to return to work, but\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fto no avail. On June 13th, Lederle sent García a letter confirming her\n\nconversation with Rodríguez and denying her request for additional\n\nleave.\n\n          As it turned out, although García had requested an\n\naccommodation until July 30th, it was on August 22, 1996 that García's\n\ndoctors released her for work, though they did not notify Lederle of\n\nthis and García did not re-apply for employment.\n\n          García's essential job functions did not go unfilled. At\n\nleast three different temporary employees provided by agencies\n\nperformed García's tasks at Lederle during her medical leave and after\n\nher dismissal. Indeed, from June 13, 1996, to January 31, 1997, a\n\nperiod of over seven months from García's dismissal, the company chose\n\nto use temporary employees. The company says her position was never\n\nfilled by a permanent employee.        There was no evidence that the\n\ntemporary employees cost Lederle any more than García would have or\n\nthat their performance was in any way unsatisfactory.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          On May 16, 1997, García brought suit against Lederle, its\n\nparent companies, American Home Products Corp. and American Cynamid\n\nCo., and others for alleged violations of the ADA and Puerto Rico Act\n\nNo. 44 of July 2, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, §§ 501 et seq., as a\n\nresult of the termination of her employment following surgery for\n\nbreast cancer. She seeks back pay, reinstatement (or \"front pay\"),\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\finjunctive relief from future discrimination, compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages, and attorney's fees. On March 30, 1998, the parties submitted\n\na stipulation of material facts together with a Motion Submitting\n\nStipulation of Uncontested Material Facts and Legal Controversies. On\n\nSeptember 28, 1998, the court granted Lederle's cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment, denied García's motion for summary judgment, declined\n\nto exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over García's claim under Act\n\n44, and dismissed the case. See García-Ayala, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 313.1\n\nGarcía appeals.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          There is some disagreement as to what happened at the trial\n\ncourt and, resultantly, as to the standard of review to be applied by\n\nthis court on an appeal from summary judgment entered after cross-\n\nmotions.

The\n\ndistrict court opinion in this jury-claimed case does not discuss\n\nwhether there was a waiver of jury trial rights or a stipulation under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(a)(1),3 or whether it was resolving\n\nthe matter on a jury-waived and a \"case stated\" basis or on\n\nconventional summary judgment; the order entered was for summary\n\njudgment (although the opinion once used the phrase \"The Court finds\").\n\nOut of the confusion, we think it wise to reiterate a few basics.\n\n           For the purposes of standard of appellate review in these\n\ncircumstances, there is usually a distinction between non-jury and jury\n\ncases. This circuit, in United Paperworkers, held that:\n\n\n\n     2     The parties made a joint \"Motion Submitting Stipulation of\nUncontested Material Facts and Legal Controversies,\" and claimed\n\"[t]here being no genuine controversy as to the material facts in this\nmatter, the parties stipulate the same, and submit the material facts\nto the Court for adjudication on the merits of the legal controversies\nin this matter.\"\n     3     At oral argument on appeal, counsel for García disavowed any\nintent not to have a jury trial. But that may have been a statement as\nto trial on damages, once the district court ruled on liability, and\nthus consistent with the position in counsel's brief on the standard of\nreview.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f          [i]n a nonjury case, when the basic dispute between the\n          parties concerns only the factual inferences that one might\n          draw from the more basic facts to which the parties have\n          agreed, and where neither party has sought to introduce\n          additional factual evidence or asked to present witnesses,\n          the parties are, in effect, submitting their dispute to the\n          court as a case stated.\n\nId.

See 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 2720, at 338-39 (1998) (referring to\n\nthis practice in non-jury cases). Instead of expending time and money\n\non a trial, the parties may decide that the pre-trial record\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\festablishes all the necessary grounds upon which a judge may enter a\n\nfinal ruling on one or all of the issues in dispute.

We determine that García agreed, pursuant to Rule\n\n39(a)(1), that the issues of liability presented for the purposes of\n\nthe summary judgment cross-motions could be determined by the court, in\n\nlight of the stipulation filed that \"the parties . . . submit the\n\nmaterial facts in this matter to the Court for adjudication on the\n\nmerits on the legal controversies in this matter.\" Further, plaintiff\n\nhas urged upon us a clear error standard of review. Although at oral\n\nargument plaintiff's counsel said she did not intend to waive her jury\n\ntrial right, she did not brief this issue on appeal and so she is\n\nbound. See Piazza v. Aponte Roque, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545208\"><a href=\"/opinion/545208/magda-marin-piazza-v-awilda-aponte-roque/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37 (1st Cir. 1990);\n\nFed. R. App. P. 28(a). In light of the wording of the stipulation,\n\ntogether with the fact that García, on appeal, has said that review is\n\nfor clear error (and not de novo), we treat this, for present purposes,\n\nas an appeal from a determination after a Rule 39(a)(1) consent.\n\nConsequently, we proceed as if the parties submitted the case to the\n\ndistrict court judge as stated, and review of the determination of the\n\ndistrict court is for clear error.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f                                 IV.\n\n           García claims that Lederle violated the ADA when the company\n\nfired her after she requested additional leave supplemental to her sick\n\nand disability leave. Section 102(a) of the ADA states: \"No covered\n\nentity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a\n\ndisability because of the disability of such individual in regard to .\n\n. . discharge of employees . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Lederle's\n\nprimary defense at summary judgment was that García was not a qualified\n\nindividual because the accommodation she sought was not reasonable.7\n\nLederle offered no evidence or argument that the requested\n\naccommodation was an undue hardship. In fact, Lederle's appellate\n\nargument is inconsistent with its factual stipulation that García's\n\nposition was terminated because her one-year period of leave had\n\nexpired.   That was the reason the company gave in its letter of\n\ntermination to García.8 The company's apparent position that the ADA\n\ncan never impose an obligation on a company to grant an accommodation\n\nbeyond the leave allowed under the company's own leave policy is flatly\n\n\n\n     7     Lederle's argument ignores our case law that \"[a]lthough the\nqualification analysis could be understood to subsume the concept of\nreasonable accommodation, we think it analytically sounder to treat the\ntwo topics separately.\" EEOC v.

The district court order ignored\n\nthe position stated in the record by the company and went instead to\n\nthe issue of the reasonableness of the accommodation.\n\n          To establish an ADA claim, a plaintiff must prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence: first, \"that she was disabled within the\n\nmeaning of the Act; second, . . . that with or without reasonable\n\naccommodation she was a qualified individual able to perform the\n\nessential functions of the job; and third, . . . that the employer\n\ndischarged her because of her disability.\" Criado v.

Individualized Assessment\n\n           It appears from the court's statements that it was applying\n\nper se rules, and not giving the type of individual assessment of the\n\nfacts that the Act and the case law requires. The Supreme Court has\n\ndeemed \"essential\" individualized attention to disability claims. See\n\nSchool Bd. v.

It is simply not the case, under\n\nour precedent that an employee's request for an extended medical leave\n\nwill necessarily mean, as the district court suggested, that the\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\femployee is unable to perform the essential functions of her job.\n\n          First, the court did not focus on the employer's statement\n\nthat the reason that it terminated García was because her medical leave\n\nperiod, under company policy, had expired. The court essentially found\n\nthat a requested accommodation of an extension of a leave on top of a\n\nmedical leave of fifteen months was per se unreasonable.           But\n\nreasonable accommodations may include \"job restructuring, part-time or\n\nmodified work schedules, . . . and other similar accommodations for\n\nindividuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). This court\n\nand others have held that a medical leave of absence -- García's\n\nproposed accommodation -- is a reasonable accommodation under the Act\n\nin some circumstances.

The district court viewed the request as\n\nbeing for five months, since Rodriguez had advised García, albeit in\n\nJune, that a one-year period for job reservation had lapsed in March.\n\nEven if the request were for an additional five months of unpaid leave,\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fwe see no reason to adopt a rule on these facts that the additional\n\nmedical leave sought would be per se an unreasonable accommodation.\n\nWell after her termination, as well as during her medical leave,\n\nLederle filled García's secretarial position with individuals hired\n\nfrom temporary agencies. Lederle had no business need apparent from\n\nthis record to replace García with an in-house hire, and hence would\n\nnot have suffered had it waited for several more months until García's\n\nreturn.

Lucent Technologies, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751342\"><a href=\"/opinion/751342/franklin-ralph-v-lucent-technologies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171-72\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), the court held that a four-week additional\n\naccommodation, beyond a fifty-two week leave period for mental\n\nbreakdown, was reasonable for purpose of a preliminary injunction. The\n\ndistrict court's statement that the employer was left in an \"untenable\n\nbusiness position\" also reinforces the sense of the use of per se rules\n\nand the lack of focus on the facts of this case, given that the\n\nemployer put on no evidence of undue hardship.11\n\n          Similarly, the court viewed García's requested accommodation\n\n-- additional leave time with a specific date for return -- as a\n\nrequest that her job be held open indefinitely. Lederle had argued\n\nthat since García's doctor could not give absolute assurances that she\n\nwould be fit to return to work on July 30th, the request was per se for\n\nan indefinite leave and so was unreasonable.       García specified,\n\nhowever, when she would return, and her doctor released her for return\n\n     11   Perhaps, alternatively, the statement was only hyperbole.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fseveral weeks thereafter. There is no evidence that either July 30th or\n\nthe August 22nd date of medical release, would have imposed any\n\nspecific hardship on Lederle. Some employees, by the nature of their\n\ndisability, are unable to provide an absolutely assured time for their\n\nreturn to employment, but that does not necessarily make a request for\n\nleave to a particular date indefinite. Each case must be scrutinized\n\non its own facts. An unvarying requirement for definiteness again\n\ndeparts from the need for individual factual evaluation.12         See\n\nHaschmann, 151 F.3d at 599-600; Criado, 145 F.3d at 443-44; Rascon, 143\n\nF.3d at 1333-34; Kimbro v.

It does not appear that García expected to be\n\npaid for the additional weeks away from work beyond those allowed under\n\nthe employer's disability benefits program and while her job functions\n\nwere being performed by temporary help. There is no evidence that the\n\ntemporary employees were paid more than García or were less effective\n\nat her job than she. Indeed, Lederle's continued use of temporary\n\nemployees and Lederle's failure to replace García indicates the\n\ncontrary. There was, therefore, no financial burden on the employer\n\nfrom paying an employee who was not performing. It is true that an\n\nemployer usually needs to have the functions of a job filled, and the\n\nfact that essential functions have gone unfilled for a lengthy period\n\ncould well warrant judgment for an employer. But here, the essential\n\nfunctions of the job were filled, to all indications satisfactorily, by\n\ntemporary employees. The use of temporary employees is not, of course,\n\nalways a satisfactory or even a possible solution. But here, there is\n\nno evidence that Lederle was under business pressure to fill the slot\n\nwith another permanent employee (indeed, it never did). In other\n\nsituations, temporary replacements may be unavailable or unsuited to\n\nthe position; here, the available evidence is all to the contrary. In\n\naddition, as said, there is no evidence that the cost of the temporary\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fhelp was greater than the cost of a permanent employee; one might\n\nsuppose it was less.    Thus, the requested accommodation of a few\n\nadditional months of unsalaried leave, with the job functions being\n\nsatisfactorily performed in the meantime, is reasonable.\n\n          The employer presented the court with no evidence of any\n\nhardship, much less undue hardship. On this record, we see no basis\n\nfor the court to do other than enter judgment for García. Under the\n\nEEOC guidelines, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(p), factors to be considered as to\n\nundue hardship include the cost of the accommodation, the effect on\n\nexpenses and resources, the impact of the accommodation on the\n\noperation of the facility (including on other employees' ability to do\n\ntheir jobs) and the impact on the facility's ability to conduct\n\nbusiness. On this record there is no discernible negative impact on\n\nany of these factors; indeed, the record shows hardly any discernable\n\nimpact at all on the employer from the requested accommodation. As it\n\nwas the employer's burden to produce evidence of hardship, we hold that\n\nit must bear the responsibility for the absence of such evidence here.\n\n          We stress that the Act does not require employers to retain\n\ndisabled employees who cannot perform the essential functions of their\n\njobs without reasonable accommodation. Applying this rule to the\n\nprolonged disability leave situation is tricky, however. An absent\n\nemployee obviously cannot himself or herself perform; still, the\n\nemployer may in some instances, such as here, be able to get temporary\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fhelp or find some other alternative that will enable it to proceed\n\nsatisfactorily with its business uninterrupted while a disabled\n\nemployee is recovering. In situations like that, retaining the ailing\n\nemployee's slot while granting unsalaried leave may be a reasonable\n\naccommodation required by the ADA. If, however, allowing the sick\n\nemployee to retain his or her job places the employer in a hardship\n\nsituation where it cannot secure in some reasonable alternative way the\n\nservices for which it hired the ailing employee, and yet is blocked\n\nfrom effecting a rehire, the ADA does not require the retention of the\n\ndisabled person. Hence, where it is unrealistic to expect to obtain\n\nsomeone to perform those essential functions temporarily until the sick\n\nemployee returns, the employer may be entitled to discharge the ill\n\nemployee and hire someone else. An exception to this might be if the\n\nrequested disability leave was so brief that no undue business harm\n\ncould reasonably be expected to occur from not filling the vacancy. We\n\nadd that our analysis, while applicable to these facts, may not be\n\napplicable in other cases. Undue hardships are not limited to financial\n\nimpacts; the term includes accommodations that are unduly extensive,\n\nsubstantially disruptive, or that would fundamentally alter the nature\n\nor operation of the business.      See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App.\n\n          Other factors to be considered as to whether requests for\n\nleaves of absence unreasonable include, for example: where the employee\n\ngave no indication as to when she might be able to return to work, and,\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\finstead, she simply demanded that her job be held open indefinitely,\n\nsee, e.g., Taylor v.

In addition, this court has inquired into whether the company\n\nhad made earlier policy decisions that it was more profitable to permit\n\nan employee additional leave than to hire and train a new employee.\n\nSee Criado, 145 F.3d at 444.\n\n          These are difficult, fact intensive, case-by-case analyses,\n\nill-served by per se rules or stereotypes.

But given the employer's failure to meet, even\n\nminimally, its burden of proof on the issue of hardship, we award\n\njudgment to García as a matter of law.\n\n                                  V.\n\n          We reverse the entry of judgment in favor of Lederle, direct\n\nentry of judgment on liability under the ADA for García, and remand the\n\ncase for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n          So ordered.

After criticizing the\n\ndistrict court for deciding this case as a matter of law, the majority\n\nthen does exactly the same thing. Holding that, on the facts presented\n\nto the district court, the plaintiff's request for leave from her job1\n\nwas a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., the court directs the entry of\n\na judgment as to liability in favor of the party with the burden of\n\nproof. Besides invading the province of fact-finding without warrant,\n\nthe court's ruling expands the reach of the ADA beyond what its\n\nlanguage should properly be understood to authorize. I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           The plaintiff's illness caused her to have several\n\nsubstantial periods of absence from work over the course of her\n\nemployment with the defendant.     She was able to be absent and yet\n\nremain employed by taking advantage of a combination of employee\n\nbenefits, including sick leave and short-term disability leave.\n\n           It appears from the record that the last time she actually\n\nworked was in November, 1995. Beginning in late November, in order to\n\nundergo a bone marrow transplant, she began a period of short-term\n\ndisability leave which apparently expired in March, 1996.        Still\n\n\n     1     The court describes the plaintiff's request as one for a\nperiod of leave. I have some doubt as to whether that is the best way\nto describe her request that her job reservation rights be extended\nlonger than the normal period. I am content, however, to accept the\ncourt's characterization for the purposes of this discussion.\n\n                                 -28-\n\frecuperating, she then began to receive long-term disability benefits\n\nunder her employer's plan. In June, the employer notified her that the\n\none-year period for reservation of her job -- that is, her right to\n\nreturn to her job from disability status -- had also expired in March.2\n\nShe asked for a further extension of the reservation of her right to\n\nreturn to work for a few weeks, but her request was denied and her\n\nemployment was formally terminated.\n\n          The court now holds that her request for an extension must\n\nbe considered a \"reasonable accommodation\" of her disability which the\n\nemployer was bound to afford her under the ADA unless the employer\n\ncould demonstrate that doing so would cause it undue hardship.

She was not then performing it, and had not performed\n\nit for some months.    Nonetheless, the court concludes that the\n\nplaintiff would have been \"qualified\" to perform her job with the\n\naccommodation she requested: that she be excused from performing the\n\njob until she had recovered sufficiently to be able to return to work\n\nonce again.\n\n          When a period of leave from a job may appropriately be\n\nconsidered an accommodation that enables an employee to perform that\n\njob presents a troublesome problem, partly because of the oxymoronic\n\nanomaly it harbors, but also because of the daunting challenge of line-\n\ndrawing it presents. The prevailing view among the Courts of Appeals,\n\nand the law of this Circuit, is that a period of leave can in some\n\ncircumstances be a reasonable accommodation required of an employer\n\nunder the ADA. See Criado, 145 F.3d at 443. Put another way, it is\n\nwrong to say categorically that leave can never be a reasonable\n\naccommodation.\n\n          The term \"leave\" is a capacious one, however, and the cases\n\ndo not hold that any leave will qualify as a reasonable accommodation.\n\nSee Walsh v.

In any context, however, to be a \"reasonable\n\naccommodation\" a measure must be both an \"accommodation\" and\n\n\"reasonable.\"\n\n          In the first place, an \"accommodation\" must serve a\n\nfunctional purpose; it is a means to a desired end. An accommodation\n\nas contemplated by the ADA is a measure that enables the performance of\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fa job by a person who, without the measure, is disabled from performing\n\nthe job.   See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9).    It effectively transforms a\n\ndisabled person into an enabled person for the purposes of the job.\n\n           The converse follows. If the measure does not enable the\n\notherwise disabled person to perform the essential functions of the\n\njob, it loses its functional quality and consequently fails to operate\n\nas an accommodation.\n\n           An accommodation must not only be functionally effective; it\n\nmust also be reasonable.3 Again, whether a proposed accommodation is\n\nreasonable or not will ordinarily be judged on the peculiar facts of a\n\ngiven case.    In most cases, it will be a matter to be left to\n\nassessment and evaluation by the trier of fact.\n\n           Nonetheless, judges may sometimes be called upon to decide\n\nwhat circumstances might make a proposed measure a reasonable\n\naccommodation, or not, as a matter of law. See Walsh, 201 F.3d at 726-\n\n27 (affirming grant of summary judgment in favor of employer because\n\nplaintiff's requested accommodation was \"objectively unreasonable\");\n\nsee also Evans v.

It seems\nto me that view gives short shrift to the modifier. \"Feasible and\neffective\" could be a shorthand way of expressing the functionality\nnecessary to make the measure an accommodation. The inclusion of the\nmodifier indicates that the measure must not only be \"feasible and\neffective,\" i.e. functional, but \"reasonable\" to boot.\n\n                                 -32-\n\faccommodation not shown likely to be successful was not reasonable).\n\nThere is hazard in trying to speak too broadly or too categorically,\n\nespecially   in   this   area   where    the   varieties   of   potential\n\naccommodations, and the reasons why any given accommodation might or\n\nmight not be reasonable, are myriad.

They presented a stipulation of undisputed facts\n\nand cross-moved for summary judgment. If nothing else appeared, one\n\nwould conclude that they were seeking only a ruling of law.\n\n          But the parties' stipulation indicated that they were\n\nsubmitting the liability portion of the case \"to the Court for\n\nadjudication on the merits of the legal controversies in this matter.\"\n\n\"Adjudication on the merits\" ordinarily suggests more than summary\n\njudgment. Unlike a full consideration of a case after trial, summary\n\njudgment does not always end in an adjudication, because even on cross-\n\nmotions based on stipulated facts, a court might conclude that neither\n\nside is entitled to win as a matter of law and that the dispute must be\n\nsubmitted to the fact-finder. The full job of the fact-finder, after\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fall, includes not only settling conflicts in the \"basic\" facts, but\n\nalso drawing appropriate inferences from those facts.

Both sides asserted in their\n\nbriefs to us that the applicable standard of appellate review is \"clear\n\nerror,\" the standard used to review fact-finding by a district court.\n\nThus, both before the district court and before this court, the parties\n\npresented the matter as having been submitted as a \"case stated\" for\n\nfull \"adjudication\" by the district court.\n\n          Moreover,    the   district   court's   opinion   indicates,\n\nconsistently with the parties' characterization, that the judge thought\n\nhe was not merely policing the fact-finding function under Rule 56, but\n\ninstead was performing it.

The \"clear error\" standard applies not only\n\nto resolution of factual disputes, but also to the factual inferences\n\ndrawn by the district court on the basis of the stipulated facts. Id.\n\n          On the record presented and under an appropriate application\n\nof the statute's terms, a fact-finder's inference-based conclusion\n\nthat the plaintiff's request for an extension of her right to return to\n\nwork was not a reasonable accommodation cannot be called clearly\n\nerroneous. The clearly erroneous standard does not permit an appellate\n\ncourt to substitute its own evaluative judgment of what was or was not\n\nreasonable, unless the district court's conclusion was unquestionably,\n\nnot just arguably, wrong. If the same facts that were presented to the\n\njudge below had been presented to a jury, and if the jury had returned\n\na verdict that the requested leave was not a reasonable accommodation,\n\nI cannot imagine that this court would disturb that finding.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          Rather than challenging the district court's fact-finding as\n\nclearly erroneous, the majority identifies two legal errors it says the\n\n\n\n     4    Of course, any purely legal rulings are subject to de novo\nreview.\n\n                                 -35-\n\fdistrict court committed. First, the court says the district court\n\nfailed to give individualized consideration to the plaintiff's case,\n\nbut instead decided that the plaintiff's request for additional leave\n\nwas per se unreasonable. Second, the court says that the district\n\ncourt improperly shifted the burden of proof as to \"undue hardship\" by\n\nrequiring the plaintiff to disprove it, rather than requiring the\n\nemployer to establish it.\n\n          The second purported error, I think, stems from an incorrect\n\nreading of the district court opinion.      The issue argued by the\n\nparties, and the issue decided by the district court, was whether the\n\nplaintiff was a qualified person with a disability. In particular,\n\nresolution of that issue depended on whether the plaintiff's request\n\nfor further leave was a reasonable accommodation. The employer did not\n\nargue undue hardship. Though the district court opinion does state\n\nthat granting the accommodation would place the employer \"in an\n\nuntenable business position,\" García-Ayala, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 315, in\n\ncontext that phrase was used not as an elaboration of the \"undue\n\nhardship\" affirmative defense, but as part of the court's explication\n\nof why, in the district court's judgment, the requested accommodation\n\nwas not reasonable. I do not think it is accurate to say that the\n\ndistrict court was giving the employer the benefit of the \"undue\n\nhardship\" affirmative defense, or shifting to the plaintiff the burden\n\nto disprove that affirmative defense.\n\n\n                                -36-\n\f          The other error the majority finds is that the district court\n\napplied a per se rule about the permissible length of a leave and,\n\ntherefore, failed to make an individualized assessment of the case. I\n\nmust say I do not quite understand this criticism. I do not find any\n\nindication in the district court's opinion that it failed to give\n\nattention to the particulars of the case.       To the contrary, the\n\ndistrict court discussed in detail the facts of the case as presented\n\nby the parties; it gave no less attention to the \"individualized\" facts\n\nof the case than the parties did.\n\n          The majority cannot mean that the need for individualized\n\nassessment of an ADA case necessarily precludes a disposition as a\n\nmatter of law, because this court has affirmed dispositions of ADA\n\ncases as a matter of law. See, e.g., Tardie v. Rehabilitation Hosp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198333\"><a href=\"/opinion/198333/tardie-v-rehabilitation/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1999); Feliciano v.

And the majority certainly cannot mean that the need\n\nfor individualized assessment always requires submission of the matter\n\nfor decision by the trier of fact, because, after all, the court's\n\ndisposition now orders entry of judgment for the plaintiff as a matter\n\nof law, without submission to the trier of fact.\n\n          The more pertinent question is, if the district court decided\n\nthe case by making a pure ruling of law as the majority apparently\n\nasserts, rather than by applying the law to the facts and the\n\npermissible inferences it drew from them, was its ruling incorrect?\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fSpecifically, did the district court err in holding (if it did) that no\n\nrational fact-finder could conclude that the extension of leave\n\nrequested by García was a reasonable accommodation under the ADA?5 I\n\nwould conclude that on the particular facts of this case, such a ruling\n\nwould not have been an error.\n\n          The leave extension requested by the plaintiff was not a\n\nreasonable accommodation as a matter of law because it was not an\n\naccommodation at all as that term ought to be understood. To be an\n\naccommodation, the requested leave would have to do what an\n\naccommodation under the ADA must do -- enable the employee to perform\n\nthe essential functions of her job. To put it in terms of the EEOC's\n\nproposed definition of \"reasonable accommodation,\" García's requested\n\nleave would not have been \"effective.\"\n\n          It seems to me that the following proposition can be\n\nextrapolated from the cases:     For a proposed period of leave to\n\nconstitute an effective accommodation, it must meet at least two\n\nconditions. First, it must be instrumental to effect or advance a\n\nchange in the employee's disabled status with respect to the job, so\n\nthat the employee is enabled to do it. A period of leave would meet\n\n\n\n     5     The district court expressly recognized that a leave may\nqualify as a reasonable accommodation in some circumstances. García-\nAyala, 20 F. Supp. 2d at 315. It is clear, therefore, that it did not\nrule that a period of leave could never be a reasonable accommodation,\nand thus the ruling is not in direct conflict with any of our\nprecedents.\n\n                                 -38-\n\fthis criterion if it permitted the employee to receive therapy or\n\ntreatment that would succeed in removing the obstacle to employment the\n\nparticular disability posed. In Criado, for example, the court noted\n\nthat the employee's physician believed that \"the leave would ameliorate\n\nher disability.\" 145 F.3d at 444. Similarly, an EEOC interpretive\n\nguideline suggests that leave \"for necessary treatment\" could be a\n\nreasonable accommodation, 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app., and the Department\n\nof Labor advises that leave might be a reasonable accommodation \"when\n\nthe disability is of a nature that it is likely to respond to\n\ntreatment.\" 29 C.F.R. pt. 32, app. A(b). Simply the possibility of\n\nimprovement is not enough, however; the recovery must be reasonably\n\nlikely. See Evans, 133 F.3d at 140 (construing similar state statute).\n\nFurther, the prospect of recovery (or enablement) should be judged not\n\nby hindsight, but by what reasonably appears at the time the leave is\n\nrequested.   Id.\n\n          Second, the employee's return to work must be relatively\n\nproximate in a temporal sense. The cases do not speak with one voice\n\non this subject, and some give little attention to it, except to imply\n\nthat the temporal element will figure in the jury's assessment of\n\nreasonableness. Although there seems to be general agreement that a\n\nleave period cannot be indefinite, the leave periods that have been\n\nexplicitly or implicitly approved vary in length. Some variation is\n\nnot inappropriate; that is consistent with the need to evaluate each\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\fcase on its particular facts.\n\n          In the end, however, the leave must not only be one that\n\nserves a proper medical purpose; it must also be one that serves the\n\nstatutory purpose, which is to enable the employee to perform the\n\nessential functions of her job. Cf. Evans, 133 F.3d at 140 (construing\n\nsimilar state statute). It cannot be overlooked that the statute\n\nspeaks in the present tense, indicative mood. A \"qualified individual\n\nwith a disability\" entitled to the statute's protection is a person who\n\n\"can perform the essential functions of the employment position\" with\n\nreasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) (emphasis added). \" Can\n\nperform,\" as in \" now.\" I would not contend that the statute requires\n\nliterally instantaneous effectiveness of an accommodation.          By\n\napproving the idea that some leaves might qualify as reasonable\n\naccommodations, courts, including this one, have properly rejected such\n\na cramped and unrealistic reading of the statute. However, fidelity to\n\nboth the language and purpose of the statute requires that the time\n\nwithin which the proposed accommodation accomplishes its intended\n\npurpose -- enabling the employee to perform the job -- must be such\n\nthat the accommodation is tolerably consistent with the statutory\n\nwords, \"can perform.\"\n\n          I would conclude that the plaintiff did not carry her burden\n\nof proffering evidence that the leave she requested was \"effective\" in\n\nthese two essential ways.    She asked that the employer abide her\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\fcontinued recuperation for an additional period, but she offered little\n\n-- essentially an unelaborated prognostic estimate -- that would enable\n\nan objective assessment either of the realistic prospect of recovery as\n\nof the time of the request or of the likely duration of her absence.\n\nFurther, I do not think the requested leave could legitimately be said\n\nto be an accommodation enabling her, more or less contemporaneously, to\n\nperform the essential functions of the job. It may have given her an\n\nopportunity to become able again a couple of months down the road, but\n\nthat is something that this statute, properly construed, does not\n\naddress.\n\n           Before she began her most recent disability leave in\n\nNovember, 1995, García was performing her job without accommodation.\n\nAs of late August, 1996, she had apparently recovered and was able\n\nagain to perform her job without accommodation. Between November and\n\nlate August, she was not able to work. The requested leave would not\n\nhave changed that. It would not have made her able to work when she\n\nwas unable, and when she was able again, it was unnecessary. In point\n\nof fact, it would have had no effect on her actual ability to work.\n\nWhat it would have affected was the employer's ability to terminate her\n\nemployment because she could not work. Restricting an employer's\n\nability to terminate an employee who is unable to work can be a\n\n\n\n\n                                 -41-\n\flegitimate object of legislative regulation,6 but that is not the\n\nobjective of the statute we are considering. It does not diminish the\n\nimportance or value of the ADA to conclude that it does not solve all\n\nproblems, and in particular that it does not solve the problem of\n\nprotecting job security for employees who need an extended absence from\n\nthe workplace for medical reasons.\n\n           Our obligation is to construe and apply the statute as it was\n\nwritten, sensibly and consistently, so that, among other things, both\n\nemployers and employees will understand what it requires and what it\n\ndoes not. Discharging that obligation will occasionally call for\n\nrulings that deny relief to plaintiffs such as García who have endured\n\nextraordinary personal hardship. We make such rulings when necessary\n\nin every area of the law, and if called on we should not shy from the\n\nobligation in this area as well, without regard to our views as to\n\nwhether the plaintiff was not treated particularly well by her long-\n\ntime employer or whether the ADA ought to contain a provision it does\n\nnot.\n\n                                  V.\n\n           Even if I were to agree with the majority that the district\n\ncourt had not reached its conclusion as an adjudicator of fact and law,\n\nbut rather had improperly ruled that García's requested accommodation\n\n       6  Congress has addressed the problem in the Family and Medical\nLeave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq. Whether it has done so\nsufficiently is not for our consideration, at least on this occasion.\n\n                                 -42-\n\fwas unreasonable as a matter of law, I would nevertheless disagree with\n\nthe court's disposition.\n\n          First, it should be plain from what I have already said that\n\nI do not agree that the requested leave was so clearly a reasonable\n\naccommodation that no rational fact-finder could conclude otherwise.\n\nWhether the opinion says it in so many words or not, that is certainly\n\nthe substance of its disposition. If the district court erroneously\n\nruled as a matter of law, the proper disposition of this case would be\n\nto vacate the judgment for the employer and send the case back for\n\ntrial by a fact-finder. (I would not hold either side to the waiver of\n\njury trial made previously.)\n\n          Second, the court's opinion gives inappropriate weight to the\n\nemployer's ability to replace García with a temporary employee during\n\nher absence from the workplace. I have two problems with it. To begin\n\nwith, it is an inquiry more pertinent to the affirmative defense of\n\n\"undue hardship,\" which was not argued by the employer or considered by\n\nthe district court. As the court notes, ante, at 19 n.13, there is\n\nconsiderable debate about the relationship between the concepts of\n\nreasonable accommodation and undue hardship, and I eagerly agree with\n\nthe court that this case does not call for us to weigh in on that\n\nsubject. Since the \"undue hardship\" defense was not argued or resolved\n\nbelow, I would leave it alone.\n\n          More fundamentally, the court's opinion morphs the meaning\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\fof the statute by suggesting that an accommodation that permits the\n\nemployer, without hardship, to hire someone else to perform the\n\nessential functions of the job is equivalent to an accommodation that\n\npermits the disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the\n\njob. Again, such a provision might be an appropriate feature of a\n\nstatute mandating leave policies, but it is not a fitting part of a\n\nstatute that forbids job discrimination against disabled persons by\n\nrequiring employers to accept them as workers when -- preconceptions,\n\nstereotypes, and \"usual\" business practices aside -- they are able to\n\ndo the job.\n\n                                 VI.\n\n           For these reasons, except as to the court's conclusion about\n\nthe nature of the proceedings below, I respectfully disagree with the\n\nreasoning and dissent from the disposition set forth in the court's\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\f</pre>",
