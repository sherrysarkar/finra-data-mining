The  suspected\r\n\ntrafficking  was being  conducted  out of  an apartment  that\r\n\nDavis shared  with his mother  and niece.   Detective Lussier\r\n\nconducted sporadic surveillance of the apartment, stopping by\r\n\nat various times  of the  day and  night for  five to  thirty\r\n\nminutes.    He frequently  observed  a  black BMW  automobile\r\n\nparked in front  of the apartment,  and on several  occasions\r\n\nsaw Davis park the BMW  and thereafter use his keys to  enter\r\n\nthe apartment.\r\n\n          To  confirm  his   suspicions,  Detective   Lussier\r\n\nsuccessfully orchestrated  a  controlled buy  of heroin  from\r\n\nDavis at  the  apartment.    Lussier searched  the  buyer,  a\r\n\nconfidential informant, before  he entered the  apartment and\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nthen  watched  him  enter,   exit,  and  return  directly  to\r\n\nLussier's  car.   The informant  then  delivered a  packet of\r\n\nheroin to Lussier, stating that it came from \"Joe.\"  \r\n\n          Relying on the controlled buy to establish probable\r\n\ncause,  Lussier   obtained  a   warrant  to  search   Davis's\r\n\napartment.   On January  24, 1994, several  Providence police\r\n\nofficers executed  the search  warrant at  Davis s apartment.\r\n\nThe police knocked on  the door, and Davis s niece,  the only\r\n\none home at that time, admitted the officers.\r\n\n          The apartment had two stories and  a basement.  The\r\n\nbedrooms on the upper  level were used by Davis's  mother and\r\n\nniece.  The basement was  divided into a laundry/storage area\r\n\nand  a third bedroom, apparently  used by Davis.   The police\r\n\nfound  numerous drug-related  items in  the basement  bedroom\r\n\narea, including seventy-seven packets of heroin, twenty-three\r\n\nbags  of marijuana, a coffee  grinder used to  mill heroin, a\r\n\nrespiratory dust mask,1 a stamp commonly used  to mark heroin\r\n\npackets, and thousands of empty glassine packets.  The police\r\n\nalso  seized from the bedroom area $10,563 in cash ($3,663 in\r\n\na bank shaped like a  large Coca-Cola bottle and $6,900 in  a\r\n\n\"Snickers\"  box), two  gold  chains (also  in the  \"Snickers\"\r\n\nbox),  and a  loaded .38  caliber revolver  in a  box on  the\r\n\nsecond shelf of an  entertainment center.  A number  of found\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  One of the officers  who searched the apartment testified\r\nat trial that these masks are used by persons who process and\r\npackage heroin in order to avoid inhalation of heroin dust.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nitems  established  that  the  basement bedroom  was  Davis's\r\n\n(letters, a  birthday card,  a photograph album,  a bill  for\r\n\npager  service, etc.).   Detective  Lussier called  the pager\r\n\nnumber  listed on the bill  several times after  the raid and\r\n\nbefore Davis s  arrest.   Each time,  Lussier, who  had known\r\n\nDavis for four or five years, recognized the  voice returning\r\n\nthe  page as that of  Davis.  Moreover,  the caller confirmed\r\n\nfor  Lussier  that he  was Joe  Mills,  another name  used by\r\n\nDavis.   The police seized the BMW and found Davis's driver's\r\n\nlicense inside, which bore the address of the apartment.\r\n\n          Providence police officers arrested Davis  on March\r\n\n4, 1994, about  six weeks  after the search.   The  arresting\r\n\nofficers seized from Davis forty-two packets of heroin marked\r\n\nwith  the brand  name \"Snake\"  from the  front pocket  of the\r\n\nsweatshirt Davis was wearing.   They also seized a  pager and\r\n\n$300  in cash.    At  the  police  station,  Davis  gave  the\r\n\napartment  as  his  residence  address.    Detective  Lussier\r\n\nsubsequently  interviewed Davis  and told  him that  they had\r\n\nseized heroin from  the apartment.   Davis responded (to  the\r\n\neffect that) \"You only got 72 bags.\"  Lussier also told Davis\r\n\nthey seized marijuana.  Again, Davis responded, \"You only got\r\n\nabout 20 bags.\"   Finally,  Lussier told Davis  that the  gun\r\n\nmade the problem more serious.  Davis rejoined, \"The revolver\r\n\nwasn't  hidden.   It was  only a  .38, just  for protection.\"\r\n\nDetective  Lussier had  not told  Davis the  quantity  of the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndrugs  seized  or the  caliber of  the  gun prior  to Davis s\r\n\nadmissions.   The  arresting officer  also turned  the seized\r\n\npager over to  Detective Lussier.  Lussier  dialed the number\r\n\nhe had previously  used to page  Davis and keyed in  a three-\r\n\ndigit code.  The code appeared on the pager s display.\r\n\n          It is also undisputed (based on trial stipulations)\r\n\nthat:  (1)  Davis had  been convicted  of  a felony  prior to\r\n\nJanuary  24,  1994,  (2)  the  R.G.  Industries  .38  caliber\r\n\nrevolver had traveled in and affected interstate commerce and\r\n\nit had been test-fired and worked, and (3) the packets seized\r\n\nfrom  the apartment, the  residue on the  coffee grinder, and\r\n\nthe packets seized from Davis s person all contained heroin.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                    Procedural Background\r                                Procedural Background\r                                                     \r\n\n          On  March 17,  1994, a  federal grand  jury charged\r\n\nJoseph Davis  with two  counts of  possession with intent  to\r\n\ndistribute heroin in violation  of 21 U.S.C.   841(a) (Counts\r\n\nOne and  Four), one  count of possession  of a  firearm by  a\r\n\nconvicted  felon in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    922(g) (Count\r\n\nTwo),  and one  count  of  using  a  firearm  during  a  drug\r\n\ntrafficking crime  in violation of 18  U.S.C.   924(c) (Count\r\n\nThree).2   On August 2, 1994,  after a two-day jury  trial at\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Count   Three  was  eventually   dismissed,  and  Davis's\r\nultimate sentence adjusted accordingly, in light of Bailey v.\r                                                                      \r\nUnited States, 116 S.

The district court denied the motion.\r\n\nDavis subsequently discharged his retained trial counsel, and\r\n\nnew  counsel was appointed by the court.  Davis s new counsel\r\n\nmoved for reconsideration of  the denial of the motion  for a\r\n\nnew trial.  The district court agreed to reconsider and heard\r\n\narguments on the merits  of the ineffective assistance claim.\r\n\nThe  district   court  found   both   that  trial   counsel's\r\n\nperformance  was  adequate and  that,  even  if it  had  been\r\n\ndeficient, Davis suffered no prejudice.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          Davis  appeals the district  court's denial  of his\r\n\nmotion for a new trial, arguing that  he received ineffective\r\n\nassistance of  counsel at trial.3   Typically, the  courts of\r\n\nappeal hear  claims of  ineffective assistance on  collateral\r\n\nreview,  because such claims usually are not presented to and\r\n\ndecided by  the district  court prior  to the  direct appeal.\r\n\nSee United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993),\r                                     \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Davis also appeals certain  aspects of his sentence under\r\nthe United  States Sentencing  Guidelines, but our  review of\r\nthe  record  reveals  that  the  asserted  errors  have  been\r\ncorrected by the district  judge.  Thus, we need  not address\r\nthem here.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ncert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1839 (1994).  In  this case, though,\r                        \r\n\nDavis  had  new  counsel   appointed  after  trial,  and  the\r\n\nineffective assistance  claim was  briefed and argued  to the\r\n\ndistrict  court,  which   determined  that  trial   counsel's\r\n\nperformance   was   neither   deficient    nor   prejudicial.\r\n\nAccordingly, \"the  record is sufficiently developed  to allow\r\n\nreasoned consideration of the claim.\"  Id.  \r                                                      \r\n\nA.

Our  review  is\r\nextensive, but we are not obliged to decide which standard of\r\nreview  obtains, because  the result  is  the same  under any\r\nstandard.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nC.  Analysis\r                        \r\n\n          We  have  carefully  reviewed  all  of the  alleged\r\n\ndeficiencies  in  counsel's  performance,  as  well  as   the\r\n\nevidence   presented   at  trial.      Although  Strickland's\r                                                                       \r\n\n\"prejudice  prong\"  is  the  basis  for  our  decision,  some\r\n\ncomments on counsel's performance are in order.  \r\n\n          Trial counsel's performance could  undoubtedly have\r\n\nbeen  better; in  particular,  he could  have refrained  from\r\n\ntelling the jury that his  client was a heroin dealer with  a\r\n\nlengthy criminal record.  There was,  however, some method in\r\n\ncounsel's  apparent  madness.    That  seemingly  prejudicial\r\n\nstatement was concededly  part of a strategy  to convince the\r\n\njury that  the police had framed  Davis, both at  the time of\r\n\nthe  search and  upon  his arrest,  because  he was  a  known\r\n\nconvicted  felon.  Counsel also argued  and attempted to show\r\n\nthrough cross-examination that Davis had too  much experience\r\n\nwith  the  criminal  justice  system  to  make  the  damaging\r\n\nstatements that the police  claimed he made (e.g., \"You  only\r                                                             \r\n\ngot  72 bags\").  Trial  counsel's statement that  this was \"a\r\n\nprosecutor's  dream case\" and therefore \"too good to be true\"\r\n\nwas  also  part  of the  same  strategy.    Counsel tried  to\r\n\nconvince  the jury that the  police had lied  and planted the\r\n\nevidence  found in the apartment  and on Davis's  person.  As\r\n\nfurther support  for  the  claim  that his  client  had  been\r\n\nframed, counsel pointed to the fact that no fingerprints were\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nfound  on the  heroin-related items  allegedly seized  at the\r\n\napartment.    While  counsel's  approach   ultimately  proved\r\n\nunsuccessful, we are hard pressed  to think of an alternative\r\n\ntrial strategy in light  of the overwhelming evidence against\r\n\nDavis.\r\n\n          Even assuming, however, that  counsel's performance\r\n\nwas constitutionally deficient, we ultimately find that there\r\n\nwas no prejudice to Davis.  The evidence against Davis was so\r\n\noverwhelming that,  as to  nine of  the  ten alleged  errors,\r\n\nthere is no reasonable  possibility that the jury  would have\r\n\nacquitted  Davis even  without counsel's  allegedly deficient\r\n\nperformance.   The remaining error,  the failure to  move for\r\n\nsuppression  of the  evidence  resulting  from the  apartment\r\n\nsearch,  cannot be  dismissed  on the  basis of  overwhelming\r\n\nevidence.   Thus, we will  discuss that claim  in some depth.\r\n\nWe also  examine  whether a  constitutionally adequate  trial\r\n\nlawyer could have convinced the jury that the police lied and\r\n\nfabricated evidence.   As to  all the other  asserted errors,\r\n\nthere is no need  to treat them individually  -- we find  the\r\n\nevidence of Davis's  guilt (if believed) to be  so compelling\r\n\nthat  he utterly  fails  to satisfy  the  prejudice prong  of\r\n\nStrickland.   See 466 U.S. at 696 (\"[A] verdict or conclusion\r                             \r\n\nonly  weakly supported by the  record is more  likely to have\r\n\nbeen  affected by  errors than  one with  overwhelming record\r\n\nsupport.\"); see also  United States v. Jackson, 918 F.2d 236,\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n243 (1st  Cir. 1990)  (holding that overwhelming  evidence of\r\n\ndefendant's guilt  negated  any reasonable  probability  that\r\n\nerror by counsel affected outcome of trial).\r\n\n          Although Davis  points to  a  plethora of  asserted\r\n\ndeficiencies, he  concedes that  trial counsel's errors  were\r\n\nnon-prejudicial  if one  accepts  the testimony  of the  four\r\n\npolice officers about the seizures of heroin and a gun at the\r\n\napartment,  and the  heroin  on Davis's  person upon  arrest.\r\n\nBoiled down  to its essence,  Davis's appeal is  founded upon\r\n\nhis claim of extensive police perjury,  and an assertion that\r\n\ncompetent counsel could have either (1) suppressed the search\r\n\nevidence because of that perjury or (2) obtained a verdict of\r\n\nacquittal  by convincing  the jury that  the police  lied and\r\n\nfabricated essential evidence.\r\n\n          Thus,  our task  is  to assess  Davis's showing  of\r\n\npolice perjury  and evidence fabrication.   We first analyze,\r\n\nand reject,  Davis's police perjury arguments  in the context\r\n\nof a  potential Fourth  Amendment challenge to  the apartment\r\n\nsearch.  We then  use that analysis to conclude that there is\r\n\nno  reasonable  probability that,  in  the  absence of  these\r\n\npurported errors by  counsel, a jury would  have accepted the\r\n\nperjury arguments and acquitted Davis.\r\n\n          1.  Suppressing the Search Evidence\r                                                         \r\n\n          Davis  argues  that  the  warrant  to  search   the\r\n\napartment  was invalid  because Detective Lussier  lied about\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nconducting the controlled buy.  First,  Davis points out that\r\n\nLussier's warrant affidavit contained little detail about the\r\n\ncontrolled buy or the informant; in particular, the affidavit\r\n\ndid not provide the date of the controlled buy or  the amount\r\n\nof heroin or currency involved.5\r\n\n          Second,  Davis  asserts   that  Lussier's   warrant\r\n\naffidavit  contained  a   logical  inconsistency   concerning\r\n\nDavis's physical description that suggests fabrication.   The\r\n\naffidavit  stated that  Davis was  5'8\" tall and  weighed 145\r\n\npounds,  when in  fact  he was  5'11\"  and 170  pounds.   The\r\n\naffidavit  also stated  that the informant,  after completing\r\n\nthe buy,  \"provided me  with a physical  description matching\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The affidavit stated:\r\n               Within the last few days I contacted\r\n          a  confidential  and reliable  informant,\r\n          this informant  has in the  past provided\r\n          me with information that has  resulted in\r\n          successful  narcotics  arrest [sic],  and\r\n          narcotics  seizures.   I spoke  with this\r\n          informant who agreed to make a controlled\r\n          purchase  from  apartment F-8  in Wiggins\r\n          Village.  I drove  the informant into the\r\n          area  of  the   apartment  and   searched\r\n          him/her for any  contraband or  currency.\r\n          After   finding   none  I   provided  the\r\n          informant  with  US  currency   and  sent\r\n          him/her to the apartment.  I then watched\r\n          as  the informant  knocked and  went into\r\n          the  apartment.    After about  5  to  10\r\n          minutes  the  informant  exited the  same\r\n          door and  walked directly to  my vehicle.\r\n          Once inside the informant handed me a sum\r\n          of  heroin, stating  that  it  came  from\r\n          \"Joe.\"  The informant  then provided me a\r\n          physical description matching Joe Davis .\r\n          . . .\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nJoe Davis\"  (emphasis added).   Davis's argument  is somewhat\r\n\nsubtle:   if  there had  really been  a controlled  buyer who\r\n\ndealt with  Davis, the buyer would  have accurately described\r\n\nDavis, and that accurate description would not have \"matched\"\r\n\nJoe  Davis in  Lussier's mind,  because Lussier  was mistaken\r\n\nabout Davis's actual height and weight.  Thus, Davis contends\r\n\nthat Lussier  fabricated both the confidential  informant and\r\n\nthe controlled buy.\r\n\n          Davis  also  makes  several other  arguments  about\r\n\npolice perjury.   Although  these arguments relate  to events\r\n\nthat occurred  after Lussier filed the  warrant affidavit, we\r\n\naddress them  here because  Davis argues that  the subsequent\r\n\nconduct  of  the  police  corroborates  the  falsity  of  the\r\n\naffidavit.  After Davis  was arrested, the arresting officers\r\n\nseized the  packets of heroin,  the pager, and  three hundred\r\n\ndollars.    About sixty-six  dollars,  however,  was left  in\r\n\nDavis's  possession  after  the  initial  post-arrest search,\r\n\napparently not  discovered when the officers  found the other\r\n\nitems.  Davis argues  that the officers would have  found the\r\n\nsixty-six  dollars if  they had  in  fact searched  Davis and\r\n\nfound  heroin and  another  wad of  cash.   Therefore,  Davis\r\n\nasserts, the arresting officers  lied about finding heroin on\r\n\nDavis, and they fabricated the physical evidence presented at\r\n\ntrial.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          Davis also contends that  the police lied when they\r\n\nsaid  that the \"Coca-Cola\" bank was found in Davis's basement\r\n\nbedroom, providing as support for that contention  affidavits\r\n\nfrom Davis's mother, sister, and a neighbor stating that  the\r\n\nbank  belonged to  the mother  and was  kept in  her upstairs\r\n\nbedroom.  None of  those three testified at trial.   Finally,\r\n\nDavis accuses  the police  of stealing  nearly $500 from  his\r\n\nmother's bedroom,  based on  his mother's affidavit  that the\r\n\nmoney was missing after the search.\r\n\n          When an ineffective assistance claim is grounded on\r\n\na failure to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim, the defendant\r\n\nmust prove  \"that his  Fourth Amendment claim  is meritorious\r\n\nand that  there is a reasonable probability  that the verdict\r\n\nwould have  been different  absent the  excludable evidence.\"\r\n\nKimmelman v. Morrison, 477  U.S. 365, 375 (1985).   We assume\r                                 \r\n\nfor the sake  of argument  that the verdict  would have  been\r\n\ndifferent  if  the evidence  resulting  from  the search  was\r\n\nexcluded, and  we focus on whether an effective counsel could\r\n\nhave successfully  suppressed the evidence resulting from the\r\n\napartment search on Fourth Amendment grounds.\r\n\n          Davis argues that, had his counsel requested it, he\r\n\nwould  have been entitled to a Franks hearing, the first step\r                                                 \r\n\nin seeking to  suppress the evidence obtained  in the search.\r\n\nUnder  Franks v.  Delaware,  438 U.S.  154, 155-56  (1978), a\r                                      \r\n\ndefendant   may  overcome   the   presumption   of   validity\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nsurrounding  affidavits  that  support  search  warrants  and\r\n\nobtain  an evidentiary  hearing, if  he \"makes  a substantial\r\n\npreliminary  showing that  a  false statement  knowingly  and\r\n\nintentionally, or with reckless  disregard for the truth, was\r\n\nincluded  by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the\r\n\nallegedly  false statement  is  necessary to  the finding  of\r\n\nprobable  cause.\"    Here,  of course,  the  allegedly  false\r\n\nstatement is Detective Lussier's assertion  that a controlled\r\n\nbuy was  conducted at Davis's  apartment, which was  the only\r\n\nbasis for probable cause in the affidavit.  \r\n\n          We  hold,  however,  that  Davis's  allegations  of\r\n\nperjury  by  Lussier  do   not  amount  to  the  \"substantial\r\n\npreliminary  showing\" required  for  a Franks  hearing.   The\r                                                         \r\n\nSupreme Court explained in Franks that:\r                                             \r\n\n          To  mandate  an evidentiary  hearing, the\r\n          challenger's  attack  must  be more  than\r\n          conclusory  and must be supported by more\r\n          than  a desire  to cross-examine.   There\r\n          must   be   allegations   of   deliberate\r\n          falsehood  or  of reckless  disregard for\r\n          the truth, and  those allegations must be\r\n          accompanied by an  offer of proof.   They\r\n          should point out specifically the portion\r\n          of the warrant  affidavit that is claimed\r\n          to  be   false;   and  they   should   be\r\n          accompanied by a statement  of supporting\r\n          reasons.      Affidavits   or  sworn   or\r\n          otherwise    reliable    statements    of\r\n          witnesses should be  furnished, or  their\r\n          absence     satisfactorily     explained.\r\n          Allegations  of  negligence  or  innocent\r\n          mistake are insufficient.\r\n\nId.  at 154.    Davis's showing  of  falsity in  the  Lussier\r               \r\n\naffidavit  is based  on  (1) the  lack  of detail  about  the\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\ncircumstances  of  the  controlled  buy,  (2)  the  error  in\r\n\nLussier's account of Davis's \"approximate\" height  and weight\r\n\ncoupled with the  statement that the controlled  buyer gave a\r\n\n\"matching\"  description, and  (3)  the  assertedly  dishonest\r\n\nsubsequentpolice conduct.  As we explain, this is not enough.\r\n\n          While further detail about the controlled buy might\r\n\nhave  been desirable, the lack  of specificity about the date\r\n\nof  the  buy  or  the quantity  involved  is  not necessarily\r\n\nprobative of  falsity.  The  concern for keeping  the buyer's\r\n\nidentity confidential  is a  more likely explanation  for the\r\n\nlack of those details.  See  United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1005,  1008 (1st  Cir. 1993)  (district court  credited trial\r\n\ntestimony   that  it   was   \"customary   to  avoid   precise\r\n\nspecification of  the dates  of controlled  buys in  order to\r\n\nprotect the identity  of informants\").   Moreover,  Lussier's\r\n\naffidavit did describe the means by which he \"controlled\" the\r\n\nbuy (i.e., a prior search  of the confidential informant  and\r\n\npersonal observation of him before entering and after exiting\r\n\nDavis's apartment).  See  United States v. Rodgers,  732 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n625,  630-31 (8th Cir. 1984) (description of means of control\r\n\n\"tended to substantiate the fact that [defendant] was selling\r\n\ncocaine from his residence\").   We conclude that the  lack of\r\n\ndetail does not amount to  a \"substantial showing\" of falsity\r\n\nin the affidavit.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          As to Lussier's misstatement of  Davis's height and\r\n\nweight, Davis does  not allege that those data  were material\r\n\nto  the warrant  to  search the  apartment,  which need  only\r\n\ndescribe with particularity  the place to  be searched.   The\r                                                  \r\n\nargument, again,  is that the discrepancy  shows that Lussier\r\n\nlied about the controlled buy, without which there would have\r\n\nbeen no probable cause.  This ingenious argument, however, is\r\n\ntoo  thin  a  reed to  support  a  claim  of police  perjury.\r\n\nLussier's  affidavit  did  not   state  in  what  regard  the\r\n\ninformant's description \"matched\" Davis (height? weight? age?\r\n\nrace?   facial   characteristics?  hair   style?  mannerisms?\r\n\nclothing?   other   distinguishing   marks   or   features?).\r\n\nMoreover,   the  affidavit   only  stated   that  Davis   was\r\n\n\"approximately  5'8\"  145\" (in  fact  he  was 5'11\"  and  170\r\n\npounds).   The \"matching\" by the informant may have also been\r\n\nmerely an approximation.  Hence, because Lussier gave only an\r\n\n\"approximate\" description, and because we do not know in what\r\n\nsense or  how closely the buyer's  description \"matched\" that\r\n\napproximation,  there may  have been  no discrepancy  at all.\r\n\nAnd  to the extent  there was a  discrepancy, it  was just as\r\n\nlikely  a  negligent  or  innocent mistake  as  a  perjurious\r\n\nfabrication.  The inference  that Davis asks us to  draw from\r\n\nthis alleged discrepancy, that no controlled buy occurred, is\r\n\ntoo strained and too speculative.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          Davis's other allegations of  police untruthfulness\r\n\n(i.e., the  sixty-six  dollars inexplicably  left on  Davis's\r\n\nperson after  arrest, the  location of the  \"Coca-Cola\" bank,\r\n\nand the  money missing from Davis's mother's  bedroom) do not\r\n\nmake  a substantial showing, either.  It is not reasonable to\r\n\ninfer, from the fact that sixty-six dollars was left on Davis\r\n\nafter his arrest,  that the police  planted heroin on  Davis.\r\n\nThe  failure of the police to find the sixty-six dollars more\r\n\nlikely resulted  from inadvertency than from  a conspiracy to\r\n\nfalsely convict Davis.  And the  testimony of Davis's mother,\r\n\nniece,  and neighbor  about the  location of  the \"Coca-Cola\"\r\n\nbank and the  missing money does little  to substantiate that\r\n\nLussier  lied about the controlled buy, even if we ignore our\r\n\nconcerns about the potential bias of those affiants.\r\n\n          We do not blindly  assume the credibility of police\r\n\nofficers,  but Davis's  assertions  do not  persuade us  that\r\n\ncompetent trial counsel could have made a substantial showing\r\n\nthat  the warrant  affidavit  was  falsified  as  part  of  a\r\n\nperjurious  police conspiracy.   Absent  that  showing, Davis\r\n\nwould  not  have  received   a  Franks  hearing,6  let  alone\r                                                  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  We recognize  that when an affidavit  relies primarily on\r\ninformation provided by a confidential informant, a defendant\r\nwill  often  lack the  information  needed to  make  a Franks\r                                                                         \r\nshowing.  See United  States v. Higgins, 995  F.2d 1, 3  (1st\r                                                   \r\nCir. 1993).   In such  cases, where the  defendant challenges\r\nthe  accuracy of  the affidavit  but has  failed to  make the\r\n\"substantial  preliminary showing\"  required  by Franks,  the\r                                                                   \r\ncourt   may   conduct  an   in   camera   interview  of   the\r                                                   \r\nofficer-affiant, and,  if necessary,  of the informant.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nsuccessfully  surmounted  the  next  hurdle,  convincing  the\r\n\ndistrict court to suppress the evidence because of a perjured\r\n\naffidavit.   Thus, we  conclude that  there is  no reasonable\r\n\nprobability  that  the   search  evidence  could   have  been\r\n\nsuppressed, and no prejudice suffered by Davis.\r\n\n          2.  Convincing the Jury of Police Perjury\r                                                               \r\n\n          Davis's trial  counsel did attempt to  convince the\r\n\njury that the police  were lying about the evidence,  but the\r\n\njury  evidently  was not  persuaded.    Trial counsel  cross-\r\n\nexamined Lussier about the controlled buy and the discrepancy\r\n\nin  the description  in Davis's  height  and weight;  he also\r\n\ncross-examined  the  arresting  officer about  the  sixty-six\r\n\ndollars left on Davis's  person after his arrest.   He argued\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nUnited  States v.

A district  court is not\r                        \r\nrequired to do so, however; the decision whether an in camera\r                                                                         \r\nproceeding   is   needed   to   test   the  officer-affiant's\r\ncredibility  rests entirely  with  the district  court.   See\r                                                                         \r\nUnited  States v.

See\r                                                                         \r\nUnited  States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 62-63 (1st Cir. 1995);\r                                     \r\nHiggins, 995 F.2d at 3.\r                   \r\n          Moreover,  Davis  has  argued  neither  that  trial\r\ncounsel should have requested an in camera hearing,  nor that\r                                                      \r\nsuch  a proceeding would have  led to the  suppression of the\r\nsearch evidence.   And,  although a  \"confidential informant\"\r\nwas used to conduct the controlled buy, there was no reliance\r\non any information provided by the informant; rather, Lussier\r                              \r\npersonally  observed  that   the  informant  went   into  the\r\napartment without heroin and  came out with heroin.   That is\r\nenough for probable  cause to search the  apartment, based on\r\nthe officer's own perception.  Thus,  many of the credibility\r\nconcerns  that   arise  when  probable  cause   is  based  on\r\ninformation provided by a confidential source are not present\r\nin this case.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nto the jury that  these facts indicated that the  police were\r\n\nlying, and that the drugs were planted on Davis.7  It is true\r\n\nthat  trial  counsel did  not  present  testimony by  Davis's\r\n\nmother, sister,  or neighbor about the Coca-Cola  bank or the\r\n\nmoney  allegedly stolen  by  the searching  officers.   These\r\n\nallegations  do not,  of  course, directly  attack the  major\r\n\nevidence  against  Davis, but  if  believed  they could  have\r\n\nimpugned the credibility of  the officers involved in Davis's\r\n\ncase.  We are very  doubtful, though, that a jury would  have\r\n\nbeen persuaded by the testimony of Davis's mother, sister, or\r\n\nneighbor,  for the reasons alluded to earlier.  Suffice it to\r\n\nsay  that  we  see   no  reasonable  probability,  given  the\r\n\nextensive evidence  against Davis,  that the jury  would have\r\n\nacquitted Davis if trial counsel had presented the additional\r\n\nevidence  of alleged  police  perjury, had  made the  perjury\r\n\narguments more artfully,  and had not made the other supposed\r\n\nerrors that Davis  points to.   The evidence  was simply  too\r\n\nvoluminous and  compelling, while  the  argued inferences  of\r\n\npolice perjury were too speculative and tenuous.\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The trial court sustained the government's objection when\r\nDavis's counsel, in closing argument, stated \"I don't know if\r\nthey enjoyed planting drugs  on him.\"   However,  the overall\r\ntheme  of the defense closing argument  -- police perjury and\r\nfabrication of  evidence --  was nonetheless made  obvious to\r\nthe jury.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\n           For the foregoing  reasons, we conclude that  none\r\n\nof the  alleged errors  by counsel resulted  in prejudice  to\r\n\nDavis, given  the overwhelming record evidence  of his guilt.\r\n\nThe decision of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                  affirmed\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n",

Davis appeals the district court's denial of his motion for a new trial, which was based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.  Because we conclude that any deficiencies in counsel's performance did not result in prejudice to Davis, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early January 1994, Detective David Lussier, a Providence, Rhode Island, police officer specializing in narcotic cases, began investigating suspected heroin dealer Joseph Davis, a/k/a Joe Mills (\"Davis\").  The suspected trafficking was being conducted out of an apartment that Davis shared with his mother and niece.  Detective Lussier conducted sporadic surveillance of the apartment, stopping by at various times of the day and night for five to thirty minutes.  He frequently observed a black BMW automobile parked in front of the apartment, and on several occasions saw Davis park the BMW and thereafter use his keys to enter the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To confirm his suspicions, Detective Lussier successfully orchestrated a controlled buy of heroin from Davis at the apartment.  Lussier searched the buyer, a confidential informant, before he entered the apartment and then watched him enter, exit, and return directly to Lussier's car.  The informant then delivered a packet of heroin to Lussier, stating that it came from \"Joe.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the controlled buy to establish probable cause, Lussier obtained a warrant to search Davis's apartment.  On January 24, 1994, several Providence police officers executed the search warrant at Davis's apartment.  The police knocked on the door, and Davis's niece, the only one home at that time, admitted the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The apartment had two stories and a basement.  The bedrooms on the upper level were used by Davis's mother and niece.  The basement was divided into a laundry/storage area and a third bedroom, apparently used by Davis.  The police found numerous drug-related items in the basement bedroom area, including seventy-seven packets of heroin, twenty-three bags of marijuana, a coffee grinder used to mill heroin, a respiratory dust mask,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a stamp commonly used to mark heroin packets, and thousands of empty glassine packets.  The police also seized from the bedroom area $10,563 in cash ($3,663 in a bank shaped like a large Coca-Cola bottle and $6,900 in a \"Snickers\" box), two gold chains (also in the \"Snickers\" box), and a loaded .38 caliber revolver in a box on the second shelf of an entertainment center.  A number of found items established that the basement bedroom was Davis's (letters, a birthday card, a photograph album, a bill for pager service, etc.).  Detective Lussier called the pager number listed on the bill several times after the raid and before Davis's arrest.  Each time, Lussier, who had known Davis for four or five years, recognized the voice returning the page as that of Davis.  Moreover, the caller confirmed for Lussier that he was Joe Mills, another name used by Davis.  The police seized the BMW and found Davis's driver's license inside, which bore the address of the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Providence police officers arrested Davis on March 4, 1994, about six weeks after the search.  The arresting officers seized from Davis forty-two packets of heroin marked with the brand name \"Snake\" from the front pocket of the sweatshirt Davis was wearing.  They also seized a pager and $300 in cash.  At the police station, Davis gave the apartment as his residence address.  Detective Lussier subsequently interviewed Davis and told him that they had seized heroin from the apartment.  Davis responded (to the effect that) \"You only got 72 bags.\"   Lussier also told Davis they seized marijuana.  Again, Davis responded, \"You only got about 20 bags.\"   Finally, Lussier told Davis that the gun made the problem more serious.  Davis rejoined, \"The revolver wasn't hidden.  It was only a .38, just for protection.\"   Detective Lussier had not told Davis the quantity of the drugs seized or the caliber of the gun prior to Davis's admissions.  The arresting officer also turned the seized pager over to Detective Lussier.  Lussier dialed the number he had previously used to page Davis and keyed in a three-digit code.  The code appeared on the pager's display.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also undisputed (based on trial stipulations) that:  (1) Davis had been convicted of a felony prior to January 24, 1994, (2) the R.G. Industries .38 caliber revolver had traveled in and affected interstate commerce and it had been test-fired and worked, and (3) the packets seized from the apartment, the residue on the coffee grinder, and the packets seized from Davis's person all contained heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 17, 1994, a federal grand jury charged Joseph Davis with two counts of possession with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a) (Counts One and Four), one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) (Count Two), and one count of using a firearm during a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (Count Three).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On August 2, 1994, after a two-day jury trial at which Davis presented no witnesses or evidence, Davis was convicted on all four counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 1994, Davis filed a pro se motion for a new trial, alleging that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel.  The district court denied the motion.  Davis subsequently discharged his retained trial counsel, and new counsel was appointed by the court.  Davis's new counsel moved for reconsideration of the denial of the motion for a new trial.  The district court agreed to reconsider and heard arguments on the merits of the ineffective assistance claim.  The district court found both that trial counsel's performance was adequate and that, even if it had been deficient, Davis suffered no prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis appeals the district court's denial of his motion for a new trial, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Typically, the courts of appeal hear claims of ineffective assistance on collateral review, because such claims usually are not presented to and decided by the district court prior to the direct appeal.   See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 1839 (1994).  In this case, though, Davis had new counsel appointed after trial, and the ineffective assistance claim was briefed and argued to the district court, which determined that trial counsel's performance was neither deficient nor prejudicial.  Accordingly, \"the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the claim.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Trial Counsel's Alleged Deficiencies</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis propounds ten specific deficiencies in trial counsel's performance:  (1) failing to discuss with Davis, before trial, the evidence and important tactical decisions;  (2) failing to challenge the legality of the search of the apartment;  (3) failing to seek dismissal of the jury panel based on allegedly prejudicial statements by prospective jurors during jury selection;  (4) making an incoherent opening statement;  (5) making prejudicial statements about the defendant at trial;  (6) failing to object to inadmissible, prejudicial testimony about outstanding warrants for prior charges;  (7) conducting ineffective and damaging cross-examination;  (8) failing to call witnesses to challenge the credibility of government witnesses;  (9) failing to present a witness (Davis's mother) to explain the presence of the pistol;  and (10) failing to request a limiting instruction regarding Davis's prior convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully reviewed all of the alleged deficiencies in counsel's performance, as well as the evidence presented at trial.  Although Strickland 's \"prejudice prong\" is the basis for our decision, some comments on counsel's performance are in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel's performance could undoubtedly have been better;  in particular, he could have refrained from telling the jury that his client was a heroin dealer with a lengthy criminal record.  There was, however, some method in counsel's apparent madness.  That seemingly prejudicial statement was concededly part of a strategy to convince the jury that the police had framed Davis, both at the time of the search and upon his arrest, because he was a known convicted felon.  Counsel also argued and attempted to show through cross-examination that Davis had too much experience with the criminal justice system to make the damaging statements that the police claimed he made (e.g., \"You only got 72 bags\").  Trial counsel's statement that this was \"a prosecutor's dream case\" and therefore \"too good to be true\" was also part of the same strategy.  Counsel tried to convince the jury that the police had lied and planted the evidence found in the apartment and on Davis's person.  As further support for the claim that his client had been framed, counsel pointed to the fact that no fingerprints were found on the heroin-related items allegedly seized at the apartment.  While counsel's approach ultimately proved unsuccessful, we are hard pressed to think of an alternative trial strategy in light of the overwhelming evidence against Davis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, however, that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient, we ultimately find that there was no prejudice to Davis.  The evidence against Davis was so overwhelming that, as to nine of the ten alleged errors, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury would have acquitted Davis even without counsel's allegedly deficient performance.  The remaining error, the failure to move for suppression of the evidence resulting from the apartment search, cannot be dismissed on the basis of overwhelming evidence.  Thus, we will discuss that claim in some depth.  We also examine whether a constitutionally adequate trial lawyer could have convinced the jury that the police lied and fabricated evidence.  As to all the other asserted errors, there is no need to treat them individually--we find the evidence of Davis's guilt (if believed) to be so compelling that he utterly fails to satisfy the prejudice prong of  Strickland.  See 466 U.S. at 696 (\"[A] verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\");   see also United States v. Jackson, 918 F.2d 236, 243 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt negated any reasonable probability that error by counsel affected outcome of trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Davis points to a plethora of asserted deficiencies, he concedes that trial counsel's errors were non-prejudicial if one accepts the testimony of the four police officers about the seizures of heroin and a gun at the apartment, and the heroin on Davis's person upon arrest.  Boiled down to its essence, Davis's appeal is founded upon his claim of extensive police perjury, and an assertion that competent counsel could have either (1) suppressed the search evidence because of that perjury or (2) obtained a verdict of acquittal by convincing the jury that the police lied and fabricated essential evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our task is to assess Davis's showing of police perjury and evidence fabrication.  We first analyze, and reject, Davis's police perjury arguments in the context of a potential Fourth Amendment challenge to the apartment search.  We then use that analysis to conclude that there is no reasonable probability that, in the absence of these purported errors by counsel, a jury would have accepted the perjury arguments and acquitted Davis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Suppressing the Search Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis argues that the warrant to search the apartment was invalid because Detective Lussier lied about conducting the controlled buy.  First, Davis points out that Lussier's warrant affidavit contained little detail about the controlled buy or the informant;  in particular, the affidavit did not provide the date of the controlled buy or the amount of heroin or currency involved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Davis asserts that Lussier's warrant affidavit contained a logical inconsistency concerning Davis's physical description that suggests fabrication.  The affidavit stated that Davis was 5'8\"' tall and weighed 145 pounds, when in fact he was 5'\"' and 170 pounds.  The affidavit also stated that the informant, after completing the buy, \"provided me with a physical description matching Joe Davis\" (emphasis added).  Davis's argument is somewhat subtle:  if there had really been a controlled buyer who dealt with Davis, the buyer would have accurately described Davis, and that accurate description would not have \"matched\" Joe Davis in Lussier's mind, because Lussier was mistaken about Davis's actual height and weight.  Thus, Davis contends that Lussier fabricated both the confidential informant and the controlled buy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis also makes several other arguments about police perjury.  Although these arguments relate to events that occurred after Lussier filed the warrant affidavit, we address them here because Davis argues that the subsequent conduct of the police corroborates the falsity of the affidavit.  After Davis was arrested, the arresting officers seized the packets of heroin, the pager, and three hundred dollars.  About sixty-six dollars, however, was left in Davis's possession after the initial post-arrest search, apparently not discovered when the officers found the other items.  Davis argues that the officers would have found the sixty-six dollars if they had in fact searched Davis and found heroin and another wad of cash.  Therefore, Davis asserts, the arresting officers lied about finding heroin on Davis, and they fabricated the physical evidence presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis also contends that the police lied when they said that the \"Coca-Cola\" bank was found in Davis's basement bedroom, providing as support for that contention affidavits from Davis's mother, sister, and a neighbor stating that the bank belonged to the mother and was kept in her upstairs bedroom.  None of those three testified at trial.  Finally, Davis accuses the police of stealing nearly $500 from his mother's bedroom, based on his mother's affidavit that the money was missing after the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an ineffective assistance claim is grounded on a failure to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim, the defendant must prove \"that his Fourth Amendment claim is meritorious and that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent the excludable evidence.\"   Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 375 (1985).  We assume for the sake of argument that the verdict would have been different if the evidence resulting from the search was excluded, and we focus on whether an effective counsel could have successfully suppressed the evidence resulting from the apartment search on Fourth Amendment grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis argues that, had his counsel requested it, he would have been entitled to a  Franks hearing, the first step in seeking to suppress the evidence obtained in the search.  Under  Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978), a defendant may overcome the presumption of validity surrounding affidavits that support search warrants and obtain an evidentiary hearing, if he \"makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\"   Here, of course, the allegedly false statement is Detective Lussier's assertion that a controlled buy was conducted at Davis's apartment, which was the only basis for probable cause in the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, however, that Davis's allegations of perjury by Lussier do not amount to the \"substantial preliminary showing\" required for a Franks hearing.  The Supreme Court explained in Franks that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>To mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger's attack must be more than conclusory and must be supported by more than a desire to cross-examine.  There must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, and those allegations must be accompanied by an offer of proof.  They should point out specifically the portion of the warrant affidavit that is claimed to be false;  and they should be accompanied by a statement of supporting reasons.  Affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of witnesses should be furnished, or their absence satisfactorily explained.  Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 154.  Davis's showing of falsity in the Lussier affidavit is based on (1) the lack of detail about the circumstances of the controlled buy, (2) the error in Lussier's account of Davis's \"approximate\" height and weight coupled with the statement that the controlled buyer gave a \"matching\" description, and (3) the assertedly dishonest subsequent police conduct.  As we explain, this is not enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While further detail about the controlled buy might have been desirable, the lack of specificity about the date of the buy or the quantity involved is not necessarily probative of falsity.  The concern for keeping the buyer's identity confidential is a more likely explanation for the lack of those details.   See United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1008 (1st Cir.1993) (district court credited trial testimony that it was \"customary to avoid precise specification of the dates of controlled buys in order to protect the identity of informants\").  Moreover, Lussier's affidavit did describe the means by which he \"controlled\" the buy (i.e., a prior search of the confidential informant and personal observation of him before entering and after exiting Davis's apartment).   See United States v. Rodgers, 732 F.2d 625, 630-31 (8th Cir.1984) (description of means of control \"tended to substantiate the fact that [defendant] was selling cocaine from his residence\").  We conclude that the lack of detail does not amount to a \"substantial showing\" of falsity in the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Lussier's misstatement of Davis's height and weight, Davis does not allege that those data were material to the warrant to search the apartment, which need only describe with particularity the place to be searched.  The argument, again, is that the discrepancy shows that Lussier lied about the controlled buy, without which there would have been no probable cause.  This ingenious argument, however, is too thin a reed to support a claim of police perjury.  Lussier's affidavit did not state in what regard the informant's description \"matched\" Davis (height? weight? age? race? facial characteristics? hair style? mannerisms? clothing? other distinguishing marks or features?).  Moreover, the affidavit only stated that Davis was \"approximately 5'8\"' 145\" (in fact he was 5'11\"' and 170 pounds).  The \"matching\" by the informant may have also been merely an approximation.  Hence, because Lussier gave only an \"approximate\" description, and because we do not know in what sense or how closely the buyer's description \"matched\" that approximation, there may have been no discrepancy at all.  And to the extent there was a discrepancy, it was just as likely a negligent or innocent mistake as a perjurious fabrication.  The inference that Davis asks us to draw from this alleged discrepancy, that no controlled buy occurred, is too strained and too speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis's other allegations of police untruthfulness (i.e., the sixty-six dollars inexplicably left on Davis's person after arrest, the location of the \"Coca-Cola\" bank, and the money missing from Davis's mother's bedroom) do not make a substantial showing, either.  It is not reasonable to infer, from the fact that sixty-six dollars was left on Davis after his arrest, that the police planted heroin on Davis.  The failure of the police to find the sixty-six dollars more likely resulted from inadvertency than from a conspiracy to falsely convict Davis.  And the testimony of Davis's mother, niece, and neighbor about the location of the \"Coca-Cola\" bank and the missing money does little to substantiate that Lussier lied about the controlled buy, even if we ignore our concerns about the potential bias of those affiants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not blindly assume the credibility of police officers, but Davis's assertions do not persuade us that competent trial counsel could have made a substantial showing that the warrant affidavit was falsified as part of a perjurious police conspiracy.  Absent that showing, Davis would not have received a Franks hearing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> let alone successfully surmounted the next hurdle, convincing the district court to suppress the evidence because of a perjured affidavit.  Thus, we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that the search evidence could have been suppressed, and no prejudice suffered by Davis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Convincing the Jury of Police Perjury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis's trial counsel did attempt to convince the jury that the police were lying about the evidence, but the jury evidently was not persuaded.  Trial counsel cross-examined Lussier about the controlled buy and the discrepancy in the description in Davis's height and weight;  he also cross-examined the arresting officer about the sixty-six dollars left on Davis's person after his arrest.  He argued to the jury that these facts indicated that the police were lying, and that the drugs were planted on Davis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  It is true that trial counsel did not present testimony by Davis's mother, sister, or neighbor about the Coca-Cola bank or the money allegedly stolen by the searching officers.  These allegations do not, of course, directly attack the major evidence against Davis, but if believed they could have impugned the credibility of the officers involved in Davis's case.  We are very doubtful, though, that a jury would have been persuaded by the testimony of Davis's mother, sister, or neighbor, for the reasons alluded to earlier.  Suffice it to say that we see no reasonable probability, given the extensive evidence against Davis, that the jury would have acquitted Davis if trial counsel had presented the additional evidence of alleged police perjury, had made the perjury arguments more artfully, and had not made the other supposed errors that Davis points to.  The evidence was simply too voluminous and compelling, while the argued inferences of police perjury were too speculative and tenuous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that none of the alleged errors by counsel resulted in prejudice to Davis, given the overwhelming record evidence of his guilt.  The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> One of the officers who searched the apartment testified at trial that these masks are used by persons who process and package heroin in order to avoid inhalation of heroin dust</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Count Three was eventually dismissed, and Davis's ultimate sentence adjusted accordingly, in light of  Bailey v.

Strickland instructs that \"both the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact,\" 466 U.S. 668, 698 (1984), and, accordingly, this court has stated that \"we review these issues de novo,\"  Matthews v. Rakiey, 54 F.3d 908, 916 (1st Cir.1995).  Five months earlier, however, this court explained that before Strickland, \"we reviewed a district judge's determination as to competence only for clear error,\" but \"[s]ince Strickland, the standard of review may be more rigorous where the issue is not a matter of historical fact but of deciding how much competence is enough.\"   United States v. Raineri, 42 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir.1994);   cf.  United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 226 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993) (comparing alternative interpretations of Strickland 's impact on our standard of review)</p>\n        <p>Here, given the strength of the evidence against Davis, we focus on whether the alleged deficiencies in counsel's performance were prejudicial.  Our review is extensive, but we are not obliged to decide which standard of review obtains, because the result is the same under any standard.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The affidavit stated:</p>\n        <p>Within the last few days I contacted a confidential and reliable informant, this informant has in the past provided me with information that has resulted in successful narcotics arrest [sic], and narcotics seizures.  I spoke with this informant who agreed to make a controlled purchase from apartment F-8 in Wiggins Village.  I drove the informant into the area of the apartment and searched him/her for any contraband or currency.  After finding none I provided the informant with U.S. currency and sent him/her to the apartment.  I then watched as the informant knocked and went into the apartment.  After about 5 to 10 minutes the informant exited the same door and walked directly to my vehicle.  Once inside the informant handed me a sum of heroin, stating that it came from \"Joe.\"  The informant then provided me a physical description matching Joe Davis....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We recognize that when an affidavit relies primarily on information provided by a confidential informant, a defendant will often lack the information needed to make a Franks showing.   See United States v. Higgins, 995 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993).  In such cases, where the defendant challenges the accuracy of the affidavit but has failed to make the \"substantial preliminary showing\" required by Franks, the court may conduct an in camera interview of the officer-affiant, and, if necessary, of the informant.   See United States v. Southard, 700 F.2d 1, 10-11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 823 (1983).  A district court is not required to do so, however;  the decision whether an in camera proceeding is needed to test the officer-affiant's credibility rests entirely with the district court.   See United States v. Jackson, 918 F.2d 236, 241 (1st Cir.1990).  We review a district court's denial of a defendant's request for an in camera proceeding for abuse of discretion.   See United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 62-63 (1st Cir.1995);   Higgins, 995 F.2d at 3</p>\n        <p>Moreover, Davis has argued neither that trial counsel should have requested an in camera hearing, nor that such a proceeding would have led to the suppression of the search evidence.  And, although a \"confidential informant\" was used to conduct the controlled buy, there was no reliance on any information provided by the informant;  rather, Lussier personally observed that the informant went into the apartment without heroin and came out with heroin.  That is enough for probable cause to search the apartment, based on the officer's own perception.  Thus, many of the credibility concerns that arise when probable cause is based on information provided by a confidential source are not present in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The trial court sustained the government's objection when Davis's counsel, in closing argument, stated \"I don't know if they enjoyed planting drugs on him.\"   However, the overall theme of the defense closing argument--police perjury and fabrication of evidence--was nonetheless made obvious to the jury</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Davis appeals the district court's denial of his motion for a new trial, which was based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.  Because we conclude that any deficiencies in counsel's performance did not result in prejudice to Davis, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early January 1994, Detective David Lussier, a Providence, Rhode Island, police officer specializing in narcotic cases, began investigating suspected heroin dealer Joseph Davis, a/k/a Joe Mills (\"Davis\").  The suspected trafficking was being conducted out of an apartment that Davis shared with his mother and niece.  Detective Lussier conducted sporadic surveillance of the apartment, stopping by at various times of the day and night for five to thirty minutes.  He frequently observed a black BMW automobile parked in front of the apartment, and on several occasions saw Davis park the BMW and thereafter use his keys to enter the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To confirm his suspicions, Detective Lussier successfully orchestrated a controlled buy of heroin from Davis at the apartment.  Lussier searched the buyer, a confidential informant, before he entered the apartment and then watched him enter, exit, and return directly to Lussier's car.  The informant then delivered a packet of heroin to Lussier, stating that it came from \"Joe.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the controlled buy to establish probable cause, Lussier obtained a warrant to search Davis's apartment.  On January 24, 1994, several Providence police officers executed the search warrant at Davis's apartment.  The police knocked on the door, and Davis's niece, the only one home at that time, admitted the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The apartment had two stories and a basement.  The bedrooms on the upper level were used by Davis's mother and niece.  The basement was divided into a laundry/storage area and a third bedroom, apparently used by Davis.  The police found numerous drug-related items in the basement bedroom area, including seventy-seven packets of heroin, twenty-three bags of marijuana, a coffee grinder used to mill heroin, a respiratory dust mask,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a stamp commonly used to mark heroin packets, and thousands of empty glassine packets.  The police also seized from the bedroom area $10,563 in cash ($3,663 in a bank shaped like a large Coca-Cola bottle and $6,900 in a \"Snickers\" box), two gold chains (also in the \"Snickers\" box), and a loaded .38 caliber revolver in a box on the second shelf of an entertainment center.  A number of found items established that the basement bedroom was Davis's (letters, a birthday card, a photograph album, a bill for pager service, etc.).  Detective Lussier called the pager number listed on the bill several times after the raid and before Davis's arrest.  Each time, Lussier, who had known Davis for four or five years, recognized the voice returning the page as that of Davis.  Moreover, the caller confirmed for Lussier that he was Joe Mills, another name used by Davis.

The arresting officers seized from Davis forty-two packets of heroin marked with the brand name \"Snake\" from the front pocket of the sweatshirt Davis was wearing.  They also seized a pager and $300 in cash.  At the police station, Davis gave the apartment as his residence address.  Detective Lussier subsequently interviewed Davis and told him that they had seized heroin from the apartment.  Davis responded (to the effect that) \"You only got 72 bags.\"   Lussier also told Davis they seized marijuana.  Again, Davis responded, \"You only got about 20 bags.\"   Finally, Lussier told Davis that the gun made the problem more serious.  Davis rejoined, \"The revolver wasn't hidden.  It was only a .38, just for protection.\"   Detective Lussier had not told Davis the quantity of the drugs seized or the caliber of the gun prior to Davis's admissions.  The arresting officer also turned the seized pager over to Detective Lussier.  Lussier dialed the number he had previously used to page Davis and keyed in a three-digit code.  The code appeared on the pager's display.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also undisputed (based on trial stipulations) that:  (1) Davis had been convicted of a felony prior to January 24, 1994, (2) the R.G.

Davis's new counsel moved for reconsideration of the denial of the motion for a new trial.  The district court agreed to reconsider and heard arguments on the merits of the ineffective assistance claim.

Trial Counsel's Alleged Deficiencies</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis propounds ten specific deficiencies in trial counsel's performance:  (1) failing to discuss with Davis, before trial, the evidence and important tactical decisions;  (2) failing to challenge the legality of the search of the apartment;  (3) failing to seek dismissal of the jury panel based on allegedly prejudicial statements by prospective jurors during jury selection;  (4) making an incoherent opening statement;  (5) making prejudicial statements about the defendant at trial;  (6) failing to object to inadmissible, prejudicial testimony about outstanding warrants for prior charges;  (7) conducting ineffective and damaging cross-examination;  (8) failing to call witnesses to challenge the credibility of government witnesses;  (9) failing to present a witness (Davis's mother) to explain the presence of the pistol;  and (10) failing to request a limiting instruction regarding Davis's prior convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully reviewed all of the alleged deficiencies in counsel's performance, as well as the evidence presented at trial.  Although Strickland 's \"prejudice prong\" is the basis for our decision, some comments on counsel's performance are in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial counsel's performance could undoubtedly have been better;  in particular, he could have refrained from telling the jury that his client was a heroin dealer with a lengthy criminal record.  There was, however, some method in counsel's apparent madness.  That seemingly prejudicial statement was concededly part of a strategy to convince the jury that the police had framed Davis, both at the time of the search and upon his arrest, because he was a known convicted felon.  Counsel also argued and attempted to show through cross-examination that Davis had too much experience with the criminal justice system to make the damaging statements that the police claimed he made (e.g., \"You only got 72 bags\").  Trial counsel's statement that this was \"a prosecutor's dream case\" and therefore \"too good to be true\" was also part of the same strategy.  Counsel tried to convince the jury that the police had lied and planted the evidence found in the apartment and on Davis's person.  As further support for the claim that his client had been framed, counsel pointed to the fact that no fingerprints were found on the heroin-related items allegedly seized at the apartment.  While counsel's approach ultimately proved unsuccessful, we are hard pressed to think of an alternative trial strategy in light of the overwhelming evidence against Davis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, however, that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient, we ultimately find that there was no prejudice to Davis.  The evidence against Davis was so overwhelming that, as to nine of the ten alleged errors, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury would have acquitted Davis even without counsel's allegedly deficient performance.  The remaining error, the failure to move for suppression of the evidence resulting from the apartment search, cannot be dismissed on the basis of overwhelming evidence.  Thus, we will discuss that claim in some depth.  We also examine whether a constitutionally adequate trial lawyer could have convinced the jury that the police lied and fabricated evidence.  As to all the other asserted errors, there is no need to treat them individually--we find the evidence of Davis's guilt (if believed) to be so compelling that he utterly fails to satisfy the prejudice prong of  Strickland.  See 466 U.S. at 696 (\"[A] verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\");   see also United States v. Jackson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551271\"><a href=\"/opinion/551271/united-states-v-walter-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 243 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt negated any reasonable probability that error by counsel affected outcome of trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Davis points to a plethora of asserted deficiencies, he concedes that trial counsel's errors were non-prejudicial if one accepts the testimony of the four police officers about the seizures of heroin and a gun at the apartment, and the heroin on Davis's person upon arrest.  Boiled down to its essence, Davis's appeal is founded upon his claim of extensive police perjury, and an assertion that competent counsel could have either (1) suppressed the search evidence because of that perjury or (2) obtained a verdict of acquittal by convincing the jury that the police lied and fabricated essential evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our task is to assess Davis's showing of police perjury and evidence fabrication.  We first analyze, and reject, Davis's police perjury arguments in the context of a potential Fourth Amendment challenge to the apartment search.  We then use that analysis to conclude that there is no reasonable probability that, in the absence of these purported errors by counsel, a jury would have accepted the perjury arguments and acquitted Davis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Suppressing the Search Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis argues that the warrant to search the apartment was invalid because Detective Lussier lied about conducting the controlled buy.  First, Davis points out that Lussier's warrant affidavit contained little detail about the controlled buy or the informant;  in particular, the affidavit did not provide the date of the controlled buy or the amount of heroin or currency involved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Davis asserts that Lussier's warrant affidavit contained a logical inconsistency concerning Davis's physical description that suggests fabrication.  The affidavit stated that Davis was 5'8\"' tall and weighed 145 pounds, when in fact he was 5'\"' and 170 pounds.  The affidavit also stated that the informant, after completing the buy, \"provided me with a physical description matching Joe Davis\" (emphasis added).  Davis's argument is somewhat subtle:  if there had really been a controlled buyer who dealt with Davis, the buyer would have accurately described Davis, and that accurate description would not have \"matched\" Joe Davis in Lussier's mind, because Lussier was mistaken about Davis's actual height and weight.  Thus, Davis contends that Lussier fabricated both the confidential informant and the controlled buy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis also makes several other arguments about police perjury.  Although these arguments relate to events that occurred after Lussier filed the warrant affidavit, we address them here because Davis argues that the subsequent conduct of the police corroborates the falsity of the affidavit.  After Davis was arrested, the arresting officers seized the packets of heroin, the pager, and three hundred dollars.  About sixty-six dollars, however, was left in Davis's possession after the initial post-arrest search, apparently not discovered when the officers found the other items.  Davis argues that the officers would have found the sixty-six dollars if they had in fact searched Davis and found heroin and another wad of cash.  Therefore, Davis asserts, the arresting officers lied about finding heroin on Davis, and they fabricated the physical evidence presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis also contends that the police lied when they said that the \"Coca-Cola\" bank was found in Davis's basement bedroom, providing as support for that contention affidavits from Davis's mother, sister, and a neighbor stating that the bank belonged to the mother and was kept in her upstairs bedroom.  None of those three testified at trial.  Finally, Davis accuses the police of stealing nearly $500 from his mother's bedroom, based on his mother's affidavit that the money was missing after the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an ineffective assistance claim is grounded on a failure to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim, the defendant must prove \"that his Fourth Amendment claim is meritorious and that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent the excludable evidence.\"   Kimmelman v. Morrison, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></span>, 375 (1985).  We assume for the sake of argument that the verdict would have been different if the evidence resulting from the search was excluded, and we focus on whether an effective counsel could have successfully suppressed the evidence resulting from the apartment search on Fourth Amendment grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis argues that, had his counsel requested it, he would have been entitled to a  Franks hearing, the first step in seeking to suppress the evidence obtained in the search.  Under  Franks v. Delaware, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 155-56 (1978), a defendant may overcome the presumption of validity surrounding affidavits that support search warrants and obtain an evidentiary hearing, if he \"makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\"   Here, of course, the allegedly false statement is Detective Lussier's assertion that a controlled buy was conducted at Davis's apartment, which was the only basis for probable cause in the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, however, that Davis's allegations of perjury by Lussier do not amount to the \"substantial preliminary showing\" required for a Franks hearing.  The Supreme Court explained in Franks that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>To mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger's attack must be more than conclusory and must be supported by more than a desire to cross-examine.  There must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, and those allegations must be accompanied by an offer of proof.  They should point out specifically the portion of the warrant affidavit that is claimed to be false;  and they should be accompanied by a statement of supporting reasons.  Affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of witnesses should be furnished, or their absence satisfactorily explained.  Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 154.  Davis's showing of falsity in the Lussier affidavit is based on (1) the lack of detail about the circumstances of the controlled buy, (2) the error in Lussier's account of Davis's \"approximate\" height and weight coupled with the statement that the controlled buyer gave a \"matching\" description, and (3) the assertedly dishonest subsequent police conduct.  As we explain, this is not enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While further detail about the controlled buy might have been desirable, the lack of specificity about the date of the buy or the quantity involved is not necessarily probative of falsity.  The concern for keeping the buyer's identity confidential is a more likely explanation for the lack of those details.   See United States v. Carty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607110\"><a href=\"/opinion/607110/united-states-v-ralph-h-carty/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1008 (1st Cir.1993) (district court credited trial testimony that it was \"customary to avoid precise specification of the dates of controlled buys in order to protect the identity of informants\").  Moreover, Lussier's affidavit did describe the means by which he \"controlled\" the buy (i.e., a prior search of the confidential informant and personal observation of him before entering and after exiting Davis's apartment).   See United States v. Rodgers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434732\"><a href=\"/opinion/434732/united-states-v-steven-thomas-rodgers/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 630-31 (8th Cir.1984) (description of means of control \"tended to substantiate the fact that [defendant] was selling cocaine from his residence\").  We conclude that the lack of detail does not amount to a \"substantial showing\" of falsity in the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Lussier's misstatement of Davis's height and weight, Davis does not allege that those data were material to the warrant to search the apartment, which need only describe with particularity the place to be searched.  The argument, again, is that the discrepancy shows that Lussier lied about the controlled buy, without which there would have been no probable cause.  This ingenious argument, however, is too thin a reed to support a claim of police perjury.  Lussier's affidavit did not state in what regard the informant's description \"matched\" Davis (height? weight? age? race? facial characteristics? hair style? mannerisms? clothing? other distinguishing marks or features?).  Moreover, the affidavit only stated that Davis was \"approximately 5'8\"' 145\" (in fact he was 5'11\"' and 170 pounds).  The \"matching\" by the informant may have also been merely an approximation.  Hence, because Lussier gave only an \"approximate\" description, and because we do not know in what sense or how closely the buyer's description \"matched\" that approximation, there may have been no discrepancy at all.  And to the extent there was a discrepancy, it was just as likely a negligent or innocent mistake as a perjurious fabrication.  The inference that Davis asks us to draw from this alleged discrepancy, that no controlled buy occurred, is too strained and too speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis's other allegations of police untruthfulness (i.e., the sixty-six dollars inexplicably left on Davis's person after arrest, the location of the \"Coca-Cola\" bank, and the money missing from Davis's mother's bedroom) do not make a substantial showing, either.  It is not reasonable to infer, from the fact that sixty-six dollars was left on Davis after his arrest, that the police planted heroin on Davis.  The failure of the police to find the sixty-six dollars more likely resulted from inadvertency than from a conspiracy to falsely convict Davis.  And the testimony of Davis's mother, niece, and neighbor about the location of the \"Coca-Cola\" bank and the missing money does little to substantiate that Lussier lied about the controlled buy, even if we ignore our concerns about the potential bias of those affiants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not blindly assume the credibility of police officers, but Davis's assertions do not persuade us that competent trial counsel could have made a substantial showing that the warrant affidavit was falsified as part of a perjurious police conspiracy.  Absent that showing, Davis would not have received a Franks hearing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> let alone successfully surmounted the next hurdle, convincing the district court to suppress the evidence because of a perjured affidavit.  Thus, we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that the search evidence could have been suppressed, and no prejudice suffered by Davis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Convincing the Jury of Police Perjury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis's trial counsel did attempt to convince the jury that the police were lying about the evidence, but the jury evidently was not persuaded.  Trial counsel cross-examined Lussier about the controlled buy and the discrepancy in the description in Davis's height and weight;  he also cross-examined the arresting officer about the sixty-six dollars left on Davis's person after his arrest.  He argued to the jury that these facts indicated that the police were lying, and that the drugs were planted on Davis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  It is true that trial counsel did not present testimony by Davis's mother, sister, or neighbor about the Coca-Cola bank or the money allegedly stolen by the searching officers.  These allegations do not, of course, directly attack the major evidence against Davis, but if believed they could have impugned the credibility of the officers involved in Davis's case.  We are very doubtful, though, that a jury would have been persuaded by the testimony of Davis's mother, sister, or neighbor, for the reasons alluded to earlier.  Suffice it to say that we see no reasonable probability, given the extensive evidence against Davis, that the jury would have acquitted Davis if trial counsel had presented the additional evidence of alleged police perjury, had made the perjury arguments more artfully, and had not made the other supposed errors that Davis points to.  The evidence was simply too voluminous and compelling, while the argued inferences of police perjury were too speculative and tenuous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that none of the alleged errors by counsel resulted in prejudice to Davis, given the overwhelming record evidence of his guilt.

Five months earlier, however, this court explained that before Strickland, \"we reviewed a district judge's determination as to competence only for clear error,\" but \"[s]ince Strickland, the standard of review may be more rigorous where the issue is not a matter of historical fact but of deciding how much competence is enough.\"   United States v. Raineri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195774\"><a href=\"/opinion/195774/united-states-v-raineri/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1994);   cf.

Our review is extensive, but we are not obliged to decide which standard of review obtains, because the result is the same under any standard.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The affidavit stated:</p>\n        <p>Within the last few days I contacted a confidential and reliable informant, this informant has in the past provided me with information that has resulted in successful narcotics arrest [sic], and narcotics seizures.  I spoke with this informant who agreed to make a controlled purchase from apartment F-8 in Wiggins Village.  I drove the informant into the area of the apartment and searched him/her for any contraband or currency.  After finding none I provided the informant with U.S. currency and sent him/her to the apartment.  I then watched as the informant knocked and went into the apartment.  After about 5 to 10 minutes the informant exited the same door and walked directly to my vehicle.  Once inside the informant handed me a sum of heroin, stating that it came from \"Joe.\"  The informant then provided me a physical description matching Joe Davis....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We recognize that when an affidavit relies primarily on information provided by a confidential informant, a defendant will often lack the information needed to make a Franks showing.   See United States v. Higgins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608154\"><a href=\"/opinion/608154/united-states-v-raymond-lee-higgins/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1993).  In such cases, where the defendant challenges the accuracy of the affidavit but has failed to make the \"substantial preliminary showing\" required by Franks, the court may conduct an in camera interview of the officer-affiant, and, if necessary, of the informant.   See United States v. Southard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414332\"><a href=\"/opinion/414332/united-states-v-jack-southard-united-states-of-america-v-monsour-ferris/\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10-11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></span> (1983).  A district court is not required to do so, however;  the decision whether an in camera proceeding is needed to test the officer-affiant's credibility rests entirely with the district court.   See United States v. Jackson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551271\"><a href=\"/opinion/551271/united-states-v-walter-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 241 (1st Cir.1990).  We review a district court's denial of a defendant's request for an in camera proceeding for abuse of discretion.   See United States v. Valerio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195933\"><a href=\"/opinion/195933/united-states-v-valerio/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 62-63 (1st Cir.1995);   Higgins, 995 F.2d at 3</p>\n        <p>Moreover, Davis has argued neither that trial counsel should have requested an in camera hearing, nor that such a proceeding would have led to the suppression of the search evidence.  And, although a \"confidential informant\" was used to conduct the controlled buy, there was no reliance on any information provided by the informant;  rather, Lussier personally observed that the informant went into the apartment without heroin and came out with heroin.  That is enough for probable cause to search the apartment, based on the officer's own perception.  Thus, many of the credibility concerns that arise when probable cause is based on information provided by a confidential source are not present in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The trial court sustained the government's objection when Davis's counsel, in closing argument, stated \"I don't know if they enjoyed planting drugs on him.\"   However, the overall theme of the defense closing argument--police perjury and fabrication of evidence--was nonetheless made obvious to the jury</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
