This case presents a question this\n\ncourt previously reserved: what is the standard to be applied to a\n\ncriminal defendant's motion for a new trial where the claim is that the\n\nprosecution knowingly used perjured testimony.\n\n          Manuel González-González, convicted of drug conspiracy and\n\nmoney laundering offenses in Puerto Rico, sought a new trial based on\n\nwhat he asserts is newly discovered evidence that two government\n\nwitnesses recanted their testimony against him after his trial.\n\nGonzález says those two witnesses perjured themselves, and that the\n\nprosecution knew of at least one witness' perjury at the time. On this\n\npoint the trial judge made no finding as to whether there was perjury\n\nor, if so, whether the government knew about it. Instead, the trial\n\njudge held that defendant did not, in any event, meet a \"reasonable\n\nprobability of a different result\" standard, thus applying the standard\n\nused for claims of failure to disclose exculpatory evidence under Brady\n\nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). González also sought a new trial\n\nbased on the government's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence, and\n\nhe claims that the prosecution engaged in misconduct during his trial\n\nby misstating the extent of a government witness' cooperation. The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion.      We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          González was charged on November 2, 1994 with conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, possession\n\nwith intent to distribute marijuana, possession with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine, importation of marijuana and cocaine, and aiding\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fand abetting in the laundering of narcotics-related proceeds. After a\n\nnineteen-day jury trial, González was found guilty as charged and\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n          At González's trial, several of González's alleged co-\n\nconspirators testified about González's involvement in the drug and\n\nmoney laundering offenses charged, as did several cooperating witnesses\n\nand federal agents involved in the investigation. In addition, the\n\ngovernment introduced documentary evidence, such as tape recordings of\n\ntelephone conversations, travel records, and surveillance photographs\n\nto corroborate the testimonial evidence. We summarize the evidence\n\nthat was before the jury.\n\n          One of the government witnesses, Ricardo Rivero, testified\n\nthat in 1991 González recruited him to assist in retrieving and\n\nrepackaging 900 pounds of marijuana imported into Puerto Rico from\n\nColombia, and in transporting cocaine from Puerto Rico to New York.\n\nThe drugs were stored at the home of Manuel Garrido.       Luz Marina\n\nGiraldo, another witness cooperating with the government, corroborated\n\nRicardo's testimony, as did an FBI agent who arrested Garrido and found\n\nthe drugs.\n\n          Another of González's alleged recruits, Roberto Garraton-\n\nRivera, testified as a government witness that he had participated in\n\ndrug trafficking activities with González. Garraton described specific\n\noccasions on which he and other associates of González smuggled drugs\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fto New York at González's behest. Both Garraton and Ricardo testified\n\nthat they once called González to resolve a dispute they had over\n\nGarraton's payment for a shipment of drugs.\n\n          Several witnesses, including Ricardo and Giraldo, testified\n\nabout a large shipment of marijuana and cocaine that González imported\n\nfrom Colombia to Puerto Rico in 1992, which was buried in the sand at\n\na particular beach. Law enforcement officers testified that they\n\nseized a similar quantity of drugs in the same location as the one\n\ndescribed in Ricardo's and Giraldo's testimony. Ricardo and Roberto\n\nSierra Rivera, a paid government informant, also testified that they\n\nassisted González's organization in importing cocaine from Colombia to\n\nPuerto Rico in 1992. Both Ricardo and Sierra testified that they\n\ndelivered some of the shipment to New York, and returned to Puerto Rico\n\nwith the drug sale proceeds; they also testified that another\n\nparticipant was arrested on the return trip to Puerto Rico, which was\n\ncorroborated by the arresting officer. Sierra also testified about the\n\nactivities of González's drug trafficking enterprise during 1993. Law\n\nenforcement agents corroborated Sierra's testimony.\n\n          The government also provided evidence that González and his\n\nassociates laundered the proceeds from the drug sales through financial\n\ninstitutions in Puerto Rico, then sent the money to Colombia.        A\n\ncooperating government witness, Angel Santiago Mora, and an undercover\n\nFBI agent, Martin Suarez, testified about several instances when\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fGonzález and others in his organization delivered several hundred\n\nthousand dollars in cash to them to be laundered. In addition to the\n\ntestimony of Moran and Suarez, the government also produced audiotapes\n\nof González and his associates in which González made admissions about\n\nhis participation in drug trafficking and money laundering activities.\n\n          After he was convicted and we affirmed his conviction on\n\nappeal, see United States v. González-González, 136 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), González moved for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed. R. Crim. P.,\n\nbased on newly discovered evidence which, González claimed,\n\ndemonstrated that both Garraton and Giraldo had testified falsely\n\nagainst him at trial. In support of those claims, González offered\n\nsworn statements of two inmates attesting that they had overheard\n\nGiraldo recanting her trial testimony, and one inmate attesting that\n\nGarraton had recanted his testimony. González also claimed he was\n\nentitled to a new trial because the government knowingly permitted the\n\nintroduction of false testimony by Giraldo and pressured Giraldo to\n\ntestify falsely. In addition, González cited Brady violations and\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, claiming that the government failed to\n\ndisclose exculpatory evidence, including an FBI report of Giraldo's\n\ndebriefing, and also misled both González and the court about the\n\nstatus of Giraldo's cooperation with the government.\n\n          The district court denied González's motion, concluding that\n\nthere was no reasonable probability that the evidence in the affidavits\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fwould lead to González's acquittal upon retrial in light of the\n\nextensive evidence against González in addition to Giraldo and\n\nGarraton's testimony. The court also found that any Brady violations\n\nby the government did not compromise González's right to a fair trial\n\nbecause the undisclosed evidence was merely cumulative of evidence\n\nGonzález used at trial to impeach Giraldo's credibility.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We review for manifest abuse of discretion the district\n\ncourt's denial of González's motion for a new trial. United States v.\n\nAlicea, 205 F.3d 480, 486 (1st Cir. 2000).     The district court's\n\ninterpretation of legal standards is reviewed de novo. United States\n\nv. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 151 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          González brought his new trial motion under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n33, which allows the court to order a new trial \"if the interests of\n\njustice so require,\" and under a theory of alleged violations of Brady\n\nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), which requires the prosecution to\n\ndisclose material exculpatory evidence in its possession.\n\nA.   Standards for Motions for New Trial\n\n          Generally under Rule 33, a defendant who seeks a new trial\n\nbased on newly discovered evidence must show that: \"(1) the evidence\n\nwas unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial; (2)\n\nfailure to learn of the evidence was not due to lack of diligence by\n\nthe defendant; (3) the evidence is material, and not merely cumulative\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\for impeaching; and (4) it will probably result in an acquittal upon\n\nretrial of the defendant.\" United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017,\n\n1019 (1st Cir. 1980); see also Alicea, 205 F.3d at 487. A defendant's\n\nnew trial motion must be denied if he fails to meet any one of these\n\nfactors. United States v. Falu-Gonzalez, 205 F.3d 436, 442 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n          Different standards as to the third and fourth showings\n\ngovern the consideration of new trial motions depending on the grounds\n\nfor the motion. As we described in Josleyn, if the basis is that the\n\ngovernment has failed to disclose information required by Brady, then\n\nthe more defendant-friendly Kyles v. Whitley standard applies. See\n\nJoselyn, 206 F.3d at 151-52. Under the Kyles standard, the defendant\n\nmust show a \"reasonable probability\" that had the evidence been\n\ndisclosed to the defense the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent, and that, in turn, requires an analysis of whether the trial\n\nresulted, in the absence of such evidence, in a verdict worthy of\n\nconfidence. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995). If, however,\n\nthe motion is a routine Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered\n\nevidence that does not involve an alleged Brady violation, then the\n\nstandard is more onerous for defendants, and defendant must show the\n\nnew material evidence \"will probably result in an acquittal.\" Wright,\n\n625 F.2d at 1019. This means an \"actual probability that an acquittal\n\nwould have resulted if the evidence had been available.\" United States\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fv. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1216, 1220 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          A further application of these two basic standards -- the\n\nKyle \"verdict worthy of confidence\" standard and the Rule 33 \"actual\n\nprobability\" of acquittal standard -- was addressed in United States v.\n\nHuddleston, 194 F.3d 214 (1st Cir. 1999). The question there was what\n\nstandard to apply to a new trial motion which alleged that the\n\nprosecutor had unwittingly used perjured testimony. See 194 F.3d at\n\n221-22. Huddleston rejected earlier cases in this circuit suggesting\n\nthat in such a situation, it may be appropriate to apply a lower\n\nstandard, announced in Larrison v. United States, 24 F.2d 82 (7th Cir.\n\n1928), that a defendant need only show that the newly discovered\n\nevidence \"might\" produce a different result. See Larrison, 24 F.2d at\n\n87; see also United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).   Instead, Huddleston held that\n\n          when a defendant grounds a motion for a new trial\n          in a criminal case on a claim that he has newly\n          discovered perjury on the part of one or more\n          government witnesses, the conviction nonetheless\n          should stand unless the force of the newly\n          discovered event (i.e., the fact and nature of\n          the perjury) and the content of the corrected\n          testimony are such that an acquittal probably\n          would result upon retrial.\n\n194 F.3d 221 (emphasis added). Huddleston expressly reserved for\n\nanother day the question of the standard to be used as to claims of\n\nknowing or reckless use by the government of perjured testimony. See\n\nid.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          We resolve that question as, we believe, Supreme Court\n\nprecedent requires us to do. Although González does not categorize\n\nknowing use of perjured testimony as a Brady type error, we think it is\n\nsufficiently analogous that the Brady error rule should apply to claims\n\nof knowing use of perjured testimony.\n\n          The risk that a conviction was brought about by the\n\ngovernment's knowing use of perjury goes to the concerns about fairness\n\nof the trial that animated Kyle. Obtaining a conviction by presenting\n\ntestimony known to be perjured \"is inconsistent with the rudimentary\n\ndemands of justice.\" Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112 (1935);\n\naccord Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 153 (1972). In Napue v.\n\nIllinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959), a pre-Brady case, the Supreme Court said\n\na new trial is required if \"the false testimony could . . . in any\n\nreasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\" 360\n\nU.S. at 271.   The Supreme Court has several times referred to the\n\nprosecution's knowing use of perjured testimony as a category of Brady\n\nerror, see, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280-81 (1999);\n\nUnited States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103-04 (1976), while also\n\nrepeating the standard that \"a conviction . . . must be set aside if\n\nthere is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have\n\naffected the judgment of the jury,\" id. at 103. In United States v.\n\nBagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), the Court noted that this rule had earlier\n\nbeen stated as a branch of the harmless error test, but it may be as\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\feasily stated as a materiality standard. See 473 U.S. at 679. And\n\nrecent decisions about Brady errors which did not involve knowing use\n\nof perjured materials continue to recognize that such errors are\n\nproperly analyzed under Brady, employing the \"reasonable likelihood\" of\n\nacquittal standard. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 298-99 (Souter, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part); Kyles, 514 U.S. at 433 n.7\n\n(citing Agurs, 427 U.S. at 103).\n\n          In sum, a court's choice among the standards for analyzing\n\nnew trial motions depends upon the ground for the new trial motion.\n\nFirst, for the non-Brady Rule 33 motion where a defendant seeks a new\n\ntrial based on newly discovered evidence (other than evidence that an\n\nadverse witness testified falsely) the inquiry is whether that evidence\n\n(assuming it meets the first three prongs of the Wright test, see\n\nsupra) in actual probability would result in acquittal if a new trial\n\nwere granted.   That test is also used where a new trial motion is\n\npremised upon alleged new evidence that a conviction was obtained by\n\nperjured testimony when the government's use of that testimony was\n\nunwitting. In that situation, Huddleston requires the defendant to\n\nmeet the \"actual probability of acquittal\" standard.\n\n          The second category involves the different types of Brady\n\nviolation cases, where it is alleged that the government withheld\n\nexculpatory evidence. There, a defendant must show that there is a\n\n\"reasonable probability\" that the missing evidence would have changed\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe result. In contrast, the \"reasonable likelihood that the false\n\ntestimony could have affected the judgment of the jury\" standard\n\napplies where it is alleged that the government knowingly used perjured\n\ntestimony to obtain a defendant's conviction. Although the Supreme\n\nCourt has not described whether there is a difference between the\n\n\"reasonable likelihood\" and \"reasonable probability\" standards, we\n\nbelieve they are equivalent. In the end, both standards are concerned\n\nwith whether defendants received a fair trial resulting in a verdict\n\nworthy of confidence.     See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 298 (concurring\n\nopinion); see also Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1310 (1993)\n\n(defining \"likelihood\" as \"probability\"). As Strickler explains, not\n\nevery violation by prosecutors of their duty to pursue truth\n\n\"necessarily establishes that the outcome was unjust.\" 527 U.S. at\n\n281.\n\n             We turn to the merits of González's new trial motion.\n\nB.     The Alleged Perjured Testimony\n\n       1.   Testimony of Luz Marina Giraldo\n\n             As to Giraldo's testimony, González raises at least a\n\ncolorable claim that, if her testimony was perjured, then the\n\ngovernment presented testimony it knew to be perjured.1      González\n\n       1   A finding that there is a colorable claim the government\nknowingly used perjured testimony is the necessary predicate for asking\nwhether the Strickler/Kyle/Bagley standard applies. Here, the district\ncourt did not make an express finding about whether Giraldo's testimony\nwas perjured, and thus did not find whether the government's use of the\n\n                                 -11-\n\foffered the sworn statement of a co-inmate, Daniel Ortiz Medina, that\n\nMedina had overheard Giraldo telling González that the prosecutor had\n\npressured her to testify to details about González's involvement in\n\ndrug trafficking, even though that testimony was false, and that the\n\nprosecutor told Giraldo that she would receive twenty-five years in\n\nprison if she refused to so testify but would receive only a five year\n\nsentence if she cooperated. The matter of perjury is not a matter of\n\ninference. Rather, the material witness herself is reported to have\n\nsaid that she was pressured by the government to give false testimony.\n\nAn affidavit from a second inmate, Ernesto Padilla Almestica, recounted\n\nthe same conversation.\n\n          Because González makes a colorable claim that the government\n\nknowingly used perjured testimony by Giraldo, we apply the\n\nStrickler/Kyle/Bagley standard and ask whether there is any reasonable\n\nlikelihood or probability that the proffered evidence that Giraldo's\n\ntestimony was false could have affected the jury's judgment. We think\n\nnot. First, the evidence of perjury is itself weak; it depends on a)\n\nthe credibility of two convicted felons, and b) believing that Giraldo,\n\n\ntestimony, if perjured, was knowing. (We have been informed that\nGiraldo had been deported by the time of the new trial motion and was\nunavailable to the court.) Instead the court concluded that González\nfailed to show that there was a \"reasonable probability\" that Giraldo's\ntestimony would result in acquittal.        Thus, we cannot avoid the\nquestion. Cf. Josleyn, 206 F.3d at 155 n.11 (where the district court\nexpressly finds that a defendant has not shown the statements to be\nperjury, court need not further consider application of lower\nstandard).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fhaving to face González after he was convicted, was not simply making\n\nexcuses based on a fiction.\n\n          Second, the sheer volume of evidence of González's drug\n\ntrafficking and money laundering activities rules out any reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the jury's ultimate decision was affected by Giraldo's\n\ntestimony. This was not a close case. Several members of González's\n\norganization besides Giraldo testified about numerous occasions during\n\n1991 and 1994 on which González imported drugs from Colombia into\n\nPuerto Rico and directed the distribution of those drugs in Puerto Rico\n\nand New York. Numerous law enforcement agents corroborated specific\n\nevents of these drug importation and distribution activities.\n\nMoreover, González's guilt was supported by documentary evidence and\n\nout of his own mouth; there were tape recordings of González making\n\ninculpatory statements about his drug trafficking and money laundering\n\nactivities. We also note that Giraldo's alleged recantation indicates\n\nthat she lied about González's importation of cocaine, but that she\n\nwas, indeed, involved in González's marijuana trafficking activities;\n\nthus, the damage done by Giraldo's purportedly false testimony is\n\nlimited to the effect of her testimony about the extent of González's\n\nactivities, and does not put into doubt that González was in fact\n\ninvolved in drug trafficking.      Viewing the evidence as a whole\n\n(including the other Brady errors discussed later), there is no\n\nreasonable likelihood or probability that false testimony, if any, by\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fGiraldo caused the jury to reach an outcome that it might not otherwise\n\nhave reached.\n\n    2.   Testimony of Roberto Garraton\n\n          We analyze González's new trial motion based on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence of allegedly perjured testimony by Garraton under\n\nthe traditional Rule 33 \"probability of acquittal\" standard, as\n\nGonzález does not raise any colorable claim that the government knew\n\nGarraton's testimony to be false, assuming it was false. No inference\n\nof government knowledge of perjury arises from the mere fact of a\n\nconvict's hearsay report that a material witness recanted testimony.\n\n          The district court cited two infirmities in González's claim.\n\nFirst, the court \"viewed with considerable skepticism\" González's\n\nevidence of Garraton's recantations, which consisted of affidavits by\n\nan inmate to whom Garraton allegedly confessed his perjury. More\n\nimportant, the court doubted Garraton's recantation because his\n\ntestimony as to González's role in the drug trafficking conspiracy was\n\ncorroborated by other trial witnesses, including law enforcement\n\nofficers, and by documentary evidence.\n\n          The substantial amount of evidence supporting González's\n\nconviction described above, apart from the testimony of Garraton, means\n\nwe cannot say that the district court manifestly abused its discretion\n\nin denying González's motion for a new trial on the basis of evidence\n\nthat Garraton testified falsely at González's trial. The district\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fcourt has \"broad power to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility\n\nof both the witness who testified at trial and those whose testimony\n\nconstitutes 'new' evidence.\" United States v. Montilla-Rivera, 115\n\nF.3d 1060, 1067 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019).\n\n          González argues that the court, at least, should have held\n\na hearing on the question whether the witnesses' testimony was false.\n\nBut in similar circumstances, we have said that a hearing on post-\n\nconviction motions is not necessary where a defendant's claim is\n\n\"conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records\n\nof the case.\" United States v. Carbone, 880 F.2d 1500, 1502 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).2 Here, as the district court\n\nfound, ample evidence supports the jury's verdict, and so González has\n\nfailed to show that the alleged new evidence of perjury, under either\n\nstandard, warrants a new trial.\n\nC.   The Alleged Withholding of Evidence/Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n          González's alternative theory in support of his motion for\n\na new trial is that the government failed to disclose the extent of\n\nGiraldo's cooperation with prosecutors in a case in the Southern\n\n\n     2     We also note that González waited to file his motion until\none of the alleged perjurers was no longer within the reach of the\ncourt. It appears that the conversations reported were shortly after\nthe 1996 trial, but no motion was filed until June of 1999, three years\nafter trial. (This was also over a year after this court affirmed\nGonzález's conviction in his appeal from an earlier unsuccessful new\ntrial motion, which was based on, inter alia, faulty jury instructions.\nSee United States v. González-González, 136 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 1998)).\nGonzález is in a poor position to complain about a lack of a hearing.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fDistrict of Florida, violating its obligations under Brady to produce\n\nto defendants exculpatory and impeachment evidence in its possession.\n\nSee Brady, 373 U.S. at 87; see also Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676; Josleyn,\n\n206 F.3d at 151. González also charges the prosecution with misconduct\n\nbased on inaccurate statements made to the district court about\n\nGiraldo's cooperation.\n\n          The record in this case as to the government's conduct,\n\ndubious perjury allegations aside, is not exemplary. The district\n\ncourt had good reason for its assumption that the evidence withheld by\n\nthe government qualifies as Brady material. Secondly, as discussed\n\nbelow, the prosecutor was either careless or made a misrepresentation\n\nto the court.\n\n          Giraldo testified against González at his trial in February,\n\n1996. Giraldo had entered into a proffer immunity agreement with the\n\nSouthern District of Florida United States Attorney's Office on June\n\n29, 1995, as to her criminal conduct in Florida; she was debriefed on\n\nJune 30 and July 6, 1995, which debriefing the FBI summarized in a 302\n\nreport on July 8, 1995; and on August 22, 1996, Giraldo entered into a\n\ncooperation/plea agreement with the government. The government did not\n\ndisclose Giraldo's proffer agreement or the FBI report,3 evidence\n\n     3     Not only did the government fail to voluntarily produce the\ninformation to González, but also it did not produce the 302 report to\nthe district court (although it did, in a footnote to its reply, offer\nto produce it for in camera review). Instead, the government submitted\nan affidavit of an FBI agent stating that the report was limited to\n\n                                 -16-\n\fGonzález could have used in an effort to impeach Giraldo's testimony.\n\nUndisclosed impeachment evidence, \"if powerful enough, could constitute\n\ngrounds for a new trial.\" United States v. Dumas, 207 F.3d 11, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n          The question, then, is whether there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that the jury, had it known the true extent and earlier\n\ndate of Giraldo's cooperation with the government, would have reached\n\na different verdict. We think not. The jury knew that Giraldo was\n\ncooperating with authorities in Florida. As the district court found,\n\nGonzález \"thoroughly cross-examined [Giraldo] as to her cooperation\n\nwith the prosecutor's office in Miami\" and her credibility was\n\n\"impeached by questioning about her expectations of lenient treatment.\"\n\nUnited States v. González- González, 106 F. Supp. 2d 269, 275 (D.P.R.\n\n2000). Thus, the undisclosed evidence was cumulative. Although the\n\nFBI report should have been turned over to González, the fact that it\n\nwas not did not deprive him of a fair trial, \"understood as a trial\n\n\n\nGiraldo's debriefing relative to the Florida indictment. Inexplicably,\nthe government persisted in its contention that the report was not\nBrady/Giglio material, and at the time of oral argument before this\ncourt, still had refused to produce it to González, although the\ngovernment was unable to identify any reason why the report should not\nbe disclosed. It took an order from this court before the government\nturned the report over.      A criminal defendant is entitled to\nexculpatory evidence, including impeachment evidence, in the\ngovernment's possession, and is not expected to take the government at\nits word as to the materiality of that evidence.\n     Having viewed the report for ourselves, we are satisfied that\nGiraldo's debriefing was limited to the Florida investigation.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fresulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\" Strickler, 527 U.S. at\n\n290 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          That does not end our inquiry, however, as González also\n\nmakes a troubling charge of prosecutorial misconduct.         The same\n\ngovernment prosecutor who on June 30, 1995, had filed a motion\n\nnotifying the court of Giraldo's scheduled debriefing, told the court\n\non February 7, 1996, during González's trial, that Giraldo \"has not yet\n\nbeen debriefed [in the Florida case] as of yet to my knowledge.\" Yet\n\nat the time of this statement Giraldo had been debriefed some seven\n\nmonths earlier. Moreover, González claims that the same prosecutor\n\nfailed to correct Giraldo's inaccurate testimony about the timing and\n\nextent of her interactions with the government, which González says the\n\nprosecutor knew to be false.\n\n          González's complaint is not frivolous; the prosecution, at\n\nthe least, was careless.     But the remedy of a new trial is not\n\nnecessarily in order whenever a court finds misconduct.           \"The\n\ndetermination of whether prosecutorial misconduct has so poisoned the\n\nwell that a new trial is required involves the weighing of several\n\nfactors: (1) the severity of the misconduct; (2) the context in which\n\nit occurred; (3) whether the judge gave any curative instructions and\n\nthe likely effect of such instructions; and (4) the strength of the\n\nevidence against the defendant.\" United States v. Rodriguez-De Jesus,\n\n202 F.3d 482, 485 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fcitations omitted). Taking a \"balanced view of the evidence in the\n\nrecord,\" id., we think that the misinformation about the extent and\n\ntiming of Giraldo's cooperation, which at best would have provided\n\nfurther impeachment evidence, did not deprive González of a fair trial\n\ngiven the volume of evidence in support of his conviction.\n\n          The denial of González's motion for a new trial is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

This case presents a question this\n\ncourt previously reserved: what is the standard to be applied to a\n\ncriminal defendant's motion for a new trial where the claim is that the\n\nprosecution knowingly used perjured testimony.\n\n          Manuel González-González, convicted of drug conspiracy and\n\nmoney laundering offenses in Puerto Rico, sought a new trial based on\n\nwhat he asserts is newly discovered evidence that two government\n\nwitnesses recanted their testimony against him after his trial.\n\nGonzález says those two witnesses perjured themselves, and that the\n\nprosecution knew of at least one witness' perjury at the time. On this\n\npoint the trial judge made no finding as to whether there was perjury\n\nor, if so, whether the government knew about it. Instead, the trial\n\njudge held that defendant did not, in any event, meet a \"reasonable\n\nprobability of a different result\" standard, thus applying the standard\n\nused for claims of failure to disclose exculpatory evidence under Brady\n\nv. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963). González also sought a new trial\n\nbased on the government's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence, and\n\nhe claims that the prosecution engaged in misconduct during his trial\n\nby misstating the extent of a government witness' cooperation. The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion.      We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          González was charged on November 2, 1994 with conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, possession\n\nwith intent to distribute marijuana, possession with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine, importation of marijuana and cocaine, and aiding\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fand abetting in the laundering of narcotics-related proceeds. After a\n\nnineteen-day jury trial, González was found guilty as charged and\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n          At González's trial, several of González's alleged co-\n\nconspirators testified about González's involvement in the drug and\n\nmoney laundering offenses charged, as did several cooperating witnesses\n\nand federal agents involved in the investigation. In addition, the\n\ngovernment introduced documentary evidence, such as tape recordings of\n\ntelephone conversations, travel records, and surveillance photographs\n\nto corroborate the testimonial evidence. We summarize the evidence\n\nthat was before the jury.\n\n          One of the government witnesses, Ricardo Rivero, testified\n\nthat in 1991 González recruited him to assist in retrieving and\n\nrepackaging 900 pounds of marijuana imported into Puerto Rico from\n\nColombia, and in transporting cocaine from Puerto Rico to New York.\n\nThe drugs were stored at the home of Manuel Garrido.       Luz Marina\n\nGiraldo, another witness cooperating with the government, corroborated\n\nRicardo's testimony, as did an FBI agent who arrested Garrido and found\n\nthe drugs.\n\n          Another of González's alleged recruits, Roberto Garraton-\n\nRivera, testified as a government witness that he had participated in\n\ndrug trafficking activities with González. Garraton described specific\n\noccasions on which he and other associates of González smuggled drugs\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fto New York at González's behest. Both Garraton and Ricardo testified\n\nthat they once called González to resolve a dispute they had over\n\nGarraton's payment for a shipment of drugs.\n\n          Several witnesses, including Ricardo and Giraldo, testified\n\nabout a large shipment of marijuana and cocaine that González imported\n\nfrom Colombia to Puerto Rico in 1992, which was buried in the sand at\n\na particular beach. Law enforcement officers testified that they\n\nseized a similar quantity of drugs in the same location as the one\n\ndescribed in Ricardo's and Giraldo's testimony. Ricardo and Roberto\n\nSierra Rivera, a paid government informant, also testified that they\n\nassisted González's organization in importing cocaine from Colombia to\n\nPuerto Rico in 1992. Both Ricardo and Sierra testified that they\n\ndelivered some of the shipment to New York, and returned to Puerto Rico\n\nwith the drug sale proceeds; they also testified that another\n\nparticipant was arrested on the return trip to Puerto Rico, which was\n\ncorroborated by the arresting officer. Sierra also testified about the\n\nactivities of González's drug trafficking enterprise during 1993. Law\n\nenforcement agents corroborated Sierra's testimony.\n\n          The government also provided evidence that González and his\n\nassociates laundered the proceeds from the drug sales through financial\n\ninstitutions in Puerto Rico, then sent the money to Colombia.        A\n\ncooperating government witness, Angel Santiago Mora, and an undercover\n\nFBI agent, Martin Suarez, testified about several instances when\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fGonzález and others in his organization delivered several hundred\n\nthousand dollars in cash to them to be laundered. In addition to the\n\ntestimony of Moran and Suarez, the government also produced audiotapes\n\nof González and his associates in which González made admissions about\n\nhis participation in drug trafficking and money laundering activities.\n\n          After he was convicted and we affirmed his conviction on\n\nappeal, see United States v. González-González, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197783\"><a href=\"/opinion/197783/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\n\n1998), González moved for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed. R. Crim. P.,\n\nbased on newly discovered evidence which, González claimed,\n\ndemonstrated that both Garraton and Giraldo had testified falsely\n\nagainst him at trial. In support of those claims, González offered\n\nsworn statements of two inmates attesting that they had overheard\n\nGiraldo recanting her trial testimony, and one inmate attesting that\n\nGarraton had recanted his testimony. González also claimed he was\n\nentitled to a new trial because the government knowingly permitted the\n\nintroduction of false testimony by Giraldo and pressured Giraldo to\n\ntestify falsely. In addition, González cited Brady violations and\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, claiming that the government failed to\n\ndisclose exculpatory evidence, including an FBI report of Giraldo's\n\ndebriefing, and also misled both González and the court about the\n\nstatus of Giraldo's cooperation with the government.\n\n          The district court denied González's motion, concluding that\n\nthere was no reasonable probability that the evidence in the affidavits\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fwould lead to González's acquittal upon retrial in light of the\n\nextensive evidence against González in addition to Giraldo and\n\nGarraton's testimony. The court also found that any Brady violations\n\nby the government did not compromise González's right to a fair trial\n\nbecause the undisclosed evidence was merely cumulative of evidence\n\nGonzález used at trial to impeach Giraldo's credibility.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We review for manifest abuse of discretion the district\n\ncourt's denial of González's motion for a new trial.

Standards for Motions for New Trial\n\n          Generally under Rule 33, a defendant who seeks a new trial\n\nbased on newly discovered evidence must show that: \"(1) the evidence\n\nwas unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial; (2)\n\nfailure to learn of the evidence was not due to lack of diligence by\n\nthe defendant; (3) the evidence is material, and not merely cumulative\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\for impeaching; and (4) it will probably result in an acquittal upon\n\nretrial of the defendant.\" United States v.

As we described in Josleyn, if the basis is that the\n\ngovernment has failed to disclose information required by Brady, then\n\nthe more defendant-friendly Kyles v. Whitley standard applies. See\n\nJoselyn, 206 F.3d at 151-52. Under the Kyles standard, the defendant\n\nmust show a \"reasonable probability\" that had the evidence been\n\ndisclosed to the defense the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent, and that, in turn, requires an analysis of whether the trial\n\nresulted, in the absence of such evidence, in a verdict worthy of\n\nconfidence.

If, however,\n\nthe motion is a routine Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered\n\nevidence that does not involve an alleged Brady violation, then the\n\nstandard is more onerous for defendants, and defendant must show the\n\nnew material evidence \"will probably result in an acquittal.\" Wright,\n\n625 F.2d at 1019. This means an \"actual probability that an acquittal\n\nwould have resulted if the evidence had been available.\" United States\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fv.

The question there was what\n\nstandard to apply to a new trial motion which alleged that the\n\nprosecutor had unwittingly used perjured testimony. See 194 F.3d at\n\n221-22. Huddleston rejected earlier cases in this circuit suggesting\n\nthat in such a situation, it may be appropriate to apply a lower\n\nstandard, announced in Larrison v.

Although González does not categorize\n\nknowing use of perjured testimony as a Brady type error, we think it is\n\nsufficiently analogous that the Brady error rule should apply to claims\n\nof knowing use of perjured testimony.\n\n          The risk that a conviction was brought about by the\n\ngovernment's knowing use of perjury goes to the concerns about fairness\n\nof the trial that animated Kyle.

In United States v.\n\nBagley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), the Court noted that this rule had earlier\n\nbeen stated as a branch of the harmless error test, but it may be as\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\feasily stated as a materiality standard. See 473 U.S. at 679. And\n\nrecent decisions about Brady errors which did not involve knowing use\n\nof perjured materials continue to recognize that such errors are\n\nproperly analyzed under Brady, employing the \"reasonable likelihood\" of\n\nacquittal standard. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 298-99 (Souter, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part); Kyles, 514 U.S. at 433 n.7\n\n(citing Agurs, 427 U.S. at 103).\n\n          In sum, a court's choice among the standards for analyzing\n\nnew trial motions depends upon the ground for the new trial motion.\n\nFirst, for the non-Brady Rule 33 motion where a defendant seeks a new\n\ntrial based on newly discovered evidence (other than evidence that an\n\nadverse witness testified falsely) the inquiry is whether that evidence\n\n(assuming it meets the first three prongs of the Wright test, see\n\nsupra) in actual probability would result in acquittal if a new trial\n\nwere granted.   That test is also used where a new trial motion is\n\npremised upon alleged new evidence that a conviction was obtained by\n\nperjured testimony when the government's use of that testimony was\n\nunwitting. In that situation, Huddleston requires the defendant to\n\nmeet the \"actual probability of acquittal\" standard.\n\n          The second category involves the different types of Brady\n\nviolation cases, where it is alleged that the government withheld\n\nexculpatory evidence. There, a defendant must show that there is a\n\n\"reasonable probability\" that the missing evidence would have changed\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe result. In contrast, the \"reasonable likelihood that the false\n\ntestimony could have affected the judgment of the jury\" standard\n\napplies where it is alleged that the government knowingly used perjured\n\ntestimony to obtain a defendant's conviction. Although the Supreme\n\nCourt has not described whether there is a difference between the\n\n\"reasonable likelihood\" and \"reasonable probability\" standards, we\n\nbelieve they are equivalent. In the end, both standards are concerned\n\nwith whether defendants received a fair trial resulting in a verdict\n\nworthy of confidence.     See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 298 (concurring\n\nopinion); see also Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1310 (1993)\n\n(defining \"likelihood\" as \"probability\"). As Strickler explains, not\n\nevery violation by prosecutors of their duty to pursue truth\n\n\"necessarily establishes that the outcome was unjust.\" 527 U.S. at\n\n281.\n\n             We turn to the merits of González's new trial motion.\n\nB.     The Alleged Perjured Testimony\n\n       1.   Testimony of Luz Marina Giraldo\n\n             As to Giraldo's testimony, González raises at least a\n\ncolorable claim that, if her testimony was perjured, then the\n\ngovernment presented testimony it knew to be perjured.1      González\n\n       1   A finding that there is a colorable claim the government\nknowingly used perjured testimony is the necessary predicate for asking\nwhether the Strickler/Kyle/Bagley standard applies. Here, the district\ncourt did not make an express finding about whether Giraldo's testimony\nwas perjured, and thus did not find whether the government's use of the\n\n                                 -11-\n\foffered the sworn statement of a co-inmate, Daniel Ortiz Medina, that\n\nMedina had overheard Giraldo telling González that the prosecutor had\n\npressured her to testify to details about González's involvement in\n\ndrug trafficking, even though that testimony was false, and that the\n\nprosecutor told Giraldo that she would receive twenty-five years in\n\nprison if she refused to so testify but would receive only a five year\n\nsentence if she cooperated. The matter of perjury is not a matter of\n\ninference. Rather, the material witness herself is reported to have\n\nsaid that she was pressured by the government to give false testimony.\n\nAn affidavit from a second inmate, Ernesto Padilla Almestica, recounted\n\nthe same conversation.\n\n          Because González makes a colorable claim that the government\n\nknowingly used perjured testimony by Giraldo, we apply the\n\nStrickler/Kyle/Bagley standard and ask whether there is any reasonable\n\nlikelihood or probability that the proffered evidence that Giraldo's\n\ntestimony was false could have affected the jury's judgment. We think\n\nnot. First, the evidence of perjury is itself weak; it depends on a)\n\nthe credibility of two convicted felons, and b) believing that Giraldo,\n\n\ntestimony, if perjured, was knowing. (We have been informed that\nGiraldo had been deported by the time of the new trial motion and was\nunavailable to the court.) Instead the court concluded that González\nfailed to show that there was a \"reasonable probability\" that Giraldo's\ntestimony would result in acquittal.        Thus, we cannot avoid the\nquestion. Cf. Josleyn, 206 F.3d at 155 n.11 (where the district court\nexpressly finds that a defendant has not shown the statements to be\nperjury, court need not further consider application of lower\nstandard).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fhaving to face González after he was convicted, was not simply making\n\nexcuses based on a fiction.\n\n          Second, the sheer volume of evidence of González's drug\n\ntrafficking and money laundering activities rules out any reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the jury's ultimate decision was affected by Giraldo's\n\ntestimony. This was not a close case. Several members of González's\n\norganization besides Giraldo testified about numerous occasions during\n\n1991 and 1994 on which González imported drugs from Colombia into\n\nPuerto Rico and directed the distribution of those drugs in Puerto Rico\n\nand New York. Numerous law enforcement agents corroborated specific\n\nevents of these drug importation and distribution activities.\n\nMoreover, González's guilt was supported by documentary evidence and\n\nout of his own mouth; there were tape recordings of González making\n\ninculpatory statements about his drug trafficking and money laundering\n\nactivities. We also note that Giraldo's alleged recantation indicates\n\nthat she lied about González's importation of cocaine, but that she\n\nwas, indeed, involved in González's marijuana trafficking activities;\n\nthus, the damage done by Giraldo's purportedly false testimony is\n\nlimited to the effect of her testimony about the extent of González's\n\nactivities, and does not put into doubt that González was in fact\n\ninvolved in drug trafficking.      Viewing the evidence as a whole\n\n(including the other Brady errors discussed later), there is no\n\nreasonable likelihood or probability that false testimony, if any, by\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fGiraldo caused the jury to reach an outcome that it might not otherwise\n\nhave reached.\n\n    2.   Testimony of Roberto Garraton\n\n          We analyze González's new trial motion based on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence of allegedly perjured testimony by Garraton under\n\nthe traditional Rule 33 \"probability of acquittal\" standard, as\n\nGonzález does not raise any colorable claim that the government knew\n\nGarraton's testimony to be false, assuming it was false. No inference\n\nof government knowledge of perjury arises from the mere fact of a\n\nconvict's hearsay report that a material witness recanted testimony.\n\n          The district court cited two infirmities in González's claim.\n\nFirst, the court \"viewed with considerable skepticism\" González's\n\nevidence of Garraton's recantations, which consisted of affidavits by\n\nan inmate to whom Garraton allegedly confessed his perjury. More\n\nimportant, the court doubted Garraton's recantation because his\n\ntestimony as to González's role in the drug trafficking conspiracy was\n\ncorroborated by other trial witnesses, including law enforcement\n\nofficers, and by documentary evidence.\n\n          The substantial amount of evidence supporting González's\n\nconviction described above, apart from the testimony of Garraton, means\n\nwe cannot say that the district court manifestly abused its discretion\n\nin denying González's motion for a new trial on the basis of evidence\n\nthat Garraton testified falsely at González's trial. The district\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fcourt has \"broad power to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility\n\nof both the witness who testified at trial and those whose testimony\n\nconstitutes 'new' evidence.\" United States v. Montilla-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197423\"><a href=\"/opinion/197423/united-states-v-montilla-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1067 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019).\n\n          González argues that the court, at least, should have held\n\na hearing on the question whether the witnesses' testimony was false.\n\nBut in similar circumstances, we have said that a hearing on post-\n\nconviction motions is not necessary where a defendant's claim is\n\n\"conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records\n\nof the case.\" United States v. Carbone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526971\"><a href=\"/opinion/526971/united-states-v-luis-carbone/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1502 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).2 Here, as the district court\n\nfound, ample evidence supports the jury's verdict, and so González has\n\nfailed to show that the alleged new evidence of perjury, under either\n\nstandard, warrants a new trial.\n\nC.   The Alleged Withholding of Evidence/Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n          González's alternative theory in support of his motion for\n\na new trial is that the government failed to disclose the extent of\n\nGiraldo's cooperation with prosecutors in a case in the Southern\n\n\n     2     We also note that González waited to file his motion until\none of the alleged perjurers was no longer within the reach of the\ncourt. It appears that the conversations reported were shortly after\nthe 1996 trial, but no motion was filed until June of 1999, three years\nafter trial. (This was also over a year after this court affirmed\nGonzález's conviction in his appeal from an earlier unsuccessful new\ntrial motion, which was based on, inter alia, faulty jury instructions.\nSee United States v. González-González, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197783\"><a href=\"/opinion/197783/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1998)).\nGonzález is in a poor position to complain about a lack of a hearing.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fDistrict of Florida, violating its obligations under Brady to produce\n\nto defendants exculpatory and impeachment evidence in its possession.\n\nSee Brady, 373 U.S. at 87; see also Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676; Josleyn,\n\n206 F.3d at 151. González also charges the prosecution with misconduct\n\nbased on inaccurate statements made to the district court about\n\nGiraldo's cooperation.\n\n          The record in this case as to the government's conduct,\n\ndubious perjury allegations aside, is not exemplary. The district\n\ncourt had good reason for its assumption that the evidence withheld by\n\nthe government qualifies as Brady material. Secondly, as discussed\n\nbelow, the prosecutor was either careless or made a misrepresentation\n\nto the court.\n\n          Giraldo testified against González at his trial in February,\n\n1996. Giraldo had entered into a proffer immunity agreement with the\n\nSouthern District of Florida United States Attorney's Office on June\n\n29, 1995, as to her criminal conduct in Florida; she was debriefed on\n\nJune 30 and July 6, 1995, which debriefing the FBI summarized in a 302\n\nreport on July 8, 1995; and on August 22, 1996, Giraldo entered into a\n\ncooperation/plea agreement with the government. The government did not\n\ndisclose Giraldo's proffer agreement or the FBI report,3 evidence\n\n     3     Not only did the government fail to voluntarily produce the\ninformation to González, but also it did not produce the 302 report to\nthe district court (although it did, in a footnote to its reply, offer\nto produce it for in camera review). Instead, the government submitted\nan affidavit of an FBI agent stating that the report was limited to\n\n                                 -16-\n\fGonzález could have used in an effort to impeach Giraldo's testimony.\n\nUndisclosed impeachment evidence, \"if powerful enough, could constitute\n\ngrounds for a new trial.\" United States v. Dumas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198855\"><a href=\"/opinion/198855/united-states-v-dumas/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n          The question, then, is whether there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that the jury, had it known the true extent and earlier\n\ndate of Giraldo's cooperation with the government, would have reached\n\na different verdict. We think not. The jury knew that Giraldo was\n\ncooperating with authorities in Florida. As the district court found,\n\nGonzález \"thoroughly cross-examined [Giraldo] as to her cooperation\n\nwith the prosecutor's office in Miami\" and her credibility was\n\n\"impeached by questioning about her expectations of lenient treatment.\"\n\nUnited States v. González- González, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510704\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510704/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275 (D.P.R.\n\n2000). Thus, the undisclosed evidence was cumulative. Although the\n\nFBI report should have been turned over to González, the fact that it\n\nwas not did not deprive him of a fair trial, \"understood as a trial\n\n\n\nGiraldo's debriefing relative to the Florida indictment. Inexplicably,\nthe government persisted in its contention that the report was not\nBrady/Giglio material, and at the time of oral argument before this\ncourt, still had refused to produce it to González, although the\ngovernment was unable to identify any reason why the report should not\nbe disclosed. It took an order from this court before the government\nturned the report over.      A criminal defendant is entitled to\nexculpatory evidence, including impeachment evidence, in the\ngovernment's possession, and is not expected to take the government at\nits word as to the materiality of that evidence.\n     Having viewed the report for ourselves, we are satisfied that\nGiraldo's debriefing was limited to the Florida investigation.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fresulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\" Strickler, 527 U.S. at\n\n290 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          That does not end our inquiry, however, as González also\n\nmakes a troubling charge of prosecutorial misconduct.         The same\n\ngovernment prosecutor who on June 30, 1995, had filed a motion\n\nnotifying the court of Giraldo's scheduled debriefing, told the court\n\non February 7, 1996, during González's trial, that Giraldo \"has not yet\n\nbeen debriefed [in the Florida case] as of yet to my knowledge.\" Yet\n\nat the time of this statement Giraldo had been debriefed some seven\n\nmonths earlier. Moreover, González claims that the same prosecutor\n\nfailed to correct Giraldo's inaccurate testimony about the timing and\n\nextent of her interactions with the government, which González says the\n\nprosecutor knew to be false.\n\n          González's complaint is not frivolous; the prosecution, at\n\nthe least, was careless.     But the remedy of a new trial is not\n\nnecessarily in order whenever a court finds misconduct.           \"The\n\ndetermination of whether prosecutorial misconduct has so poisoned the\n\nwell that a new trial is required involves the weighing of several\n\nfactors: (1) the severity of the misconduct; (2) the context in which\n\nit occurred; (3) whether the judge gave any curative instructions and\n\nthe likely effect of such instructions; and (4) the strength of the\n\nevidence against the defendant.\" United States v. Rodriguez-De Jesus,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767483\"><a href=\"/opinion/767483/united-states-v-ruben-rodriguez-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fcitations omitted). Taking a \"balanced view of the evidence in the\n\nrecord,\" id., we think that the misinformation about the extent and\n\ntiming of Giraldo's cooperation, which at best would have provided\n\nfurther impeachment evidence, did not deprive González of a fair trial\n\ngiven the volume of evidence in support of his conviction.\n\n          The denial of González's motion for a new trial is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f</pre>",
