Upon  careful  review of  the  briefs and\r                            \r\n\nrecord,  we conclude  that  this appeal  clearly presents  no\r\n\nsubstantial   question  and   that  summary   disposition  is\r\n\nappropriate.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.  \r                             \r\n\n     We further conclude that, for  the reasons stated in the\r\n\nMay  8, 1996,  order,  the district  court  acted within  its\r\n\ndiscretion   in     entering   default   against   defendant.\r\n\nDefendant's repeated failures  to comply  with discovery  and\r\n\nother orders justified that  sanction, of which defendant had\r\n\nbeen warned.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).  \r                             \r\n\n     Further, for the reasons stated in the opinion and order\r\n\ndated  June  7, 1996,  Pages v.  Feingold,  928 F.  Supp. 148\r                                                     \r\n\n(D.P.R. 1996),  the district court properly  entered judgment\r\n\nfor  plaintiff.    The  district court's  findings  that  the\r\n\nletters  written  by  defendant  were false  and  maliciously\r\n\npublished, that plaintiff suffered damages thereby,  and that\r\n\nplaintiff was a private figure,  were amply supported by  the\r\n\nevidence  presented at  trial and consistent  with applicable\r\n\nPuerto Rico law as cited by the district court.  And, we find\r\n\nno  factual or  legal basis  for  defendant's assertion  of a\r\n\nqualified  immunity defense,  particularly  in  light of  the\r\n\ndefault.\r\n\n     The  district  court did  not  abuse  its discretion  in\r\n\ndenying defendant's  motion to  recuse.  The  various remarks\r\n\nabout which  defendant complains  do not create  a reasonable\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndoubt  concerning  the district  judge's  impartiality.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

In  light of  the numerous\r                                           \r\n\nviolations  of the  appellate  rules regarding  the form  and\r\n\ncontent of the brief  and appendix, we are persuaded  that an\r\n\naward of sanctions is appropriate.  See Fed. R. App.  P. 28 &amp;\r                                                   \r\n\n30;  Reyes-Garcia v.
