The former Chief\r                                                    \r\n\nof  Police and the City of Warwick, Rhode Island, appeal from\r\n\na  judgment against them in the district court entered on the\r\n\njury's  verdict  in  favor  of  a  Warwick  police  officer.1\r\n\nPlaintiff  had  alleged, inter  alia,  that  she was  treated\r                                                \r\n\ndisparately because of her gender and that her constitutional\r\n\nright  to procedural due process  was violated when the Chief\r\n\nsuspended her without holding a hearing as  required by state\r\n\nlaw.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          We state the  facts in the light most  favorable to\r\n\nthe verdict.  See Ferragamo v. Chubb Life Ins. Co. of Am., 94\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 26, 27 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n          Plaintiff, Lori  Ann Molloy,  a police  officer for\r\n\nthe  City of Warwick, Rhode Island, was suspended by Chief of\r\n\nPolice Wesley  Blanchard, on  June 3,  1994.  The  suspension\r\n\nresulted from  her ostensible  refusal to cooperate  with the\r\n\nstate  police in  their  investigation of  a triple  homicide\r\n\ninvolving Robert Sabetta, a  police officer from the  Town of\r\n\nFoster, Rhode Island.  \r\n\n          Before Molloy joined  the Warwick police department\r\n\nin 1991, she and Sabetta were in the same class at the police\r\n\nacademy.  After the police academy, Molloy had little contact\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Cf. Molloy v. Blanchard, 907 F. Supp. 46 (D.R.I. 1995)\r                                       \r\n(granting in part and denying in part the defendants' motion\r\nfor summary judgment).\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nwith Sabetta until 1993.   In February 1993, Molloy  spent an\r\n\nevening socializing  with  Sabetta and  Paula Duffy,  another\r\n\npolice academy  classmate and  a police officer  in Cranston,\r\n\nRhode Island.  During that evening, Sabetta showed Molloy and\r\n\nDuffy  his personal  firearm,  a semiautomatic  with a  laser\r\n\nsight.\r\n\n          Molloy  saw Sabetta  again approximately  two weeks\r\n\nlater.  Duffy,  with Sabetta  in the car,  drove to  Molloy's\r\n\nhome to  show Molloy her new Jeep.  The  three then went to a\r\n\nnearby  restaurant  for pizza  and  beer.   During  the meal,\r\n\nSabetta complained  about his suspension for  improper use of\r\n\nforce.  He commented  that perhaps he should have  killed, or\r\n\nshould kill, the people whose complaints had resulted in  his\r\n\nsuspension.\r\n\n          On April  13, 1993,  Sabetta shot and  killed three\r\n\nteenage  boys and injured a  fourth.  Among  the victims were\r\n\npersons who had filed brutality complaints against  him.  The\r\n\ninjured  victim identified  Sabetta as  the shooter.   Molloy\r\n\nlearned about  the murders  and Sabetta's involvement  during\r\n\nher  midnight to 8:00  a.m. shift on April  14, 1993.  Molloy\r\n\ntold her sergeant about  knowing Sabetta from having attended\r\n\nthe police academy with him.  \r\n\n          Later that morning, Duffy contacted Molloy, worried\r\n\nthat  Sabetta  might  come  to  Duffy's  home.   At  Molloy's\r\n\nsuggestion, Duffy arranged to spend the night at the house of\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nher friend  Suzanne Jardine, also a  Cranston police officer.\r\n\nMolloy stopped by  Jardine's home after her duty  shift. When\r\n\nthe Sabetta  matter was  broached, Duffy stated  that talking\r\n\nabout the  shootings upset her too much  and that she did not\r\n\nwant to discuss them further.  Molloy acceded to her request.\r\n\n          During their investigation,  the Rhode Island state\r\n\npolice  contacted Molloy in June 1993 to ask her some general\r\n\nquestions  about  Sabetta.   Molloy  did  not volunteer  that\r\n\nSabetta  had said either he should have killed or should kill\r\n\nthe people who had  filed a brutality complaint  against him,\r\n\nnor   did  she   mention   knowing  that   Sabetta  owned   a\r\n\nsemiautomatic with a laser sight.  The murder weapon had been\r\n\nSabetta's service revolver, not a semiautomatic.\r\n\n          After the Sabetta murder  trial began the following\r\n\nsummer,  the  state  police  received   an  anonymous  letter\r\n\nclaiming  that a  Warwick  police dispatcher  and a  Cranston\r\n\npolice  officer possessed  information relevant  to Sabetta's\r\n\nprosecution.  This led  the state police to interview  Molloy\r\n\non  June 2, 1994.  At this  interview Molloy revealed her two\r\n\nmeetings  with Sabetta, his comments about the people who had\r\n\ncomplained  about his  brutality,  and his  ownership of  the\r\n\nlaser sighted semiautomatic.\r\n\n          Not  satisfied  with  the  information  Molloy  had\r\n\nsupplied,  the state  police  asked her  to  report to  their\r\n\nbarracks for a third interview the following morning.  During\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthis session, Molloy  told the state  police about her  visit\r\n\nwith Duffy  after the  triple homicide.   The police  pressed\r\n\nMolloy for  additional information, but  Molloy denied having\r\n\nany.\r\n\n          The state police called  Chief Blanchard, told  him\r\n\nthat Molloy  was refusing to  cooperate with them,  and asked\r\n\nhim to  come down to their  barracks to speak with  her.  The\r\n\nChief prepared a letter  of suspension and then drove  to the\r\n\nstate  police barracks with  Deputy Chief Stephen Castiglioni\r\n\nand Captain Thomas K. Wilson.  \r\n\n          After he arrived at  the state police barracks, the\r\n\nChief met  with several  investigators who accused  Molloy of\r\n\nconspiring  with  Duffy  to withhold  information  about  the\r\n\nmurders.   The Chief then met with Molloy and, without asking\r\n\nfor her side of the story, advised her to cooperate  with the\r\n\nstate  police investigation.  When  she insisted she had told\r\n\nthe  state  police all  she knew,  the  Chief handed  her the\r\n\nletter  of suspension and told her she was suspended with pay\r\n\nuntil the state police concluded their investigation into her\r\n\nalleged conspiracy  with Duffy.   The Chief  also barred  her\r\n\nfrom participating  in training activities and  from entering\r\n\nthe police headquarters building.\r\n\n          Molloy remained  on suspension for nine  and a half\r\n\nweeks.  While suspended she received her salary, but she lost\r\n\nthe  opportunity  to work  extra  shifts,  to participate  in\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ntraining  sessions,  and  to  work on  special  details,  all\r\n\nactivities which  would have provided additional  pay.  While\r\n\nsuspended, Molloy  suffered emotional distress  and damage to\r\n\nher  personal  and  professional  reputations.    On  several\r\n\noccasions during  her suspension,  Molloy was required  while\r\n\ntestifying as  a witness in  connection with arrests  she had\r\n\nmade before her suspension  to explain in open court  why she\r\n\nhad been suspended.\r\n\n          On  June 9,  1994, approximately  a week  after her\r\n\nsuspension, Molloy, with the  help of her attorney, requested\r\n\na  hearing concerning  her suspension  pursuant to  the Rhode\r\n\nIsland Law  Enforcement Officers'  Bill of Rights,  R.I. Gen.\r\n\nLaws   42-28.6-13(C) (\"the Officers' Bill of Rights\").2   The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Although it has since been amended, see 1995 R.I. Pub.\r                                                       \r\nLaws ch. 19,   1, at the time of Molloy's suspension, R.I.\r\nGen. Laws   42-28.6-13(C) stated:\r\n\n   Emergency suspension may be imposed by the chief or the\r\n   highest ranking officer of the law enforcement agency,\r\n   when it appears that such action is in the best\r\n   interest of the public.  Any emergency suspension of\r\n   any law enforcement officer shall consist of the law\r\n   enforcement officer being relieved of duty and he or\r\n   she shall receive all ordinary pay and benefits as he\r\n   or she would have if he or she were not suspended.  Any\r\n   law enforcement officer so suspended shall be entitled\r\n   to a prompt hearing before a hearing committee upon his\r\n   or her request.  The time period for the hearing is not\r\n   to exceed fourteen (14) days.  If, after hearing, the\r\n   hearing committee does suspend or dismiss the law\r\n   enforcement officer, he or she shall not be entitled to\r\n   his or her pay and benefits; however, if the\r\n   enforcement officer is reinstated by a subsequent\r\n   hearing, he or she shall be entitled to be reimbursed\r\n   for all salary and benefits that have not been paid.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nChief had met with the City Solicitor, William Smith, the day\r\n\nbefore.   The Chief testified  Smith had advised  him that he\r\n\ndid  not need to specify any charges against Molloy or afford\r\n\nher a hearing  so long as  Molloy was receiving full  pay and\r\n\nbenefits.3    The Chief  did not  charge  Molloy, nor  was he\r\n\nwilling to  grant her the  hearing required by  the Officers'\r\n\nBill of Rights.\r\n\n          Molloy filed a mandamus  action in the Rhode Island\r\n\nSuperior Court  under R.I. Gen.  Laws   42-28.6-14(2).4   The\r\n\nChief  never answered  Molloy's  state court  complaint.   In\r\n\nAugust 1994, the Chief reinstated her, reserving the right to\r\n\nfile disciplinary  charges upon  the completion of  the state\r\n\npolice investigation.   Her reinstatement rendered  her state\r\n\ncourt mandamus action moot.   In September 1994, the Attorney\r\n\nGeneral informed the Chief that no criminal charges  would be\r\n\nfiled against Molloy.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  In contrast, Smith testified he told the Chief to put\r\nMolloy on \"administrative leave status\" and specifically\r\nadvised him not to suspend Molloy under the emergency\r\nsuspension provision of the Officers' Bill of Rights, R.I.\r\nGen. Laws   42-28.6-13(C), because that provision did not\r\napply to Molloy's case.\r\n\n4.  R.I. Gen. Laws   42-28.6-14(2) states:\r\n\n   Any law enforcement officer who is denied any right\r\n   afforded by this subtitle may apply, either\r\n   individually or through his or her certified or\r\n   recognized employee organization, to the superior court\r\n   where he or she resides or is regularly employed for\r\n   any order directing the law enforcement agency to show\r\n   cause why the right should not be afforded.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          On September 30, 1994, Molloy filed an eight-count5\r\n\ncomplaint against  the City of Warwick,  the Chief, Warwick's\r\n\nBoard of Public Safety,  and Mayor Lincoln Chafee.   Under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1983,6 Molloy  alleged she had been deprived  of her\r\n\nconstitutional rights to equal  protection, free speech,  and\r\n\nsubstantive  and procedural due process.   Under Title VII of\r\n\nthe Civil  Rights Act  of 1964, 42  U.S.C.    2000e et  seq.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nMolloy claimed disparate treatment  because of her gender and\r\n\ndisparate  impact  because  of  policies  having a  disparate\r\n\nnegative impact on her  as a woman.  Under  state law, Molloy\r\n\nalleged  discrimination  and  the  negligent  or  intentional\r\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.\r\n\n          Before  trial, the  district  court  dismissed,  on\r\n\ngrounds   of   qualified   immunity,   Molloy's   claims  for\r\n\nsubstantive  and procedural  due  process violations  against\r\n\nMayor  Chafee and  her claim  for a  substantive  due process\r\n\nviolation against the Chief.   The trial then proceeded.   At\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The complaint actually states nine counts, though two are\r\nlabeled \"VIII.\"  However, the first two counts are apparently\r\nidentical.\r\n\n6.  42 U.S.C.   1983 states, in relevant part:\r\n\n   Every person who, under color of any statute,\r\n   ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\r\n   or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or\r\n   causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United\r\n   States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof\r\n   to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\r\n   immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall\r\n   be liable to the party injured in an action at law,\r\n   suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthe  close of all the evidence, the court granted judgment as\r\n\na  matter of law for all the defendants on Molloy's disparate\r\n\nimpact and  First Amendment claims.   The court  also granted\r\n\njudgment as a matter of law for Molloy on her  procedural due\r\n\nprocess claim,  submitting her gender discrimination claim to\r\n\nthe  jury.  The jury was also instructed to ascertain damages\r\n\non both claims.7\r\n\n          The   jury   determined   that   Molloy   had  been\r\n\ndiscriminated against on the basis of her gender.  It awarded\r\n\nher $23,000 in damages on the discrimination claim as well as\r\n\nfor violation of  procedural due process as earlier  found by\r\n\nthe  court.   The  district  court  denied Defendants'  post-\r\n\nverdict motions  for judgment as a  matter of law,  for a new\r\n\ntrial, and to alter judgment.  Defendants appealed.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          We  turn first to  Defendants' contention  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court committed  error  in granting  judgment as  a\r\n\nmatter of  law against Defendants and in Plaintiff's favor on\r\n\nthe  procedural due process claim.  This is a close question.\r\n\nGiven, however, our affirmance,  infra, of the jury's verdict\r                                                  \r\n\nfor   Plaintiff   on  her   Title   VII   claim  for   gender\r\n\ndiscrimination,  there is  no practical  need to  address it;\r\n\nhowever resolved,  the outcome  would not affect  the damages\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The remaining claims appear to have been dropped and, in\r\nany event, are not at issue in this appeal.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nawarded to Plaintiff.   The  jury provided  a single  damages\r\n\naward  for both  claims, and  so long  as Plaintiff  is found\r\n\nentitled to have prevailed  on either of the two  claims, the\r\n\naward  stands, with  no alteration in  the amount  of damages\r\n\nregardless of whether  one or  both claims are  upheld.   The\r\n\nsame conduct underlay both:  the Chief's suspension of Molloy\r\n\nwhile  depriving  her  of  the  hearing  called  for  by  the\r\n\nOfficers' Bill  of  Rights.   Her damages  consisted in  each\r\n\ninstance of her lost  opportunity to earn extra income  while\r\n\nsuspended  (for  special  details,  overtime,  etc.)  and her\r\n\nemotional  distress  and loss  of  reputation  caused by  her\r\n\nsuspension.  The special  verdict form handed to the  jury by\r\n\nthe court instructed  the jury  to award a  single amount  of\r\n\ndamages  even if  it  found (as  the  jury reported  it  did)\r\n\nliability  and  causation   under  both  of  Molloy's   legal\r\n\ntheories.8   We  also note  that the  district  court's final\r\n\njudgment,  which  we  affirm,  infra, does  not  mention  the\r                                                \r\n\nunderlying  legal  theories  but  only states  a  finding  of\r\n\nliability and the amount of damages. \r\n\n          Because the jury's damages  award would be the same\r\n\nunder either or both liability  theories, and because we find\r\n\nthere was  sufficient evidence to support  the jury's finding\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.

We disagree.\r\n\n          At  trial,  the  Chief himself  testified  that  in\r\n\napproximately  a  dozen  discipline  cases  involving Warwick\r\n\npolice  officers who were male,10 the  Chief had afforded the\r\n\nofficers the rights  created by the Officers' Bill of Rights,\r\n\nas  he  conspicuously  would  not  do  for Molloy,  a  woman.\r\n\nMoreover,  in a  number of  these cases  he kept  officers on\r\n\nactive duty after learning that they were suspected of highly\r\n\nquestionable behavior.  \r\n\n          Scott Hornoff, for example, was the primary suspect\r\n\nin the state  police investigation  of the 1989  murder of  a\r\n\nwoman  named Victoria Cushman.  Although the Chief knew as of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  The Chief also briefly referred to a situation involving\r\na woman officer, but she was not identified, and the details\r\nof her case remain unclear.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nOctober  1991 that Hornoff was  the main suspect,  he did not\r\n\nsuspend him  as he later did  Molloy but instead  kept him on\r\n\nactive duty  working at an  administrative job.   Hornoff was\r\n\nnot suspended until he was eventually indicted for murder  by\r\n\na  grand jury in December  1994.  It  was conceded, moreover,\r\n\nthat  Hornoff's rights  under the  Law Enforcement  Officers'\r\n\nBill of Rights were recognized.\r\n\n          Joseph Duquette, a senior Warwick police officer at\r\n\nthe  time of  the  Cushman case,  interfered  with the  state\r\n\npolice investigation of Hornoff.  In  1993, Duquette issued a\r\n\nmemorandum in  which he  ordered the members  of the  Warwick\r\n\nMajor Crimes  Unit not  to discuss the  Cushman investigation\r\n\nwith anyone  from the state attorney  general's office unless\r\n\nsuch a discussion took  place pursuant to a subpoena  or with\r\n\nthe   explicit   permission   of   Duquette,   then-Commander\r\n\nCastiglioni or Chief Blanchard.  Duquette was not disciplined\r\n\nin  any  way  for  his  interference  with the  state  police\r\n\ninvestigation until August of 1995, after Chief Blanchard had\r\n\nbeen replaced by  Chief DeFeo.   While Appellants argue  that\r\n\nthe  Chief  was  unaware  of  Duquette's  activity,  we  find\r\n\nsufficient evidence in  the record from which  the jury could\r\n\nhave properly inferred knowledge.\r\n\n          We   conclude   that   Molloy  presented   evidence\r\n\nsufficient   for  the  jury  to  have   found  that  she  had\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nestablished her prima  facie case  that \"similarly  situated\"\r\n\nmales had received dissimilar treatment.\r\n\n          The  defendants go  on to  argue that  even if  the\r\n\nconduct of  the disciplined  male  officers was  sufficiently\r\n\nsimilar in material respects to Molloy's to establish a prima\r\n\nfacie case,  the weight of  the evidence was  insufficient to\r\n\nsupport  a finding  \"that the  justification [offered  by the\r\n\ndefendants]  was  pretextual and  that  the  real reason  was\r\n\ndiscriminatory.\"  Cuello-Suarez, 988 F.2d at 278.\r                                           \r\n\n          Presented  with  the  evidence  of  cases  such  as\r\n\nHornoff's and  Duquette's in  which male police  officers who\r\n\nhad  committed similar  or  more severe  offenses than  those\r\n\nMolloy was  accused of  were  either not  disciplined or,  if\r\n\ndisciplined,  were  first  afforded their  rights  under  the\r\n\nOfficers' Bill of Rights, the jury was entitled to infer that\r\n\nthe   Chief's  proffered  explanation   for  his  more  harsh\r\n\ntreatment of Molloy    the state police's advice that she was\r\n\nrefusing  to cooperate  with them  and the  ostensible advice\r\n\nthat the  granting of rights was  unnecessary where, although\r\n\nsuspended, she was still being paid    was a pretext.  \r\n\n          Essentially  the  same   evidence  also  allowed  a\r\n\nreasonable jury  to conclude  that the plaintiff  had carried\r\n\nher  burden  of  proving  that the  Chief  had  discriminated\r\n\nagainst Molloy  because of her  gender in violation  of Title\r\n\nVII.

Molloy was suspended\r\n\nwithout being  offered the  same rights granted  to similarly\r\n\nsituated male  officers.   Moreover, the reasons  supplied by\r\n\nthe  Chief for his refusal  to provide Molloy  with a hearing\r\n\nwere so flimsy as to permit a finding of mendacity:\r\n\n          The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons\r\n          put    forward     by    the    defendant\r\n          (particularly if disbelief is accompanied\r\n          by   a   suspicion  of   mendacity)  may,\r\n          together with  the elements of  the prima\r\n          facie case, suffice  to show  intentional\r\n          discrimination.  Thus,  rejection of  the\r\n          defendant's proffered reasons will permit\r                                                               \r\n          the trier of  fact to infer  the ultimate\r\n          fact  of intentional discrimination . . .\r\n          .\r\n\nSt. Mary's Honor  Ctr. v.

There is no  contention that\r\n\nMolloy's   asserted   anxiety,   nervousness,    nausea   and\r\n\nsleeplessness  derived from a  preexisting medical condition.\r\n\nThe  sole  issue  was  the  role  of  Defendants' conduct  in\r\n\nproducing  those symptoms and the  placing of a fair monetary\r\n\nvaluation on them relative to the circumstances of this case.\r\n\nThe jury  heard and  could evaluate her  testimony describing\r\n\nwhat  effect  the suspension  had upon  her as  compared with\r\n\nother events.  It is unclear how an expert could have helped.\r\n\nThis  is the  kind  of determination  typically entrusted  to\r\n\njuries.\r\n\n          Besides emotional distress,  Molloy also  testified\r\n\nthat  the defendants' actions caused her  to suffer damage to\r\n\nher personal  and professional reputations.   She stated that\r\n\nher suspension, related as it was to  Sabetta's murder trial,\r\n\nreceived  substantial publicity.  Also, during her suspension\r\n\nMolloy testified as a witness at several trials in connection\r\n\nwith arrests she had  made previously.  At these  trials, she\r\n\nhad  to admit in open  court that she  was then suspended and\r\n\nwas  obliged  to describe  the circumstances  surrounding her\r\n\nsuspension.  The  jury was entitled to  compensate Molloy for\r\n\nthese additional elements of damage.\r\n\n          The judgment is affirmed.

The  suspension\r\n\nresulted from  her ostensible  refusal to cooperate  with the\r\n\nstate  police in  their  investigation of  a triple  homicide\r\n\ninvolving Robert Sabetta, a  police officer from the  Town of\r\n\nFoster, Rhode Island.  \r\n\n          Before Molloy joined  the Warwick police department\r\n\nin 1991, she and Sabetta were in the same class at the police\r\n\nacademy.

In February 1993, Molloy  spent an\r\n\nevening socializing  with  Sabetta and  Paula Duffy,  another\r\n\npolice academy  classmate and  a police officer  in Cranston,\r\n\nRhode Island.  During that evening, Sabetta showed Molloy and\r\n\nDuffy  his personal  firearm,  a semiautomatic  with a  laser\r\n\nsight.\r\n\n          Molloy  saw Sabetta  again approximately  two weeks\r\n\nlater.  Duffy,  with Sabetta  in the car,  drove to  Molloy's\r\n\nhome to  show Molloy her new Jeep.  The  three then went to a\r\n\nnearby  restaurant  for pizza  and  beer.   During  the meal,\r\n\nSabetta complained  about his suspension for  improper use of\r\n\nforce.  He commented  that perhaps he should have  killed, or\r\n\nshould kill, the people whose complaints had resulted in  his\r\n\nsuspension.\r\n\n          On April  13, 1993,  Sabetta shot and  killed three\r\n\nteenage  boys and injured a  fourth.  Among  the victims were\r\n\npersons who had filed brutality complaints against  him.  The\r\n\ninjured  victim identified  Sabetta as  the shooter.   Molloy\r\n\nlearned about  the murders  and Sabetta's involvement  during\r\n\nher  midnight to 8:00  a.m. shift on April  14, 1993.  Molloy\r\n\ntold her sergeant about  knowing Sabetta from having attended\r\n\nthe police academy with him.  \r\n\n          Later that morning, Duffy contacted Molloy, worried\r\n\nthat  Sabetta  might  come  to  Duffy's  home.   At  Molloy's\r\n\nsuggestion, Duffy arranged to spend the night at the house of\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nher friend  Suzanne Jardine, also a  Cranston police officer.\r\n\nMolloy stopped by  Jardine's home after her duty  shift. When\r\n\nthe Sabetta  matter was  broached, Duffy stated  that talking\r\n\nabout the  shootings upset her too much  and that she did not\r\n\nwant to discuss them further.  Molloy acceded to her request.\r\n\n          During their investigation,  the Rhode Island state\r\n\npolice  contacted Molloy in June 1993 to ask her some general\r\n\nquestions  about  Sabetta.   Molloy  did  not volunteer  that\r\n\nSabetta  had said either he should have killed or should kill\r\n\nthe people who had  filed a brutality complaint  against him,\r\n\nnor   did  she   mention   knowing  that   Sabetta  owned   a\r\n\nsemiautomatic with a laser sight.  The murder weapon had been\r\n\nSabetta's service revolver, not a semiautomatic.\r\n\n          After the Sabetta murder  trial began the following\r\n\nsummer,  the  state  police  received   an  anonymous  letter\r\n\nclaiming  that a  Warwick  police dispatcher  and a  Cranston\r\n\npolice  officer possessed  information relevant  to Sabetta's\r\n\nprosecution.  This led  the state police to interview  Molloy\r\n\non  June 2, 1994.  At this  interview Molloy revealed her two\r\n\nmeetings  with Sabetta, his comments about the people who had\r\n\ncomplained  about his  brutality,  and his  ownership of  the\r\n\nlaser sighted semiautomatic.\r\n\n          Not  satisfied  with  the  information  Molloy  had\r\n\nsupplied,  the state  police  asked her  to  report to  their\r\n\nbarracks for a third interview the following morning.  During\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthis session, Molloy  told the state  police about her  visit\r\n\nwith Duffy  after the  triple homicide.   The police  pressed\r\n\nMolloy for  additional information, but  Molloy denied having\r\n\nany.\r\n\n          The state police called  Chief Blanchard, told  him\r\n\nthat Molloy  was refusing to  cooperate with them,  and asked\r\n\nhim to  come down to their  barracks to speak with  her.  The\r\n\nChief prepared a letter  of suspension and then drove  to the\r\n\nstate  police barracks with  Deputy Chief Stephen Castiglioni\r\n\nand Captain Thomas K. Wilson.  \r\n\n          After he arrived at  the state police barracks, the\r\n\nChief met  with several  investigators who accused  Molloy of\r\n\nconspiring  with  Duffy  to withhold  information  about  the\r\n\nmurders.   The Chief then met with Molloy and, without asking\r\n\nfor her side of the story, advised her to cooperate  with the\r\n\nstate  police investigation.  When  she insisted she had told\r\n\nthe  state  police all  she knew,  the  Chief handed  her the\r\n\nletter  of suspension and told her she was suspended with pay\r\n\nuntil the state police concluded their investigation into her\r\n\nalleged conspiracy  with Duffy.   The Chief  also barred  her\r\n\nfrom participating  in training activities and  from entering\r\n\nthe police headquarters building.\r\n\n          Molloy remained  on suspension for nine  and a half\r\n\nweeks.  While suspended she received her salary, but she lost\r\n\nthe  opportunity  to work  extra  shifts,  to participate  in\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ntraining  sessions,  and  to  work on  special  details,  all\r\n\nactivities which  would have provided additional  pay.  While\r\n\nsuspended, Molloy  suffered emotional distress  and damage to\r\n\nher  personal  and  professional  reputations.    On  several\r\n\noccasions during  her suspension,  Molloy was required  while\r\n\ntestifying as  a witness in  connection with arrests  she had\r\n\nmade before her suspension  to explain in open court  why she\r\n\nhad been suspended.\r\n\n          On  June 9,  1994, approximately  a week  after her\r\n\nsuspension, Molloy, with the  help of her attorney, requested\r\n\na  hearing concerning  her suspension  pursuant to  the Rhode\r\n\nIsland Law  Enforcement Officers'  Bill of Rights,  R.I. Gen.\r\n\nLaws   42-28.6-13(C) (\"the Officers' Bill of Rights\").2   The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Although it has since been amended, see 1995 R.I. Pub.\r                                                       \r\nLaws ch. 19,   1, at the time of Molloy's suspension, R.I.\r\nGen. Laws   42-28.6-13(C) stated:\r\n\n   Emergency suspension may be imposed by the chief or the\r\n   highest ranking officer of the law enforcement agency,\r\n   when it appears that such action is in the best\r\n   interest of the public.  Any emergency suspension of\r\n   any law enforcement officer shall consist of the law\r\n   enforcement officer being relieved of duty and he or\r\n   she shall receive all ordinary pay and benefits as he\r\n   or she would have if he or she were not suspended.  Any\r\n   law enforcement officer so suspended shall be entitled\r\n   to a prompt hearing before a hearing committee upon his\r\n   or her request.  The time period for the hearing is not\r\n   to exceed fourteen (14) days.  If, after hearing, the\r\n   hearing committee does suspend or dismiss the law\r\n   enforcement officer, he or she shall not be entitled to\r\n   his or her pay and benefits; however, if the\r\n   enforcement officer is reinstated by a subsequent\r\n   hearing, he or she shall be entitled to be reimbursed\r\n   for all salary and benefits that have not been paid.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nChief had met with the City Solicitor, William Smith, the day\r\n\nbefore.   The Chief testified  Smith had advised  him that he\r\n\ndid  not need to specify any charges against Molloy or afford\r\n\nher a hearing  so long as  Molloy was receiving full  pay and\r\n\nbenefits.3    The Chief  did not  charge  Molloy, nor  was he\r\n\nwilling to  grant her the  hearing required by  the Officers'\r\n\nBill of Rights.\r\n\n          Molloy filed a mandamus  action in the Rhode Island\r\n\nSuperior Court  under R.I. Gen.  Laws   42-28.6-14(2).4   The\r\n\nChief  never answered  Molloy's  state court  complaint.   In\r\n\nAugust 1994, the Chief reinstated her, reserving the right to\r\n\nfile disciplinary  charges upon  the completion of  the state\r\n\npolice investigation.   Her reinstatement rendered  her state\r\n\ncourt mandamus action moot.   In September 1994, the Attorney\r\n\nGeneral informed the Chief that no criminal charges  would be\r\n\nfiled against Molloy.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  In contrast, Smith testified he told the Chief to put\r\nMolloy on \"administrative leave status\" and specifically\r\nadvised him not to suspend Molloy under the emergency\r\nsuspension provision of the Officers' Bill of Rights, R.I.\r\nGen. Laws   42-28.6-13(C), because that provision did not\r\napply to Molloy's case.\r\n\n4.  R.I. Gen. Laws   42-28.6-14(2) states:\r\n\n   Any law enforcement officer who is denied any right\r\n   afforded by this subtitle may apply, either\r\n   individually or through his or her certified or\r\n   recognized employee organization, to the superior court\r\n   where he or she resides or is regularly employed for\r\n   any order directing the law enforcement agency to show\r\n   cause why the right should not be afforded.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          On September 30, 1994, Molloy filed an eight-count5\r\n\ncomplaint against  the City of Warwick,  the Chief, Warwick's\r\n\nBoard of Public Safety,  and Mayor Lincoln Chafee.   Under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1983,6 Molloy  alleged she had been deprived  of her\r\n\nconstitutional rights to equal  protection, free speech,  and\r\n\nsubstantive  and procedural due process.   Under Title VII of\r\n\nthe Civil  Rights Act  of 1964, 42  U.S.C.    2000e et  seq.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nMolloy claimed disparate treatment  because of her gender and\r\n\ndisparate  impact  because  of  policies  having a  disparate\r\n\nnegative impact on her  as a woman.  Under  state law, Molloy\r\n\nalleged  discrimination  and  the  negligent  or  intentional\r\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.\r\n\n          Before  trial, the  district  court  dismissed,  on\r\n\ngrounds   of   qualified   immunity,   Molloy's   claims  for\r\n\nsubstantive  and procedural  due  process violations  against\r\n\nMayor  Chafee and  her claim  for a  substantive  due process\r\n\nviolation against the Chief.   The trial then proceeded.   At\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The complaint actually states nine counts, though two are\r\nlabeled \"VIII.\"  However, the first two counts are apparently\r\nidentical.\r\n\n6.  42 U.S.C.   1983 states, in relevant part:\r\n\n   Every person who, under color of any statute,\r\n   ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\r\n   or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or\r\n   causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United\r\n   States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof\r\n   to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\r\n   immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall\r\n   be liable to the party injured in an action at law,\r\n   suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthe  close of all the evidence, the court granted judgment as\r\n\na  matter of law for all the defendants on Molloy's disparate\r\n\nimpact and  First Amendment claims.   The court  also granted\r\n\njudgment as a matter of law for Molloy on her  procedural due\r\n\nprocess claim,  submitting her gender discrimination claim to\r\n\nthe  jury.  The jury was also instructed to ascertain damages\r\n\non both claims.7\r\n\n          The   jury   determined   that   Molloy   had  been\r\n\ndiscriminated against on the basis of her gender.  It awarded\r\n\nher $23,000 in damages on the discrimination claim as well as\r\n\nfor violation of  procedural due process as earlier  found by\r\n\nthe  court.   The  district  court  denied Defendants'  post-\r\n\nverdict motions  for judgment as a  matter of law,  for a new\r\n\ntrial, and to alter judgment.  Defendants appealed.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          We  turn first to  Defendants' contention  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court committed  error  in granting  judgment as  a\r\n\nmatter of  law against Defendants and in Plaintiff's favor on\r\n\nthe  procedural due process claim.  This is a close question.\r\n\nGiven, however, our affirmance,  infra, of the jury's verdict\r                                                  \r\n\nfor   Plaintiff   on  her   Title   VII   claim  for   gender\r\n\ndiscrimination,  there is  no practical  need to  address it;\r\n\nhowever resolved,  the outcome  would not affect  the damages\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The remaining claims appear to have been dropped and, in\r\nany event, are not at issue in this appeal.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nawarded to Plaintiff.   The  jury provided  a single  damages\r\n\naward  for both  claims, and  so long  as Plaintiff  is found\r\n\nentitled to have prevailed  on either of the two  claims, the\r\n\naward  stands, with  no alteration in  the amount  of damages\r\n\nregardless of whether  one or  both claims are  upheld.   The\r\n\nsame conduct underlay both:  the Chief's suspension of Molloy\r\n\nwhile  depriving  her  of  the  hearing  called  for  by  the\r\n\nOfficers' Bill  of  Rights.   Her damages  consisted in  each\r\n\ninstance of her lost  opportunity to earn extra income  while\r\n\nsuspended  (for  special  details,  overtime,  etc.)  and her\r\n\nemotional  distress  and loss  of  reputation  caused by  her\r\n\nsuspension.  The special  verdict form handed to the  jury by\r\n\nthe court instructed  the jury  to award a  single amount  of\r\n\ndamages  even if  it  found (as  the  jury reported  it  did)\r\n\nliability  and  causation   under  both  of  Molloy's   legal\r\n\ntheories.8   We  also note  that the  district  court's final\r\n\njudgment,  which  we  affirm,  infra, does  not  mention  the\r                                                \r\n\nunderlying  legal  theories  but  only states  a  finding  of\r\n\nliability and the amount of damages. \r\n\n          Because the jury's damages  award would be the same\r\n\nunder either or both liability  theories, and because we find\r\n\nthere was  sufficient evidence to support  the jury's finding\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Although liability under Molloy's procedural due process\r\nclaim had been directed by the court, the causation\r\ndetermination under that theory was left to the jury, as were\r\ndamages.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nof   gender   discrimination,   infra,   we  need   make   no\r                                                 \r\n\ndetermination as  to  whether  or  not  the  court  erred  in\r\n\ngranting  judgment to  Plaintiff as  a matter  of law  on her\r\n\nconstitutional   claim  of  a  violation  of  procedural  due\r\n\nprocess.9   Cf.

We disagree.\r\n\n          At  trial,  the  Chief himself  testified  that  in\r\n\napproximately  a  dozen  discipline  cases  involving Warwick\r\n\npolice  officers who were male,10 the  Chief had afforded the\r\n\nofficers the rights  created by the Officers' Bill of Rights,\r\n\nas  he  conspicuously  would  not  do  for Molloy,  a  woman.\r\n\nMoreover,  in a  number of  these cases  he kept  officers on\r\n\nactive duty after learning that they were suspected of highly\r\n\nquestionable behavior.  \r\n\n          Scott Hornoff, for example, was the primary suspect\r\n\nin the state  police investigation  of the 1989  murder of  a\r\n\nwoman  named Victoria Cushman.  Although the Chief knew as of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  The Chief also briefly referred to a situation involving\r\na woman officer, but she was not identified, and the details\r\nof her case remain unclear.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nOctober  1991 that Hornoff was  the main suspect,  he did not\r\n\nsuspend him  as he later did  Molloy but instead  kept him on\r\n\nactive duty  working at an  administrative job.   Hornoff was\r\n\nnot suspended until he was eventually indicted for murder  by\r\n\na  grand jury in December  1994.  It  was conceded, moreover,\r\n\nthat  Hornoff's rights  under the  Law Enforcement  Officers'\r\n\nBill of Rights were recognized.\r\n\n          Joseph Duquette, a senior Warwick police officer at\r\n\nthe  time of  the  Cushman case,  interfered  with the  state\r\n\npolice investigation of Hornoff.  In  1993, Duquette issued a\r\n\nmemorandum in  which he  ordered the members  of the  Warwick\r\n\nMajor Crimes  Unit not  to discuss the  Cushman investigation\r\n\nwith anyone  from the state attorney  general's office unless\r\n\nsuch a discussion took  place pursuant to a subpoena  or with\r\n\nthe   explicit   permission   of   Duquette,   then-Commander\r\n\nCastiglioni or Chief Blanchard.  Duquette was not disciplined\r\n\nin  any  way  for  his  interference  with the  state  police\r\n\ninvestigation until August of 1995, after Chief Blanchard had\r\n\nbeen replaced by  Chief DeFeo.   While Appellants argue  that\r\n\nthe  Chief  was  unaware  of  Duquette's  activity,  we  find\r\n\nsufficient evidence in  the record from which  the jury could\r\n\nhave properly inferred knowledge.\r\n\n          We   conclude   that   Molloy  presented   evidence\r\n\nsufficient   for  the  jury  to  have   found  that  she  had\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nestablished her prima  facie case  that \"similarly  situated\"\r\n\nmales had received dissimilar treatment.\r\n\n          The  defendants go  on to  argue that  even if  the\r\n\nconduct of  the disciplined  male  officers was  sufficiently\r\n\nsimilar in material respects to Molloy's to establish a prima\r\n\nfacie case,  the weight of  the evidence was  insufficient to\r\n\nsupport  a finding  \"that the  justification [offered  by the\r\n\ndefendants]  was  pretextual and  that  the  real reason  was\r\n\ndiscriminatory.\"  Cuello-Suarez, 988 F.2d at 278.\r                                           \r\n\n          Presented  with  the  evidence  of  cases  such  as\r\n\nHornoff's and  Duquette's in  which male police  officers who\r\n\nhad  committed similar  or  more severe  offenses than  those\r\n\nMolloy was  accused of  were  either not  disciplined or,  if\r\n\ndisciplined,  were  first  afforded their  rights  under  the\r\n\nOfficers' Bill of Rights, the jury was entitled to infer that\r\n\nthe   Chief's  proffered  explanation   for  his  more  harsh\r\n\ntreatment of Molloy    the state police's advice that she was\r\n\nrefusing  to cooperate  with them  and the  ostensible advice\r\n\nthat the  granting of rights was  unnecessary where, although\r\n\nsuspended, she was still being paid    was a pretext.  \r\n\n          Essentially  the  same   evidence  also  allowed  a\r\n\nreasonable jury  to conclude  that the plaintiff  had carried\r\n\nher  burden  of  proving  that the  Chief  had  discriminated\r\n\nagainst Molloy  because of her  gender in violation  of Title\r\n\nVII.

Laws\r                                                          \r\n\n   42-28.6-13(C) (\"Any  law enforcement officer  so suspended\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nshall  be  entitled  to a  prompt  hearing  before a  hearing\r\n\ncommittee upon his  or her request.\").  The  Chief's outright\r\n\nrefusal was  in marked contrast  to his regular  allowance of\r\n\nthese rights to  male officers.   We hold that  the jury  had\r\n\nsufficient  evidence  from  which  to   infer  discriminatory\r\n\nintent.  \r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n          The  defendants'  remaining  contentions   are  not\r\n\npersuasive.  First, they  argue that the district court  made\r\n\ncertain errors in admitting evidence at trial.  Our review of\r\n\nthe  record  satisfies us  that  such  errors,  if any,  were\r\n\nharmless.

In\r                                                                    \r\n\nthat case,  the plaintiff had  a previous history  of stomach\r\n\nproblems,  headaches, and  diarrhea.   We  held that  medical\r\n\ntestimony was  required for the  plaintiff to prove  that the\r\n\nirritated   bowels,   diarrhea,    tension   headaches    and\r\n\nsleeplessness  she experienced were  the result  of emotional\r\n\ndistress   caused  by   the  defendant   and  not   merely  a\r\n\ncontinuation of her previous medical problems.  In that case,\r\n\nwe  sought  to  avoid  putting  juries  in  the  position  of\r\n\nevaluating  the effect  of  a  preexisting medical  condition\r\n\nwithout  the aid  of expert  medical testimony.   We  stated,\r\n\n\"[W]e  are not  establishing a  bright-line rule  that expert\r\n\ntestimony is always necessary to prove the causation prong of\r\n\n[intentional infliction  of emotional distress].

There is no  contention that\r\n\nMolloy's   asserted   anxiety,   nervousness,    nausea   and\r\n\nsleeplessness  derived from a  preexisting medical condition.\r\n\nThe  sole  issue  was  the  role  of  Defendants' conduct  in\r\n\nproducing  those symptoms and the  placing of a fair monetary\r\n\nvaluation on them relative to the circumstances of this case.\r\n\nThe jury  heard and  could evaluate her  testimony describing\r\n\nwhat  effect  the suspension  had upon  her as  compared with\r\n\nother events.  It is unclear how an expert could have helped.\r\n\nThis  is the  kind  of determination  typically entrusted  to\r\n\njuries.\r\n\n          Besides emotional distress,  Molloy also  testified\r\n\nthat  the defendants' actions caused her  to suffer damage to\r\n\nher personal  and professional reputations.   She stated that\r\n\nher suspension, related as it was to  Sabetta's murder trial,\r\n\nreceived  substantial publicity.  Also, during her suspension\r\n\nMolloy testified as a witness at several trials in connection\r\n\nwith arrests she had  made previously.  At these  trials, she\r\n\nhad  to admit in open  court that she  was then suspended and\r\n\nwas  obliged  to describe  the circumstances  surrounding her\r\n\nsuspension.  The  jury was entitled to  compensate Molloy for\r\n\nthese additional elements of damage.\r\n\n          The judgment is affirmed.
