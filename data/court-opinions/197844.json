George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n        Before\r\n\nBoudin, Circuit Judge, \r\nCoffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJoseph L. Kociubes with whom Melissa M. Thompson was on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\nGordon T. Walker with whom Steven W. Kasten and Christopher\r\nR. Bush were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nMarch 12, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  LTX Corporation, a Massachusetts manufacturer of\r\nsemi-conductor testing equipment, brought suit in United States\r\nDistrict Court in Massachusetts for breach of contract and\r\nnegligent supervision against Daewoo Electronics, Ltd., a Korean\r\nmanufacturer of various electronic products, and Daewoo\r\nCorporation, a Korean company that distributes products for Daewoo\r\nElectronics internationally.  The district court dismissed the\r\naction for lack of personal jurisdiction, pursuant to Mass. Gen. L.\r\nch. 223A,  3 (1993) and Mass. Gen. L. ch. 223,  38 (1976), and\r\nfor forum non conveniens.  It also concluded that any prospective\r\nservice conforming to the requirements of  38 would not surmount\r\nthe hurdle of lack of general due process jurisdiction.  LTX\r\nappeals these rulings and the district court's refusal to permit it\r\ndiscovery on the jurisdictional issue.  After careful review of the\r\nbriefs, the complaint, the district court order, and the applicable\r\ncase law and statutes, we affirm for the reasons set forth in full\r\nby the district court in LTX Corporation v. Daewoo Corporation, 979\r\nF. Supp. 51 (D. Mass. 1996).  \n",
