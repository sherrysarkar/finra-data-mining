Madeline   Valent n-Oquendo   was\r                      Per   Curiam.\r                                  \r\n\nconvicted  of  three  counts  of  dealing  in  semi-automatic\r\n\nweapons  prohibited  by 18 U.S.C.   922(v)  and was sentenced\r\n\nto 51 months of incarceration.\r\n\n          She  appeals  her  conviction,  arguing  that   the\r\n\nindictment, at Count I, merged the substantive and conspiracy\r\n\noffenses such that she did not have fair notice of that which\r\n\nshe  was being accused  and that, therefore,  double jeopardy\r\n\nconcerns  are raised by  her conviction.   A co-conspirator's\r\n\nstatement was erroneously admitted and there were other trial\r\n\nerrors, she says, and she complains that  she was not given a\r\n\ntheory of the defense instruction.  Her sentence is improper,\r\n\nshe also argues, because she  should not have received a two-\r\n\npoint upward adjustment as an organizer or supervisor and she\r\n\nshould  have  been  given a  downward  departure  for extreme\r\n\nfamily hardship.\r\n\n          Many of  the claimed errors were not objected to in\r\n\nthe trial  court and  Valent n's arguments  fail for  reasons\r\n\nwhich require only brief explanation.\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n          Valent n worked as a manager at a weapons shop, the\r\n\nArmer a  del Oeste  in  Bayam n, Puerto  Rico.   The  federal\r\n\nfirearms  license for the shop was  issued to Carmen V squez-\r\n\nV squez.   Valent n wanted to  assume the business and  had a\r\n\npending application to obtain her  own license.  The  undoing\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nof Valent n  and her  co-defendants, including  Jose S nchez-\r\n\nToledo,  came when  a package,  sent though  the U.S.  Mails,\r\n\narrived at the Bayam n Post Office with the muzzle of a rifle\r\n\nsticking out.  It was addressed to the post office box of the\r\n\nArmer a del  Oeste, but the  return address, in  Florida, was\r\n\nfictitious.  Valent n  claimed the package and turned it over\r\n\nto S nchez, an  employee of the Puerto Rican  Police, who put\r\n\nthe package into  a police car and drove  to another location\r\n\nwhere he returned  the package to  Valent n.  [S nchez  would\r\n\nlater plead guilty and provide evidence against Valent n.] \r\n\n          Within  two weeks a  second package arrived  at the\r\n\nBayam n Post Office from the same fictitious Florida address.\r\n\nThis package was  picked up by co-defendant  Maritza Emerson-\r\n\nde-Jes s, who  presented false identification.   Emerson also\r\n\nworked at the Armer a.  Emerson used Valent n's pick-up truck\r\n\nto get  the package.   She  also turned  the package  over to\r\n\nS nchez,  who again  put it  into  his police  car, in  which\r\n\nGonz lez-Rom n  was a passenger.  The postal authorities, who\r\n\nhad  been   monitoring  these  transactions   with  interest,\r\n\nimmediately arrested the two men, and later, the women.  \r\n\n          These transactions  were not recorded on  the books\r\n\nof  the  Armer a.   Indeed,  documents  appear to  have  been\r\n\nfalsified in  an effort to  show that the transaction  in the\r\n\nweapons  was  authorized.   The  two  packages  contained six\r\n\nNorinco rifles  and two large  capacity magazines, prohibited\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nby law.  The two women acknowledged receiving $750.00 for the\r\n\ntransactions,  but  argued  that  they  thought  the  weapons\r\n\nbelonged  to the  Puerto Rican  Police and  had been  sent to\r\n\nMiami for repair.  The jury rejected that theory.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\nThe Indictment\r\n\n          While  not   artfully  drafted,  Count  I   of  the\r\n\nIndictment alleged that the defendants did \"unlawfully engage\r\n\nin the business of dealing in firearms as the term is defined\r\n\nin Title 18,  United States Code, Section 921(3),  that is, a\r\n\nconspiracy to violate  Title 18, United States  Code, Section\r\n\n922(a)(1).\"  The  indictment went on to allege  the object of\r\n\nthe conspiracy  and a series  of overt acts,  giving specific\r\n\nplaces and times.  Valent n never objected to  the indictment\r\n\nbefore the  trial court,  so review is  for plain  error. See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States  v. Olano, 507 U.S.  725 (1993).  There  was no\r                                   \r\n\nplain error. \r\n\n           The   combination   of  the   references   in  the\r\n\nindictment   to  the  statutory  sections  involved  and  the\r\n\ndescription of the  overt acts gave Valent n  ample notice of\r\n\nthe  charges.    To  the  extent  Valent n  argues  there was\r\n\nambiguity as to  whether the transaction was  illegal because\r\n\nshe   was  unlicensed  or   because  she  was   licensed  but\r\n\nnonetheless  engaged in an  illegal transaction, Valent n was\r\n\ngiven  discovery showing that  the government would  show she\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndid  not  have   a  valid  license  at  the   time  of  these\r\n\ntransactions.  There was no  due process notice problem.  The\r\n\ndistrict court  sensibly construed  Count I  as a  conspiracy\r\n\ncount and so instructed, without objection.  \r\n\n          As to any  hypothetical double jeopardy  issue, the\r\n\nissue is at present exactly that:  hypothetical.  If there is\r\n\na  future prosecution, Valent n may raise the double jeopardy\r\n\nissue at that time.\r\n\nCo-Conspirator Statement and Other Alleged Trial Errors\r\n\n          Applying  this  circuit's  oft-recited  test  under\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Petrozziello, 548  F.2d 20,  23 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1977), the district  court conditionally held  admissible the\r\n\nstatement of  Gonz lez-Rom n, as reported  by S nchez-Toledo.\r\n\nThe statement concerned the relationship between Valent n and\r\n\nGonz lez,   that  they  had made  arrangements  to  send  the\r\n\npackages from  Florida to Puerto  Rico and that all  of those\r\n\ninvolved were  aware that the packages contained weapons.  At\r\n\nthe  end  of  the trial,  the  district  court revisited  the\r\n\nquestion and again determined the statements were admissible.\r\n\nValent n argues  that there was  no evidence of  a conspiracy\r\n\nother than these statements and so admission of the testimony\r\n\nwas error.  The argument  is without merit, as the recitation\r\n\nof the evidence demonstrates.\r\n\n          Nor  was Valent n entitled to an instruction on the\r\n\ndefense theory  that these transactions  were legitimate  and\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe guns were intended for the Puerto Rico Police.  There was\r\n\nno evidence to support the theory.  The document proffered in\r\n\nsupport  were not established  to be official  documents from\r\n\nSan Juan Police; rather, they  appear to have been falsified,\r\n\nand rather ineptly at that.\r\n\n          We have reviewed the remaining alleged trial errors\r\n\nand find the arguments to be without merit.\r\n\nSentencing\r\n\n          The district court found that Valent n was a leader\r\n\nor organizer  in the  offense and  accordingly increased  the\r\n\noffense level  by two points  under U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c).   On\r\n\nthe  evidence, this conclusion was plainly correct.  Valent n\r\n\ngave Gonz lez  the address  to which the  weapons were  to be\r\n\nshipped,  twice called S nchez-Toledo to pick up the weapons,\r\n\nappeared herself to pick up the guns, and let Emerson use her\r\n\ntruck when  Emerson picked up the  guns.  As to  the downward\r\n\ndeparture argument  made here,  no request  was  made to  the\r\n\ndistrict court for a downward departure and there is no clear\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n",

Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).  There  was no\r                                   \r\n\nplain error. \r\n\n           The   combination   of  the   references   in  the\r\n\nindictment   to  the  statutory  sections  involved  and  the\r\n\ndescription of the  overt acts gave Valent n  ample notice of\r\n\nthe  charges.    To  the  extent  Valent n  argues  there was\r\n\nambiguity as to  whether the transaction was  illegal because\r\n\nshe   was  unlicensed  or   because  she  was   licensed  but\r\n\nnonetheless  engaged in an  illegal transaction, Valent n was\r\n\ngiven  discovery showing that  the government would  show she\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndid  not  have   a  valid  license  at  the   time  of  these\r\n\ntransactions.  There was no  due process notice problem.  The\r\n\ndistrict court  sensibly construed  Count I  as a  conspiracy\r\n\ncount and so instructed, without objection.  \r\n\n          As to any  hypothetical double jeopardy  issue, the\r\n\nissue is at present exactly that:  hypothetical.  If there is\r\n\na  future prosecution, Valent n may raise the double jeopardy\r\n\nissue at that time.\r\n\nCo-Conspirator Statement and Other Alleged Trial Errors\r\n\n          Applying  this  circuit's  oft-recited  test  under\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Petrozziello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  23 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1977), the district  court conditionally held  admissible the\r\n\nstatement of  Gonz lez-Rom n, as reported  by S nchez-Toledo.\r\n\nThe statement concerned the relationship between Valent n and\r\n\nGonz lez,   that  they  had made  arrangements  to  send  the\r\n\npackages from  Florida to Puerto  Rico and that all  of those\r\n\ninvolved were  aware that the packages contained weapons.  At\r\n\nthe  end  of  the trial,  the  district  court revisited  the\r\n\nquestion and again determined the statements were admissible.\r\n\nValent n argues  that there was  no evidence of  a conspiracy\r\n\nother than these statements and so admission of the testimony\r\n\nwas error.  The argument  is without merit, as the recitation\r\n\nof the evidence demonstrates.\r\n\n          Nor  was Valent n entitled to an instruction on the\r\n\ndefense theory  that these transactions  were legitimate  and\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe guns were intended for the Puerto Rico Police.  There was\r\n\nno evidence to support the theory.  The document proffered in\r\n\nsupport  were not established  to be official  documents from\r\n\nSan Juan Police; rather, they  appear to have been falsified,\r\n\nand rather ineptly at that.\r\n\n          We have reviewed the remaining alleged trial errors\r\n\nand find the arguments to be without merit.\r\n\nSentencing\r\n\n          The district court found that Valent n was a leader\r\n\nor organizer  in the  offense and  accordingly increased  the\r\n\noffense level  by two points  under U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c).   On\r\n\nthe  evidence, this conclusion was plainly correct.  Valent n\r\n\ngave Gonz lez  the address  to which the  weapons were  to be\r\n\nshipped,  twice called S nchez-Toledo to pick up the weapons,\r\n\nappeared herself to pick up the guns, and let Emerson use her\r\n\ntruck when  Emerson picked up the  guns.  As to  the downward\r\n\ndeparture argument  made here,  no request  was  made to  the\r\n\ndistrict court for a downward departure and there is no clear\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n</pre>",
