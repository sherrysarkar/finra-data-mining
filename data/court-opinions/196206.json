Defendant Stephen Cardelli appeals the\r                                \r\n\nsentence imposed upon his convictions for federal tax evasion\r\n\nand conspiring to possess with intent to distribute more than\r\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n       In  September  1992,  a six-count  indictment  charged\r\n\nCardelli  with  two drug  offenses  and four  counts  of tax-\r\n\nevasion. Cardelli subsequently entered into  a plea agreement\r\n\nunder which he agreed to  plead guilty to counts one and  six\r\n\nof  the  indictment.   These  respectively  charged him  with\r\n\nconspiring to  possess with  intent to distribute  cocaine in\r\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and evasion\r\n\nof  federal income  taxes in violation  of 26  U.S.C.  7201.1\r\n\nCardelli  entered  his guilty  plea on  April  7, 1993.   His\r\n\nsentencing hearing was held on September 26, 1994.\r\n\n     At  the sentencing hearing,  Cardelli contested the drug\r\n\nquantity used to calculate his sentence under the United\r\n\nStates Sentencing  Guidelines (Nov.  1993).   While  Cardelli\r\n\ncould  not recall the precise amount of cocaine that he sold,\r\n\nhe  estimated it to  be an amount  below 15  kilograms.2  The\r\n\ngovernment  then called  DEA Agent  John Bryfonski,  the case\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The government agreed to  dismiss the remaining counts of\r\nthe indictment.  Cardelli  also agreed to cooperate  with the\r\ngovernment's investigative efforts.\r\n\n2.  The  Drug Quantity  Table of  the Guidelines,   2D1.1(c),\r\nassigned  a base offense level of 34 to offenses involving at\r\nleast 15 but less than 50 kilograms of cocaine. \r\r\n\nagent on the investigation that led to Cardelli's indictment.\r\n\nConsistent with  the  information in  the presentence  report\r\n\n(PSR), Bryfonski testified that between  May, 1988 and May or\r\n\nJune,  1989,  Cardelli  and  four others  participated  in  a\r\n\ncocaine  distribution  ring  that operated  in  the Portland,\r\n\nLewiston,  and  Auburn  areas  of Maine.3    Agent  Bryfonski\r\n\ntestified that Dan  and Randy Hicks  and Pizzi each  provided\r\n\nconsistent information to the government concerning the birth\r\n\nand subsequent  operation of the conspiracy.   Thus, sometime\r\n\nin  May,   1988,  the  five  conspirators   met  at  Giobbi's\r\n\nrestaurant in Portland and  agreed that Cardelli would supply\r\n\ncocaine to Dan and Randy Hicks who, in turn, would distribute\r\n\nit to Pizzi for retail sales.    \r\n\n     Dan  Hicks estimated  that  Cardelli  supplied him  with\r\n\napproximately 25-30 kilograms of cocaine during the course of\r\n\nthe  conspiracy.   Randy  Hicks,  who  often transported  the\r\n\ncocaine from  Portland to Lewiston/Auburn,  estimated that  a\r\n\ntotal of  20-25 kilograms was involved.  Pizzi indicated that\r\n\nhe received   approximately 35-40 kilograms during the course\r                                \r                                \r\n\n3.  The  other  individuals involved  in the  conspiracy were\r            of the  conspiracy.4  Bryfonski also  testified that Cardelli\r\nJonathan Singer,  who supplied  the cocaine to  Cardelli, Dan\r\nand Randy Hicks, a  father and son team who  obtained cocaine\r\nfrom Cardelli,  and Christopher  Pizzi, who  obtained cocaine\r\nfrom the  Hickses and distributed  it to retail  customers in\r\nthe Lewiston/Auburn area.  Although Singer was never charged,\r\nDan and Randy Hicks and Christopher Pizzi pled guilty to drug\r\noffenses arising from their conspiracy with Cardelli.   \r\n\n4.  When asked how Pizzi  knew that all of this  cocaine came\r\nfrom Cardelli, Bryfonski related  that Pizzi was occasionally\r\npresent  in  Cardelli's  business  office  when  distribution\r\nmatters were discussed.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nhimself  had  indicated during  his debriefing  sessions with\r\n\ngovernment agents that he had sold more than 15 kilograms.   \r\n\n     Cardelli did not testify at his sentencing hearing.   He\r\n\npresented   no  evidence  to   controvert  agent  Bryfonski's\r\n\ntestimony.   Defense  counsel  stated that  he would  like an\r\n\nopportunity  to  cross-examine  the coconspirators,  implying\r\n\nthat their  statements, particularly that of  Dan Hicks, were\r\n\nunreliable because  the  coconspirators had  all  been  given\r\n\nreduced   sentences  in  return  for  implicating  Cardelli.5\r\n\nRelying on agent Bryfonski's testimony and the information in\r\n\nthe  PSR,   the  district  judge  found   that  Cardelli  was\r\n\nresponsible for at least 15 kilograms of cocaine and that his\r\n\ncorresponding base  offense level was  34.6  While  the court\r\n\nacknowledged  that  agent   Bryfonski's  description  of  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  We note, however, that defense counsel neither subpoenaed\r\nthese witnesses, nor requested a continuance so that he might\r\nsecure their presence.  Yet it was apparent from the PSR that\r\nsubstantially more  than 15 kilograms had  been attributed to\r\nCardelli.   \r\n\n6.  The PSR attributed a total of 29.4 kilograms to Cardelli.\r\nThat  figure   was  based  on  evidence   that  Cardelli  had\r\ndistributed  a  total  of  27  kilograms  to  Dan  Hicks  for\r\nChristopher  Pizzi  and  evidence  that  Cardelli  also   had\r\nprovided an  additional 2000  grams to one  Phillip DiStefano\r\nfor distribution to Dan  Hicks.  The PSR also  indicated that\r\nCardelli  provided  an  additional  396.9  grams  to  another\r\nindividual  (Phillip  Gullifer).    Absent  evidence  to  the\r\ncontrary,\"[f]acts   contained   in   a   presentence   report\r\nordinarily  are considered  reliable evidence  for sentencing\r\npurposes.\"   United States v.  Morillo, 8 F.3d  864, 872 (1st\r                                                  \r\nCir. 1993).\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nconconspirators'  drug  quantity estimates  was  hearsay, the\r\n\ncourt found that this evidence was reliable because all three\r\n\ncoconspirators had  indicated that at least  15 kilograms had\r\n\nbeen  distributed during the course of the conspiracy.7      \r\n\n                                       Thus, starting  with a\r\n\nbase offense level of  34, the court added 2 points  based on\r\n\nCardelli's leadership  role in the conspiracy  and deducted 3\r\n\npoints based on his acceptance of responsibility to arrive at\r\n\na  total offense  level  of 33.    Applying criminal  history\r\n\ncategory II,  the court determined  that Cardelli's guideline\r\n\nsentencing  range was 151-188 months.  The court then allowed\r\n\nthe  government's motion  for a  downward departure  based on\r\n\nCardelli's  substantial cooperation (see U.S.S.G.  5K1.1) and\r                                                    \r\n\naccepted the  government's  sentencing recommendation.    The\r\n\ncourt sentenced  Cardelli to  108 months' imprisonment  and 5\r\n\nyears  of supervised release on the conspiracy count and to a\r\n\nconcurrent 60 months' imprisonment  and 3 years of supervised\r\n\nrelease  on the  tax evasion  charge.  Cardelli  appeals this\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n                             II. \r\n\n     Cardelli  maintains  that  the  district  court  made  a\r\n\nserious mistake by  basing its drug  quantity finding on  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The court specifically noted that it did not need to find\r\nthe precise number of kilograms that Cardelli had  sold since\r\nthe  court's finding  triggered  the base  offense level  for\r\ncrimes involving 15 to 50 kilograms.  See n. 2, supra.   \r                                                                 \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nhearsay  statements  of his  coconspirators  as  described in\r\n\nagent Bryfonski's  testimony.   Cardelli  implies that  these\r\n\ndescriptions are  nothing more than  \"drug filtered memories\"\r\n\nthat are all the more unreliable because they were not tested\r\n\nby cross-examination.   Cardelli  contends that the  district\r\n\ncourt  committed  clear  error   by  crediting  this  hearsay\r\n\nevidence without  requiring the coconspirators to  testify in\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n     We review the district court's findings on drug quantity\r\n\nonly for clear error.   See, e.g., United States  v. Whiting,\r                                                                        \r\n\n28 F.3d 1296,  1304 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 115  S.

Zuleta-Alvarez, 922  F.2d 33, 36-7\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 927 (1991).  We find\r                                          \r\n\nno  error here.   It  is well  established that,  \"[r]eliable\r                                                               [r]eliable\r\n\nhearsay  can  be  used   at  sentencing.\"  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nConnolly,  51   F.3d  1,  5  (1st   Cir.  1995)(holding  that\r                    \r\n\ncodefendants'  drug quantity  estimates  reported in  PSR and\r\n\ninvestigating officer's testimony were reliable hearsay where\r\n\nestimates  were  \"generally  consistent\").     Here,  as   in\r\n\nConnolly,  the  three coconspirators  consistently attributed\r                    \r\n\nmore  than  15  kilograms  of  cocaine  to  Cardelli.    This\r\n\nconsistency   was   sufficient    corroboration   that    the\r\n\ncoconspirators' estimates were reliable enough to support the\r\n\ncourt's  conservative finding  that Cardelli  was responsible\r\n\nfor  at  least  15  kilograms.    But  for  his  own  unsworn\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nstatements, Cardelli presented  no evidence to the  contrary.\r\n\nThe  district court  was  not required  to credit  Cardelli's\r\n\ncontrary  estimate,  see  Connolly, id.,  particularly  where\r                                                   \r\n\nCardelli presented  no evidence and conceded that  he did not\r\n\nrecall the precise amount that he had sold.  \r\n\n      We also do not  find any error in the  district court's\r\n\nacceptance of  the drug quantity estimates  reported by agent\r\n\nBryfonski   absent   direct    testimony   from    Cardelli's\r\n\ncoconspirators.   Although  the PSR  clearly  indicated  that\r\n\nthese  witnesses  had  knowledge  of  the  amounts  involved,\r\n\ndefense counsel  did not ask for  cross-examination until the\r\n\nday of Cardelli's sentencing hearing.  This was far too late.\r\n\nSee United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 36  (holding\r                                               \r\n\ndistrict  court did  not err  in denying  request for  cross-\r\n\nexamination made  at sentencing  hearing).  We  have reviewed\r\n\nthe  record thoroughly  and are  satisfied that  the district\r\n\ncourt's   quantity   determination   is   supported    by   a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence.  See United States v. Morillo,\r                                                                        \r\n\n8 F.3d at  871.

These respectively charged him with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.

While Cardelli could not recall the precise amount of cocaine that he sold, he estimated it to be an amount below 15 kilograms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The government then called DEA Agent John Bryfonski, the case agent on the investigation that led to Cardelli's indictment.  Consistent with the information in the presentence report (PSR), Bryfonski testified that between May, 1988 and May or June, 1989, Cardelli and four others participated in a cocaine distribution ring that operated in the Portland, Lewiston, and Auburn areas of Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Agent Bryfonski testified that Dan and Randy Hicks and Pizzi each provided consistent information to the government concerning the birth and subsequent operation of the conspiracy.

Randy Hicks, who often transported the cocaine from Portland to Lewiston/Auburn, estimated that a total of 20- 25 kilograms was involved.  Pizzi indicated that he received approximately 35-40 kilograms during the course of the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Bryfonski also testified that Cardelli himself had indicated during his debriefing sessions with government agents that he had sold more than 15 kilograms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardelli did not testify at his sentencing hearing.

It is well established that, \"[r]eliable hearsay can be used at sentencing.\"  United States v. Connolly, 51 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995)(holding that codefendants' drug quantity estimates reported in PSR and investigating officer's testimony were reliable hearsay where estimates were \"generally consistent\").  Here, as in Connolly, the three coconspirators consistently attributed more than 15 kilograms of cocaine to Cardelli.  This consistency was sufficient corroboration that the coconspirators' estimates were reliable enough to support the court's conservative finding that Cardelli was responsible for at least 15 kilograms.  But for his own unsworn statements, Cardelli presented no evidence to the contrary.  The district court was not required to credit Cardelli's contrary estimate, see Connolly, id., particularly where Cardelli presented no evidence and conceded that he did not recall the precise amount that he had sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also do not find any error in the district court's acceptance of the drug quantity estimates reported by agent Bryfonski absent direct testimony from Cardelli's coconspirators.

This was far too late.  See United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d at 36 (holding district court did not err in denying request for cross- examination made at sentencing hearing).

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1992, a six-count indictment charged Cardelli with two drug offenses and four counts of tax-evasion.  Cardelli subsequently entered into a plea agreement under which he agreed to plead guilty to counts one and six of the indictment.  These respectively charged him with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and evasion of federal income taxes in violation of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7201.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Cardelli entered his guilty plea on April 7, 1993.  His sentencing hearing was held on September 26, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, Cardelli contested the drug quantity used to calculate his sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (Nov. 1993).  While Cardelli could not recall the precise amount of cocaine that he sold, he estimated it to be an amount below 15 kilograms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The government then called DEA Agent John Bryfonski, the case agent on the investigation that led to Cardelli's indictment.  Consistent with the information in the presentence report (PSR), Bryfonski testified that between May, 1988 and May or June, 1989, Cardelli and four others participated in a cocaine distribution ring that operated in the Portland, Lewiston, and Auburn areas of Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Agent Bryfonski testified that Dan and Randy Hicks and Pizzi each provided consistent information to the government concerning the birth and subsequent operation of the conspiracy.  Thus, sometime in May, 1988, the five conspirators met at Giobbi's restaurant in Portland and agreed that Cardelli would supply cocaine to Dan and Randy Hicks who, in turn, would distribute it to Pizzi for retail sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dan Hicks estimated that Cardelli supplied him with approximately 25-30 kilograms of cocaine during the course of the conspiracy.  Randy Hicks, who often transported the cocaine from Portland to Lewiston/Auburn, estimated that a total of 20- 25 kilograms was involved.  Pizzi indicated that he received approximately 35-40 kilograms during the course of the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Bryfonski also testified that Cardelli himself had indicated during his debriefing sessions with government agents that he had sold more than 15 kilograms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardelli did not testify at his sentencing hearing.  He presented no evidence to controvert agent Bryfonski's testimony.  Defense counsel stated that he would like an opportunity to cross-examine the coconspirators, implying that their statements, particularly that of Dan Hicks, were unreliable because the coconspirators had all been given reduced sentences in return for implicating Cardelli.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Relying on agent Bryfonski's testimony and the information in the PSR, the district judge found that Cardelli was responsible for at least 15 kilograms of cocaine and that his corresponding base offense level was 34.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  While the court acknowledged that agent Bryfonski's description of the conconspirators' drug quantity estimates was hearsay, the court found that this evidence was reliable because all three coconspirators had indicated that at least 15 kilograms had been distributed during the course of the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, starting with a base offense level of 34, the court added 2 points based on Cardelli's leadership role in the conspiracy and deducted 3 points based on his acceptance of responsibility to arrive at a total offense level of 33.  Applying criminal history category II, the court determined that Cardelli's guideline sentencing range was 151-188 months.  The court then allowed the government's motion for a downward departure based on Cardelli's substantial cooperation (see U.S.S.G. Sec. 5K1.1) and accepted the government's sentencing recommendation.  The court sentenced Cardelli to 108 months' imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release on the conspiracy count and to a concurrent 60 months' imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release on the tax evasion charge.  Cardelli appeals this sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardelli maintains that the district court made a serious mistake by basing its drug quantity finding on the hearsay statements of his coconspirators as described in agent Bryfonski's testimony.
