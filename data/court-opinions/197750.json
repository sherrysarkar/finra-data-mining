Snyder\r\n\nappeals.  We affirm his conviction.1\r\n\n          The appellant  has  cultivated a  hothouse  of  issues.\r\n\nSome  are  hardier  than  others.   We  address  seven  of  them,\r\n\nrejecting the remainder    all of which are  patently meritless  \r\n\nwithout editorial  comment.   We discuss the  facts of  the case,\r\n\ninsofar  as necessary,  in  connection  with  our  discussion  of\r\n\nparticular issues.\r\n\n          1.   The  Events  of  January 8-10.    The  appellant's\r                    1.   The  Events  of  January 8-10.\r                                                      \r\n\nprincipal Fourth Amendment claim is that the Boston police lacked\r\n\nreasonable  suspicion  to  detain  him on  January  8,  1995, and\r\n\nlikewise lacked probable cause to arrest him on January 10, or to\r\n\nsearch a locked briefcase in the trunk of his car coincident with\r\n\nthe arrest.  On  this basis, he contends that the  district court\r\n\nerred in refusing to suppress  evidence obtained during and after\r\n\nthe  stop,  arrest, and  search.   We  review de  novo  the trial\r\n\ncourt's  determinations  of  reasonable  suspicion  and  probable\r\n\ncause, but defer to the trial court's subsidiary findings of fact\r\n\n(accepting those  findings unless  they  are clearly  erroneous).\r\n\nSee United States v. Young, 105 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                                    \r\n\n          The  governing  legal  standards are  familiar.    \"[A]\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In  a  separate cross-appeal,  No. 97-1233,  the government\r\nchallenges the district  court's leniency in sentencing.  The two\r\nappeals were consolidated  for purposes of oral  argument, but we\r\nhave elected to write a separate opinion for each.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\npolice  officer  may  in  appropriate  circumstances  and  in  an\r\n\nappropriate   manner   approach   a  person   for   purposes   of\r\n\ninvestigating  possibly criminal behavior even though there is no\r\n\nprobable cause to make an arrest.\"  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22\r                                                           \r\n\n(1968).   Such  an investigatory  stop  requires only  reasonable\r\n\nsuspicion, based on \"specific and articulable  facts,\" id. at 21,\r                                                                    \r\n\nthat,  viewed  through the  eyes  of  a  prudent police  officer,\r\n\nwarrant  the  intrusion.   Like  reasonable  suspicion, \"probable\r\n\ncause  is  a  fluid  concept     turning  on  the  assessment  of\r\n\nprobabilities  in  particular  factual contexts.\"    Illinois  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nGates,   462  U.S.  213,  232  (1983).    This  \"totality-of-the-\r               \r\n\ncircumstances\" approach \"recognize[s] the  value of corroboration\r\n\nof  details of an  informant's tip  by independent  police work.\"\r\n\nId. at 241.\r             \r\n\n          We need  not dwell  on the  events of  January  8.   It\r\n\nsuffices to say that the  district court's findings, made after a\r\n\nthree-day  evidentiary hearing,  are  plainly  supportable.   The\r\n\nrecord,  fairly read,  conduces  to  a  finding that  the  police\r\n\nprotagonist,  Officer Doogan, had  reasonable suspicion, based on\r\n\nspecific  and   articulable  facts,  sufficient   to  justify   a\r\n\nrelatively brief detention.\r\n\n          While we  dwell  at greater  length  on the  events  of\r\n\nJanuary  10, we  are  satisfied  that  a  m lange  of  adequately\r\n\ncorroborated information and circumstances generated the probable\r\n\ncause  necessary  for Doogan  to  arrest  Snyder  and search  his\r\n\nvehicle on that date.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          Snyder was not a stranger to Doogan, who had some prior\r\n\nsuspicions about Snyder's involvement in nefarious activities (as\r\n\nwitness the detention of January 8).  Doogan had learned,  by way\r\n\nof a tip  from an unnamed informant,  that on January  9, Snyder,\r\n\ndriving  a black  Honda, had  been in  possession of  a briefcase\r\n\ncontaining a  handgun.2   On January 10,  Doogan received  a page\r\n\nfrom John Hawk, an informant  who had occasionally worked for him\r\n\nin the  past.  Doogan  telephoned Hawk, who reported  that Snyder\r\n\nhad  just robbed  him at  gunpoint, stolen  a quantity  of Valium\r\n\ntablets, and  sped off in  a black  Honda accompanied by  a known\r\n\ncriminal (Diaferio).   Hawk also  said that the men  were heading\r\n\nfor Roslindale.   Doogan  knew that Diaferio  lived at  17 Murray\r\n\nHill Road, Roslindale, a known drug haven that had figured in the\r\n\nJanuary 8 detention.  Believing that the men were likely  to turn\r\n\nup at 17 Murray Hill  Road, Doogan arranged a police surveillance\r\n\nat that address.   Shortly thereafter, Snyder arrived,  driving a\r\n\nblack Honda and accompanied  by Diaferio.   He parked the car  on\r\n\nthe street.  At  this point, the police had enough information in\r\n\nsupport of Hawk's report to establish probable cause that Snyder,\r\n\na previously convicted  felon, had committed a crime  and that he\r\n\npossessed not only the avails of the robbery but also a handgun.\r\n\n          The officers  converged on Snyder and Diaferio, frisked\r\n\nthe two men,  and found no weapons.  They then searched the black\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Another  detective  passed  this  tip   to  Doogan,  having\r\ngarnered it from an informant  who worked with the federal Bureau\r\nof Alcohol,  Tobacco, and  Firearms and  the Massachusetts  State\r\nPolice.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nHonda.   The vehicle's trunk  yielded a briefcase.   Doogan shook\r\n\nthe briefcase  and felt something  heavy inside it.   When Doogan\r\n\npried  open the  corner  of  the locked  briefcase,  he saw  what\r\n\nappeared to  be a  gun.   Doogan then  forced the  lock open  and\r\n\nconfiscated  a  fully  loaded  Colt  semi-automatic  .32  caliber\r\n\npistol.  The police arrested Snyder and took him into custody.  A\r\n\nlater search  of his  person at  the station  house turned up  26\r\n\nValium tablets in his pants pocket.\r\n\n          The  search was  lawful.   Snyder parked  his car  on a\r\n\npublic highway.   A warrantless  search is justified even  in the\r\n\ncase of a stationary vehicle parked on a public road based on its\r\n\ninherent mobility and the reduced expectation of privacy afforded\r\n\nto  vehicles.   See California  v. Carney,  471 U.S.  386, 392-93\r                                                   \r\n\n(1985).   Thus,  under  a  recognized  exception  to  the  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment, a police  officer may search such a  vehicle without a\r\n\nwarrant if there  is probable cause to  believe that a crime  has\r\n\nbeen  committed  and  that  contraband  or  evidence  of  illegal\r\n\nactivities will  be found there.   See Carroll v.  United States,\r                                                                          \r\n\n267 U.S.  132, 153-54 (1925);  United States v. Panitz,  907 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1267,  1271 (1st  Cir. 1990).   By the  same token,  a diminished\r\n\nexpectation of  privacy extends  to personal  property within  an\r\n\nautomobile.   If the police have  probable cause to search a car,\r\n\nthey also may inspect the interior of any closed container within\r\n\nit that reasonably might be thought to contain a proper object of\r\n\nthe  search.   See California  v. Acevedo,  500 U.S.  565, 579-80\r                                                   \r\n\n(1991); United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 823 (1982).\r                                       \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          These principles are dispositive  here.  As  previously\r\n\nindicated, Officer  Doogan had probable  cause to believe  that a\r\n\ncrime had been  committed and that  a search of the  Honda likely\r\n\nwould produce  evidence of it  (i.e., the Valium tablets  and the\r\n\ngun).  It follows that  Doogan had a right not only to search the\r\n\nHonda  for the  gun, but  also  to search  the briefcase  for it.\r\n\nAccordingly,  the  district court  did  not  err  in denying  the\r\n\nappellant's motion to suppress.\r\n\n          2.    Sufficiency  of  the  Evidence.    The  appellant\r                    2.    Sufficiency  of  the  Evidence.\r                                                        \r\n\nchallenges  the sufficiency  of the  government's proof,  arguing\r\n\nthat the  evidence  adduced  cannot  support a  finding  that  he\r\n\nknowingly possessed the  firearm.  This argument  is procedurally\r\n\ndefaulted.  See United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1206-07 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1994) (holding that grounds not urged below in support  of a\r\n\nmotion for judgment  of acquittal are  deemed waived on  appeal).\r\n\nThere  is,  of course,  an  exception  for  convictions that  are\r\n\n\"clearly and  grossly unjust,\"  id. at  1207, but  that exception\r                                             \r\n\ndoes not apply here.\r\n\n          Leaving procedural default to one side, the standard by\r\n\nwhich sufficiency challenges are reviewed is straightforward:\r\n\n          An appellate court plays a very circumscribed\r\n          role  in  gauging  the  sufficiency  of   the\r\n          evidentiary foundation upon  which a criminal\r\n          conviction  rests.    The  court  of  appeals\r\n          neither   weighs  the   credibility  of   the\r\n          witnesses nor attempts  to assess whether the\r\n          prosecution  succeeded  in  eliminating every\r\n          possible   theory    consistent   with    the\r\n          defendant's innocence.   Instead, its task is\r\n          to   canvass   the   evidence   (direct   and\r\n          circumstantial) in  the light  most agreeable\r\n          to  the prosecution  and decide  whether that\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          evidence, including all  plausible inferences\r\n          extractable  therefrom,  enables  a  rational\r\n          factfinder  to conclude  beyond a  reasonable\r\n          doubt  that   the  defendant   committed  the\r\n          charged crime.\r\n\nUnited  States  v.  Noah,  130  F.3d 490,  494  (1st  Cir.  1997)\r                                  \r\n\n(citations  omitted).   The evidence  in this case  easily passes\r\n\nmuster under the Noah test.  After all, the standard demands that\r                               \r\n\na reviewing court  resolve all credibility conflicts in  a manner\r\n\ncompatible with the  verdict.  See United States  v. Santiago, 83\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 20, 23  (1st Cir. 1996).   Here, a rational jury  could have\r\n\nchosen to  believe Hawk and  therefore could have found  not only\r\n\nconstructive possession, but also actual possession.\r\n\n          3.  Exculpatory  Evidence.  The appellant says that the\r                    3.  Exculpatory  Evidence.\r                                             \r\n\ngovernment failed  to disclose certain  exculpatory evidence,  in\r\n\nviolation of its  duty under Brady  v. Maryland, 373 U.S.  83, 87\r                                                         \r\n\n(1963).  This contention was  never raised in the district court;\r\n\nand, moveover, the record indicates that the evidence in question\r\n\nin fact  was made  known to the  appellant before  or during  the\r\n\ntrial.   Consequently, his  complaint is for  delayed disclosure,\r\n\nrather than non-disclosure, and he has utterly failed to show any\r\n\nprejudice stemming from the delay.   The claim of error therefore\r\n\nfails.  See  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d  1161, 1178 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1993).\r\n\n          4.   Jury Instructions.   The appellant  calumnizes the\r                    4.   Jury Instructions.\r                                          \r\n\ndistrict  court's   instruction  to  the  jury   on  constructive\r\n\npossession.  The challenged instruction is virtually identical to\r\n\nthat which we criticized in United States v. Booth, 111 F.3d 1, 2\r                                                            \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).  Here,  like in Booth, the defendant interjected\r                                                \r\n\nno contemporaneous objection  to the instruction, and  our review\r\n\nis for plain error.  See id.\r                                      \r\n\n          In Booth, we  concluded that the language  used, though\r                            \r\n\ninfelicitous,  did  not  require reversal.    We  reach  the same\r\n\nconclusion here.  Taking the charge as a whole, see United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Weston, 960 F.2d  212, 216 (1st Cir.  1992), and weighing  the\r                   \r\n\nstrength of the government's case   a case which, in our view, is\r\n\nstronger than that presented in Booth   we find that any error in\r                                               \r\n\nthe constructive possession instruction was harmless.\r\n\n          5.

It\r\n\nsuffices to say that the  district court's findings, made after a\r\n\nthree-day  evidentiary hearing,  are  plainly  supportable.   The\r\n\nrecord,  fairly read,  conduces  to  a  finding that  the  police\r\n\nprotagonist,  Officer Doogan, had  reasonable suspicion, based on\r\n\nspecific  and   articulable  facts,  sufficient   to  justify   a\r\n\nrelatively brief detention.\r\n\n          While we  dwell  at greater  length  on the  events  of\r\n\nJanuary  10, we  are  satisfied  that  a  m lange  of  adequately\r\n\ncorroborated information and circumstances generated the probable\r\n\ncause  necessary  for Doogan  to  arrest  Snyder  and search  his\r\n\nvehicle on that date.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          Snyder was not a stranger to Doogan, who had some prior\r\n\nsuspicions about Snyder's involvement in nefarious activities (as\r\n\nwitness the detention of January 8).  Doogan had learned,  by way\r\n\nof a tip  from an unnamed informant,  that on January  9, Snyder,\r\n\ndriving  a black  Honda, had  been in  possession of  a briefcase\r\n\ncontaining a  handgun.2   On January 10,  Doogan received  a page\r\n\nfrom John Hawk, an informant  who had occasionally worked for him\r\n\nin the  past.  Doogan  telephoned Hawk, who reported  that Snyder\r\n\nhad  just robbed  him at  gunpoint, stolen  a quantity  of Valium\r\n\ntablets, and  sped off in  a black  Honda accompanied by  a known\r\n\ncriminal (Diaferio).   Hawk also  said that the men  were heading\r\n\nfor Roslindale.   Doogan  knew that Diaferio  lived at  17 Murray\r\n\nHill Road, Roslindale, a known drug haven that had figured in the\r\n\nJanuary 8 detention.  Believing that the men were likely  to turn\r\n\nup at 17 Murray Hill  Road, Doogan arranged a police surveillance\r\n\nat that address.   Shortly thereafter, Snyder arrived,  driving a\r\n\nblack Honda and accompanied  by Diaferio.   He parked the car  on\r\n\nthe street.  At  this point, the police had enough information in\r\n\nsupport of Hawk's report to establish probable cause that Snyder,\r\n\na previously convicted  felon, had committed a crime  and that he\r\n\npossessed not only the avails of the robbery but also a handgun.\r\n\n          The officers  converged on Snyder and Diaferio, frisked\r\n\nthe two men,  and found no weapons.  They then searched the black\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Another  detective  passed  this  tip   to  Doogan,  having\r\ngarnered it from an informant  who worked with the federal Bureau\r\nof Alcohol,  Tobacco, and  Firearms and  the Massachusetts  State\r\nPolice.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nHonda.   The vehicle's trunk  yielded a briefcase.   Doogan shook\r\n\nthe briefcase  and felt something  heavy inside it.   When Doogan\r\n\npried  open the  corner  of  the locked  briefcase,  he saw  what\r\n\nappeared to  be a  gun.   Doogan then  forced the  lock open  and\r\n\nconfiscated  a  fully  loaded  Colt  semi-automatic  .32  caliber\r\n\npistol.  The police arrested Snyder and took him into custody.  A\r\n\nlater search  of his  person at  the station  house turned up  26\r\n\nValium tablets in his pants pocket.\r\n\n          The  search was  lawful.   Snyder parked  his car  on a\r\n\npublic highway.   A warrantless  search is justified even  in the\r\n\ncase of a stationary vehicle parked on a public road based on its\r\n\ninherent mobility and the reduced expectation of privacy afforded\r\n\nto  vehicles.

It follows that  Doogan had a right not only to search the\r\n\nHonda  for the  gun, but  also  to search  the briefcase  for it.\r\n\nAccordingly,  the  district court  did  not  err  in denying  the\r\n\nappellant's motion to suppress.\r\n\n          2.    Sufficiency  of  the  Evidence.    The  appellant\r                    2.    Sufficiency  of  the  Evidence.\r                                                        \r\n\nchallenges  the sufficiency  of the  government's proof,  arguing\r\n\nthat the  evidence  adduced  cannot  support a  finding  that  he\r\n\nknowingly possessed the  firearm.  This argument  is procedurally\r\n\ndefaulted.  See United States v. Neal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679500\"><a href=\"/opinion/679500/united-states-v-gary-p-neal-united-states-v-william-f-kenney-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1206-07 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1994) (holding that grounds not urged below in support  of a\r\n\nmotion for judgment  of acquittal are  deemed waived on  appeal).\r\n\nThere  is,  of course,  an  exception  for  convictions that  are\r\n\n\"clearly and  grossly unjust,\"  id. at  1207, but  that exception\r                                             \r\n\ndoes not apply here.\r\n\n          Leaving procedural default to one side, the standard by\r\n\nwhich sufficiency challenges are reviewed is straightforward:\r\n\n          An appellate court plays a very circumscribed\r\n          role  in  gauging  the  sufficiency  of   the\r\n          evidentiary foundation upon  which a criminal\r\n          conviction  rests.    The  court  of  appeals\r\n          neither   weighs  the   credibility  of   the\r\n          witnesses nor attempts  to assess whether the\r\n          prosecution  succeeded  in  eliminating every\r\n          possible   theory    consistent   with    the\r\n          defendant's innocence.   Instead, its task is\r\n          to   canvass   the   evidence   (direct   and\r\n          circumstantial) in  the light  most agreeable\r\n          to  the prosecution  and decide  whether that\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          evidence, including all  plausible inferences\r\n          extractable  therefrom,  enables  a  rational\r\n          factfinder  to conclude  beyond a  reasonable\r\n          doubt  that   the  defendant   committed  the\r\n          charged crime.\r\n\nUnited  States  v.  Noah,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197675\"><a href=\"/opinion/197675/united-states-v-noah/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  494  (1st  Cir.  1997)\r                                  \r\n\n(citations  omitted).   The evidence  in this case  easily passes\r\n\nmuster under the Noah test.  After all, the standard demands that\r                               \r\n\na reviewing court  resolve all credibility conflicts in  a manner\r\n\ncompatible with the  verdict.  See United States  v.

Here, a rational jury  could have\r\n\nchosen to  believe Hawk and  therefore could have found  not only\r\n\nconstructive possession, but also actual possession.\r\n\n          3.  Exculpatory  Evidence.  The appellant says that the\r                    3.  Exculpatory  Evidence.\r                                             \r\n\ngovernment failed  to disclose certain  exculpatory evidence,  in\r\n\nviolation of its  duty under Brady  v.

This contention was  never raised in the district court;\r\n\nand, moveover, the record indicates that the evidence in question\r\n\nin fact  was made  known to the  appellant before  or during  the\r\n\ntrial.   Consequently, his  complaint is for  delayed disclosure,\r\n\nrather than non-disclosure, and he has utterly failed to show any\r\n\nprejudice stemming from the delay.   The claim of error therefore\r\n\nfails.  See  United States v. Sepulveda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1178 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1993).\r\n\n          4.

Here,  like in Booth, the defendant interjected\r                                                \r\n\nno contemporaneous objection  to the instruction, and  our review\r\n\nis for plain error.  See id.\r                                      \r\n\n          In Booth, we  concluded that the language  used, though\r                            \r\n\ninfelicitous,  did  not  require reversal.    We  reach  the same\r\n\nconclusion here.  Taking the charge as a whole, see United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

The appellant's trial counsel did not object to any of\r\n\nthe remarks   and for good reason.  While all three practices are\r\n\nto be condemned, none of them occurred here.   We add only that a\r\n\ndefendant who  fails to lodge a contemporaneous  objection to the\r\n\nprosecution's  summation  is  in a  perilously  poor  position to\r\n\ncomplain that  a seemingly appropriate  comment conceivably could\r\n\nhave been  taken by  jurors in  some other  (improper) way.
