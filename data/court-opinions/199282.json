Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Jack J. Mikels, with whom Linda J. Keogh and Jack Mikels &\nAssociates were on brief for appellants.\n     Irving Brodsky for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                      February 23, 2001\n\f              LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.             The trial in the district court\n\nwas     about    the     breach     of     a        franchise   agreement     and     the\n\nreasonableness          of   a   liquidated          damages    clause.     The     court\n\nrefused to enforce the liquidated damages clause, deeming it a\n\npenalty.       We conclude that the court misallocated the burden of\n\nproof and lacked an adequate factual basis for its penalty\n\ndetermination.          We therefore vacate the judgment and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                                               I.\n\n              Bowen Investment Inc. (\"Bowen\"), a sub-franchisor of\n\nHoney    Dew     Associates,        Inc.       (\"Honey    Dew\"),    entered    into     a\n\nfranchise agreement with M & K Food Corporation (\"M & K\"), on\n\nJune     9,     1992.        This    contract          included    a   \"Supplemental\n\nAgreement,\" which amended the principal document's statement of\n\ndamages in the event of breach.                         Irwin and Adele Kay were\n\nguarantors of the agreement for M & K, which gave them the right\n\nto establish and operate a Honey Dew donut shop in Providence,\n\nRhode Island.       The term of the agreement was for 10 years.                       The\n\nKays expended over $240,000 to get the business up and running.\n\nHowever, due to personal financial difficulties, M & K became\n\ndelinquent in weekly franchise royalties and service fees in\n\namounts running just over $300.                      Bowen also cited operational\n\n                                           -2-\n\fproblems with the shop that breached the franchise agreement.\n\nAfter several warnings, including issuance of a default notice\n\nin February 1998, Bowen terminated the agreement on or about\n\nMarch 2, 1998.\n\n           Despite   receipt   of   the   termination    notice,   M   &   K\n\ncontinued using the Honey Dew trade marks and trade dress.             This\n\npractice   continued   until   the    district   court    preliminarily\n\nenjoined it on February 22, 1999, after a hearing.            M & K was\n\npermitted to continue operation of a generic doughnut shop in\n\nthe same leased location.\n\n           The district court awarded summary judgment to the\n\nplaintiffs on M & K's liability for trademark infringement and\n\nbreach of contract.    The court determined that Bowen had validly\n\nterminated the franchise agreement for M & K's chronic failure\n\nto make timely royalty payments even after notice and expiration\n\nof the cure period.    The court also ordered a hearing on damages\n\nand commented on the liquidated damages issue:\n\n           I recognize that plaintiffs want some sort\n           of remedy that is prescribed by the\n           franchise   agreement.      Whether   that's\n           appropriate or not, whether it results in a\n           penalty or forfeiture, is something the\n           Court will decide at a later time.      So I\n           will tell you now that I have no idea\n           whether I will impose damages on Count IV\n           [seeking enforcement of the supplemental\n           agreement on royalty payments in the event\n           of breach], and if I do what the amount will\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           be. But that will be determined at a later\n           time after proof and argument.\n\n           The district court held a hearing on damages on April\n\n14 and 15, 1999.      The court said nothing about its expectations\n\nfor proof on the liquidated damages clause at the outset of the\n\nhearing.    In opening remarks, the plaintiffs said they would\n\npresent    evidence   on   the   calculation   of   liquidated    damages\n\naccording to the formula established in the franchise agreement.\n\nThe court responded to this introduction by stating, \"you've got\n\nto prove your case. . . . You've got to make some proof here.\"\n\n           Bowen and Honey Dew sought liquidated damages for\n\nbreach in accord with the Supplemental Agreement entered into\n\nwith the franchisee.       These damages included \"all royalty and\n\nother payments which, but for the termination, would have been\n\ndue through the intended expiration of this Agreement.\"             These\n\ndamages were to be calculated as \"the average of the royalties\n\ndue for the calendar year ending prior to termination.\"                 The\n\nplaintiffs put on testimony to support this calculation of\n\ndamages,   demonstrating     how   the   average    royalties    from   the\n\nfranchise's history should be applied to the liquidated damages\n\nformula in the contract.         The plaintiffs waived recovery for\n\ntrademark infringement, stating that \"in light of the damages\n\nalready requested under the contract, we don't feel it's cost\n\neffective to proceed on the Lanham Act statutory damages.\"\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          In their case, the defendants did not challenge the\n\nliquidated   damages    calculations       of   the    plaintiffs      and   they\n\noffered no evidence to show that the liquidated damages clause\n\nworked a penalty.      Instead, they concentrated on aspects of the\n\nfranchisee-franchisor relationship that may have contributed to\n\nM & K's failure, including exclusion from promotions and the\n\nproximity of other Honey Dew franchises.              Both parties submitted\n\nevidence as to the amount of counsel fees at issue.\n\n          At the close of the evidence, the court said that the\n\nplaintiffs' \"failure of proof\" on the issue of actual damages\n\nand mitigation raised      \"a question as to whether that clause is\n\nvalid and should be enforced, and I think that's an issue\n\nneither side has truly addressed.\"          During the plaintiffs' final\n\nargument, the court said, \"I don't know if it's valid . . . .\n\n[I]t seems to me that there are penalty aspects to this.\"\n\nHearing this, the defendants echoed the judge's concern in their\n\nclosing argument: \"I have now, of course, the benefit of your\n\nHonor's   expressions     and    thinking       with    reference      to    [the\n\nliquidated   damages     clause],      .   .    .     this    clause    in    the\n\nsupplementary   agreement       is   nothing    short    of   a   confiscatory\n\nnature and a penalty.\"      In rebuttal, the plaintiffs complained\n\nabout this late injection of the penalty issue:\n\n          I assure the Court that had these issues\n          been raised prior to or during the trial, I\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            not only feel comfortable that we would have\n            been able to convince the Court that these\n            were fair and reasonable provisions both\n            then and now, but our entire case would have\n            been extremely different, and I feel that\n            it's, although I understand the Court's\n            hesitation in enforcing the clause, I feel\n            it's only fair to take the case as it was\n            presented to you and not penalize us for the\n            fact that we weren't really given an\n            opportunity   to   make    the   appropriate\n            arguments as to those issues and present the\n            proof as to those issues.\n\nIn light of these arguments, the court required post-trial\n\nmemoranda      on   enforcing   the   liquidated    damages   clause    and\n\ncalculating attorneys' fees.\n\n            The plaintiffs argued in their memorandum that the\n\ndefendants had waived the penalty as an affirmative defense.\n\n\"Significantly, the defendant in this litigation did not contest\n\nthe validity of the method of calculating liquidated damages. .\n\n. . [A] party seeking to invalidate a liquidated damages clause\n\nbears the burden of proving this affirmative defense.\"                  The\n\nplaintiffs also reiterated that if they had known the validity\n\nof the liquidated damages clause was in question, \"the entire\n\ncase   would    have   been   litigated     differently,   with   different\n\nwitnesses.\"\n\n            In their memorandum, the defendants asserted that the\n\nplaintiffs \"have the burden of demonstrating that the liquidated\n\ndamages provision is enforceable. . . . The plaintiffs failed to\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fprove that either the amount fixed was a reasonable forecast of\n\njust damages or that the harm caused would be incapable or\n\ndifficult to estimate.\"              Additionally, they stated that the\n\ndamages formula acts as a penalty because \"it is designed always\n\nto   assure   the    plaintiffs      more     than    their    actual       damages.\"\n\nFinally, the defendants asserted that, in seeking enforcement,\n\nthe plaintiffs failed to account for mitigation of damages by\n\nthe defendants.\n\n          After considering the evidence and the memoranda of\n\ncounsel, the court decided that the liquidated damages clause\n\nwas an unenforceable penalty and awarded nominal damages of one\n\ndollar   to   Bowen     and     Honey       Dew.       The    court     made      this\n\ndetermination pursuant to the law of Massachusetts, as specified\n\nby a choice of law provision in the contract.                      Because the term\n\nspecifying attorneys' fees and costs was part of the liquidated\n\ndamages clause in the supplemental agreement, the district court\n\nruled that it was also unenforceable.                   Both of these rulings\n\nwere erroneous.\n\n                                        II.\n\n          Plaintiffs argue on appeal that because M & K never\n\npled   explicitly     that     the   liquidated       damages       clause    was   an\n\nunenforceable       penalty,    they    have       waived    any    claim    to   this\n\naffirmative defense.         Although failure to plead an affirmative\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdefense generally \"results in its waiver and exclusion from the\n\ncase,\"   Boston Hides & Furs, Ltd. v. Sumitomo Bank, Ltd., 870 F.\n\nSupp. 1153, 1161 (D. Mass. 1994), the defendants' pleadings in\n\nthis case provided notice of the penalty defense.               They state\n\nthat   the   relief    plaintiffs   seek   would    \"present    a   definite\n\nforfeiture of defendants' business and their immense investment;\n\nand by every principle of equity and justice, such forfeiture\n\nshould not be enforced.\"          In context, this defense primarily\n\ncontests the fairness of stripping the franchise of the Honey\n\nDew trade name and prohibiting further operation of a doughnut\n\nbusiness at the existing site.        Still, this statement indicates\n\nthe defendants' concern that the relief that could be awarded to\n\nthe plaintiffs would constitute a penalty.           Moreover, the judge\n\nunderstood the presence in this case of the penalty defense to\n\nthe claim of damages.         Again, as the court stated at the close\n\nof the liability phase of the case, almost three months before\n\nthe hearing on damages, \"I recognize that plaintiffs want some\n\nsort of remedy that is prescribed by the franchise agreement.\n\nWhether that's appropriate or not, whether it results in a\n\npenalty or forfeiture, is something the Court will decide at a\n\nlater time.\"\n\n             Under    these   circumstances,   we    conclude       that   the\n\ndefendants did not waive the penalty defense to the enforcement\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fof the liquidated damages clause in their pleadings.                  At trial,\n\nhowever, they failed to present evidence on the enforceability\n\nof the liquidated damages clause.              So did the plaintiffs.          We\n\nnow assess the significance of this odd circumstance.\n\n                                      III.\n\n          Not surprisingly, the court revealed some uncertainty\n\nabout whether the plaintiffs had the burden of proving that the\n\nliquidated damages clause in the franchise agreement did not\n\nimpose an unenforceable penalty, or whether the defendants had\n\nthe   burden   of    proving   that    it     did.     In    their   post-trial\n\nmemorandum,    the    plaintiffs      cited    law    from    New    Jersey   and\n\nConnecticut in support of their assertion that the defendants\n\nhad the burden of proving that the liquidated damages clause\n\nimposed an unenforceable penalty.            See Naporano Associates, L.P.\n\nv. B & P Builders, 706 A.2d 1123 (N.J. Super. 1998); Norwalk\n\nDoor Closer Co. v. Eagle Lock & Screw Co., 220 A.2d 263 (Conn.\n\n1966).    Defendants cited law from Maine in support of their\n\ninsistence that the plaintiffs had to prove that a liquidated\n\ndamage clause did not impose such a penalty.                   See Pacheco v.\n\nScoblionko, 532 A.2d 1036 (Me. 1987).1               Neither party cited the\n\n\n\n      1\n      The court in this case recognized, however, that while few\njurisdictions have addressed the issue, \"an apparent majority\"\nfavor the view that the party challenging the liquidated damages\nprovision bears the burden of proof. Id. at 1038-39.\n\n                                      -9-\n\flaw of Massachusetts.           So far as we can discern, there is no\n\ndefinitive statement by the Massachusetts courts on this issue.\n\nAt most, we find cases stating that defendants who challenged\n\ncontract enforcement on the basis of illegality or a violation\n\nof   public    policy    have   the     burden   to     raise    and    prove   that\n\ndefense.      See Fedenyszen v. Pollano, No. 9413, 1997 WL 382114 at\n\n*2   (Mass.    App.     Ct.   June     25,   1997)    (relating        to   contract\n\nenforcement: \"The burden was on the defendant to raise and prove\n\nthe affirmative defense of illegality or a violation of public\n\npolicy.\")      We also find a federal district court case which\n\nassigns the burden of demonstrating unenforceability to the\n\nparty hoping to avoid enforcement of the contract.                          See New\n\nEngland Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Stuzin, No. 86-2470-S, 1990 U.S.\n\nDist.   Lexis    13137    *13    (D.    Mass.    Oct.    1,     1990)    (regarding\n\nmaterial issues surrounding enforceability of liquidated damages\n\nclauses, \"defendants have the burden of proof.\").\n\n            Our search of the treatises and academic literature\n\nleads us to the conclusion that the prevailing rule is that the\n\nparty challenging the enforceability of a liquidated damages\n\nclause has the burden of proving that it is a penalty.                        \"[T]he\n\ntrend toward increased enforcement of stipulated damages is also\n\nencouraged by a shifting of the burden of proof to the party who\n\nasserts the existence of an unlawful penalty.                           The shifted\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fburden of proof, enacted by statute in some states, has probably\n\nnow    become       the    majority      rule,    replacing      the     earlier    rule\n\nrequiring the enforcer of a contract to prove the absence of an\n\nunlawful penalty.\"                Joseph F.

See Losacco v.\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fF.D. Rich Construction Co., Inc., 992 F.2d 382, 384 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) (\"When the highest state court has not issued a definitive\n\nruling on the precise issue at hand, the federal courts may\n\nrefer to analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works,\n\nor other reliable sources to ascertain how the highest court\n\nwould rule.\").      For that reason, we conclude that the trial\n\ncourt erred in requiring that the plaintiffs prove that the\n\nliquidated    damages   clause   did   not   impose   a   penalty   on   the\n\ndefendants.\n\n          In addition, we note that the district court decided\n\nthe penalty issue without the benefit of any pertinent evidence.\n\nFor example, after observing that plaintiff Bowen “was relieved\n\nof its duties under the Franchise Agreement as a consequence of\n\nM & K's default and termination,” the court wrote in its opinion\n\nthat “[c]ommon sense dictates that Bowen will save an unstated\n\namount because it does not have to supervise the operation of\n\nthe shop and regularly send personnel to Rhode Island to ensure\n\nthat M & K complies with the Franchise Agreement (for example,\n\nthe sanitary standards set forth in Honey Dew's policies).”              The\n\ncourt   similarly   emphasized    that   the    damages    clause   is    an\n\nunenforceable penalty “because, at the time the agreement was\n\nmade, it was not a reasonable estimation of the potential loss\n\nwhich would occur if there was breach and termination of the\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fFranchise Agreement.”         The court explained this conclusion on\n\nthe basis of logic and inference:\n\n           Under the terms of the franchise agreement,\n           royalties were to be paid to plaintiffs on a\n           monthly basis to June 8, 2002. It was known\n           at the time of contracting that if M & K had\n           defaulted under the terms of the Franchise\n           Agreement and it was terminated, the loss\n           sustained by Bowen would be some small\n           unknown amount every month through to the\n           expiration date of the agreement.         To\n           require M & K to make all of those future\n           payments in one lump sum as of the time of\n           termination cannot reasonably be viewed as\n           compensation for Bowen's loss, but rather as\n           a penalty for the breach since there is no\n           provision for discounting the amount to\n           present value.    Consequently, the damages\n           clause   calls  for   the   payment  of   an\n           unconscionable penalty.\n\n           In the circumstances of this case, these judgments\n\nbased on common sense and logic should have been informed by an\n\nunderstanding     of    the   factual   predicates       for    the   liquidated\n\ndamages    clause.       Determining    the    validity     of    a   liquidated\n\ndamages clause is usually a fact-specific exercise.                     See A-Z\n\nServicenter, Inc. v. Segall, 138 N.E.2d 266, 268 (Mass. 1956);\n\nZapatha v. Dairy Mart, Inc., 408 N.E.2d 1370, 1374-75 (Mass.\n\n1980).    In the relevant commercial code context, when there are\n\nclaims of unconscionable contract provisions, Massachusetts law\n\nrequires   that     “the   parties   shall     be   afforded      a   reasonable\n\nopportunity    to      present   evidence     as    to   [the    contract's   or\n\nclause's] commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the\n\n                                     -13-\n\fcourt in making its determination.”          Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, §\n\n2-302(2).2\n\n          In their post-trial memorandum, the plaintiffs noted\n\ncorrectly the absence in the record of evidence on the penalty\n\nissue: \"[A]t trial, there was no evidence presented as to either\n\nnegotiations or intention, making it virtually impossible to\n\nsecond guess whether the provision was reasonable at the time it\n\nwas negotiated.”3      They go on to suggest the types of evidence\n\nthey would have offered to defend against a claim that the\n\nclause constituted a penalty: \"actual damages, the projected\n\nroyalty stream over the remainder of the contractual term, the\n\npresent   value   of   the   damages   and    the   factors   which   were\n\nconsidered in establishing the liquidated damages clause.\"              In\n\n\n\n     2Massachusetts courts dealing with claims of unconscionable\ncontract terms have recognized the relevance of the Uniform\nCommercial Code provisions in analyzing the claims before them\neven if the contract was not covered by the Code. See Zapatha,\n408 N.E.2d at 1374-75 (invoking the provisions of the sales\narticle regarding good faith and unconscionability by analogy,\nwhile recognizing that franchise agreements may be distinct from\ncontracts for sale of items).\n     3 Under Massachusetts law, \"a judge, in determining the\nenforceability of a liquidated damages clause, should examine\nonly the circumstances at contract formation. Our position is\nthat 'where actual damages are difficult to ascertain and where\nthe sum agreed upon by the parties at the time of the execution\nof the contract represents a reasonable estimate of the actual\ndamages, such a contract will be enforced.'\" Kelly v. Marx, 705\nN.E.2d 1114, 1117 (Mass. 1999) (quoting A-Z Servicenter, Inc. v.\nSegall, 138 N.E.2d 266, 268 (Mass. 1956)).\n\n                                 -14-\n\fthe plaintiffs' brief on appeal, they cite \"a variety of factors\n\non both sides which could have been considered in selecting the\n\nformula to which the parties agreed.\"           The court needed to hear\n\nevidence about these factors before deciding the penalty issue.4\n\n           We recognize that the defendants did not present any\n\nevidence   on   the   unenforceability     of   the   liquidated   damages\n\nclause.    Arguably, given this absence of evidence, and our\n\nconclusion that the defendants have the burden of proving that\n\nthe clause imposes an unenforceable penalty, we should vacate\n\nthe judgment of the court and order the entry of judgment for\n\nthe   plaintiffs.     We   reject   that   conclusion,    however.     The\n\nconfusion about the proper allocation of the burden of proof on\n\nthe enforceability of the liquidated damages clause hampered\n\nboth parties in properly addressing the issue.               Indeed, the\n\ncourt's insistence about the plaintiffs' responsibility to prove\n\nthat the clause was not a penalty may have lulled the defendants\n\ninto complacency about their evidentiary burden on this issue.\n\n\n\n      4\n      In characterizing the liquidated damages provision as an\nacceleration clause, the court wrote, \"it is well settled law\nthat other than in a mortgage or security agreement situation,\n'an acceleration clause cannot be viewed as one for liquidated\ndamages if the full amount owing cannot be an estimate of the\ntrue extent of the damages sustained upon the breach.'\"\n(citation omitted).   Without considering evidence, the court\nconcluded that the liquidated damages clause could not be an\nestimate of the true cost of the breach and thus was\nunenforceable. Again, this conclusion required evidence.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fWe conclude, therefore, that the fairest outcome to both parties\n\nis a remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                    IV.\n\nFees and costs\n\n           The district court concluded that \"[Bowen's] claim for\n\ncounsel fees is based solely on the last sentence of the damages\n\nclause.\"   Because it \"declared that clause unenforceable and the\n\ncounsel fee provision is an integral part thereof, counsel fees\n\nare not recoverable in this case.\"        We disagree.     The sentence\n\nmaking the franchisee \"liable for all costs resulting from its\n\ndefault and all costs of collection including reasonable counsel\n\nfees\" is not integral to the liquidated damages clause.           Indeed,\n\nthere was no indication at trial that this term was troubling to\n\nthe   court,    even    if   the   liquidated   damages    clause      was.5\n\nAccordingly, with the plaintiffs having prevailed on liability,\n\nthe   court    should   award   reasonable   costs   and   fees   to    the\n\nplaintiffs on remand for the litigation to date, with additional\n\ncosts and fees to be awarded to the plaintiffs for the pending\n\npenalty litigation if they prevail on that issue.\n\n\n\n\n      5The district court requested post-trial briefs from the\nparties on whether the fees should be calculated pursuant to\nRhode Island or Massachusetts rates. Neither party indicated\nthat this term might be unenforceable as part of an invalidated\nliquidated damages clause.\n\n                                   -16-\n\f         Judgment vacated.      Remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

We therefore vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowen Investment Inc. (\"Bowen\"), a sub-franchisor of Honey Dew Associates, Inc. (\"Honey Dew\"), entered into a franchise agreement with M &amp; K Food Corporation (\"M &amp; K\"), on June 9, 1992. This contract included a \"Supplemental Agreement,\" which amended the principal document's statement of damages in the event of breach. Irwin and Adele Kay were guarantors of the agreement for M &amp; K, which gave them the right to establish and operate a Honey Dew donut shop in Providence, Rhode Island. The term of the agreement was for 10 years. The Kays expended over $240,000 to get the business up and running. However, due to personal financial difficulties, M &amp; K became delinquent in weekly franchise royalties and service fees in amounts running just over $300. Bowen also cited operational problems with the shop that breached the franchise agreement. After several warnings, including issuance of a default notice in February 1998, Bowen terminated the agreement on or about March 2, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite receipt of the termination notice, M &amp; K continued using the Honey Dew trade marks and trade dress. This practice continued until the district court preliminarily enjoined it on February 22, 1999, after a hearing. M &amp; K was permitted to continue operation of a generic doughnut shop in the same leased location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded summary judgment to the plaintiffs on M &amp; K's liability for trademark infringement and breach of contract. The court determined that Bowen had validly terminated the franchise agreement for M &amp; K's chronic failure to make timely royalty payments even after notice and expiration of the cure period. The court also ordered a hearing on damages and commented on the liquidated damages issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize that plaintiffs want some sort of remedy that is prescribed by the franchise agreement. Whether that's appropriate or not, whether it results in a penalty or forfeiture, is something the Court will decide at a later time. So I will tell you now that I have no idea whether I will impose damages on Count IV [seeking enforcement of the supplemental agreement on royalty payments in the event of breach], and if I do what the amount will be. But that will be determined at a later time after proof and argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing on damages on April 14 and 15, 1999. The court said nothing about its expectations for proof on the liquidated damages clause at the outset of the hearing. In opening remarks, the plaintiffs said they would present evidence on the calculation of liquidated damages according to the formula established in the franchise agreement. The court responded to this introduction by stating, \"you've got to prove your case. . . . You've got to make some proof here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowen and Honey Dew sought liquidated damages for breach in accord with the Supplemental Agreement entered into with the franchisee. These damages included \"all royalty and other payments which, but for the termination, would have been due through the intended expiration of this Agreement.\" These damages were to be calculated as \"the average of the royalties due for the calendar year ending prior to termination.\" The plaintiffs put on testimony to support this calculation of damages, demonstrating how the average royalties from the franchise's history should be applied to the liquidated damages formula in the contract. The plaintiffs waived recovery for trademark infringement, stating that \"in light of the damages already requested under the contract, we don't feel it's cost effective to proceed on the Lanham Act statutory damages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their case, the defendants did not challenge the liquidated damages calculations of the plaintiffs and they offered no evidence to show that the liquidated damages clause worked a penalty. Instead, they concentrated on aspects of the franchisee-franchisor relationship that may have contributed to M &amp; K's failure, including exclusion from promotions and the proximity of other Honey Dew franchises. Both parties submitted evidence as to the amount of counsel fees at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the evidence, the court said that the plaintiffs' \"failure of proof\" on the issue of actual damages and mitigation raised \"a question as to whether that clause is valid and should be enforced, and I think that's an issue neither side has truly addressed.\" During the plaintiffs' final argument, the court said, \"I don't know if it's valid . . . . [I]t seems to me that there are penalty aspects to this.\" Hearing this, the defendants echoed the judge's concern in their closing argument: \"I have now, of course, the benefit of your Honor's expressions and thinking with reference to [the liquidated damages clause], . . . this clause in the supplementary agreement is nothing short of a confiscatory nature and a penalty.\" In rebuttal, the plaintiffs complained about this late injection of the penalty issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I assure the Court that had these issues been raised prior to or during the trial, I not only feel comfortable that we would have been able to convince the Court that these were fair and reasonable provisions both then and now, but our entire case would have been extremely different, and I feel that it's, although I understand the Court's hesitation in enforcing the clause, I feel it's only fair to take the case as it was presented to you and not penalize us for the fact that we weren't really given an opportunity to make the appropriate arguments as to those issues and present the proof as to those issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these arguments, the court required post-trial memoranda on enforcing the liquidated damages clause and calculating attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argued in their memorandum that the defendants had waived the penalty as an affirmative defense. \"Significantly, the defendant in this litigation did not contest the validity of the method of calculating liquidated damages. . . . [A] party seeking to invalidate a liquidated damages clause bears the burden of proving this affirmative defense.\" The plaintiffs also reiterated that if they had known the validity of the liquidated damages clause was in question, \"the entire case would have been litigated differently, with different witnesses.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their memorandum, the defendants asserted that the plaintiffs \"have the burden of demonstrating that the liquidated damages provision is enforceable. . . . The plaintiffs failed to prove that either the amount fixed was a reasonable forecast of just damages or that the harm caused would be incapable or difficult to estimate.\" Additionally, they stated that the damages formula acts as a penalty because \"it is designed always to assure the plaintiffs more than their actual damages.\" Finally, the defendants asserted that, in seeking enforcement, the plaintiffs failed to account for mitigation of damages by the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the evidence and the memoranda of counsel, the court decided that the liquidated damages clause was an unenforceable penalty and awarded nominal damages of one dollar to Bowen and Honey Dew. The court made this determination pursuant to the law of Massachusetts, as specified by a choice of law provision in the contract. Because the term specifying attorneys' fees and costs was part of the liquidated damages clause in the supplemental agreement, the district court ruled that it was also unenforceable. Both of these rulings were erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue on appeal that because M &amp; K never pled explicitly that the liquidated damages clause was an unenforceable penalty, they have waived any claim to this affirmative defense. Although failure to plead an affirmative defense generally \"results in its waiver and exclusion from the case,\" Boston Hides &amp; Furs, Ltd. v. Sumitomo Bank, Ltd., 870 F. Supp. 1153, 1161 (D. Mass. 1994), the defendants' pleadings in this case provided notice of the penalty defense. They state that the relief plaintiffs seek would \"present a definite forfeiture of defendants' business and their immense investment; and by every principle of equity and justice, such forfeiture should not be enforced.\" In context, this defense primarily contests the fairness of stripping the franchise of the Honey Dew trade name and prohibiting further operation of a doughnut business at the existing site. Still, this statement indicates the defendants' concern that the relief that could be awarded to the plaintiffs would constitute a penalty. Moreover, the judge understood the presence in this case of the penalty defense to the claim of damages. Again, as the court stated at the close of the liability phase of the case, almost three months before the hearing on damages, \"I recognize that plaintiffs want some sort of remedy that is prescribed by the franchise agreement. Whether that's appropriate or not, whether it results in a penalty or forfeiture, is something the Court will decide at a later time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we conclude that the defendants did not waive the penalty defense to the enforcement of the liquidated damages clause in their pleadings. At trial, however, they failed to present evidence on the enforceability of the liquidated damages clause. So did the plaintiffs. We now assess the significance of this odd circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, the court revealed some uncertainty about whether the plaintiffs had the burden of proving that the liquidated damages clause in the franchise agreement did not impose an unenforceable penalty, or whether the defendants had the burden of proving that it did. In their post-trial memorandum, the plaintiffs cited law from New Jersey and Connecticut in support of their assertion that the defendants had the burden of proving that the liquidated damages clause imposed an unenforceable penalty. See Naporano Associates, L.P. v. B &amp; P Builders, 706 A.2d 1123 (N.J. Super. 1998); Norwalk Door Closer Co. v. Eagle Lock &amp; Screw Co., 220 A.2d 263 (Conn. 1966). Defendants cited law from Maine in support of their insistence that the plaintiffs had to prove that a liquidated damage clause did not impose such a penalty. See Pacheco v. Scoblionko, 532 A.2d 1036 (Me. 1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Neither party cited the law of Massachusetts. So far as we can discern, there is no definitive statement by the Massachusetts courts on this issue. At most, we find cases stating that defendants who challenged contract enforcement on the basis of illegality or a violation of public policy have the burden to raise and prove that defense. See Fedenyszen v. Pollano, No. 9413, 1997 WL 382114 at *2 (Mass. App. Ct. June 25, 1997) (relating to contract enforcement: \"The burden was on the defendant to raise and prove the affirmative defense of illegality or a violation of public policy.\") We also find a federal district court case which assigns the burden of demonstrating unenforceability to the party hoping to avoid enforcement of the contract. See New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Stuzin, No. 86-2470-S, 1990 U.S. Dist. Lexis 13137 *13 (D. Mass. Oct. 1, 1990) (regarding material issues surrounding enforceability of liquidated damages clauses, \"defendants have the burden of proof.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our search of the treatises and academic literature leads us to the conclusion that the prevailing rule is that the party challenging the enforceability of a liquidated damages clause has the burden of proving that it is a penalty. \"[T]he trend toward increased enforcement of stipulated damages is also encouraged by a shifting of the burden of proof to the party who asserts the existence of an unlawful penalty. The shifted burden of proof, enacted by statute in some states, has probably now become the majority rule, replacing the earlier rule requiring the enforcer of a contract to prove the absence of an unlawful penalty.\" Joseph F. Brodley &amp; Ching-to Albert Ma, Contract Penalties, Monopolizing Strategies, and Antitrust Policy, 45 Stan. L. Rev. 1161, 1179 (1993) (citing 25A C.J.S. Damages &#167; 144(f) (1966)). See also Melvin Aron Eisenberg, The Limits of Cognition and the Limits of Contract, 47 Stan. L. Rev. 211, 236 (1995) (\"[A] liquidated damages provision should relieve the plaintiff of the burden of proving damages, by shifting to the defendant the burden of establishing that the liquidated damages provision is unenforceable.); 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages &#167; 905 (1999) (\"[W]here the contract contains a liquidated damages clause, the party seeking to repudiate that clause must show that agreed damage is so exorbitant as to be in [the] nature of a penalty.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this authority, and the Massachusetts precedents cited above dealing with proof of the unenforceability of contracts in other contexts, we conclude that if the Massachusetts Supreme Court were required to decide the issue before us definitively, it would assign the burden of proving the unenforceability of a liquidated damages clause to the party raising that defense (here, the defendants). See Losacco v. F.D. Rich Construction Co., Inc., 992 F.2d 382, 384 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"When the highest state court has not issued a definitive ruling on the precise issue at hand, the federal courts may refer to analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works, or other reliable sources to ascertain how the highest court would rule.\"). For that reason, we conclude that the trial court erred in requiring that the plaintiffs prove that the liquidated damages clause did not impose a penalty on the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we note that the district court decided the penalty issue without the benefit of any pertinent evidence. For example, after observing that plaintiff Bowen \"was relieved of its duties under the Franchise Agreement as a consequence of M &amp; K's default and termination,\" the court wrote in its opinion that \"[c]ommon sense dictates that Bowen will save an unstated amount because it does not have to supervise the operation of the shop and regularly send personnel to Rhode Island to ensure that M &amp; K complies with the Franchise Agreement (for example, the sanitary standards set forth in Honey Dew's policies).\" The court similarly emphasized that the damages clause is an unenforceable penalty \"because, at the time the agreement was made, it was not a reasonable estimation of the potential loss which would occur if there was breach and termination of the Franchise Agreement.\" The court explained this conclusion on the basis of logic and inference:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the franchise agreement, royalties were to be paid to plaintiffs on a monthly basis to Junea8, 2002. It was known at the time of contracting that if M &amp; K had defaulted under the terms of the Franchise Agreement and it was terminated, the loss sustained by Bowen would be some small unknown amount every month through to the expiration date of the agreement. To require M &amp; K to make all of those future payments in one lump sum as of the time of termination cannot reasonably be viewed as compensation for Bowen's loss, but rather as a penalty for the breach since there is no provision for discounting the amount to present value. Consequently, the damages clause calls for the payment of an unconscionable penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances of this case, these judgments based on common sense and logic should have been informed by an understanding of the factual predicates for the liquidated damages clause. Determining the validity of a liquidated damages clause is usually a fact-specific exercise. See A-Z Servicenter, Inc. v. Segall, 138 N.E.2d 266, 268 (Mass. 1956); Zapatha v. Dairy Mart, Inc., 408 N.E.2d 1370, 1374-75 (Mass. 1980). In the relevant commercial code context, when there are claims of unconscionable contract provisions, Massachusetts law requires that \"the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to [the contract's or clause's] commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making its determination.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, &#167; 2-302(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their post-trial memorandum, the plaintiffs noted correctly the absence in the record of evidence on the penalty issue: \"[A]t trial, there was no evidence presented as to either negotiations or intention, making it virtually impossible to second guess whether the provision was reasonable at the time it was negotiated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> They go on to suggest the types of evidence they would have offered to defend against a claim that the clause constituted a penalty: \"actual damages, the projected royalty stream over the remainder of the contractual term, the present value of the damages and the factors which were considered in establishing the liquidated damages clause.\" In the plaintiffs' brief on appeal, they cite \"a variety of factors on both sides which could have been considered in selecting the formula to which the parties agreed.\" The court needed to hear evidence about these factors before deciding the penalty issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the defendants did not present any evidence on the unenforceability of the liquidated damages clause. Arguably, given this absence of evidence, and our conclusion that the defendants have the burden of proving that the clause imposes an unenforceable penalty, we should vacate the judgment of the court and order the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs. We reject that conclusion, however. The confusion about the proper allocation of the burden of proof on the enforceability of the liquidated damages clause hampered both parties in properly addressing the issue. Indeed, the court's insistence about the plaintiffs' responsibility to prove that the clause was not a penalty may have lulled the defendants into complacency about their evidentiary burden on this issue.

(\"Bowen\"), a sub-franchisor of Honey Dew Associates, Inc. (\"Honey Dew\"), entered into a franchise agreement with M &amp; K Food Corporation (\"M &amp; K\"), on June 9, 1992. This contract included a \"Supplemental Agreement,\" which amended the principal document's statement of damages in the event of breach. Irwin and Adele Kay were guarantors of the agreement for M &amp; K, which gave them the right to establish and operate a Honey Dew donut shop in Providence, Rhode Island. The term of the agreement was for 10 years. The Kays expended over $240,000 to get the business up and running. However, due to personal financial difficulties, M &amp; K became delinquent in weekly franchise royalties and service fees in amounts running just over $300. Bowen also cited operational problems with the shop that breached the franchise agreement. After several warnings, including issuance of a default notice in February 1998, Bowen terminated the agreement on or about March 2, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite receipt of the termination notice, M &amp; K continued using the Honey Dew trade marks and trade dress. This practice continued until the district court preliminarily enjoined it on February 22, 1999, after a hearing. M &amp; K was permitted to continue operation of a generic doughnut shop in the same leased location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded summary judgment to the plaintiffs on M &amp; K's liability for trademark infringement and breach of contract. The court determined that Bowen had validly terminated the franchise agreement for M &amp; K's chronic failure to make timely royalty payments even after notice and expiration of the cure period. The court also ordered a hearing on damages and commented on the liquidated damages issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize that plaintiffs want some sort of remedy that is prescribed by the franchise agreement. Whether that's appropriate or not, whether it results in a penalty or forfeiture, is something the Court will decide at a later time. So I will tell you now that I have no idea whether I will impose damages on Count IV [seeking enforcement of the supplemental agreement on royalty payments in the event of breach], and if I do what the amount will be. But that will be determined at a later time after proof and argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing on damages on April 14 and 15, 1999. The court said nothing about its expectations for proof on the liquidated damages clause at the outset of the hearing. In opening remarks, the plaintiffs said they would present evidence on the calculation of liquidated damages according to the formula established in the franchise agreement. The court responded to this introduction by stating, \"you've got to prove your case. . . . You've got to make some proof here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowen and Honey Dew sought liquidated damages for breach in accord with the Supplemental Agreement entered into with the franchisee. These damages included \"all royalty and other payments which, but for the termination, would have been due through the intended expiration of this Agreement.\" These damages were to be calculated as \"the average of the royalties due for the calendar year ending prior to termination.\" The plaintiffs put on testimony to support this calculation of damages, demonstrating how the average royalties from the franchise's history should be applied to the liquidated damages formula in the contract. The plaintiffs waived recovery for trademark infringement, stating that \"in light of the damages already requested under the contract, we don't feel it's cost effective to proceed on the Lanham Act statutory damages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their case, the defendants did not challenge the liquidated damages calculations of the plaintiffs and they offered no evidence to show that the liquidated damages clause worked a penalty. Instead, they concentrated on aspects of the franchisee-franchisor relationship that may have contributed to M &amp; K's failure, including exclusion from promotions and the proximity of other Honey Dew franchises. Both parties submitted evidence as to the amount of counsel fees at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the evidence, the court said that the plaintiffs' \"failure of proof\" on the issue of actual damages and mitigation raised \"a question as to whether that clause is valid and should be enforced, and I think that's an issue neither side has truly addressed.\" During the plaintiffs' final argument, the court said, \"I don't know if it's valid . . . . [I]t seems to me that there are penalty aspects to this.\" Hearing this, the defendants echoed the judge's concern in their closing argument: \"I have now, of course, the benefit of your Honor's expressions and thinking with reference to [the liquidated damages clause], . . . this clause in the supplementary agreement is nothing short of a confiscatory nature and a penalty.\" In rebuttal, the plaintiffs complained about this late injection of the penalty issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I assure the Court that had these issues been raised prior to or during the trial, I not only feel comfortable that we would have been able to convince the Court that these were fair and reasonable provisions both then and now, but our entire case would have been extremely different, and I feel that it's, although I understand the Court's hesitation in enforcing the clause, I feel it's only fair to take the case as it was presented to you and not penalize us for the fact that we weren't really given an opportunity to make the appropriate arguments as to those issues and present the proof as to those issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these arguments, the court required post-trial memoranda on enforcing the liquidated damages clause and calculating attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argued in their memorandum that the defendants had waived the penalty as an affirmative defense. \"Significantly, the defendant in this litigation did not contest the validity of the method of calculating liquidated damages. . . . [A] party seeking to invalidate a liquidated damages clause bears the burden of proving this affirmative defense.\" The plaintiffs also reiterated that if they had known the validity of the liquidated damages clause was in question, \"the entire case would have been litigated differently, with different witnesses.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their memorandum, the defendants asserted that the plaintiffs \"have the burden of demonstrating that the liquidated damages provision is enforceable. . . . The plaintiffs failed to prove that either the amount fixed was a reasonable forecast of just damages or that the harm caused would be incapable or difficult to estimate.\" Additionally, they stated that the damages formula acts as a penalty because \"it is designed always to assure the plaintiffs more than their actual damages.\" Finally, the defendants asserted that, in seeking enforcement, the plaintiffs failed to account for mitigation of damages by the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the evidence and the memoranda of counsel, the court decided that the liquidated damages clause was an unenforceable penalty and awarded nominal damages of one dollar to Bowen and Honey Dew. The court made this determination pursuant to the law of Massachusetts, as specified by a choice of law provision in the contract. Because the term specifying attorneys' fees and costs was part of the liquidated damages clause in the supplemental agreement, the district court ruled that it was also unenforceable. Both of these rulings were erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue on appeal that because M &amp; K never pled explicitly that the liquidated damages clause was an unenforceable penalty, they have waived any claim to this affirmative defense. Although failure to plead an affirmative defense generally \"results in its waiver and exclusion from the case,\" Boston Hides &amp; Furs, Ltd. v. Sumitomo Bank, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1647725\"><a href=\"/opinion/1647725/boston-hides-furs-ltd-v-sumitomo-bank-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span>, 1161 (D. Mass. 1994), the defendants' pleadings in this case provided notice of the penalty defense. They state that the relief plaintiffs seek would \"present a definite forfeiture of defendants' business and their immense investment; and by every principle of equity and justice, such forfeiture should not be enforced.\" In context, this defense primarily contests the fairness of stripping the franchise of the Honey Dew trade name and prohibiting further operation of a doughnut business at the existing site. Still, this statement indicates the defendants' concern that the relief that could be awarded to the plaintiffs would constitute a penalty. Moreover, the judge understood the presence in this case of the penalty defense to the claim of damages. Again, as the court stated at the close of the liability phase of the case, almost three months before the hearing on damages, \"I recognize that plaintiffs want some sort of remedy that is prescribed by the franchise agreement. Whether that's appropriate or not, whether it results in a penalty or forfeiture, is something the Court will decide at a later time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we conclude that the defendants did not waive the penalty defense to the enforcement of the liquidated damages clause in their pleadings. At trial, however, they failed to present evidence on the enforceability of the liquidated damages clause. So did the plaintiffs. We now assess the significance of this odd circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, the court revealed some uncertainty about whether the plaintiffs had the burden of proving that the liquidated damages clause in the franchise agreement did not impose an unenforceable penalty, or whether the defendants had the burden of proving that it did. In their post-trial memorandum, the plaintiffs cited law from New Jersey and Connecticut in support of their assertion that the defendants had the burden of proving that the liquidated damages clause imposed an unenforceable penalty. See Naporano Associates, L.P. v. B &amp; P Builders, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></span> (N.J.

Defendants cited law from Maine in support of their insistence that the plaintiffs had to prove that a liquidated damage clause did not impose such a penalty. See Pacheco v. Scoblionko, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></span> (Me. 1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Neither party cited the law of Massachusetts. So far as we can discern, there is no definitive statement by the Massachusetts courts on this issue. At most, we find cases stating that defendants who challenged contract enforcement on the basis of illegality or a violation of public policy have the burden to raise and prove that defense. See Fedenyszen v. Pollano, No. 9413, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">382114</span></span> at *2 (Mass. App. Ct. June 25, 1997) (relating to contract enforcement: \"The burden was on the defendant to raise and prove the affirmative defense of illegality or a violation of public policy.\") We also find a federal district court case which assigns the burden of demonstrating unenforceability to the party hoping to avoid enforcement of the contract. See New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Stuzin, No. 86-2470-S, 1990 U.S. Dist. Lexis 13137 *13 (D. Mass. Oct. 1, 1990) (regarding material issues surrounding enforceability of liquidated damages clauses, \"defendants have the burden of proof.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our search of the treatises and academic literature leads us to the conclusion that the prevailing rule is that the party challenging the enforceability of a liquidated damages clause has the burden of proving that it is a penalty. \"[T]he trend toward increased enforcement of stipulated damages is also encouraged by a shifting of the burden of proof to the party who asserts the existence of an unlawful penalty. The shifted burden of proof, enacted by statute in some states, has probably now become the majority rule, replacing the earlier rule requiring the enforcer of a contract to prove the absence of an unlawful penalty.\" Joseph F. Brodley &amp; Ching-to Albert Ma, Contract Penalties, Monopolizing Strategies, and Antitrust Policy, 45 Stan. L. Rev. 1161, 1179 (1993) (citing 25A C.J.S. Damages &#167; 144(f) (1966)). See also Melvin Aron Eisenberg, The Limits of Cognition and the Limits of Contract, 47 Stan. L. Rev. 211, 236 (1995) (\"[A] liquidated damages provision should relieve the plaintiff of the burden of proving damages, by shifting to the defendant the burden of establishing that the liquidated damages provision is unenforceable.); 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages &#167; 905 (1999) (\"[W]here the contract contains a liquidated damages clause, the party seeking to repudiate that clause must show that agreed damage is so exorbitant as to be in [the] nature of a penalty.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this authority, and the Massachusetts precedents cited above dealing with proof of the unenforceability of contracts in other contexts, we conclude that if the Massachusetts Supreme Court were required to decide the issue before us definitively, it would assign the burden of proving the unenforceability of a liquidated damages clause to the party raising that defense (here, the defendants). See Losacco v. F.D. Rich Construction Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605980\"><a href=\"/opinion/605980/frank-x-losacco-v-fd-rich-construction-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 384 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"When the highest state court has not issued a definitive ruling on the precise issue at hand, the federal courts may refer to analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works, or other reliable sources to ascertain how the highest court would rule.\"). For that reason, we conclude that the trial court erred in requiring that the plaintiffs prove that the liquidated damages clause did not impose a penalty on the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we note that the district court decided the penalty issue without the benefit of any pertinent evidence. For example, after observing that plaintiff Bowen \"was relieved of its duties under the Franchise Agreement as a consequence of M &amp; K's default and termination,\" the court wrote in its opinion that \"[c]ommon sense dictates that Bowen will save an unstated amount because it does not have to supervise the operation of the shop and regularly send personnel to Rhode Island to ensure that M &amp; K complies with the Franchise Agreement (for example, the sanitary standards set forth in Honey Dew's policies).\" The court similarly emphasized that the damages clause is an unenforceable penalty \"because, at the time the agreement was made, it was not a reasonable estimation of the potential loss which would occur if there was breach and termination of the Franchise Agreement.\" The court explained this conclusion on the basis of logic and inference:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the franchise agreement, royalties were to be paid to plaintiffs on a monthly basis to Junea8, 2002. It was known at the time of contracting that if M &amp; K had defaulted under the terms of the Franchise Agreement and it was terminated, the loss sustained by Bowen would be some small unknown amount every month through to the expiration date of the agreement. To require M &amp; K to make all of those future payments in one lump sum as of the time of termination cannot reasonably be viewed as compensation for Bowen's loss, but rather as a penalty for the breach since there is no provision for discounting the amount to present value. Consequently, the damages clause calls for the payment of an unconscionable penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances of this case, these judgments based on common sense and logic should have been informed by an understanding of the factual predicates for the liquidated damages clause. Determining the validity of a liquidated damages clause is usually a fact-specific exercise. See A-Z Servicenter, Inc. v. Segall, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></span>, 268 (Mass. 1956); Zapatha v.

In the relevant commercial code context, when there are claims of unconscionable contract provisions, Massachusetts law requires that \"the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to [the contract's or clause's] commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making its determination.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, &#167; 2-302(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their post-trial memorandum, the plaintiffs noted correctly the absence in the record of evidence on the penalty issue: \"[A]t trial, there was no evidence presented as to either negotiations or intention, making it virtually impossible to second guess whether the provision was reasonable at the time it was negotiated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> They go on to suggest the types of evidence they would have offered to defend against a claim that the clause constituted a penalty: \"actual damages, the projected royalty stream over the remainder of the contractual term, the present value of the damages and the factors which were considered in establishing the liquidated damages clause.\" In the plaintiffs' brief on appeal, they cite \"a variety of factors on both sides which could have been considered in selecting the formula to which the parties agreed.\" The court needed to hear evidence about these factors before deciding the penalty issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the defendants did not present any evidence on the unenforceability of the liquidated damages clause. Arguably, given this absence of evidence, and our conclusion that the defendants have the burden of proving that the clause imposes an unenforceable penalty, we should vacate the judgment of the court and order the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs. We reject that conclusion, however. The confusion about the proper allocation of the burden of proof on the enforceability of the liquidated damages clause hampered both parties in properly addressing the issue. Indeed, the court's insistence about the plaintiffs' responsibility to prove that the clause was not a penalty may have lulled the defendants into complacency about their evidentiary burden on this issue. We conclude, therefore, that the fairest outcome to both parties is a remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Fees and costs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that \"[Bowen's] claim for counsel fees is based solely on the last sentence of the damages clause.\" Because it \"declared that clause unenforceable and the counsel fee provision is an integral part thereof, counsel fees are not recoverable in this case.\" We disagree. The sentence making the franchisee \"liable for all costs resulting from its default and all costs of collection including reasonable counsel fees\" is not integral to the liquidated damages clause. Indeed, there was no indication at trial that this term was troubling to the court, even if the liquidated damages clause was.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Accordingly, with the plaintiffs having prevailed on liability, the court should award reasonable costs and fees to the plaintiffs on remand for the litigation to date, with additional costs and fees to be awarded to the plaintiffs for the pending penalty litigation if they prevail on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment vacated.

See Zapatha, 408 N.E.2d at 1374-75 (invoking the provisions of the sales article regarding good faith and unconscionability by analogy, while recognizing that franchise agreements may be distinct from contracts for sale of items).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Under Massachusetts law, \"a judge, in determining the enforceability of a liquidated damages clause, should examine only the circumstances at contract formation. Our position is that 'where actual damages are difficult to ascertain and where the sum agreed upon by the parties at the time of the execution of the contract represents a reasonable estimate of the actual damages, such a contract will be enforced.'\" Kelly v. Marx, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></span>, 1117 (Mass. 1999) (quoting A-Z Servicenter, Inc. v.

Without considering evidence, the court concluded that the liquidated damages clause could not be an estimate of the true cost of the breach and thus was unenforceable.
