Appellants are  present  or  former city\r                            \r\n\npolice officers for the Municipality of San Juan.  They claim\r\n\ntheir employer has violated the Fair Labor Standards Act,  29\r\n\nU.S.C.    201  et  seq. (\"FLSA\"),  in  two respects:    1) by\r\n\nfailing to  pay overtime  as required  by subsection  207(a),\r\n\neven  though they worked more than  40 hours per week; and 2)\r\n\nby giving them compensatory time  in lieu of overtime pay for\r\n\nhours  worked in  excess  of 35  or 40  hours  per week,1  in\r                                                                    1\r\n\nviolation of subsection 207(o).\r\n\n     Both  arguments fail for the same reason.  Appellants do\r\n\nnot become eligible for payment  of overtime wages until they\r\n\nhave worked 43 hours per week; see  29 U.S.C.   207(k) and 29\r                                              \r\n\nC.F.R.     553.230(b)  &amp;  (c).    The  rule  applies  to  law\r\n\nenforcement personnel  who  have  a  seven to  28  day  \"work\r\n\nperiod.\"    Their argument  that  this special  rule  for law\r\n\nenforcement officers does not apply to them, since they never\r\n\nwork seven consecutive  days, is specious.    A \"work period\"\r                                  \r\n\nis not a \"duty cycle.\"  Instead,  it is a recurring period of\r\n\nwork, from seven to 28 days, which the employer sets up ahead\r\n\nof time for  determining whether an employee  is eligible for\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Appellants seem to  claim they were entitled  to overtime\r               1\r\npay for  hours worked  in excess of  35 per  week; apparently\r\nlocal law  is more generous  than federal law with  regard to\r\nmunicipal  employees; see  Ordinance No. 58,  Municipality of\r                                     \r\nSan Juan, June 28, 1985.  Whether appellants allege they were\r\nentitled  to overtime  pay under  the FLSA  after  working 35\r\nhours or 40 hours, they still  fail to allege a violation  of\r\nthe FLSA.  See text infra.\r                                     \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\novertime pay  in any given  period.  29 C.F.R.    553.224(a).\r\n\nAppellants have not  alleged they were required  to work more\r\n\nthan  43   hours  in   a  work   period  without   additional\r\n\ncompensation, so they have failed  to allege or show facts to\r\n\nsupport their claims.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\r                          \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
