Jeremias and Natanael Guzman  appeal from\r                           \r\n\ntheir  sentences on two  related grounds.   First, they argue\r\n\nthat the district  court erred in rejecting  their claim that\r\n\ngovernment   agents  had   engaged   in   sentencing   factor\r\n\nmanipulation by  requesting that  the cocaine they  purchased\r\n\nfrom  appellants be  delivered  in crack  rather than  powder\r\n\nform.  Second,   appellants contend  that the district  court\r\n\nerred in denying their request for an  evidentiary hearing on\r\n\nthe sentencing  manipulation claim.  Natanael  Guzman filed a\r\n\nsupplemental  pro  se  brief   in  which  he  raised  several\r                                 \r\n\nadditional issues. \r\n\n     This   court  has   emphasized   that  \"garden   variety\r\n\nmanipulation  claims are  largely  a waste  of  time. .  .  .\r\n\n[S]entencing  factor manipulation  is  a claim  only for  the\r\n\nextreme and unusual case.\"  United States v. Montoya, 62 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).  We agree with the district court that,\r\n\neven assuming the truth of the facts alleged by appellants at\r\n\nsentencing, appellants have  failed to demonstrate sentencing\r\n\nmanipulation  amounting to  \"extraordinary misconduct.\"  Id. \r                                                                        \r\n\n\"Because manipulation  is largely a fact-bound  inquiry, even\r\n\nthe   district   court's   ultimate  judgment   whether   the\r\n\ngovernment's  conduct  is outrageous  or  intolerable  is not\r\n\nlightly to be disregarded.\" Id. at 4.  We  decline to reverse\r                                           \r\n\nthat judgment here.\r\n\n     The  district  court did  not  abuse  its discretion  in\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndenying appellants' request at sentencing  for an evidentiary\r\n\nhearing  on  the  issue  of  sentencing factor  manipulation.\r\n\nUnder the  Sentencing Guidelines, \"when  any factor important\r\n\nto the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the\r\n\nparties  shall be  given an  adequate opportunity  to present\r\n\ninformation  to the  court regarding  that factor.\"  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n 6A1.3.   In this case,  the facts in  the presentence report\r\n\nwere undisputed.   The district  court repeatedly  questioned\r\n\nappellants at  sentencing about the facts that they sought to\r\n\nprove by introducing evidentiary  evidence.  Rather than hold\r\n\na  formal hearing,  the court  assumed,  for the  purposes of\r\n\nsentencing,  the truth  of those  alleged facts.   The  court\r\n\nproperly  concluded  that,   even  with  those   assumptions,\r\n\nappellants  were  not  entitled  to an  adjustment  in  their\r\n\nsentences.  There was no abuse of discretion.\r\n\n     In his pro se supplemental brief, Natanael Guzman raises\r                              \r\n\nseveral  additional  issues, none  of  which  entitle him  to\r\n\nrelief.   Natanael  objects belatedly to  certain evidentiary\r\n\nmatters  related to the grand jury proceedings.  Even had the\r\n\nissues been  raised below  (which they apparently  were not),\r\n\nNatanael's guilty plea  \"effectuates a waiver of  any and all\r\n\nindependent  non-jurisdictional lapses  that may  have marred\r\n\nthe  case's progress  up  to that  point.\"  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCordero, 42 F.3d  697, 699  (1st Cir. 1994).   Natanael  also\r                   \r\n\nwaived  his constitutional right to  a speedy trial, not only\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nby failing to assert  the right, but also by  contributing to\r\n\nthe delay  when he moved for a continuance of the trial date.\r\n\nSee  Barker v.  Wingo, 407  U.S. 514,  529 (1972).   Finally,\r                                 \r\n\nbecause Natanael did  not present his  ineffective assistance\r\n\nclaim  to the trial court  first, we decline  to consider it.\r\n\nSee  United  States v.  Guzman, 85  F.3d  823, 830  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1996). \r\n\n     The convictions and  sentences of Jeremias and  Natanael\r\n\nGuzman are summarily affirmed.
